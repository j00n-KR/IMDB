0,MartinHafer,More an experience than comprehensible movie.,7,17 August 2021,"""The Lighthouse"" is one of the strangest films I've ever seen. Describing it or even knowing whether or not I liked it is pretty difficult. Suffice to say, it was is a very, very unique movie...one that is quite haunting and difficult.The story is set in the late 19th century and a lighthouse keeper (Willem Dafoe) and his assistant (Rob Pattinson) arrive at the facility for their tour of duty. At first, things seem pretty mundane, though over time they both seem to be losing their minds...Pattinson's character in particular. Where it goes from there is ugly, disturbing and weird.This is definitely NOT a film for everyone. In fact, I'd go so far as to say most people probably would not like the film....and fewer yet would really enjoy it. But it also is a wholly original viewing experience and I can respect the folks who made it. The acting is good....and it feels much like peeking inside the mind of a madman. Overall, not enjoyable but also pretty amazing.",The Lighthouse
1,Leofwine_draca,Misses the mark,3,26 October 2020,"THE LIGHTHOUSE is the latest spooky old lighthouse story which takes the true story of a mysterious disappearance in the late 19th century and uproots it to New England, where Willem Dafoe and Robert Pattinson are well cast as a couple of lighthouse keepers going out of their minds. I've seen numerous screen adaptations of this story in recent years, the best being the low budget monster flick COLD SKIN, but this one's a real bore by comparison. It's made by the guy who did THE WITCH - which I enjoyed, to a degree - and is a typical arthouse movie with zero storyline and close attention to stylistics and histrionic acting over any kind of depth. I found it a slog to sit through, an endless array of intense performances combined with a lack of narrative cohesion, structure, and storyline. The old ""going mad"" plot has been done to death and this adds nothing new, although Dafoe and Pattinson are good and it has a nice look to it at least.",The Lighthouse
2,SnoopyStyle,gets too crazy,7,24 January 2020,"Two lighthouse keepers arrive at an isolated island for a four week stint. Newcomer Thomas Howard (Robert Pattinson) is a former Canadian lumberjack. Thomas Wake (Willem Dafoe) is an one-legged veteran seafarer. Howard has to do all the heavy duties, dreams of a mermaid, and hounded by a seagull. Demanding Wake warns him of various superstitions.The first notable thing is the black and white photography with 1.19:1 aspect ratio. It is reminiscent of old timey movies dating back to the silent era. It fits very well with the mood and the setting. I like this up to the over-drinking. After that, the story gets crazier and crazier. I was expecting it to go supernatural. I can take some interspecies erotica. The Brokeback stuff comes out of nowhere. It becomes too experimental. The madness of the lighthouse booze is too much. The craziness dampens my enthusiasm a little bit.",The Lighthouse
3,Hitchcoc,"Now, That Was Pleasant!",7,17 May 2020,"So many have commented already, I'll keep it short. I remember when I saw ""Taxi Driver."" I was amazed at DeNiro's performance, the incredible visuals, and the wonderful direction. We watched a man fall into a darkness that none of us could possibly survive. But what i remember to this day is being dragged through the world the film presents. There is a line where it is thought that one should take a part of the city and pour concrete over it, destroying the sickness and covering it forever. As I watched the really amazing, frenetic performances in this film, I had some of the same feelings. I reached a point where I wanted cleanliness and daylight. The cruelty from the beginning that never dissipates is all once can hold. It's about human destruction in a claustrophobic world, a living hell.",The Lighthouse
4,Kirpianuscus,a puzzle,10,22 March 2020,"I discovered this film as a large puzzle. Different pieces , from the atmosphere to the acting and flavor of old fashion Gothic stories are pieces of this dark, profound, bitter not comfortable but inspired in each scene film. A film about loneliness. And one of films with the main virtue to be a return to a form of cinema who can be defined as good refuge. So, a puzzle. An admirable one.",The Lighthouse
5,boblipton,A Succes D'Estime,7,8 January 2020,"Wileman Dafoe and Robert Pattinson are two lighthouse keepers on a small, isolated island off the coast of Maine - actually shot in Nova Scotia. As a storm rages about them, they go slowly mad.Robert Eggar's film is based in part on two Welsh lighthouse keepers in 1801, the Smalls Lighthouse tragedy. It is a peculiarly designed movie - Eggars, besides directing two movies, has worked on several other films as a production designer. The set is claustrophobic, the screen frame is just about square at 1.19:1, and the film is black and white. Dafoe uses an accent that is almost cartoonish, based on 19th century fishermen.It's a striking-looking film, that's for certain, but despite the acclaim it has received, I think these details are more likely to appeal to those with a technical understanding and appreciation of antediluvian film making. I was certainly fascinated, but I have my doubts that it will appeal to a general audience; despite its High Art merit, film remains a medium that must appeal to tens of millions to be deemed a success. While the revival of antique techniques and extinct accents may please the cognoscenti, it won't play in Peoria.",The Lighthouse
6,Horst_In_Translation,"Always on the edge of style over substance, but most of the time really haunting",6,8 December 2019,"""The Lighthouse"" is a US-American/Canadian co-production from 2019, so a really new film that was just released here this week, and it is the very first full feature film for writer and director Robert Eggers as the man in charge, even if film in general is nothing new to him. He has directed several short films and also worked in all kinds of departments, most prominently production design and costumes. It seems like he came up with the script here together with his brother Max. The outcome is this 110-minute movie that is set over a century ago. This may also explain why they decided for it to be made in black-and-white because the action is really set way in the past, but also because it is a really bleak movie and it certainly puts more emphasis on the essential plot. ""Essential"" is in general a good word to describe this one because the cast is also minimal. We have the two leads, a mermaid with almost no screen time and at the very beginning a few men who don't have an impact whatsoever.The two protagonists are played by Robert Pattinson and Willem Dafoe and I definitely want to say a few words about them. Dafoe I am a big fan of and I have read he is considered a potential Oscar nominee for his performance here, but in the supporting category. Now that does not make any sense at all. I mean he is not as much lead as Pattinson as we don't see him alone in scenes (which adds to the mystery surrounding his character), but there would be no movie without his character and he is absolutely lead. So is Pattinson. People who still seriously think he can't act because of Twilight need to reconsider. Or just watch more of his projects. He has been in so many quality films in recent years. Only one I want to mention is his Safdie Brothers film from not too long ago. Those two by the way could turn Adam Sandler into an Oscar nominee this year, but now I am drifting a bit away and that is not my intention. So back to ""The Lighthouse"". I generally would say I preferred Dafoe, but he also has the baitier material and it should definitely say nothing negative about Pattinson. He was really good too and probably hardly anybody could have given better portrayals than these two here. Actually, it was kinda shocking how here and there Pattinson was very difficult to recognize although he did not have the heavy beard make-up that Dafoe did. So also a good job from the make-up crew for sure and the way this film turned out I am 100% sure we will see more films from Eggers in the next years, even if I have a bit of a feeling this film could just be too weird and different for nominations at the Academy Awards. We will see.I don't want to say too much about the story because you see all that when you watch the film yourself. Still, this is the kind of film you can watch five times and most likely you still recognize something new and will be far from understanding it all. We have a duo of men, one old and one young starting their duty at a lighthouse. So far all normal. I mean the older one bullies the younger one a bit and makes it clear who's the boss and who has to do the hard work, but I guess Pattinson's character's fitness also makes this decision not too surprising. So the old guy basically only operates the light at the top, while the younger has to do all the cleaning, really physically hard work and also disgusting work. They are there for 4 weeks and at the end of this month, they actually grow a bit closer, share their real names and drink and have a bit of fun. But when for some reason the end of their term at this rock in the middle of nowhere is delayed because they do not get off the island and nobody replaces them, they stay there for longer and really turn insane eventually.There is a lot of talk about Pattinson's character's background and real identity, references to seagulls carrying the spirits of deceased sailors, which makes it a bad omen to kill a sea gull. And related to that, there is a really violent scene that includes the brutal killing of a seagull. I must say that was painful to watch for me, actually more painful almost than the scene near the ending when we witness what happens to Dafoe's character and I guess that says it all how much I like animals. But yeah, the gulls get their revenge at the end as the young protagonist's plan to be in charge of the light up there also results in his death eventually. I think this scene up there with the light was really hauntingly horrifying and very well done with light, darkness, camera angles and everything, also Pattinson's looks there with madness all over him. And Eggers does not give us this one slightly positive moment at all to close the film with when Pattinson's character is up there having achieved his goal. Not a chance. He gives us the looks of his intestines being mauled by wild animals after probably breaking pretty much every single bone in his body when he crashes down the stairs. So it is a horror film, there is no denying. And while there was a lot I liked about this film and not too much I didn't like, I am still hesitant in saying there was anything I really loved (except the two performances perhaps). So this explains my rating of 3 stars out of 5, which is not too bad and not too great. But this is definitely one of the darkest and at the same time most different films from 2019, maybe too different for me, so my rating is definitely subjective. There is not too much to argue against here from an objective point of view.In general, I could say a lot more about this one, but it feels that sadly I forgot quite a bit already since seeing it last night. It is an extremely atmospheric film of course. The isolated setting is perfect for the film's tone and everything related to it. Oh yeah, one thing you can never be really sure about in this film is what is real and what just exists basically in Patterson's character's mind. They are even toying with the audience when Dafoe's character says something that he himself is just an imagination in the young man's mind and he is somewhere in the Canadian woods having critical illusions. Then the mermaid scenes of course, the idea that he found the man who helped Dafoe's character in the past, how they absolutely have no idea how long they have been on the island. You never know what's real and what not. Aside from that, i.e. the scary moments, it is not a film that you want to watch with your young children because it is downright scary at times. The alive burial near the end is horrifying also the actual killing moments later. I mentioned the gull scene already. Then there is also some sexual explicitness in here. We see breasts and also very vaguely indicated intercourse and masturbation. Apart from that, there is a great deal of swearing although that I always find harmless.Another thing I found interesting was to find out what was written in the logbook. Did he have mercy on the young man and gave him a good report? Not at all. And that makes things escalate even further because it was all about being paid and clearly that was the only reason why Pattinson's character was on the island, the longer the film went even more so because it was just more and more a haven of horrors. And pay attention to how we find out they have the same first name, maybe a metaphor to indicate that at their very core they are not too different from each other. And despite the early scenes, you really should not mistake the young Tom for a good character here. They are basically both evil eventually. Remember what happened with the real Winslow. The young Tom is just forced to follow orders, but you can clearly see his violent tendencies several times, like when he approaches the old Tom ready to cut his throat while asleep. And it is also never 100% safe how much of all this is really insanity. Actually you could make a statement for Dafoe's character just being cruel and not really having lost his sanity. Okay, I guess I could write another three paragraphs about this film because it is packed with symbolisms, metaphors and interesting elements that make a relatively simple story fairly interesting. But I will not. Instead I want to encourage you to head to your nearest theater and watch this film. Or watch it at home, preferably when it is dark outside (and inside) because everything else just wouldn't fit the film's tone. I still think it is a much better watch on the big screen, so go for it. It's a thumbs-up for me as expected.",The Lighthouse
7,claudio_carvalho,"Original, Stylish, Ambiguous and Open to Interpretation",7,29 January 2020,"""The Lighthouse"" is one of the most original, stylish, ambiguous and open to interpretation films recently released in the theaters. The originality and stylish begin with the black and white and screen size, with a theatrical story of madness that keeps the attention of the viewer until the last scene. The ambiguity is reflected in the different favorable opinions that we can find in Internet showing that the movie is open to interpretation. In addition, the performances of Robert Pattinson and Willem Dafoe are impressive. Last but not the least, ""The Lighthouse"" is the typical film that deserves to be watched more than once. My vote is seven.Title (Brazil): ""O Farol"" (""The Lighthouse"")",The Lighthouse
8,nogodnomasters,Boredom makes men to villains.,4,12 January 2020,"Thomas Wake (Robert Pattinson ) attempts to maintain his sanity being alone in a lighthouse with William Defoe, who smells, talks, and drinks like a pirate.

What I am trying to say is, that this movie will leave a lot of things unanswered. Saying you have to be watchful and follow what is going on would be a massive understatememnt.The movie gives you hints and clues as to what it is trying to do and tell you. But it also is leaving it up to you to see what you want to see. Who is who, and where are they/him/it? This is a great example in minimalism. It also will be a stretch for those watching - do you mind the ratio (4:3), do you mind it is black and white, do you mind the small cast? Or do you relish in the story, in the craziness, in the depths of human isolation and what can occur in ones mind? What triggers what and what helps or doesn't? What is reality?",The Lighthouse
10,classicsoncall,"""You ain't even human no more.""",8,7 August 2020,"Bleak and brooding, ""The Lighthouse"" is a study of the descent into madness of two lighthouse keepers, stranded beyond their original four week assignment, and despairing in the fate of their existence together. Thomas Wake (Willem Dafoe) and Tom Howard (Robert Pattinson) are alternately at each others' throats or gleefully imbibing their way into a state of stupor, at one point suggesting a homoerotic encounter, but quickly devolving into yet another fit of pique. Of the two, it's Pattinson's character who eventually experiences visions and nightmares as he goes about his daily chores, subservient to the demands of his nominal supervisor Wake. Cinematically, the picture reminded me of all those great black and white films of the Thirties and Forties emanating from the silent era. It even has a 'B' quality look, though the subject matter goes beyond the simplistic efforts of early film, and challenges the viewer with a myriad of interpretations one could assign to the story. That the fate of the two men ends so tragically is no wonder given the exposition, and you'll come away convinced that it's bad luck to kill a seabird.",The Lighthouse
11,jboothmillard,The Lighthouse,6,10 February 2020,"If it wasn't for the nominations received Awards Season, and the two well-known leading actors, I'm not sure if this was a film I would have rushed out to see, but I did read about it also, and it sounded intriguing, directed by Robert Eggers (The Witch). Basically, set in the late 19th century, Ephraim Winslow (Robert Pattinson) is sent on a boat to an isolated island off the coast of New England, to serve a four-week contract job as a wickie. He is under the supervision of irritable elderly fellow lighthouse keeper Thomas Wake (Willem Dafoe). The following few days is filled with back-breaking work and unfavourable conditions, and the tight-lipped men will have no one else for company except for each other, forced to endure irritating idiosyncrasies, bottled-up resentment, and burgeoning hatred. Winslow observes Wake going up to the lighthouse's lantern room at night and stripping naked. Winslow begins experiencing visions and dreams of tentacles in the lighthouse, tree stumps floating in the water, and distant images of a mermaid (Valeriia Karamän). Over time, Wake demands Winslow take the more taxing jobs, including refuelling the light, carrying heavy kerosene containers, and disposing of the two men's chamber pots. Whilst outside, Winslow repeatedly encounters a one-eyed gull, but Wake warns him it is bad luck to kill a gull, as he is superstitious that the animals are reincarnated sailors. The weeks continue, and Winslow masturbates to a figurine of a mermaid and continues to see Wake naked. One night at dinner, the two get to know each other and discuss Wake's previous second wickie, who Wake says died shortly after going insane. The day before Winslow is scheduled to leave, he notices the water pump is releasing bloody water and investigates. He checks the cistern to see a dying gull floating inside. The one-eyed seagull returns and attacks Winslow, hr grabs the bird and beats it to death against the cistern. The winds dramatically change direction during the afternoon, and when a storm hits the island the two men get drunk. The next morning, the ferry does not arrive, and Winslow sees a body washed up on the shore. He approaches the naked body and flees in shock seeing that it is a mermaid. Back at the cottage, rations were impacted by the storm, and the crate supposedly containing extra rations only contain more alcohol. More nights progress, and the storm continues, and the two men grow closer while remaining adversaries toward each other. Winslow is curious about what is in the lantern room at the top of the lighthouse and unsuccessfully tries to steal the key to it from a sleeping Wake. He has visions of a lobster trap containing the severed, half-blinded head of Wake's previous wickie. One night, Winslow tells Wake that his real name is Thomas Howard and that he assumed the identity of Ephraim Winslow (Logan Hawkes) who died in an accident. Wake accuses Howard of ""spilling his beans,"" and Howard tries to leave. He attempts to escape in a lifeboat, but in madness Wake destroys it with an axe, which he chases him with, until he is calmed down. With no alcohol left, the two begin mixing spirits out of turpentine and honey, and the powerful storm waves crash through the windows of the cottage. After Howard looks through Wake's log, he confronts Wake about his work performance and accuses him of mental abuse and begs to see the light that he is seemingly keeping him from. Wake berates Howard, and Howard attacks him. While seeing visions of the mermaid, Wake as a sea monster, and the real Winslow, Howard beats Wake until he unconscious. Using a rope, Howard drags Wake's body and buries him alive in the ration pit. Howard takes the keys and prepares to go up to the lantern room, but Wake appears and hits him in the shoulder with the axe. Howard disarms Wake with a kettle pot, grabs the axe and kills him. He then ascends the lighthouse staircase to the lantern house. He approaches the Fresnel lens, and it stops and opens. Howard gazes into the mirrored interior in ecstasy and reaches his arm inside. Then the light suddenly brightens, he lets out a distorted scream, the light gets brighter and his scream (unheard) louder, until he slips, falling down the steps and breaks his leg. It ends with Howard lying naked on the rocks, missing an eye and with several gulls pecking his innards, eating him alive. Also starring Kyla Nicolle as Woman on the Rocks, Shaun Clarke as Departing Wickie and Pierre Richard as Departing Assistant Wickie. Apart from characters seen in part, including the monstrous mermaid, this is mainly a two-hander movie, with Dafoe as the superstitious veteran and Pattison as the younger man assisting manning the beacon. Throughout the film, the atmosphere is dark, strange and unpredictable, you are anxious that either character could crack as their sanity fades and hatred increases, and the eerie things seen in terrifying visions captivate you, and the camerawork is very good, a disturbing but most interesting psychological horror. It was nominated the Oscar for Best Cinematography, and it was nominated the BAFTA for Best Cinematography. Good!",The Lighthouse
12,paul_haakonsen,"Well, it was unique...",6,31 January 2020,"I finally got the chance to sit down and watch the 2019 movie ""The Lighthouse"" from director and writer Robert Eggers. And I must admit that it was with a great level of expectation that I did so, because I had heard nothing but praise and good things about the movie.First of all, personally I think having shot the movie in black and white wasn't a great move, because a lot of details were lost in the lack of color, and I just don't overly enjoy watching black and white movies in general. But this was a minor nuisance.I will say that the movie was really nicely carried by both leads, that being Willem Dafoe and Robert Pattinson. Initially I had some doubt about Robert Pattinson being able to pull a movie like this off with grace, but wow, he sure did. He definitely has cast aside that horrible mantle that was the sparkling vampire of ""Twilight"".The characters in the movie were nicely detailed and given lots of personalities and quirks. And both Dafoe and Pattinson really gave their heart and soul in the performances, and it bore fruit well in favor of the movie.The dialogue in the movie is just splendid. Especially the dialogue given to Thomas Wake - the character portrayed by Willem Dafoe.It should be said that ""The Lighthouse"" is not your average movie, not even remotely. This is a bizarre movie and a very unique movie for sure. And I don't think that it will fall well in favor with everyone in the audience. This is a very detailed and vivid descent into madness. And the movie even have a hint of Lovecraftian atmosphere, which I enjoyed.I had expected more from the movie, given all the praise it had been receiving. Sure, this was an enjoyable and entertaining movie, but it just fell short of my expectations somehow.My rating for ""The Lighthouse"" is a six out of ten stars.",The Lighthouse

14,Hey_Sweden,"Yes, I am fond of ye lobster.",8,5 July 2021,"After making a big splash with his creepy horror film ""The Witch: A New-England Folktale"", co-writer / director Robert Eggers takes us on a similarly gloomy journey. It's largely a study of two very distinct characters, with the added aspect of full-blown psychological horror and an incredible onslaught of nightmarish imagery. It won't be to all tastes, but people eager to check out a dark descent into madness will find it endlessly interesting and entertaining.Willem Dafoe and Robert Pattinson play Thomas and ""Ephraim"", two lighthouse keepers assigned to a remote, rocky location in New England of the 1890s. The two don't get along very well from the get-go, so you can imagine how thick the tension is going to get as their relationship gets more and more antagonistic. Each man will come to believe that the other is capable of just about anything, including murder.Ever-reliable veteran Dafoe completely disappears inside his character, an ultra-crusty and ultra-salty old dog who's fond of tale-spinning. Pattinson is just as creditable in another performance that helps to further distance himself from his breakthrough role as Edward in the ""Twilight"" series. And, for a while, these are the only two characters in the story, with occasional appearances by a mermaid played by the striking Valeriia Karaman.It's great fun to watch Dafoe and Pattinson butt heads, and the antiquated dialogue flows from Dafoe's mouth with the greatest of ease. (Eggers and co-writer Max Eggers draw their inspiration from the writings of Herman Melville, Sarah Orne Jewett, and the journals of actual lighthouse keepers.) This dialogue is so colourful that it can be downright priceless.All in all, this viewer can see how some viewers might find this film pretentious, but he found it an agreeable melding of conventional horror tropes with more arthouse-type aspirations. It's grim, it's ominous, and despite the laughs to be had, it rarely offers the audience a respite from the darkness on display.Filmed on location in Nova Scotia, Canada.Eight out of 10.",The Lighthouse
15,CinemaSerf,"Don't be fooled by any ""art-house"" label - this is a great psychological thriller...",7,18 February 2020,"Willem Dafoe & Robert Pattison deliver strong performances in this gripping tale of life stranded on a remote island where they keep a lighthouse. The latter starts off as a more responsible, sensible character in the face of his uncouth, bullying, alcoholic companion but as we develop, we see the influence on Pattinson soon becomes more toxic and we descend into a psychological drama where nothing/no-one makes a lot of sense. The monochrome photography adds greatly to the eeriness of the production; the dark skies; sweeping seascapes; torrid weather conditions - and the story combines nautical myths and superstitions with human frailties in a compelling fashion. It's a film about two people - there isn't any definable storyline, or structure - it evolves in an entirely fluid manner that adds much to the tension and makes it well worth a watch (ideally on a big screen).",The Lighthouse

It is his first time working in a lighthouse and his partner and leader is a veteran of many years at the lighthouse. From the outset his boss treats him very badly, leading to much animosity between the two. Will they get through the four weeks without a violent confrontation?Great psychological drama. From the start there is a brooding, simmering atmosphere which intensifies throughout the movie as the tension between the two men escalates. Writer-director Robert Eggers builds the tension well and pulls the strings very deftly in terms of manipulating viewers.The psychological aspect is fairly well done, with themes of insanity and paranoia that are reminiscent of Joseph Conrad's 'Heart of Darkness'.All this is helped by brilliant cinematography that creates the perfect atmosphere for the plot. Filmed in black and white some of the scenes and shots are stunning in their execution. Jarin Blaschke received a Best Cinematography Oscar nomination for his work (the film's only Oscar nomination). The bleakness of the setting helps too.One misgiving I had about this film before watching it was that it starred Robert Pattinson, he of Twilight fame. Pattinson actually does a really good job here and doesn't detract from the film at all. Willem Dafoe is great as the other protagonist.Great film.",The Lighthouse

18,evanston_dad,2019 Is Officially the Year of the Freak Out Movie,8,8 November 2019,"2019 is officially the year of the freak out movie. ""Joker,"" ""Parasite,"" ""Midsommar,"" ""Her Smell,"" just to name a few. And now ""The Lighthouse.""Robert Pattinson freaks out like nobody's business in this technically amazing and incredibly atmospheric fable set on a bleak seashore. He's a young man running from some unsavory doings in his past, while Willem Dafoe is a kind of Captain Ahab of lighthouses, a salty caricature of a seafaring fellow who asserts his authority early and often. This set up gradually devolves into a bizarro thriller with mythical overtones as Pattinson's character begins to lose his mind and hurtles toward a violent showdown of macho wills with his older partner.I don't know that I'll see a more visually impressive film this year. Filmed in glorious black and white with a square aspect ratio, the film looks like it comes from an older era, but it's a technical marvel. The production and sound design combined with the moody cinematography make the environment of the film palpable to the audience. You can almost smell the sea air, feel the biting drafts, taste the rotgut both characters are constantly swilling. I was a little disappointed as the film wore on that it becomes progressively more like a fable than an actual story grounded in reality. Fables just seem dramatically unsatisfying to me, since everything is meant to represent something else, and characters are used at the service of a moral rather than given full dimensional life. After this movie ended, I found myself wanting a bit more from it.But the performances are extremely good, and they, combined with the visual and auditory merits, make the movie more than worth sitting through. While watching the film, it's easy to think that Pattinson is the one who's acting the hell out of it, as he gets the showier role. But in retrospect, it's Defoe who's the most memorable.Grade: A",The Lighthouse
19,ferguson-6,Wickies on the rock,8,17 October 2019,"Greetings again from the darkness. The opening sequence plays like something from 1920's era cinema. The chug-chug-chug of a boat slamming against the waves of an angry sea while birds flap and chirp alongside. We hear the wind and ""feel"" the severe ocean spray. Several minutes elapse before any word is spoken. Immediately noticeable is the nearly square aspect ratio ... the rarely (these days) seen 1.19:1 frame, making the black and white images appear both surreal and ominous.All of the above makes perfect sense when we realize this is writer-director Robert Eggers' first feature film since his 2015 indie horror gem THE WITCH won dozens of festival awards. Mr. Eggers obviously has his own vision for projects, and his approach borders on experimental, eschewing conventional. He co-wrote this script with his brother Max, and evidently much was drawn from the actual journals of lighthouse keepers ... something that is evident in the vocabulary and the effects of solitude.4-time Oscar nominee Willem Dafoe stars alongside Robert Pattison as the two men charged with a 4 week assignment of tending to a lighthouse. The film is set in 1890, and Dafoe plays Thomas Wake, the epitome of a salty old sea dog, replete with bad leg, hardcore Atlantic accent, and upside down pipe. Pattinson is Ephraim Winslow, the assistant Wickie, who faces non-stop demands from Wake, and initially maintains a quietness as he goes about his duties ... what Wake calls the 'doldrums.' We learn little about either man's past. For Wake, other than knowing his previous assistant went mad, the clue is when he mentions ""13 Christmases spent at sea"" costing him a family. For Ephraim, when Wake asks, ""Tell me what's a timberman want with being a Wickie?"" we get some insight into Ephraim's desired future.Eggers has delivered the anti-buddy movie. It's a bleak, slow-motion race to insanity caused by being isolated with only one other person ... a person you aren't fond of. Only this is not a director or a film content with showing two men stuck on a storm-battered rock, as they slip towards insanity. No, we viewers are forced to experience some of these same feelings - how much of what we see is actually happening? It's mesmerizing and hypnotic, and the above-mentioned narrow screen aspect purposefully emphasizes the sense of confinement and claustrophobia.With no color and only a couple of characters ... OK, 3 if you count the mermaid ...OK, 4 if you count the seagull ... the film still manages to pound us with sensory overload. We can barely process all we are seeing, despite relatively minimal 'typical' action. The black and white images are mostly just various shades of gray, and sunshine is non-existent. Cinematographer Jarin Blaschke (THE WITCH) embraces the dreariness by allowing the fog, lanterns, candles, wind, rain, and harsh elements to become characters unto themselves. However, nothing is in sync with our two leads. Composer Mark Korven fills the many lapses in dialogue with sounds and tones we haven't heard before, yet they fit perfectly here. This is also quite likely the first film to utilize farts and foghorns in harmony.Director Eggers filmed this on Cape Forchu in Nova Scotia, and the extreme weather and less-than-welcoming terrain create quite the visuals - as do the faces of our two lead actors. Dafoe may never have chewed scenery so delightfully as he does here, and Pattinson starts slowly before delivering his best work - including a ferocious rant that is fascinating to watch and contrast to his character's first meal with Dafoe. Is this a horror film? A fantasy? Macabre comedy? There is simply no way to describe this other than bizarre. It's truly miserable cinema, and I loved every minute of it.",The Lighthouse

While Thomas is a wise poet and religious quoting fanatic all makes for an atmosphere of wonder and thought as you ask what does the lighthouse contain and what is it a symbol of?

24,wellthatswhatithinkanyway,"An inspired idea, but a muddled execution",4,13 July 2020,"STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday MorningIn the late 1890s, taciturn former lumberjack Ephraim Winslow (Logan Hawkes) is sent to a remote lighthouse to work with veteran lighthouse keeper Thomas Wake (Willem Dafoe) a curmudgeonly, flatulent old gruff figure who initially tries to ride his younger charge to breaking point. Gradually, the two men develop an uneasy bond, but as the reality of their seclusion and confinement dawns on them, it becomes a desperate battle for sanity, pushing both men to breaking point.Given the critical acclaim and cult following of 2015's The Witch, director Robert Eggers next film was always going to be hotly anticipated. And so this latest effort, co written with his brother arrives, for some reason filmed in black and white and with a boxed in screen. He has a distinctive schtick, standing out from the conventional modern horror style of cheap jump scares and fast cutting, and centering his stories in a period setting. Here, we have the clearer, more relatable dialect of the late 1800s, in contrast to the eluding ye olde New England tongues of the 18th century from The Witch. But the results are sadly still not as effective.The stand out performance undoubtedly comes from Dafoe, an inspired piece of casting in the lead role. Despite being American, something about his voice naturally translates into that 'arrrgh me 'arty's' old seaman voice, whilst managing to look authentic in the role naturally, playing as Captain Birdseye's mean brother he never talks about. Eggers pits him off against Hawkes's younger charge, and tries to create a sense of atmosphere and mounting claustrophobia in this dark, isolated setting, but the plot is too sketchily written, the set up too unelaborated and the two characters too unengaging for it to work.For those looking for a break from mainstream horror, it might still have something going for it, but it's a sadly disappointing follow up piece from the guy who gave us one of cinema's most surprising recent cult hits, despite the notably similar ending. **",The Lighthouse
25,MOscarbradley,"Yes, it's a horror film but not as you know it....",8,29 January 2020,"Shot in black and white and in an aspect ratio of 1.19:1, giving us an almost square screen like the early silent movies and with really only a cast of two, Robert Eggers' ""The Lighthouse"" might appear to be either highly innovative or hugely pretentious or maybe even both. The setting is a lighthouse on a small, craggy island off New England, circa the 1890's. The only characters are the two lighthouse keepers, one young, (Robert Pattinson), and the other something of an old sea-dog, (Willem Dafoe), who seem to take an instant dislike to each other. The only way they have to pass the time is to work and to let their imaginations run away with them.Eggers' movie has been described as a horror film but like his earlier ""The Witch"", it's far from a conventional horror film. Its demons are those of the mind rather than the spectres of the supernatural and its physical horrors are much more disturbing than its metaphysical imaginings and in the end it's up to its two players to sustain it. Pattinson has probably never been better and Defoe is simply magnificent. His is the most difficult role; his crusty old dictator could so easily have been nothing more than a cliche but Defoe gives his character shadings not immeadiately apparent in the script, as indeed does Pattinson.Unfortunately, despite a highly unsettling score by Mark Korven and Jarin Blaschke's stunning cinematography boredom does set in before the climax, which I suppose was only to be expected. Eggers simply can't provide enough incidents of terror or indeed anything else to make us fully care about its protagonists. That said, there is enough here to ensure at least cult status and a considerable future for its director.",The Lighthouse
26,Pjtaylor-96-138044,"Seagulls, stop it now.",8,31 January 2020,"'The Lighthouse (2019)' is an experimental experience; an experiential experiment. It doesn't matter why things happen (or even what things happen), it matters how things happen. The piece is as strange as its reputation would have you believe, an at once ambiguous and overt head-trip. It constantly makes you question its reality, its seemingly obvious dream sequences soon blurring into each isolating and increasingly strange day. It dances across a myriad of genres, as absurd as it is disturbing. The tone is pitch-perfect, though, as it amounts to a constantly unsettling story. As is the pacing, which alternates from slow-paced digressions to whip-quick montages. Even when it's mundane, it's never dull. At the heart of it all are its two stars, whose give-it-all performances are only hampered by their occasionally difficult-to-hear muttering and heavy-handed sailor's lilt. The filmmaking is all on fine form, too. The claustrophobic aspect ratio and stark black-and-white cinematography amplify the increasingly grisly narrative yet remain beautiful throughout. It's a masterwork of cinema, for sure. In the end, though, the movie isn't quite as engaging as you'd expect. It falls short of 'gripping' just a little too often. Having said that, it's mostly enjoyable and it's certainly unique. It's confident, well-crafted and, frankly, crazy. It needs to be seen to be believed. 8/10",The Lighthouse
27,dromasca,horror comes from deep inside,8,15 February 2020,"I believe that 'The Lighthouse', the film directed by Robert Eggers, needs two sets of warnings. First of all, it's a horror movie, so those who don't like the genre would be better off avoiding it. For the enthusiasts, I think it is good that they be told that on one hand they may be disappointed with the rhythm, on the other hand certain elements of horror go beyond the limits of the genre. It is a psychological film, the tension builds up slowly and comes from the nature of the two characters that occupy the screen throughout the film, and it takes about half of the screening time until the truly frightening events start and unfold. By then, viewers risk being completely absorbed into the atmosphere, which might seem paradoxical for a film whose action takes place in the 19th century. The reason is, I think, that the horror of 'The Lighthouse' comes from within, from the darkness of souls of the two heroes. These kinds of feelings have no historical specificity.The film is inspired by a real historical case that happened on an island near the southwest coast of England in the late 18th century, a story that has already inspired another film with the same name in 2016, a BBC radio play, as well as documentary films. Robert Eggers moved the action a century later, and near the coast of New England. Two lighthouse keepers are sent to the island for a one-month tour of duty. Relations between the veteran played by Willem Dafoe and the disciple played by Robert Pattinson unfold slowly in the first part of the film. The tensions inherent in life in seclusion, the routine, the boredom, are the trivial bricks from which is built up the edifice of the conflict that bursts with the storm that will prevent the arrival of the exchange shift. There is also an ecological message in the film, about the conflict between humans and the nature symbolized by the seagulls that become as threatening as in Hitchcock's 'The Birds'. But are these real birds, or are they actually prisons of the souls of sailors lost in the storms, as the legends tell? And are the two men what they seem to be? Even from seemingly realistic scenes, before the movie slips into fantasy and nightmare, we understand that we are dealing with a game of identities. We also have here a Symbolist approach to the legend of Light whose brightness and warmth can kill the uninitiated who dare to get too close to its source.It is fascinating to watch the dialogues between the two characters. There is a difference of rank and of social classes between them, which is reflected in the language. The veteran lighthouse keeper played by Dafoe speaks in parables and quotes, his language being that of Captain Ahab in 'Moby Dick'. Pattinson's apprentice is mostly silent at first, then, when he seems to start to open his soul, does so in the slang of the lower classes, but it becomes clear that he builds an identity screen hiding terrible facts from past. In the end, words give way to images, and each of the characters gets to be seen through the eyes of the other or maybe even in the other's nightmares. As the fog leaves place to the storm, the horror unleashes and overwhelms everything. The performances are terrifying, so is the soundtrack. Eggers's cinematography uses black and white, and the screen format of classic films of the genre. It is a reverence for the horror masters of the past, of course, but the imaginary fantasy nightmare that dominates the final scenes far exceeds what the predecessors dared, and will accompany the spectators after the end of the film.",The Lighthouse

It's equally weird and disturbing, and ultimately probably not worth the casual viewers 110 minutes of their time. But I'm also happy I saw it and got to witness the insanity that is Willem DaFoe's Thomas Wake up against Robert Pattinson's Ephraim Winslow.

29,Cineanalyst,Phallusy,8,2 February 2020,"The descent into madness plot is nothing new, but ""The Lighthouse"" is a fantastically designed variation. It's not surprising that this began as a reworking of an Allen Edgar Poe story; one of the earliest films to feature a character having a psychotic break from reality that comes to my mind is D.W. Griffith's ""The Avenging Conscience; or Thou Shalt Not Kill"" (1914), which is based on Poe writings. Nor are comparisons made here surprising to the works of Robert Louis Stevenson, who besides penning nautical adventures, authored ""The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde,"" a famous instance of the sort of doubling theme hinted at in ""The Lighthouse"" with the two Thomases, the one wanting the other's job and that other paranoid of him stealing it, as well as of a drug-induced lunacy from the novella that aligns with the inebriated states of the lighthouse keepers. Madness became a predominant theme in the Expressionist and art films of Weimar Germany, too, but ""The Lighthouse"" reminds me more of the Scandinavian cinema that began to emerge in the 1910s--namely, in the oeuvres of Victor Sjöström and Mauritz Stiller--that intrinsically connected characters' fates and mentality to the harshness of nature. Likewise, the characters of ""The Lighthouse"" become victims of their environment, which is felicitously reflected in the contours, shades and art of the picture.The square, 1.19:1 aspect ratio and the black-and-white photography are apt for both the lighthouse setting and its confinement surrounded by the stormy seas and even prayed upon from above by the seabirds. Today's usual widescreen presentation wouldn't have the same claustrophobic effect. Shooting on orthochromatic, black-and-white 35mm film, with its low sensitivity, too, surely helps control the light given off by the lighthouse, kerosene lamps and stars, while maintaining the dark voids that escape their illumination. Indeed, ""The Lighthouse"" has received much praise for its cinematography (including its only Oscar nomination), as well as some for its production design. Perhaps, not receiving due credit, however, is the soundscape. Mostly relying upon the diegetic sounds of the location contributes to the sense that the fog horns, crashing waves, birds squawking and engine noise are driving the protagonist mad, as much so as his supervisor's belligerence, chatter and farting. Although this two-hander calls for showy acting and the characters are considerably clichés--both characters even say as much about the other at one point or another--Robert Pattinson and Willem Dafoe do well, aided by a camera, as well as the scenario, practically exclusively focused on them, to keep the spectator's engagement.I'd be remiss if I didn't comment on the psycho-sexual dynamic in the horror of ""The Lighthouse,"" as well. As its maker Robert Eagers puts it, ""Nothing good happens when two men are trapped in a giant phallus."" The phallic nature of the lighthouse is reinforced by Dafoe's character's guarded control of it, including for seemingly sexual gratification. Pattinson's protagonist, then, desires entry to this domain not only for reasons of professional advancement, but also for sexual engagement. Instead, his madness is partly driven by sexual dissatisfaction and displacement, from the mermaid engraving to the delusions of an actual fish-woman and his conflation of her with his supervisor played by Dafoe and with birds, to the lighthouse-inspired phallocentric struggle over submission and dominance between the two men. ""The Lighthouse"" is quite a perverse twist on the familiar fallacy of madness, although it's not the first time in film history a lighthouse has symbolized sex and, specifically, a penis--for one, an insert shot of a lighthouse proved an amusing workaround the Hays Code in ""Casablanca"" (1942/43).",The Lighthouse
30,gbill-74877,Fantastic cinematography and performance,7,26 January 2020,"Willem Dafoe is one part Melville's Captain Ahab, one part Van Gogh's Joseph Roulin, and one part John Steuart Curry's John Brown. He delivers an absolutely brilliant performance. Director Robert Eggers creates a claustrophobic, harsh environment from the start, and gives us a steady stream of wonderfully stark, beautiful images. The film feels incredibly authentic to the 19th century as well. As for the story and where it leads, it falls a little short of its early promise, mainly because it goes for too much -a blend of madness and sanity, elements of Bergman's Persona and Kubrick's The Shining, Jungian symbolism, Greek mythology, aggressive sea birds, and mermaid sex on top of it all, reveling I think a little too much in its own ambiguity and hoping it all adds up to something. It's a case of a 5 star performance, 5 star cinematography, and 3.5 star plot.

True understanding of the effects of isolation can only be found in experience & ""The Lighthouse"".

34,ironhorse_iv,The Lighthouse is a shining example of a semi good psychological Lovecraftian horror movie.,8,17 July 2020,"It's time to shed some light into this A24 motion picture directed by Roger Eggers. Let's first start with the movie's premise. The plot is not much of a guiding light as we have seen the story about lightkeepers slowly losing their minds done a few times before like 2018's 'The Vanishing'. Nevertheless it's 2016 British psychological thriller drama film of the same name that has the biggest similarities. The flick directed by Chris Crow was also somewhat based on the Smalls Lighthouse incident which occurred in 1801 that inspire author Edgar Allan Poe's fragment work of the same name. To add onto that the movie also have two wickies characters named Thomas; one semi religious, the other a bit nihilism going crazy after being strand by a storm. The use of repetitive sounds is also noticeable in both films. I love the random tapping of the lifeless hand upon the window. While in Eggers version, the creepy foghorn works so well. I do dig that both
films include scenes with a large amount of drunken singing of sea shanties/fighting between them, nightmarish dreams of getting lost in foggy rocky shores and talks about curses. Yet the visuals scares in the 2016 movie were not quite as over the top as we got here with surrealism visions of artist Sascha Schneider's 1904 hypnosis painting, one eyed seagulls, mermaids, giant octopuses and Greek mythology like Prometheus/Proteus metaphors. Certain scenes here felt a bit cartoony. It made me unintentionally chuckled. Nonetheless, the most deeply unsettling visual this grim old timey black and white period piece features is the orthochromatic like photographic cinematography of the island. All of it is filmed elegantly in narrow squarish smaller 1.19:1 aspect ratio. It really does spells isolation & constricting for Ephraim Winslow (Robert Pattinson) and Thomas Wake (Willem Dafoe). I'm just surprised that the film got amazing shots with what conditions were like there in Nova Scotia with all the rain and fog. I'd heard that one scene had to filmed 25 times due the absolutely bad weather. Even when weather was good. The performers were often sprayed with a fire hose to give off the image that the island was in the middle of a storm. At nights since the film was shot on Double-X stock black and white, which requires much more natural light to get exposure, crews put flickering period correct kerosene lamps that were only a few feet away from the thespian's faces to get results; making it blindingly bright with the actors barely seeing each other. They did this so much that Pattinson nearly came close to punching out the director. Despite that, the actors did give a hell of a performance even if the amount of sea lingo jargon dialogue was somewhat overwhelming with how confusing they were, along with the deceitfully like flip flop ambiguous gaslighting. Mad props go to Dafoe for making cheesy lines sound somehow menacing with his repeatedly and ominously growling. He probably deserves a best supporting actor nomination at the Oscars that year. As for Pattinson. He really went to some crazy lengths to show that he can portrayed the mentally deteriorating Winslow such as staying in character at the hotel getting so drunk that he's piss himself and actually vomit. Talk about dying for your craft. Hopefully he doesn't gain alcoholic habit in real life because of his method approach. He doesn't need to go that far to prove that he can act. Anyways, while Pattinson stayed at a normal place with the rest of the film crew during the shoot, Dafoe lived in a little fisherman's cottage in solitude researching marine works. While both of them had radically different approaches to acting. The chemistry between their characters works so well. It is believable that both would be trying to lust for power & knowledge; while trying to control and underhand the other, violently mentally, physically and even sexually due to that obsession. In other words, be the biggest dick. According to the actors, the phallic imagery of the lighthouse is explicit toxic masculinity as its worst. After all, the film was originally meant to include a very juvenile transition shot of a lighthouse morphing into a giant penis. Although this cut was removed upon request by sponsors. I kinda do get what the filmmakers was going with the shots of characters pulling up their suspenders and such without being too pretentious or not articulating enough. Another thing that I notice is the conflict between man vs self, especially when it comes to dualism. Both men could be the same person slowly eating away due to past mistakes with young Thomas being the body and old Thomas as the soul. Hints no coexisting and harmony. Regardless of the meaning. The director cleverly crafted pieces of cinema that really plays with its audience minds to simulate a feeling of insanity and immense atmosphere. Overall: While you don't need to be fond of me lobster. You do have to check this movie out. It's one worth spotlighting.",The Lighthouse

38,eddie_baggins,Brilliant craft and performances mix with a slow and dull story,6,4 February 2020,"With 2015's The Witch, director Robert Eggers announced himself as one of the most exciting new talents of the decade.A brilliantly realized slice of New English folk horror, The Witch was the work of a filmmaker who knows and is at home in his art form.As we watched in terror as an unfortunate family found themselves living with a particularly dastardly goat on the border of a set of woods you wouldn't want to hold a picnic in, Eggers displayed a deft hand behind camera as his unique vision unfolded before our eyes.With such a well-rounded debut under his name, hopes were high across the industry that Eggers next project would further solidify the hype and with a return to a New England setting this time in the late 1890's, The Lighthouse further enhances Eggers reputation amongst the top class of upcoming directors, even if The Lighthouse's more bare-bones story and snail-paced proceedings will mean it finds itself both loved and hated in equal measure.Quite simply the story of Willem Dafoe's and Robert Pattinson's isolated lighthouse keepers, the grissled and gassy Thomas Wake and the under-prepared Thomas Howard, The Lighthouse is far more psycho-drama than pure horror, as this Greek mythology laden event takes us on a journey of two men crumbling in different ways as their job and its dangers begin to take hold.As with The Witch, The Lighthouse is stunningly well-shot and put together in a film-making sense, with Eggers getting great help from his hauntingly beautiful black and white photography courtesy of Oscar nominated cinematographer Jarin Blaschke, the films goose-bump inducing score by Mark Korven and his script co-written with brother Max while the films central performances are both a sight to behold.Creating one of 2019's great acting double acts, Pattinson and Dafoe excel as the two Thomas's with the two well-liked actors giving their all to the film.Featuring in some scenes and images that won't soon be forgotten (a scene with a feathered visitor, images of a beached mermaid and Dafoe getting up close and personal with a light source some such moments), both performers are awards worthy in their respective turns.With so much worth recommending, it's sad to report that the journey we go on in the snail paced Lighthouse is one that depends a lot on it's final destination and with a procession of repetitive situations and seemingly unimportant scenes littering Eggers film, by the time we finally get the films end game, you can't help but shake the feeling the potential of where we are being taken is quickly overshadowed by a surprisingly weak final stretch that doesn't leave much of a lasting impression for what is at times such an original and impressive offering.Final Say -Sure to find some ardent fans amongst many that will question what all the fuss is about, The Lighthouse is a technically brilliant sophomore effort from Robert Eggers that features two standout performances but it's slow and metaphor filled examination of masculinity and the male psyche makes for an unpleasing narrative experience.3 seagulls out of 5",The Lighthouse
39,TheMovieDiorama,The Lighthouse shines a mythologically surreal light of dread upon its sluggishly repetitious narrative.,7,8 June 2020,"""Should pale death with treble dread - Make the ocean caves our bed. God who hear'st the surges roll - Deign to save our supplicant soul"". Nineteenth Century, New England. An isolated rock shrouded in flocks of seagulls. A towering lighthouse illuminating the blustery skies with its empowering glow, its bellowing horn echoing through the torrential rainfall. Waves crashing upon its jagged coastline. An elderly lighthouse keeper and his recent ""wickie"" recruit surmount the population of this desolated landmass. Two strapping male individuals on a power struggling journey for command and control. ""HAAARK!"", squawks keeper Wake amidst a drunken argument with his protegee Winslow. ""Let Neptune strike ye dead Winslow! Bellow, bid our father the Sea King rise from the depths full fowl in his fury!"", damning a gradually crazed Winslow to a superstitious death that sees ""the souls of dead sailors to peck and claw and feed upon only to be lapped up and swallowed by the infinite waters of the Dread Emperor himself"", after savaging a seagull, mythical for a soul of a lost sailor, during his morning duties. Invoking the ancient Promethean myth of Prometheus himself, creating humanity with clay. The prophetic ocean God who served Poseidon, Proteus, manifesting within Wake's condemnatory speeches. Man versus deity. The ultimate struggle for power. Winslow's increasingly maniacal stance, yearning to feast his eyes upon the light of the erect tower that Wake secludes from him, rampantly overwhelms with each night of alcoholic consumption. The mind melting to insanity amidst the claustrophobic extremity of desolation. Producing intimacy, jubilation and commination.Eggers' surreal horror is a fierce contemporary mythological insight into homoeroticism. Exploring the idealisms of man, supplying toxic masculinity upon the poisoned water supply that drives Winslow to alcohol. Uncovering the complexities of human nature and sexuality through meticulously orchestrated conversations that fluctuate in enragement. ""Boredom. Eviler than the devil. Makes men to villains"". Indicative to the gradual embracing of immoral homosexuality, given the archaic century, that is bestowed upon these two individuals. Two morally ambiguous men, segregated from society, in constant contact with each other. Winslow especially, sexually repressed as he practices onanism with the visualisations of a siren conjured in his mind from an ornate sculpture. A duel for dominance, where one must accede to submission. Physically beating each other into capitulation, iconising foreplay.The homoeroticism sprouting from Eggers' nautical screenplay of Gods and monsters, coincides with the power struggle that encapsulates these two men into primitive beings. Desiring control over one and other. The striking visceral imagery, particularly the composited shot of Wake and Winslow adapting Schneider's artwork 'Hypnosis', known for its queer interpretations, assisting in unearthing the mythic roots of the screenplay. From a psychological perspective, the subdued terror incites an Oedipal fixation from Winslow's viewpoint. Both fearing and worshipping Wake as, not just a deity figure, but a fathering dynamic. Consequently causing Winslow to rampantly act like a child during heated conversations, often resorting to physical altercations.Fortunately, the sizeable performances from both Pattinson and Dafoe establish these thematic interpretations, in what are undoubtedly career-best roles. The hurricane force at which Dafoe exerts, is nothing short of behemothic power. A titan amongst men. From the nautical dialect to the ferocity of his line delivery. Simply unmatched. Pattinson nearly equaled his dominant ability, with only a wobbly accent and occasional mumble diluting the clarity of his dialogue. The eventual turning point and climactic distorted screams highlighting the subdued acting style that he has polished over the years, truly aiming for acclaim. Eggers' choice for a narrowed aspect ratio and orthochromatic aesthetic accentuates the photography of its time period, whilst symbolising the repressed nature of its characters. Equipped with meticulously implemented lighting and ornate production design, The Lighthouse truly was an exceptional masterclass is technical filmmaking.Alas, the tidal voyage of this surreal psychological horror was too curvaceous for its own good. A problem was bound to arise, and so it did. Much like his narrative pacing in 'The VVitch', Eggers offers a sluggish motion to allow each detail to ""strike ye down"". Unfortunately, the repetitious structure of Winslow completing his laborious duties with limited escalation in dread for the first hour, exemplified the very issue at the core of his films. They're too slow, with limited development from a characterised and thematic perspective. The Promethean mythology, homoeroticism and dynamic power struggle were only established after Winslow inevitably bashed that one-eyed seagull in. The preceding first act provided insubstantial information other than the remoteness of the lighthouse and Winslow's recurring duties as a ""wickie"". Essentially withholding integral enlightenment until the halfway mark. As a consequence, Eggers was unable to produce the underlying vibe of dread that exquisitely powered the third act. Opting for a simple dramatic approach, albeit with minimised drama thanks to superfluous character development, rather than immediately entrancing with its eventual surrealistic integration. Undeniably sumptuous to glance at, but ultimately vacuous with its monotonous approach.Much like my apprehension with 'The VVitch', a feature that personally felt disconnected upon first viewing, The Lighthouse will more than likely illuminate with future watches. A surreal voyage into the homoerotic interpretations of ancient mythology. The accentuation of differentiating dominance with submission. Eggers once again possesses exceptional talent to implement an exquisitely audacious horror, bolstered by two sterling performances, that regrettably takes too long to set sail for the powerfully inclined sea.",The Lighthouse
40,Tweetienator,Trippin' Good,8,24 December 2019,"I really like The Lighthouse even if I am not sure I understand everything that's happening. The Lighthouse is one of those movies that can only work if you got excellent actors and Willem Dafoe (like always) and Robert Pattinson perform excellent. To enjoy this movie you should like to watch the unusual, trippy, and weird stuff and don't mind that something is shot black and white only. A fine piece for a open-minded and experiments liking audience but maybe unwatchable for those who are looking for something rather mainstream. All in all: remarkable.",The Lighthouse

42,imseeg,"Twisted, repulsive, eery and dark, yet fascinating and mindboggling to watch.",8,1 January 2021,"Welcome to 2021, my first movie of the new year and what a movie it is! This is the kind of movie I would never dare recommend to my friends or family, who would like to be entertained, because this movie is so dark, twisted, repulsive and eery, yet it still was such a fascinating watch for me personally. I would only dare recommend it to the arthouse movie fan of disturbing, dark tales though...The good: the black and white photography was breathtakingly GORGEOUS. The sound design was intense and got under my skin. The acting, especially by Willem Dafoe is absolutely magnificent and Oscar worthy. The mood of this picture, however repulsive, lucid, eerie and ominous, is still so fascinating to experience...as if in a dream...The bad: story continuity is rather bad. Yes, I totally agree with all the other reviewers. I am usually never ever bothered by lack of story continuity in any other movie, but in this movie I found myself wondering that several scenes did not connect to the next one, AT ALL. Was it done on purpose? If so, it still hammered a natural flow of the story. A minor criticism: Robert Pattinson, however good an actor, wasnt the best actor for this role in my opinion, he simply didnt quite convince with his accent and simply looked to modern, for this character from another era of the past.The story: a mad man (Willem Dafoe), who is a lighthouse keeper on a far away, isolated island gets a new assistant (Robert Pattinson). They both go mental...or already were mental to begin with?Beware: you need subtitles to really understand what they are saying...",The Lighthouse
43,paul-allaer,Stunning film with Dafoe sure to get Oscar nomination,9,26 October 2019,"""The Lighthouse"" (2019 release; 110 min.) brings the story of two lighthouse keepers. As the movie opens, we see a boat in choppy waters and wrapped in fog, on its way to a small island with a lighthouse. Two men arrive at the lighthouse, settle in, and make a toast: ""To 4 weeks!"", the scheduled length of their stay on the island. It is clear that the older guy, named Wake, is in charge, and orders the younger guy, Winslow, around and gives him backbreaking work... At this point we are 10 min. into the movie but to tell you more of the plot would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.Couple of comments: this is the second film from writer-director Robert Eggers, who seemingly came out of nowhere a few years ago with ""The Witch"". Here he goes one better yet, bringing us a tale of psychological paranoia, set on a mysterious island (location: unknown; time: late 19th/early 20th century). The first striking thing is that the movie is shot in an unusual 1:1 screen ratio, and in B&W on top of that. The second striking thing are the outstanding performances of the two leads, William Dafoe (as the older guy) and Robert Pattinson (as the younger guy). Dafoe is like a good bottle of wine: he simply keeps getting better as he is getting older. On the heels of Oscar-nominated performances in ""The Florida Project"" in 2017 and ""At Eternity's Gate"" in 2018, he outdoes them all with this career-defining role as the aging lighthouse keeper who is in control (but is he really?). There are certain scenes that defy even the highest of expectations, in particular in the last 20 min. Pattinson shows us how much he has matured and improved as an actor since the ""Twilight"" saga days, but in the end he cannot compete against Dafoe's sheer brilliance. The movie's photography and editing is pure eye-candy from start to finish. In the movie's end titles, I noted that this was filmed on location at Cape Forchu, Nova Scotia, and that the film makers used diaries from actual lighthouse keepers back in the day as part of the source for the movie's dialogues, wow. I am going on record right now that this film will accrue tons of nominations in the upcoming awards season, including multiple Oscar nominations.""The Lighthouse"" premiered at this year's Cannes film festival to immediate critical acclaim. It is no accident that this film is currently rated 91% certified fresh on Rotten Tomatoes. The movie finally opened this weekend at my local art-house theater here in Cincinnati, and I couldn't wait to see it. The Friday early evening screening where I saw this at was attended very nicely (about 20-25 people), and the positive word-of-mouth this movie surely will generate could make it into an art-house theater circuit success, despite the many unusual aspects of this movie. If you are in the mood for truly something different and out there, featuring stunning acting performances, I'd readily suggest you check this out, be it in the theater, on VOD, or eventually on DVD/Blu-ray, and draw your own conclusion.",The Lighthouse

46,jtindahouse,A very unique and captivating film that won't be for everyone,7,20 December 2019,"Robert Eggers first film 'The Witch' was a big favourite with audiences and particularity critics, but it didn't really take my fancy. So I was cautiously optimistic going into 'The Lighthouse' despite having heard incredibly good things about it. This film is about as unique as films ever come along today. The aspect ratio, the black and white, the bizarre and almost incomprehensible dialogue, the character actions/interactions - all combine to make this quite a captivating viewing experience, albeit not a perfect one.This isn't going to a film to everyone's liking I can assure you that. It takes a lot of patience and it requires you to watch two pretty weird dudes do some pretty weird stuff for almost two hours. Robert Pattinson and Willem Defoe are quite incredible in this movie. Their acting is transformative. This has to be one of the toughest performances each has had in their career and they both nailed it. I suspect they won't get a lot of love in award season because they were both so good they almost cancel each other out which is a shame.I love bold and original film-making. This is certainly that, but just because a film has those things going for it doesn't mean it is perfect or without flaws. You'll probably know about 15 minutes in whether this is going to a film to your liking. Some will love it, some will hate, somehow I've found myself right in the middle.",The Lighthouse
47,robfollower,"It's all about the the acting... if the seagull doesn't get a Best Supporting Actor nomination at the Oscars, I will riot.",9,25 October 2019,"Writer and director Robert Eggers writing and directing are absolutely brilliant. The filmmaker is highly adept conjuring madness and dread for his fantasy horror The Lighthouse. The 1890s plot follows experienced seafarer Thomas (Willem Dafoe) as he hires fresh new recruit Winslow (Robert Pattinson) to help him with the upkeep of a lighthouse off the coast of Maine. Working hard by day and drinking hard by night with only each other for company, the harsh conditions and isolation eventually takes its toll on them. Eggers' film throws one into the insanity quickly. His striking and unsettling visuals, eerie sound design, and wonderfully dark humor create an experience that is unforgettable.While Eggers' distinct vision is astonishing, the film thrives thanks to the fearless work by Willem Dafoe and Robert Pattinson. The two leads chew into their words with performances that must stand as one of the greatest of 2019. I will be stunned if one or the other does't land an Oscar.Eggers has created a film of disturbing horror, absurdist comedy and probing psychodrama. The film clearly has very deliberate arthouse sensibilities. I can't wait to see what Robert Eggers comes up with next.",The Lighthouse
48,parry_na,Didn't work for me.,3,18 July 2020,"I've long since wanted to see 'The Lighthouse'. A slow burning story, with elements of Lovecraft and David Lynch, featuring two powerful actors in an isolated, secluded location sounds exactly my kind of horror.I'm glad I have seen it. It satisfied my curiosity about what the director of 2015's terrific 'The Witch' would do next. Sadly, as a film, it failed to make any connection with me, or I with it. It isn't a bad production - the images are stark and beautifully filmed in black and white. The acting, mainly from Robert Pattinson and William Defoe, is intense and convincing - but I couldn't detect any real emotion, other than the rage that comes with being cooped up with another.The direction clearly wants to provide us with weird and unsettling images, which it does, but that only goes so far when there isn't any kind of story, or development, going on - other than bouts of madness, which manifests itself in moments of screaming violence.Despite everything, all I could see were two men, neither of whom are particularly likeable, shouting at each other, fighting or indulging in grubby personal habits. There are some interesting moments, mostly toward the end, but ultimately, there was nothing here I found frightening in any way. Nor did I find anything funny, or witty or particularly satisfying.I won't slate the film because I can see it was well made and performed. It just didn't have any resonance with me personally. As such, I just found it rather dull and noisy. My score is 3 out of 10.",The Lighthouse

Even a horror movie (though I'm willing to consider it's not meant to be horror) needs some kind of momentum behind it; it can't just be excellently crafted scene after excellently crafted scene.Maybe something went way over my head (which is very possible and I am even willing to give the movie the benefit of the doubt; it just feels that good) but to me this quickly becomes a bunch of sketches of two guys how struggle to get along and intermittently find some kind of truce and then argue again. I do like an episodic approach, I find they convey growing dread very well and even when the movie is daring you to laugh at it with it (just wait) it has an uneasy power.Being optimistic I just didn't understand it and I saw nothing but a couple of men getting cabin fever and having some strange dreams. I'm not sure what to make of that seagull...In conclusion: I would go in with low expectations, but this is so heads and shoulders above most of the other dark movies that people keep insisting are modern classics like Midommar or Mother!",The Lighthouse

The performances are certainly worthy of awards with both men leaving little of their inner selves unexposed.

52,jimbo-53-186511,More of a technical success than a narrative one,4,14 January 2021,"In the 1890's a pair of lighthouse keepers are sent to a remote island in New England; the remote setting and the isolation soon takes a toll on the 2 men as they become increasingly unhinged the longer they are together on the island...Credit where credit's due I have to admit that I felt that Robert Pattinson and Willem Dafoe were both very good here and there were certainly occasions when their performances did hold my attention (aside from odd occasions where it felt like they were trying to 'out act' one another). In addition to the impressive performances the film is also atmospheric and at times it also has a chilly eeriness about it. Unfortunately, for me, that is where a lot of the positive elements of this film end....For a start, I didn't find the characters all that interesting and also found them to be poorly developed (which goes some way to perhaps explaining why I didn't find them all that interesting). Truth be told, I also found some of their dialogue difficult to decipher (again not helped by Willem Dafoe speaking like Captain Birdseye). The descent into madness is also handled a little unevenly and in all honesty it occasionally veers into comical & surreal madness which made it hard for me to take it seriously (which presumably wasn't the intention given the serious way that the story generally unfolds).Unless you're a big fan of Willem Dafoe and/or Robert Pattinson it's not a film I could recommend personally - as I've mentioned it is only a success from a technical perspective. For what it's worth though I was going to give the film a 3, but added another star to my rating as I felt that it deserved that for the mostly excellent performances from Willem Dafoe and Robert Pattinson.",The Lighthouse
53,MissSimonetta,Nihilism never seemed so wacky,8,7 September 2020,"There is another user review with this as a headline: ""Well crafted... but bit empty with story"" and to be honest, that's how I feel about this movie.Now, the hype was real with this one. I adored THE WITCH and expected this would be just as good, if not better. Personally, I love the aesthetic THE LIGHTHOUSE is going for: very 1920s German Expressionist. Robert Pattinson and Willem Dafoe are both brilliant in their descents to insanity, unafraid of going absolutely over the top and deranged. And being a book lover, the evoking of Poe, Lovecraft, and Melville was all enough to have me chomping at the bit.Now how to describe the experience of watching THE LIGHTHOUSE? Well, it's a weird blend of nihilistic despair and goofy comedy, if that makes sense. Thought fart jokes were only for kids' movies? Think again. Some of the lines must be heard to be believed-- my favorite scene is when Dafoe thinks Pattinson has slighted his cooking and casts a lengthy, Lovecraftian curse upon him. After close to three minutes of this long rant, complete with the invoking of pagan sea gods and a description of bowels being pecked at by ravenous birds, Pattinson sighs and more or less goes, ""Fine I love your cooking!""While I enjoyed the movie, I left it with an empty feeling. Nothing about the characters in and of themselves intrigued me much, though to be fair, I sometimes had a hard time understanding their accents, so I could have missed something. A lot of the themes (gay repression, Prometheus allusions, the light being a forbidden fruit, cosmic despair) all felt more like window dressing than anything really explored in depth. By the time the gruesome ending occurred, I was more like ""WHAT?"" than horrified or moved... but maybe that was what Robert Eggers was going for? I'm unsure.I can see why the reviews have been so polarizing, to say the least. I still think THE WITCH is the better of the two movies, but THE LIGHTHOUSE still has a lot going for it regardless. It will just suit less people's tastes than Eggers' debut.",The Lighthouse
54,drownnnsoda,Nightmare in black and white,9,8 November 2019,"""The Lighthouse,"" director Robert Eggers' second offering after 2016's remarkable ""The Witch,"" follows two men in late-19th century New England who are left to man a lighthouse on a remote island for one month. What ensues is a descent into madness for the isolated rookie (Robert Pattinson) under the supervision of his aging supervisor (Willem Dafoe).Taking ""The Lighthouse"" into account with aforementioned Eggers' directorial debut, it is clear that he excels as a filmmaker with small stories that, though localized in physical space and short on characters, are anything but shallow. Over its near-two-hour runtime, ""The Lighthouse"" bores deeper and deeper into nightmare imagery (and logic), mining the backstories and motivations of its two characters, from whom the horror really springs. Unlike in ""The Witch,"" which was humorless, Eggers folds some dark humor into the proceedings here that works very nicely.Dafoe's character is an enigma more or less, while Pattinson's comes into focus over the course of the film, and the entire feature's meditation on guilt grows clearer and clearer. Both Dafoe and Pattinson give tour-de-force performances, and are in all truth 80% of the why the film works. In the hands of the wrong performers, a screenplay like this implodes, but both are experts at these characters.Eggers makes the most of the limited space in which the story is set, and it never grows dull--if anything, the oppressive atmosphere put on show leaves the viewers with a claustrophobia that occludes any potential boredom. The black and white photography is stark and beautifully done, and there are visual references that recall ""The Night of the Hunter,"" as well as thematic ones that make obvious nods to Kubrick's ""The Shining."" Eggers' decision to present the film in fullscreen (cropped on the sides) only further adds to the closed-in world of the story.By the end of it all, ""The Lighthouse"" wraps itself up into a fitting conclusion. And for all its bleakness, there is enough dark humor and borderline-creature-feature weirdness on display to keep the audience perplexed, and horrified. As a portrait of madness, ""The Lighthouse"" is among the best of the 21st century thus far. 9/10.",The Lighthouse

The cameras and film stock are of the type used in the early 20th century which results in an aged looking print. At times the island is drenched in sun and a sparkling black and white results but more often it is the grey of rain and storms while the indoors are dark, small sections barely lit by lamps. But it is the lighting of the faces which result in the opening of the terror, the senior keeper Willem Dafoe's visage seeming deranged as he tells his tall tales before it twists with manic rage as he abuses and orders Robert Pattinson about. Pattinson's countenance is at first meek, then resentful and gradually anger builds. Dafoe ranges from the comical like the Captain from The Simpsons to frightening Shakespearian soliloquys.Though Cinematographer Jarin Blaschke does a great job it is Director Robert Eggers set up of shots which make this film, an eye staring through a hole in the shingles, the ship disappearing into the fog, tentacles wrapping around Pattison, a stand off with a seagull. Pattinson's feud with a seagull is central to the development of the narrative. As is his exploitation by Dafoe, he ends up doing all of the back breaking manual work, stoking the furnaces, hauling coal in all weather, while Dafoe tends the lamp.A tale of madness due to isolation, alcohol abuse, being stranded by a storm; as well as a building sense of resentment on the part of Pattinson. But is Pattinson a reliable narrator, or is Dafoe really gaslighting him? Pattinson also has visions of a Mermaid she eventually seems to actually appear and they make love. Elements of a quandry or what is real and what is imaginary emerge just as they did in Eggers' The Witch.

Already at the outset the parameters of their duties are delineated w/the older tar in charge of the light work (tending to lighthouse keeping & cooking meals) w/the new hire doing all the grunt work (repairing roof tiles & keeping their septic system flowing) which starts to grate on the younger man who's mind is already starting to fracture due to the isolation of the environment.

I seem to be one of the few movie fans that didn't much care of the VVitch so to see that director return in another weird period piece sounded like a recipe for repeat disappointment. How delighted I was to watch this and find it a really engaging and captivating experience. A near two hour jaunt through a period piece revolving around two men minding a lighthouse and slowly losing hold of their grip on reality. It's exceptionally put together, the cinematography is really spectacular hear, the use of black and white along with the aspect ratio really helps set the mood and the stunning performances by Dafoe and Pattinson really hammer it home. Add in the way it plays with mythology amidst the madness really adds a fun extra layer to everything.Only real downside is that it feels a little unfocused at times, meandering about from strangeness to strangeness. The insanity doesn't help here, making some of those drawn out moments feel a touch disjointed or like a one off thing that doesn't amount to quite enough. These are small knocks really but they pull it down from perfection and utter greatness.The Lighthouse is a fascinating film, worth checking out, worth renting.

In my review for that film, I said I believed it was one of the best horror films of the last decade; I still believe that.""The Lighthouse"" is something else entirely.From the atmosphere hinted at in the trailers, I expected ""The Lighthouse"" to be a horror film, and there are some moments in ""The Lighthouse"" that are undeniably horrific, but, in my opinion, this film defies genre classification by transcending it. ""The Lighthouse"" is an experience more than it is anything else; I came out of it feeling overwhelmed, as if I'd just watched Ingmar Bergman's ""Persona"" for the first time. The premise of this film is so simple, yet the way in which the story is told and the way it plays on certain ideas, touches on so many big ideas. The ending is powerfully symbolic, and furthermore, it felt eerily harmonious with the ending Eggers gave us in ""The Witch"".Two days later, I still had yet to write this review because I was still processing it, replaying certain scenes, trying to process the themes. So when the opportunity came to see the film again, I leapt at it.

Considering it's filmed in 35mm black and white and in an aspect ratio of 1.19:1 which is basically square , its looks absolutely amazing. The visuals and sounds attack your senses from the very beginning and never let go.
It looks like it was made in days of Fritz Lang but the use of light is far more ambitious than anything Fritz ever attempted.
The movie itself is about Two lighthouse keepers who try to maintain their sanity while living on a remote and mysterious New England island in the 1890s.
These two men are incredibly troubled even before they get to the Lighthouse and the situation they find themselves in only makes things much , much worse.
Robert Pattinson and Willem Dafoe are at the very top of their game .
They feed off each other in what could almost be described as an acting battle and both come out on top in different stages of the film , not unlike the battle the characters are having with each other.
If it's the Twilight Pattinson that you are looking for you are going to be sorely disappointed. This is the mature version and I was incredibly impressed.

It also was a bonus watch in a horror movie challenge that I'm trying to complete before October ends. The synopsis here is the hypnotic and hallucinatory tale of two lighthouse keepers on a remote and mysterious New England island in the 1890s.We start this seeing the island in question. There's a ship that is going out to it and it is bringing Thomas Wake (Willem Dafoe) and Ephraim Winslow (Robert Pattinson). They're taking over as the two keepers for the next month. Thomas will be the one to actually man the light at night while Ephraim will take care of the rest of the duties which are upkeep of the machinery and keeping the quarters in working order.There's actually a pretty tense scene to start us off at their first dinner. Thomas pours a drink for Ephraim and wants to do a toast. He points out in the manual that they're not supposed to drink and pours it out. Thomas in turn tells him it is bad luck to not finish a toast. Ephraim gets water and it tastes horrible.The two men take on an uneasy friendship, which is required as they're the only two people on this island. Ephraim starts to see weird things though. He sees a Mermaid (Valeriia Karaman), but wakes up in his bed. That opening day he found a statue of one as well. He thinks that he sees things in the room with the light while Thomas is up there and we get flashes of creepy images as well. He also isn't the biggest fan of the seagulls on the island. As things go on though, we learn that these men aren't as they seem and what we are seeing might not be what is actually happening as they descend into madness in their isolation.Now I wanted to go a little bit vague for that recap for a couple different reasons. The first being that there's not a lot that actually goes on in the film. We see things that happen, but as it goes we learn the truth of what we saw and who these two really are. On top of that, I want you to experience it as well.With that out of the way, I love the concept that we have set up here. One of my favorite troupes is the descent into madness. I personally deal with a lot of anxiety, so seeing mental illness when displayed properly in film is something that I enjoy. I think that the Eggers brothers did some really good writing here and presenting that to us. This story is really told from one of the point of views and it's the other one that is pointing out what he is experiencing. I really dug that, as it really made me consider what I see around me in my own life.This film is actually really hard to talk about it as it is a mash up of so many things. I normally think that can actually be a detriment to a film, but here it oddly works. I actually heard this concept before seeing it and it makes complete sense afterwards. If they want to take this into a Lovecraftian way, they most definitely set it up. There's comedy here as we get these two guys living together and being forced together, which is kind of like having a roommate. There are also some mariner superstitions here that made me worried if some of these bad things that are happening stem from that as well.I want to shift gears to talk about the pacing of this film. It comes in at a runtime of 109 minutes, so just under two hours. I'd say that at the halfway point of that is when they start celebrating that they're almost off the island, but that's where it gets crazy. We really get to know the characters during that time, or at least we think we do. Even though we don't necessarily always know what is going on and what to believe, I think it takes us on a journey to figure that out. The ending was quite interesting as well and I did like it, even if I don't necessarily completely understand it. It is definitely ambiguous.The best part of this is actually the performances. Dafoe plays a man that comes off as a ship captain that is from the New England area. To use a pun, he wants to run a tight ship and makes Ephraim do all of the grunt work. This makes him seem mean, but I think that is in order to maintain order. Pattinson on the other side though is a lumberjack from I'm assuming the northern Midwest. He really portrays this role really well and the more we learn about him, the crazier it gets though. Karaman also is solid in the small role she has. She plays a mermaid that is more like mythology as a creature, but she is still quite attractive and we get to see her topless as well.That will take me to the effects of this one, which to be honest there's not a lot. It isn't that type of film though. I do think that the mermaid effects were done practically for the most part. I do know there's a scene with CGI, but we see it at a distance and that works. We also get to see something like octopus tentacles that are CGI. We don't linger on it, so we really don't get to break it apart too much. I will say that how this is shot is amazing. We get a weird aspect ratio, which from the interview wasn't used long in the past, but it was popular at the time of the likes of Fritz Lang. There's time where I noticed and it just makes things feel off, but there's times when in darkness you forget and it's almost overbearing. I thought it really added something for sure.This moves to me to the soundtrack and the final thing to go over. There's a recurring foghorn that partially drives Ephraim crazy. I know a couple times it made me jump with how loud it is. It does fall back into almost being a recurring background noise that is eerie at times. The rest of the score is subtle, but I did feel it building dread within me. I think that fits what they were going for and I was on board.Now with that said, this film is definitely hard to classify. We really have a buddy story of these two guys who are isolated on an island with a lighthouse. Thomas is out to exert his dominance and Ephraim just wants to work his time and get paid. There are secrets that are hidden and the isolation drives them mad. It does become kind of a fever dream where you don't know what is real and what's not, which I dig. The acting is amazing from our two leads for sure. I like the effects that we get as well as how it was filled. It is out of the ordinary and since this whole film is like that, it works. The soundtrack has some good sounds and I think the rest of it fits for what the film really needed. Overall I'd say this is a really good and I think I need another viewing to pick up anything I may have missed. I would recommend this if you're into arthouse films or non-traditional horror films.Read more: https://horrorreview.webnode.com/news/the-lighthouse/",The Lighthouse
66,robertemerald,Strange tale artistically filmed,8,22 August 2020,"First there was Cold Skin, then The Vanishing and then this strange work of art, The Lighthouse. I'll be honest. I was hoping for something like Cold Skin. Cold Skin was an exciting duel between men, the elements and something, well, unearthly. In fact all three of these superb lighthouse movies are about conflicts arising, in part, because of isolation. The Lighthouse is closer to The Vanishing than Cold Skin. But it does have an aspect of unearthly. Thus, to my mind, it lost two points from me, as I thought it needed, or at least we the audience needed to see, much more of that aspect. I can understand how technically this is a superb movie, with an original and authentic script, robust characters played well, fantastic location, and filmed with great depth and originality as well, producing some classic images. Alas, I wanted more unearthly and less extreme drama.",The Lighthouse
67,jadepietro,Losing Its Way,4,30 October 2019,"GRADE: C-THIS FILM IS NOT RECOMMENDED.IN BRIEF: Despite some gorgeous cinematography and two strong and committed performances, the movie is slightly more grueling for moviegoing audiences to endure than its two fine actors.JIM'S REVIEW: In comes the ominous fog that hangs over the film like a shroud of doom and gloom. Two seafarers stationed on a remote island tend to a lighthouse and descend into madness in critical darling Robert Eggers' mood piece, The Lighthouse. The film is one of the best lensed film of the year and one of most pretentious films of any year.There is an aura of mystery from the start. But eeriness can only take you so far. The story has to be there. It's not. Moviegoers spend nearly two hours watching two 19th century lighthouse keepers named Ephraim and Thomas play a battle of witlessness as they argue, bicker, eat, drink, and fart their way through the stormy days. The screenplay by Max Eggar and the director is pure tedium as it depicts events that are real or imagined. Some may call the resulting narrative poetic and haunting. Not me. I was bored by the lack of action and squirmed at the overblown dialog. (The audience around me sat silently throughout, which led me to believe they were either in rapt attention or fast asleep. I think the latter.)This is High Art, the kinda going experience in which critics are bowled over by the visual beauty. And let me say right here that Janin Blaschke's cinematography is absolutely stunning and deserving of an Oscar. He shoots the movie in a square Movietone format, similar to films from the silent movie era, in glorious black & white tones. Every scene is beautifully composed and artistically rendered. Special mention also goes out to Craig Lathrop's moody production design.It seems that a new genre of artful independent films has officially arrived. Movies I would call Atmospheric Psycho Babble. To fall into this category, a film must be directed with consummate skill and deft craftsmanship, usually with a visionary director at the helm. (Lars von Trier, David Lynch, Ari Aster, and this director come to mind.) The criteria also includes: loud sound effects, strong surreal visuals, a dissonant music score, heavy symbolism, an oppressive theme, gratitious nudity, and an interesting premise that peters out at the midway mark and loses all logic from that point. It's The Emperor's New Clothes School of Filmmaking, a grandiose movie that relies solely of stunning imagery over storytelling, all style over no substance.Much of the film's success depends upon the actors in this two character psychological study. Both actors are very good in their very physical and grueling performances and deserve better material. They may not win an Oscar, but they certainly earn a Purple Heart for their yeomanlike duties in this movie. Robert Pattinson, looking like a young and handsome Daniel Day Lewis, is Ephraim. The actor spends most of the film doing grunt work: carrying heavy metal containers, cleaning out chamber pots, becoming waterlogged working in the rain, trudging through knee-deep mud, masturbating on call. Yet he is able to make his one-dimensional character come to life. Willem Dafoe plays Thomas as a cross between Van Gogh's postman Joseph Roulin, Captain Ahab or Crunch (take your pick), and the Sea Captain from The Simpsons. As written, it is an truly absurd caricature, but bless the God Poseidon, Mr. Dafoe is always entertaining and he is, once again, a riveting screen presence.But the film. Da she blows. And the Artsy Fartsy (literally) Award goes to....",The Lighthouse
68,EdgarST,Two hags in search of a plot,4,22 December 2019,"I do not know what is wrong with cinéphiles. They are mistaking the epidermic values of a movie with good cinema... But I cannot tell which movie is worse... «Midsommar» or this pointless thing you cannot make heads or tails of, inspired not so much in Melville or Lovecraft, but in all the bad horror movies that Los Angeles has been making after the 1970s. «The Lighthouse» takes about thirty-something minutes to make a tiring exposition concerning two men, alone with their secrets, in charge of a lighthouse, which has its own secret. All that first act is dominated by omnipresent amplified sound and gimmicky music cues, because --I repeat it again-- filmmakers seem not to trust the images they shoot, and because someone told them (from Bernard Herrmann down) that cinema without music is useless. Cheap aphorism of populist cinema with cultured pretensions... And then the secrets of all are revealed when the movie turns into a piece of chamber theater, delivered by two drunks: the endless dialogues were perhaps inspired by Melville or diaries of sailors and lighthouse keepers (as the credits claim), but to me they sounded like the verbal fencing between two crazy hags exchanging ridiculous lines of nineteenth-century melodrama, about beans, wood and nuns. While the man in charge of the lighthouse (Willem Dafoe) goes from tyrant to old queen, his slave/assistant (Robert Pattinson) hallucinates with mermaids, octopus men, Hitchcockian seagulls, storms, seaweed and whatever sea thing you can imagine. Second film by Robert Eggers, the decorator and costumer who tricked everyone with ""The VVitch,"" his first movie, «The Lighthouse» mimics the format and black-and-white of silent films to no avail. Unless you have watched very little cinema and do not know Dreyer, you may find it fascinating. For me it is irremediably silly.",The Lighthouse

74,krocheav,The Lighthouse - Go There At Your Own Risk,4,8 January 2020,"Having a love of all things set around the sea and classic navigational aids, it was essential to see 'The Lighthouse' - not so sure it was a good idea though. It's a movie to make you feel both sickened and exhausted. The exhaustion is not so much from watching the harrowing events but from forcing yourself to last the distance. Great movies have been made with thought-provoking prose telling of highly strained relationships; O'Neil's Long Day's Journey Into Night, Mourning becomes Elektra, Melville's Moby Dick, along with several similar writings by Edgar Allen Poe, being just a few.This grotesque, gothic horror yarn borrows from just about all of these in an attempt to bring to life its relentless assault on the hapless viewer's senses.
The end result may prove to please the horror aficionados or audiences with sadeo-masochistic tendencies. It pounds you over the head with an endless barrage of perverse abuse and vulgarity, till you want to reach for the remote to escape or move on in double speed. This sort of theme, in the past, would have been made as an effective 50min featurette (BFI or CNFB style)As is, the endless morbid visual and sound scapes, tend to weigh you down to the point of wanting to walk out. The two performers are hard working but a good movie needs more than slick acting to be enjoyable. I'm OK with the use of beautiful, moody, well lit Black and White cinematography but don't see the advantage of shooting in an odd variation of the old 4 x 3 mode, as it added little or nothing. Also, with appearing to be set in the late 1800s early 1900s, these constructions would have been relatively newish and quite well maintained but this set, looks so severely neglected as to be more like an untouched, 200 yr old museum piece. Lastly, lugging heavy 'steel' barrels up a Spiral Staircase...step by step, single handed, when you have a pulley system outside seemed odd (?) Strictly for 'arty' self-abusers.",The Lighthouse
75,Abdulxoxo,An instant classic,9,25 December 2020,"When this film's trailer first came out, I was very intrigued with the idea of the premise, so much that I re-watched it countless times, but when I watched the actual movie, the whole concept changes, from the trailer it looked like it's Winslow who have the upper hand and like he's hiding something from Thomas. But the role is reversed In the movie. Whoever edited that trailer deserves a pat in the back for misleading the viewers.
The film's plot revolves around two lighthouse keepers who become stranded on a tiny island in the middle of nowhere during a prolonged storm. It's an intriguing blend of strange visuals, psychological uncertainty, and genuine humor all anchored by two absolutely brilliant performances from Willem Dafoe and Robert Pattinson. The cinematography along with the authentic production design set the depressing tone, the bleak atmosphere, and the rainy, colorless, lifeless island perfectly. The score is atmospheric, I particularly like the eerie foghorn sound piercing through the scenes occasionally.
I like The Lighthouse very much for some reason, people hate because it lacks coherent plot but to me it's the interactions between the two characters and their slow descent to madness that appeals to me the most. Overall, the film is great from a technical standpoint but doesn't have a strong story.",The Lighthouse

78,frankde-jong,Robert Eggers second is not so innovative as his first.,6,28 February 2020,"In many reviews ""The lighthouse"" is celebrated as an innovative picture. I have my doubts. The theme of remoteness / solitude leading to madness has an ancient tradition in filmhistory (""The shining"" (1980, Stanley Kubrick) and ""Hour of the wolve"" (1968, Ingmar Bergman)).Especially the resemblance with ""The shining"" is striking, not only with respect to theme but also with respect to specific scenes. The first meeting with the mermaid (who starts screaming), made me think of the young (later old) woman in the bathtube. The persuit with the axe by the old man (walking limp), made me think of Jack Torrance in the labyrinth. Speaking about individual scenes, what about the love scene with the mermaid annex octopus? Is this not just like Isabelle Adjani in ""Possession"" (1981, Andrzej Zulawski)?On top of the fact that ""The lighthouse"" is not so innovative as many reviewers would like us to believe, the film becomes less in the second part. In this part it has many of the weaknesses that many horror movies have, too long and too much emphasis on shock effects. Already Jacques Tourneur showed in ""Cat people"" (1942) that things you left to the imagination are as scary as things you show explicitely.Is there nothing positive to say about ""The lighthouse"". Certainlty! The cinematography is beautiful and this also applies to the aspect ratio (the ancient 4:3). Furthermore the sountrack, with a regularly repeated fog horn, is spooky in its own respect.",The Lighthouse

80,Jeremy_Urquhart,"Great and unique, with a good chance of being a classic one day",8,15 January 2020,"It's hard to say much about The Lighthouse without either giving away plot details that are best left unspoiled, falling into review stock phrases and cliches, and saying a whole lot of stuff that's already been said. Australia has only just gotten The Lighthouse, and so this movie doesn't really need another review talking about how good it is. Global releases are a thing for TV shows, music releases, and video games, so I'm not sure why the film industry hasn't caught up yet. People who aren't as concerned with seeing something at the cinema could well turn to pirating if they're tired of waiting several months for something anticipated to come out, as well as trying to avoid spoilers and discussions of the film online in the process.Bit of a tangent, I apologise. Like I said, it's just hard to bring much new to the discussion around The Lighthouse. The two lead performances are just as good as you've heard, especially Dafoe, whose Oscar snub this year is particularly baffling. Pattinson continues to take on challenging, strange roles, and after this and other movies like The Rover and especially Good Time, it's great seeing where his career is going. The mood of the film is haunting and captivating, the sound design and music score (if I can even call it a score, in the traditional sense) is also fantastic, and the movie is both thrillingly beautiful and (a good kind of) ugly.I also appreciate how difficult it is to fit into one broad genre; it truly is its own beast. I can't say it's just a ""horror"" or ""mystery"" or ""drama."" If Dafoe and Pattinson broke into song at one point, it possibly could fall into every single primary genre. At times it's incredibly creepy, at other points funny, always very psychological, sometimes leisurely paced and character-focused, sometimes very confusing, and every now and then relentless and tense.It's hard to criticise beyond saying that perhaps it's slightly too long for such a simple premise. Of course there's more to it than just the story, if you want to dig into it, and really, you wouldn't want to take out too much of what was already there. Some of it plays out how you might expect, while some of it really doesn't, so perhaps this does keep it mysterious and unpredictable overall. It's hard to recommend to absolutely everybody too. I'm sure Eggers intends to confuse his audience with this film, but some may walk out feeling more baffled than they're comfortable with feeling. It's also incredibly gross and off-putting in parts- another reason it's certainly not for everyone.Still, it has potential to be a classic one day. I could see this getting better in time, and increasingly interesting and profound on a rewatch, or perhaps after reading reviews and analysis' from people far smarter than myself. Like a good David Lynch movie, you kind of get out of this what you put in- on a base level, it works as an experience, with an eerie atmosphere, provocative and disturbing moments, great performances, and an unforgettably haunting mood. Digging down deeper and uncovering just what this somewhat simple tale is ""about"" could lead to a masterpiece being uncovered... or it could end up driving you just as mad as being stuck on a tiny island with nothing but a lighthouse, many cans of beans, and copious amounts of alcohol. Time will tell I guess, and I'm similarly interested to see how time treats this bizarre, intense, yet likely unforgettable film.",The Lighthouse

Aside from the obvious things you notice right away, such as the square ratio and black and white picture, it also has a very original (and very weird) storyline and two fascinating characters.This is more of a slow-burning psychological thriller than a full-blown horror film, but it is effectively disturbing and creepy and the more the film goes on the more it gets to you. One thing I would recommend is to put the subtitles on as it can be very difficult to understand what Dafoe's character in particular is saying.'The Lighthouse' is one-of-a-kind and not something you would expect to be released in 2019.

For our Covid-times, it's a horror film that scares through a lingering sense of being trapped. Shooting in b&w and a tight, boxy aspect ratio creates an uneasy intimacy with the characters. Chuck in the soundtrack of a lighthouse foghorn, punctuating scenes like a warning siren. The film's period dialogue is joyous, and the film has moments of friendship, bleak humour and a healthy serving of fart gags.This deals with madness, but in a form that feels ancient and mythical. Old folk tales and superstitions, sailors cling to as the only way to bring reason and order to the all-consuming chaos of the sea. Eggers' film never delineates between reality and dream, leaving us to decide for ourselves whether the island is cursed or whether this is all some kind of hallucination.

With the combination of Wake's abusive authoritarianism, their isolation, and nature's harsh elements, the two men gradually become unhinged.The intensity of the situation brings out the best in the two leads especially Dafoe as a cantankerous, flatulent curmudgeon. Up to a point, the actors and the film do well within the limits of a very claustrophobic story which happens to be a good depiction of the hardships of working-class men in another era. Adding to the harsh mood of the film is the appropriately stark and beautiful black-and-white cinematography by Jarin Blaschke.The rare scenes when the two men get along are a relief as many others are sadistic with mutual abuse. ""The Lighthouse"" is a fine drama but its length is a liability for one with a confined setting and much degradation. - dbamateurcritic",The Lighthouse

There was also a severed head in the lobster pan. It might be something to do with him seeing the man die back at his previous work where he stole the identity of the man to have better job prospects. Because he also saw a guy drowning between the logs in the water. The cistern was filthy. He saw dead birds in the cistern and killed one of them which had been mocking him. Tom claimed that this changed the direction of the wind and brought the storm. They were stranded on the rock and Thomas also started to drink. They dug up the stash and drunk it all up. Then they made their own drinks and got drunk and danced and hugged each other while Thomas spillt the beans about his kind-of-murder bak at his previous work. Thomas wanted to leave with the boat but Tom destroyed it with an axe. After reading his negative opinions of himself in the diary, he went mad and attacked Tom and tried to bury him in the hole under the lighthouse tower where they dug up the bottles. He came back from the hole and attacked him and Thomas killed him there and went up to the light. He was enchanted and charmed and laughed hysterically after he saw what he saw in the light. He then got rejected by it and fell down the stairs. After that he was seen to have fallen prey to the gulls. They were feeding on his flesh on the rocks.

90,aciessi,Land Ho!!!,9,25 January 2020,"The Lighthouse is a visual masterpiece, and an avant-garde horror classic that gives us all the more reason to consider 2019 the best year for film in more than a decade. Even if you don't like weird movies, you'll really like this one. Robert Eggers scared us with The Witch, but The Lighthouse places him head and shoulders above any other horror filmmaker out there. In stunning black and white, the film looks more like a creepy, old-timey photograph than a motion picture. The first introduction of our two characters is practically picture in itself. The story (if you could even call it that) is the mental deterioration of two sailors, cooped up inside of a lighthouse as they toil away to keep it shining. They are both starving and sexually deprived, and over time, they begin to hallucinate. You'll be reminded of films such as Eraserhead and Un Chein Andalou, as Robert Eggers let's his bizarre imagination run wild. Theres a mermaid, and a giant squid, and a lot of seagulls... oh, and a bit of farting. Willem Dafoe and Robert Pattinson are spellbinding to watch, but I was especially blown away by Pattinson. He's been underestimated since the Twilight days, but he's no ordinary actor. The Lighthouse contains his best onscreen performance to date. He's absolutely chilling.",The Lighthouse
91,rockman182,The Lighthouse (2019),7,18 October 2019,"I loved The Witch when I first saw it. It was legitimately such a uniquely entertaining horror film where so much went on on the screen and you could feel expert film-making in the subject matter and the attention to detail. For this reason I was very excited to see the next effort from Robert Eggers and it looked like an absolute mad one from the trailer. After watching, the film certainly is madness although I can't help but feel that my expectations were way higher than what I felt after watching the film.The film is about two lighthouse keepers on duty in isolation. The two are initially at odds with each other with a boss-employee relationship with a lot of hostility. Soon both men realize the effects of their loneliness in the isolation and descend into madness and terror with each passing day. Reality becomes blurred and emotions and violence flares. There are very few actors in this film and it is primarily comprised of Willem Defoe and Robert Pattinson.The film is shot entirely in black and white and the aspect ratio is 1.19:1. The film looks and feels like something from the past. The film could have easily been made in the 50s or 60s, it absolutely looks the part. The sound effects and editing on the phone are stellar. Every crashing wave, siren, and moment of terror is heard precisely. The acting is also tremendous from both men. I have no worries at all about Robert Pattinson playing Batman. Between Good Time and now The Lighthouse, I already know that he is a very talented man.This film once against offers unforgettable and unnerving imagery much like The Witch. Its a craft in technical film making although I felt like the film dragged in its narrative. A lot felt like rambling (though very well presented) and I feel like other segments feel incoherent and garbled. Its a good film no doubt but after The Witch I was expecting to absolutely love this film. Still its a good effort from a film maker with a wealth of talent.7/10",The Lighthouse
92,Benjamin-M-Weilert,"Some excellent performances in a total ""what the heck?"" film.",7,25 August 2021,"When Oscar season rolled around a few years ago, I heard a lot of buzz about an artsy film known as The Lighthouse (2019). Years later, I finally found the time to sit down and watch it on Amazon Prime. Now I understand why the Academy didn't nominate this film for Best Picture. It's weird. I legitimately tried to figure out what was going on but gave up when things just spiraled into chaos. I have a suspicion that a key moment in the film resulted in a character's death and that the remainder all takes place in some sort of purgatory, but that's the best explanation I can give at the moment.For a film that features two actors for almost the entire runtime, I have to say that Willem Dafoe and Robert Pattinson make this movie something to see at least once. In fact, I'm still half-certain that Willem Dafoe wasn't even acting in this movie, as his portrayal of a crazy lighthouse keeper was too on-the-nose to be anything but authentic. Pattinson's performance was a perfect counterpoint to Dafoe's, even if both were ultimately disturbing.I understand that not every movie needs a comprehendible ending that wraps everything up into a nice little conclusion. Still, a little more of something would have been nice given how everything collapsed into a quagmire of insanity. And perhaps that was the point. As many of us have experienced over the last few years, isolation is a hell of an existence. When there's no way out and no way to know when the isolation will end, things are bound to get crazy. Just not H. P. Lovecraft-style crazy.Some excellent performances in a total ""what the heck?"" film, I give The Lighthouse 3.5 stars out of 5.",The Lighthouse
93,RforFilm,"Within the madness of mermaids, tentacles and a lot of alcohol, The Lighthouse is a frightening experience with a lot of layers",10,15 November 2019,"If you're a science fiction or horror fan, especially of books, then you certainly have to know H.P. Lovecraft. His name along as created a sub genre called ""Lovecraftian"", which means dealing with a monster or force that's either cosmic or so otherworldly that humans can barley understand what's after them. This also makes this kind of work much more abstract, so it's understandable if it's not your taste. There are a lot of people who want a clear picture of monsters and ghosts, but what Lovecraftian stories do is explore the fear of not understanding what it is, yet knowing it could still be dangerous.While today's movie was not written by Lovecraft, it has a lot of its similar style. It's story deals with forces that are either too abstract for our heroes to understand or could just be their own insanity. It just so happens to also have director Robert Eggers (The Witch) who has not only given the story a late nineteenth century setting, along with a black and white look. It also tackles the general fear of isolation and being alone, which itself terrifies me. All this it put into a complex package that is The Lighthouse.Former timberman Ephraim (played by Robert Pattinson) is sent to an island off the New England coast where he's taken work as a ""wickie"" (a lighthouse keeper) under the supervision of a grizzled elderly Thomas (played by Willem Dafoe). Ephraim is given orders to not enter the light part of the light house (as that's Thomas' responsibility) and is given the majority of chores. At first, Ephraim is not much of a talker, despite the language and personality of Thomas. Slowly, he opens up a little more, listening to Thomas' tales and is given the warning never to kill a seagull, as they apparently carry the souls of dead sailors.After a seagull is killed by Ephraim, the winds change and a powerful storm strikes the lighthouse. The two spend their night getting drunk and singing sea shanties. As days of the storm pass by, Ephraim is not only curious about the light, but is starting to see a lot of things like tentacles, mermaids and the heads of dead people. He even starts to lose focus on what day it is. Whether its him or Thomas going insane, or even ghosts even playing around, all is not well at this lighthouse.Is The Lighthouse a horror movie? I would make the case similar to how The Shining is also a horror movie. They may not have jump scares or an over-the-top soundtrack, but it does tap into the idea that what we don't see is scarier then a typical monster. This makes the movie very effective thanks to both actors Robert Pattinson and Willem Dafoe who both embody ticking time bombs. Their characters each have unknown pasts that, even though we learn a little about, both seem like men who would be hard to trust in real life. Hence since neither are either heroes or villains, we can only witness what's going to happen.You'd think it would become boring, but the script understands how these guys would comminute and makes them intriguing. I'll admit that while I did have some trouble understanding Willem Dafoe through his grizzled sailor voice, the point isn't to take everything he says seriously. In fact, much of what is said though his body language and how Robert Pattinson reacts to it. The best way I can describe this is like a silent movie that happens to have sound.What helps that is that the movie is in black and white. I can't even imagine the movie in color. Along with giving it a classic horror film look, it builds the Lovecraftian tone of the unexpected. I'd say the other scary element is that the further the movie progresses, the more unpredictable it is. Yeah, you know it's got to build up to something, which I won't spoil, but the abstract nature of this creates several paths to take. I just happen to love the one taken in the movie.I'll give this ten lighthouses out of ten. If your looking for something traditional, The Lighthouse is anything but that. What you do get is something that'll stick with you for a while, trying to analyze the images, sounds and even the story. I can see many conclusions to what people may draw but I can only recommend checking for yourself to see how. It's a movie that's just as addicting as the light at the top.",The Lighthouse
94,Holt344,"The Lighthouse has a solid story, breathtaking cinematography and incredible acting performances, a must watch for psychological drama fans",9,3 January 2021,"The Lighthouse is a character driven psychological drama with elements of horror, claustrophobic is how I would describe it because of the sets and how it was shot in black and white with a nearly square 1.19:1 aspect ratio.
The story is simple, original and fascinating. It has Willem Dafoe and Robert Pattinson as the main characters, they play two lighthouse keepers on an island that isn't what it appears to be. If you enjoy character driven movies then this is the one for you as those two actors give one if not best performances of their career. The accent is on point and so was everything else regarding their performances.
The story and screenplay was written by Robert Eggers the person who also produced and directed this film and he wrote the script with his brother Max. Phenomenal writing and directing, it's a story I will remember for years to come.The technical aspects is where the movie truly shined, with its breathtaking visuals and cinematography to its production design, the strong music and its use of natural sound effects works so well for the movie as it is another way to immerse the audience.
The lighthouse only oscar nomination was for its achievement in cinematography and I used to believe 1917 deserved its win but after watching and experiencing this spectacular film I can only say that my thoughts have changed, this should have won as it is an achievement.
There's only one filmmaker that I can say have a similar style and visual storytelling and it's of course David Lynch, Robert Eggers could potentially be the spiritual successor to David Lynch but Robert is his own filmmaker and I can't wait for his new film titled The Northman.Robert Eggers created a visual and technical masterpiece with his second movie, The Lighthouse is a must watch for any fan of the psychological genre. How I could miss this when it was being played in the cinema, how wrong I were to miss it as it truly is an extraordinary experience.",The Lighthouse
95,bankofmarquis,Weird - and I couldn't look away,7,25 January 2021,"I have viewed some really strange films in my day. When asked, I often mention MIRRORMASK (based on a Neil Gaiman story) and mother! (the Darren Aronofsky oddity) as the strangest films I have ever seen.Add Robert Eggers' THE LIGHTHOUSE to this list.Based on a real life tragedy from 1801, THE LIGHTHOUSE follows 2 isolated Lighthouse keepers as they interact with each other, slowly going mad in the process...or did they? Is one of them mad and the other sane? Are they both mad? Or...is it the viewer who is going mad? Eggers let's you, the viewer, decide.And...good for him. I have now encountered 2 films directed by former Production Designer Eggers - THE WITCH and now this film. In both cases, the movies are interestingly shot and intriguing to view but almost incomprehensible. The more so with THE LIGHTHOUSE, it is almost as if Eggers heard the criticism of THE WITCH of being incomprehensible and said ""hold my beer"".Besides the production values - which really are quite good (especially Eggers use of Black and White) - what holds this movie in high regards is the acting of the 2 people in film. These 2 characters are the only speaking parts in this movie.Willem Dafoe portrays the older, veteran Lighthouseman who tells the tales of Mermaids and Curses and has a generally air of foreboding from the start. It is a masterwork by Dafoe - his best work of his career (and that's saying something). He is unnerving to view from the start. The only thing the viewer needs to figure out is whether he is insane or very, very, very sane.The surprise for me in this movie is the work of Robert Pattinson, the younger Lighthouseman who is in his first assignment. He is the audience's eyes into this weird world and he is very much sane at the beginning. At the end...well...you decide. He was able to go toe-to-toe with DaFoe and held his own very well. This young actor has made a conscious choice following the Twilight films and with this movie and with Christopher Nolan's TENANT he is establishing himself as a darn good performer.As for the film itself, my one recommendation for you is to not be too concerned of making sense of what is going on in the scene you are watching...you'll drive yourself mad doing this (at least it was driving me mad). After awhile I just sat back and drank in the weirdness - and the quality acting and production values - that was enfolding in front of me and the ending was satisfying (enough).All in all one of the stranger times I've had at the movies.Letter Grade: B7 stars (out of 10) and you can take that to the Bank (ofMarquis)",The Lighthouse

He was absolutely superb, frightening and Shakespearean all in one. I enjoyed the film simply for the range and depth he brought to his character. Pattinson, on the other hand, simply seems like he needs more seasoning under his belt to achieve thespian greatness. That said, the black & white/square aspect ration of the film seemed unnecessary as a modern-day wide screen full color format would've worked. Hopefully, that wasn't the reason why a lot of Academy voters overlooked his brilliant performance. In any case, I recommend this film not so much for its story but for Dafoe's acting. As a side note, I'd watched The Vanishing just before seeing The Lighthouse.

Willem Dafoe, a Trump fan, symbolizes those Trump supporters who see the world as they do. Robert Pattinson is emblematic of the Democrats who can't see past their hate towards Trump. Throughout the movie, there's a love/hate aspect between the two, just as the Dems hate Trump, yet in their own way, love the acrimony associated with the president.
Once you go into the theater with that outlook on the film, The Lighthouse can be a masterpiece. There is no other way of interpreting this movie.

103,tm-sheehan,An acting Masterclass Duo,9,8 March 2020,"My Review- The Lighthouse
My Rating 9/10 .Not for Everyone- Madness, Isolation and Very Grim but what performances and cinematography!I'm still disturbed and reeling from this movie which in my opinion is the most explicit portrayal of madness and the effects of alcohol abuse on the mind that I've seen in years.Without any spoilers I'll divide my Review in three segments.1-The Look- The Lighthouse is filmed in dramatic monochrome which adds to the austerity and the bleak setting of a lonely New England lighthouse in 1890 perched atop a rocky outcrop in the Atlantic Ocean.The interior shots are even more austere I read the film was shot on Double-X stock black and white, it requires much more light to get exposure, so when they shot at night and indoors, they had to use about 15 to 20 times more light on set to actually see something on film. The crew put flickering 500 to 800 watt halogen bulbs in period-correct kerosene lamps that were only a few feet away from the actor's faces, resulting in the set being blindingly bright, so the actors could barely see each other. The film has an aspect ratio of 1.19:1, an almost-square frame that was used in the early sound years by filmmakers including Fritz Lang and G. W. Pabst. They chose the format because ""the spaces in this movie are meant to feel confined, and it certainly achieves that effect.2-The Sound- The constant drone of a foghorn adds to the angst and tension and remains an ominous, memorable, and unique soundtrack to this film.It's a very frenetic alcohol fuelled insane script at times and leaves the audience wondering what's really happening and what's an aberration of a drunken brain .I can't recall any actual music score apparently there was one by Mark Korven.3- The Acting - The most impressive and vital reason to see The Lighthouse.The cast and crew filmed under extreme weather conditions: Freezing temperatures, cold atlantic water, intense winds, snow, rain and no protective flora on the Forchu terrain kept them exposed to the elements throughout the shoot.I'm gobsmacked by both Actors Willem Defoe of course has proved his brilliant acting credentials previously in so many fine films . He plays Thomas Wake the crusty old sea salt Captain of The Lighthouse who's authoritarian and manic attitude to Robert Pattinson Thomas Howard the sub ""wickie"" (a term used by Thomas Wake is the 19th Century slang term for a lighthouse keeper )creates a threatening and suspenseful mood which is exaggerated by the look and sound of this film. Robert Pattinson is amazing he gives a career defining performance which to my mind places him in the company of the greats like De Foe,
De Niro, Hoffman, Penn ,Hanks and Pacino.I read that both actors have very different approaches to their roles before filming began, Willem Dafoe and Robert Pattinson rehearsed with Robert Eggers for a week in a hotel in Halifax. While Dafoe loved to rehearse given his extensive theatre background, Pattinson didn't want to show and let out too much beforehand, preferring to jump into the scene blindly. He found the rehearsal process frustrating and uncomfortable, being used to react impulsively in front of the camera and getting self-conscious by thinking too much about the scene beforehand. His method being, that if he accomplishes certain things in rehearsal, it will later ruin the spontaneity and feel fake in front of the camera.Both Actors techniques obviously were effective I think it's one of the great Actor pairings ever in a movie .It's certainly not a pleasant film but for this Cinemaphile , who loves many genres of film was very impressed .When asked to describe the movie, director/writer Robert Eggers always used the same choice of words in every interview: ""Nothing good can happen when two men are trapped alone in a giant phallus.""",The Lighthouse

I thought they were both a-holes; so I didn't care what happened to them (meaning no suspense or emotional journey). What did Robert Pattinson found in the end inside the lighthouse? The movie made absolutely no sense by the end of it. Such a garbage movie what a horrible film. I really can't believe how they spent a money and time to made this movie.. no meaning at all there's no story no point just like a nightmare even the nightmare has a meaning .. only two persons fight each other and hate each other for no reason as well is depressing movie i regretted spent two hours for this what i should call it? I really liked The Witch, but this one was pretty bad. Great acting but story is a bit empty and boring. I am very disappointed. The actors were great and the movie was shot well but the movie just wasn't interesting. Nothing felt new, I feel like actors can be great and the film can be shot well but this movie feels so that it's an artsy movie with fart jokes. This is the epitome of just an artsy overrated movie. I was waiting for an hour and a half for it to not feel like something I've seen already but it never did. One of the worst films of the year I have to say that I was super bored. The dialogues are awful, awfully. It was hard watching that dirt get thrown on Dafoe's face.

I rarely find these kind of gems, And whenever I do, I make sure to boast about it; and I'm gonna do that right now.To be honest, this one deserves every single praise out there.

Great use of deep contrast with B&W shades; Robert Eggers really know how to use absence of color to his advantage!
Soundscore is phenomenal as well!
An immaculate composition that alludes eeriness, and signifies secludedness the script heavily demands.
Screenplay is on par with such flawless technicalities. Hence complimenting their greatness with ease!

Well, one's mad to begin with and the other is a psychopath. The seagulls knew all along.The Lighthouse is a horror film that thinks it's a psychological drama. It looks like the 1880's, it sounds like the 1880's, it feels like the Eggers brothers forgot one basic thing about drama; you have to have a character to care about - whether to want him/her/them to receive their just desserts, or to be redeemed. In that lies your story, your drama, your ending. The Lighthouse has neither, only a race to the bottom, like a slasher flick.The two stuffed costumes here simply degenerate over time, as they fear they are stuck on the island with nothing but the fear that either might secretly be gay, and hard liquor to keep them company. That's it. A lot of expert film-making about people nobody gives a hoot about., because neither is particularly loveable or particularly hateable. Authentic? Sure, we've all seen old photos of seafarers.

But yeah, the ending of the movie really should have had a conclusion. It knocked this movie down from an 8/10 to a 6/10 just because of that.",The Lighthouse

I'm not a big fan of movies where it is unclear what is a hallucination or what is real. I'm also not a fan of films that are open to multiple interpretations. Apparently it's an allegory of certain character's from greek mythology (which I sorta got near the end) but I just don't want to think on a film such as this for long.

116,Andres-Camara,This is crazy,4,19 January 2020,"The truth is that I do not understand anything, it leaves me many doubts unresolved. The film is credible, yes, the actors are, on acting, but it is, I imagine what the director wants, and that goes very well for the film. But for me this kind of movies, which doesn't have a logic, I don't like them.The two actors are very good, if that is what the director is looking for. It must have been a very hard shoot, that if there is a scene, eating sand, that can not help laughing at me, thinking what the actor would be thinking at that moment.Black and white photography is very grateful. It is not like in color, that as soon as it is not well done, it looks like a television lighting. In this case, the lighting does not put you in a world of terror, because it is not a world of terror, it is not known what it is, but it is beautiful.The makeup and hair work is brutal. What the actors have had to go through must have been hard.The job of directing, as I don't know where he wants to go, I don't know if he gets it. I have finished watching the movie, to do my Oscar pool, if not, I don't know if I would have finished it. But I don't like how he handles the camera, why he doesn't. And I don't know if he takes the film well, because I don't understand anything.Anyway, I wouldn't see it whole, if you want to spend that time, it's your business.",The Lighthouse
117,MrDHWong,"A surreal, often nightmarish exploration of isolation and paranoia",8,27 December 2019,"The Lighthouse is a psychological horror film directed and co-written by Robert Eggers (The VVitch). Starring Willem Dafoe and Robert Pattinson, it is a surreal, often nightmarish exploration of isolation and paranoia.In the late 1800s, Ephraim Winslow (Robert Pattinson) travels to a small New England island to work as the lighthouse keeper alongside the elderly Thomas Wake (Willem Dafoe). As time passes slowly, both men try various ways to retain their declining sanity, either by drinking profusely or by swapping stories of their past. However, one day the wind changes direction which brings about misfortune on the island and Thomas believes Ephraim is to blame. This causes a great deal of animosity to build up between the two and furthers their descent into madness.In spite of its minimalistic plot and setting, The Lighthouse uses just the right amount of those elements to create one of the most interesting looks into these two men's detachment from civilisation. From the very beginning, director Robert Eggers gives his audience the sense of how droning it would be to work at a lighthouse by showing the repetitious chores in keeping things maintained as well as the tight claustrophobic rooms needed to be navigated through. In addition to this, we are constantly reminded of how remote their island living quarters are from the mainland with the ever present sound of crashing waves and seagulls constantly squawking at all times of the day.Visually, the film looks great, with meticulous care put in to creating the 19th century setting. Each of the actors wear the appropriate attire for the time and even speak in the correct New England accent. The cinematography and the black-and-white aesthetic draws comparisons to the work of Swedish director Ingmar Bergman, in particular his 1957 film ""The Seventh Seal"", which used the oceanic scenery as a backdrop to several key moments. But perhaps most noteworthy is Robert Eggers' decision to shoot the film in the square framed 1.19:1 aspect ratio, giving the whole thing a distinct vintage feel.Being the only two proper actors in the entire film, both Willem Dafoe and Robert Pattinson successfully keep the audience in suspense over whose sanity will slip first. It was fascinating seeing each of them during their outbursts of frustration and loneliness. The ever reliable Dafoe is his usual rugged self, making his character the most mysterious while Pattinson holds his own against him. Pattinson's performance is highly reminiscent of somebody Daniel Day-Lewis would play, complete with facial hair and suppressed anger.In conclusion, while this film certainly isn't for everyone, it is worth checking out for anybody interested in psychological horror such as myself. Rather than delving into the supernatural, we instead learn more about the down-to-earth oddities that can play around with someone's mental state, which in turn can be scarier than any ghost story. The Lighthouse is one such film and it has earned its place among the best of this genre.I rate it 8/10",The Lighthouse
118,Alexander_Blanchett,For me more to respect than love,7,1 January 2020,I loved the atmosphere and generally gritty feel it gaves you. I adored the performances by Robert Pattinson and Willem Dafoe and I absolutely dig the cinematography. There are many aspects of the film to respect and appreciate however I wasnt nailed by the story or even storytelling. It has a very Bergman-ish style with it that often did not connect to me in the past and does not here. However the film has many strengths. OF course the on screen duo who really both demand the screen. Out of the two performances I slightly prefer Willem Dafoe. The reason is that you would expect greatness from him but he even topped those expectations. He truly commanded the screen and played his role with such a fascinating enthusiasm. Robert Pattinson is also fantastic. He more and more grows into one of the most interesting actors of his career. The magic in his performance lies in the fact that he slowly and slowly shows what he is capable of while Dafoe is a force of nature from the first time he opens his mouth on screen. Both a brilliant and so is the realistic look and feel the film portrays. I loved that it was in black & white and cannot even imagine what different effect it would have had in color. Still I wasnt too focused on the story but I guess thats a too subjective opinion. In general the film is a piece of art - and art is subjective.,The Lighthouse

There are few films out there like this and even fewer that can make nearly two hours of two guys alone in a New England lighthouse this tense and fascinating.

122,jmbovan-47-160173,Art house most decidedly,6,19 April 2020,"Eggars is decidedly a dedicated director to the craftmanship of film. He has shown his skill at creating atmosphere with setting, sound, and a story. He is an actors' director and is malleable to each and every method of acting. From this, he is able to elicit exciting performances that highlight the excellence of his actors. The downside to his films is the focus on the craft of making and focus on a return to the aesthetics of film making. This leaves me wondering what he is trying to tell me with his films, as the esoteric nature of his ""slowburn"" approach dilutes much of the intensity of what he can create. In this film, he circles around and around again to show the descent into madness of characters that were mad at the beginning. So what was the point of the 2 hours of watching this film. Aesthetics? Craftmanship? Acting excellence? This he does. But these are not enough to build a film and enhance storytelling (which is different than setting a story). I wish Eggars would take a bit more time to create the ""whole"" versus intense focus on the minute details that, while showcase his talent, leave the film without a center upon to build a whole.",The Lighthouse
123,elicopperman,Through the Eyes of Mad Dog Sailors,9,8 December 2019,"In 2016, newcomer horror filmmaker Robert Eggers fascinated critics and audiences with the supernatural period film called The Witch. In addition to its unconventional plot and subversive horror movie tropes, it had a distinctive aesthetic that was reminiscent of its established time period: 17th century New England. Now cut to this year, when he released another film set accurately in that region, only this time in the 19th century, known as The Lighthouse. Out of all the brilliant psychological horror movies that have come out in recent years, this one might take the cake and potentially swallow it whole.The film follows two lighthouse keepers who try maintaining their sanity while living on a remote New England island in the 1890s. The central core of the movie is insanity, since it mainly focuses on the lead Ephraim Winslow who tries to maintain his new lighthouse keeper job without losing it on a strange remote land, only to have him slowly melt into lunacy. In addition, his boss Thomas Wake is a seemingly vulgar and slovenly housekeeper who may not really be what he appears as. In fact, without going into detail, let's just say that Winslow and Wake have more in common than one might imagine. As for key narrative points, the picture twists typical sailor tropes like mermaids and seagulls into symbolic icons that make one question what they truly mean without coming off as too vague. The vividness of these icons are what make the film engaging enough to make theories out of, and even when they show up on screen, they can be interpreted in more ways than just one. It's that type of subtlety that makes the metaphorical work rather than if it were all spelled out.In terms of the actual tone, while the movie itself isn't exactly scary, everything that happens to the two essential leads is disturbingly enticing from start to finish. Most of the horror comes from the sanity going on in the lead's heads, thus making it feel like you're inside their minds throughout the runtime. Even at its goriest, the film mostly becomes shocking by letting the viewers take in the overall experience. With a tone like that comes spectacular performances, and both Robert Pattinson and Willem Dafoe practically become their characters they're so professional. Pattinson does a successful job capturing the seemingly suave nature of Winslow whilst trying to maintain his inner anxiety, whereas Dafoe comes off as a stereotypical Captain Ahab-like caricature with enough charisma and even pathos to present Wake as much more than the disgusting slob he appears to be. Whichever character you sympathize with the most in the end, they both display their own sympathetic qualities through their growing madness, making them all the more memorable as island survivors.As for the filmmaking itself, the film was shot in black & white with a 1.19:1 aspect ratio, so in addition to feeling like one of those classic fright fests, the tighter space intentionally makes the experience more claustrophobic. The simple albeit gloomy atmosphere of the lighthouse itself makes one feel trapped inside, with the little details of muck and dripping water adding in to the intimidation. Given that the film takes place within weeks, the editing feels appropriately fast paced without coming off as jarring, since one never knows how long the characters have truly been on the island. Similar to The Witch, the dialogue is representative of a certain period dialect: in this case, old-timey sailor talk. While it can be hard to interpret if you're more used to common movie character ""lingo"", it's so authentic that you feel like you've traveled back to that specific moment in time. Those extra bits of effort and legitimacy can give way more of a punch to your work depending on what it's going for, and one can tell that Eggers and his crew did their homework properly.Some movies deserve all the hype they receive, and other movies aren't really worthy of it...needless to say, The Lighthouse is part of the former. With a gripping tale about insanity, phenomenal performances and creative/authentic filmmaking, this film might stand as one of the greatest horror movies of the decade, if not the entire century. If you're a fan of psychological horror, period pieces or movies that offer more than mainstream fodder, than this is just for you. Even if you don't get much out of it, it will offer you a vastly alternative look for a character study that most horror movies could only wish of obtaining.",The Lighthouse
124,ronakkotian,"I'm fond of yer movie, Robert Eggers",10,2 February 2020,"After watching The Witch, Robert Eggers became a really fascinating director to me. He clearly had a lot of talent which is why The Lighthouse was my most anticipated film of 2019. Once again, Eggers delivers.The Lighthouse tells the story of two lighthouse keepers trying to keep their sanity intact as they stay on the remote island.First of all I want to say that THIS FILM IS NOT FOR EVERYONE. I was extremely excited for this film due to the buzz and hype surrounding it, claiming this was the best film of the year or even the decade. I suggest you go into this movie with low expectations since you may be disappointed by how it turns out. If you're expecting a full on horror film, this may not satisfy you. This is an arthouse movie that does NOT cater to mainstream audiences. If you go in with this in mind, you may actually find this film to be incredible.What I loved about The Witch was how authentic it felt. The dialect, setting and costumes helped make it very believable. The Lighthouse is no different. You can tell Eggers does his homework and clearly cares a lot about the craft of his movies. This is one of, if not, the best looking movies of 2019. The black and white and 1.19:1 aspect ratio make this movie feel like it was made in the early 1900s. The costumes, makeup and dialect contribute massively to the film's realism and authenticity. Hats off to Eggers for creating an experience that completely sucks you into the world the film takes place. Even if you don't like the movie, you can't deny the sheer brilliance of the aesthetics.Alongside the aesthetics, the other aspect you cannot ignore is the phenomenal acting by Dafoe and Pattinson. I've always loved Willem Dafoe and this just might be his best performance yet. His expressions and way of speaking make him the highlight of the entire film. Robert Pattinson is shaping up to be one of the best actors in Hollywood. He proved to me how great he can be in Good Time but what he did here is nothing short of Oscarworthy. The way he shows his character slowly descend into madness is mindblowing. The level of commitment these two actors had is simply outstanding and it pains me to see them not get recognised for their work at the Oscars.This is, without a doubt, one of the weirdest films I've ever seen. So much can be interpreted and theorized about this movie which I love. I love it when a film is ambiguous since it makes me want to think about what everything could mean. The film is not that scary but the imagery shown is quite surreal creating a bizarre yet uneasy experience. The music also enhances the atmosphere through its ominous tone. There really isn't a film quite like this.The Lighthouse is a cinematic achievement. What they were able to accomplish in terms of its visuals and aesthetics is applaudable. Dafoe and Pattinson give some of the best performances of 2019 and Eggers cements himself as one of Hollywood's greatest visionaries. This is a movie which I feel needs to be watched multiple times in order get a better grip at what the film is saying and the themes it presents. Right now this remains as one of the most unique films ever.",The Lighthouse
125,garethcrook,Let the madness set in.,8,8 February 2020,"Black and white 4:3 films are like buses. This seemed like a good double-bill with Bait, but despite the technical similarities they share little in common. To start, this is tighter than 4:3, it's pretty much 1:1 and feels claustrophobic as hell. It's also a period pierce, set in the late 1800s, although to be fair that's of little importance. It also has some rather A list stars in Willem Dafoe and Robert Patterson. It is based by the sea though, as the title gives away, in a lighthouse. A dark, cramped, creaking lighthouse. It's not the sort of environment you want to be stuck in with someone you don't like and the lighthouse keeper and his junior do not like one another. They've been drafted onto to isolated island for a month, to fix things and maintain the light, simple enough, but isolation does strange things to people. The sounds are eerie, drawn out brass and strings, that sounds like whales, mix with grinding machinery, an ever present ticking clock, seagulls and waves. The weather beaten island seems alive and it's clear from the outset that the young junior feels ill at ease. Possibly not helped by his flatuant boss, who insists on the cushy jobs, leaving the heavy lifting to the underling. It's only half way through their stay, that the junior asks to be called by his name, Ephraim Winslow and Thomas, the Lightkeeper only introduces himself on their final night before relief comes in the morning, but back to that later. It starts to become clear to Ephraim that things aren't right, as Thomas becomes more infatuated by the light and the local gulls start to give Ephraim more of a hard time, as he tries to fix things on the tiny island. I'm thankful it's black and white, when Ephraim snaps and batters one gull to death against the buildings white walls, black blood splattering everywhere. Something he's been warned is back luck. It'll be okay though, he's leaving in the morning and won't have to put up with the dirty plumbing, freaky seagulls, or chamber pot filling Thomas... or will he. Not if a raging storm has anything to do with it! As if the first act wasn't unnerving enough, it only gets more intense as Ephraim's disturbing visions increase and his own obsessions with the light, still off limits to him increase. Hefty volumes off booze are consumed, nights seem to go on forever, names are confused, but all along the storm rages on. As the final act unfolds, so does Ephraim's life story, himself more than meets the eye and his madness growing to unfathomable levels with a sequence of scenes more powerful than the waves. Patterson is fantastic, but Dafoe, Dafoe is monumental. It's not an easy watch, but it's certainly rewarding. I'm starting to think all films should be shot this way.",The Lighthouse

128,andrewroy-04316,"Filled with ambiguity and ideas, The Lighthouse is as rewarding as you're willing to engage with it",8,18 January 2020,"The Lighthouse is something of a Rorschach Test: there are so many ways to interpret the scenes and characters that it says more about the viewer than the film. To me, this is a film about a man struggling to come to terms with his past and going mad through his self-beratement and isolation. Everything we see in the film is from Winslow's perspective, so unreliable narrator is an easy claim, but it's how his perspective warps the world that's so interesting. Under my reading, he's deeply regretful of letting the real Ephraim Winslow die and is trying to move past that and become at peace with himself. Wake is something like his older, jaded conscience, who has already undergone this process and is the only one of the two of them who has gone up to the lighthouse and seen the light. That elusive light represents salvation and peace, which is the only thing Winslow cares about, but it continues to elude him as only the idealized, older projection of himself as Wake is allowed to go up to the light. The flipping of roles towards the end of the movie, as Winslow calls Wake lad, walks him like a dog, and Wake claims that Winslow was the one who broke the boat and attacked him with an axe, are the primary reasons I think they're the same person. Wake also doesn't seem to have anything to himself, and is content to gradually let Winslow spill his beans. Winslow was working so hard all movie to keep it together, avoiding alcohol and confrontation, but eventually it's too much and he lets his inner fears rush out. In the aftermath, Wake as his conscience scolds him, saying ""Why'd ya spill yer beans?"" Towards the end of the film, Winslow feels more self-assured and decides he's going to take control. First he buries Wake, then he goes up to the lighthouse to once and for all see if he is worthy of salvation, which is what he had been nervous to find out all film. The final shots of the movie give a definitive answer, as we see him fall down the spiral stairs and is eaten alive by gulls a la Prometheus. I could definitely see a case for the time scale of the film being much larger than the weeks Winslow thinks it is (particularly with the punching of the clock, though I just read that as another part of his decision to take fate into his own hands and stop waiting, and just go up to the lighthouse), but I think he is struggling with his guilt and his madness increases over the 4 weeks. Both performances are excellent, with Pattinson as a particular standout. To me it's a slow burn meditation on guilt and finding internal peace, but part of what's great about it is that the scenes and ideas of the film can be interpreted so widely. The Lighthouse leaves a lot to consider and is yet another very strong film in the great stock of 2019 movies.",The Lighthouse

The beginning was a little boring but watching the actors descend into madness really was fun. They wound up stuck on the island longer than expected and essentially were stuck getting drunk with each other, often in a raging storm. After the first hour I really enjoyed it. Both actors really put their all into it. Dafoe was unrecognizable. Pattinson is really coming into his own. I can see how people wouldn't like it because it's essentially a non-sense movie but I really think the actors nailed crazy so perfectly. They were losing their minds and had a love/hate relationship with each other. In the end they couldn't overcome the madness which I think was a fitting end.",The Lighthouse
132,bregund,Character inconsistencies drag it down to the briny depths,4,16 May 2020,"The single most frustrating thing about this film is Wake's inconsistency. He attempts to impose a series of rules and regulations on Howard, and then proceeds to break those rules. Then he establishes himself as the alpha male, only to waiver and show signs of weakness in front of his young charge. It doesn't work because there needs to be a lead character, otherwise we're left with two men going crazy on a tiny island, which is exactly what happens. Wake is a grizzled old character who has been around the block and seen everything, it's too much a stretch of the imagination that he would go crazy as well, he is long past the point where he would have developed coping mechanisms for his vocation, for the exact set of circumstances that occur in the film. This flaw continues throughout the film and to the very end. It's hard to fault the meticulous attention to period details but Wake's wishy-washy behavior and the story's subsequent descent into tiresome is-it-a-hallucination-or-isn't-it scenes waters down the whole affair. Dafoe is good, but much like Gary Oldman he sometimes overacts...at times I expected him to start dancing around like Popeye and say ""I eats me spinach.""",The Lighthouse

So, when I saw Dafoe promoting this film on late night TV I was interested, but it looked really dark in its nature, so I didn't think it would make any box office. The interview mainly talked about working with sea gulls! When I saw that this was something so recently made and on Prime, I had to check it out. I watched it with my wife in the morning while we ate breakfast and I quickly lost interest 30 minutes in, it was very dark and sadistic and not good morning fair. Later on in the day I picked it back up and I'm really happy I did, it was very interesting! Not 5 stars because my wife hated it (lol) and I also didn't like that they presented it in 4x3 old time film and TV ratio. I get the black and white thing, this would be really gruesome to watch in color but to present it in that screen width makes no sense and cheapens the film, IMO. The music is listed in the ending credits and I plan on getting them to drive my wife crazy (not really, she likes them).

However, this one in my opinion does not land in the wonderful part. It's just weird. And not in a good way.So first off the acting is the main reason it has 3 stars and not 1. The performances were absolutely brilliant. Beyond that however I'm really struggling to find any more positives.To sum it all up. IT MADE NO SENSE. A film like this hinges on one big moment. That moment that ties everything together and makes you realise what's happened in the film you've just watched. That ""moment"" never arrives. It's just scene after scene of random stuff happening that has no explanation or reasoning as to why it's happening. Don't even get me started on the ending, it didn't answer a single question you might have had. It was so bizarre and random.So how can a film make no sense if there's a plot? Well the plot can be summed up in one line. ""Guy goes a bit mental in a lighthouse"". That's it. There's no beginning, middle and end really. It all just looks and feels like random bits and bobs lobbed together. It was really boring and poor.I found it all just far too pretentious and artsy as well. No doubt the film buffs and pro critics will enjoy something of this nature, but for an average film viewer this is something to avoid.I honestly don't have much else to say on this other than it makes absolutely zero sense. And I'm really not exaggerating either. It's literally just random scene after random scene.

137,PyroSikTh,Quite Unlike Anything Else,9,10 February 2020,"The Lighthouse follows two men stranded on a small island maintaining a lighthouse in the late 19th century, when a hefty storm surges in on their last day, stranding them even longer, and allowing time for the madness to seep in and take over. But that's only the surface-level. The movie is packed full of interesting concepts and ideas that leave so much open to interpretation. It's Greek mythology, telling the story of Prometheus stealing the flame. It's an adaptation of an early 19th century event where two lighthouse keepers off the coast of Wales were stranded due to a storm, one died and the other went mad. It's a psychological look at the Id, Ego, and Superego. It's the story of Lucifer seeking salvation only to find he's not worthy. It's a story of one man stuck in an infinite loop of suffering, butting heads with his older/younger self, only to suffer it all over again. It's a story of Marxism and capitalism, quashing the working man to reap the benefits of a higher life. It's a highlight of the dichotomy between 'god' and 'dog'. It's an old American myth of the sea. It's a Lovecraftian look at madness and the unseen cosmic horror.This movie is so chock full of themes and interpretations that I don't know where to begin, but this does have the downside of resulting in a scatty, messy narrative that often doesn't make a whole lot of sense. Scenes are thrown in for their aesthetic or artistic merit without consideration for the superficial story being told. For instance there's a gorgeous shot modelled after a painting by Sascha Schneider, where a nude Wake holds Winslow by the wrist and beams a light from his eyes into Winslow's face. It doesn't hold a whole lot of significance to the movie's plot, but it's gorgeous to look at and opens up a lot of room for various interpretations as to its meaning. That said, not once did I feel like I was particularly lost, mainly because I didn't treat it as a movie to be followed, but more as a movie to be experienced and swallowed by. In truth, thanks to the two characters being unreliable narrators, the idea of a linear plot that makes sense would be anathema. It's so rife with hallucinations, dream sequences, and symbolism in order to embody the madness and insanity.The Lighthouse is a marvel in its technique as well, most obviously in the film's visual quality. The cinematography is like nothing I've seen from a modern film, jumping through hoops in order to make it feel as authentic as possible, using cameras and lenses from the early 20th century, completely devoid of colour, with an aspect ratio almost square. Instead of looking bad and low quality, it gives the movie a visual identity all its own, and is used to fantastic effect to create some of the most striking scenes that will burn a hole in your retinas, and which wouldn't have been achievable with a more modern setup. The lighting and high contrast between light and dark makes everything standout, while the greyscale of daylight keeps the movie from looking too artistic.This authenticity bleeds into the dialogue and performances by the film's powerhouses. The dialogue is filled to the brim with the slang of the time, and neither Robert Pattinson nor Willem Dafoe stutter in their delivery. In fact they embrace this dialogue and deliver it with equally as authentic accents, accents that have been diminished in modern times. This can make the dialogue a little hard to grasp at times, but it never gets so hard to decipher that it loses you completely. Pattinson and Dafoe also look like they went through hell together in order to give the best performances possible. Pattinson had to wade into freezing cold water multiple times for the perfect take, while Dafoe gets dirt thrown in his face while delivering a complicated monologue. This was some of the most impressive, gruelling, and convincing acting I've seen.Particular scenes and moments that standout include Wake cursing Winslow with a harsh underlight casting creepy shadows on his face and Dafoe not blinking for over two minutes, Winslow being physically consumed by madness as he cackles and screams, and the high contrast lighting causes his facial features to merge and disappear, a sudden submersion in water to see a mermaid silhouette as it swims closer and screams the most blood-curdling sound, the ever-present sound of a foghorn blaring as if part of the score, amplifying the creepy atmosphere from beginning to end, Winslow complaining about Wake's farts and the smell they produce, the defiant one-eyed seagull that just won't leave him alone, resorting to drinking kerosene because they've run out of alcohol, Winslow jacking off to a mermaid corpse but keeps getting interrupted by visions of dead men...The Lighthouse was something else. Despite my best efforts here, it's a truly indescribable movie. It's claustrophobic and maddening, it's terrifying and hilarious, it's beautiful and disgusting. It's a movie simply quite unlike anything else, so it would be disingenuous to give it anything less than a staggering 9/10.",The Lighthouse

139,nickenchuggets,A recent movie that is actually worth seeing,9,26 May 2021,"Before I start talking about this movie itself, it begs the question of why are there loads and loads of negative reviews for this calling it a waste of time? It's understandable that entertainment is subjective, and something that one person finds enjoyable somebody else might not. This might be the reason why well made movies like this one are often not appreciated in their own time. The ironic thing here is that most of the reviewers who are calling it pretentious arthouse trash that is too deep for them to get are probably the same type to praise something like Eraserhead while these two movies have a number of similarities. Eraserhead is probably the only movie I can compare this one to, since both are black and white despite being made in the era of color technology, both make absolutely no sense, and both have a creepy, foreboding atmosphere. The movie is about two men who are stuck on some island in the late 1800s that has a lighthouse on it. One of the men is the lighthouse's keeper, and is obviously older and more experienced than the other guy. One day, the younger man is bothered by a seagull that only has one eye, but the keeper tells him not to kill it, believing the birds are reincarnated seamen. Eventually though, anger gets the better of him and he brutally beats the bird to death one day, and a huge storm hits the island afterwards, preventing them from leaving. The keeper's superstitions were correct. The movie has a nice and ominous feel to it, and without black and white, it probably wouldn't be as creepy. The acting of the two men is also incredible, and you can see how they start to lose their minds after being on the island for so long. The movie doesn't really make any sense, and the ending will leave almost everyone confused, but there's so many nice shots and strange things throughout that I can call it a modern classic.",The Lighthouse
140,sweidman-28016,Hopefully Will Become a Classic Someday,9,5 November 2019,"The Lighthouse Review:The Lighthouse is a hypnotic and hallucinatory tale of two lighthouse keepers, Willem DaFoe and Robert Pattinson, on a remote and mysterious New England island in the 1890s. As their stay at the lighthouse grows longer and longer, they start their decent into madness. Robert Eggers is just a visionary when it comes to making films. His last was the amazing horror-drama film The Witch. It won so many awards and had many nominations, yet never received any nominations from the Academy or the Globes. Just based on that their was no wya this could be anything less than great. Once the credits began, I couldn't believe he outdid his masterpiece. Eggers just did something special to this. He created an absurd atmosphere that worked well and made it endlessly entertaining. The beginning of the film starts a rising action right from the start. There's a shot of the two starting into the camera for an elongated period of time with a dark and angry look in their eyes. Right after there's a shot of the boat sailing away from them so basically they're separated from all reality and sanity, at least that's what I got out of it. The mystery of what's happening to them actually and figuring out if what they're seeing is real or not drives the story. With the strange happenings throughout, the tone sort of changes frequently, but in a good way. Surprisingly this film was pretty funny. Eggers wasn't afraid to throw in jokes and just funny situations throughout the duration of the film. I thought Willem DaFoe was pretty funny. Also, GIVE THAT MAN AN OSCAR RIGHT NOW! There's no question that he's had the best male performance I've seen all year. I never thought once that his character was played by an actor. DaFoe has just been on a role lately with acting and I think he just had his career defining performance. I just loved his voice. It was hard to understand them at points because the language was different back then and their voices were low, but it added to the realness of the performances and the story. Robert Pattinson also has a very strong performance. It's on par with his role another A24 film, Good Time. I would consider Pattinson the lead and DaFoe the supporting actor since the story is mainly shown through Pattinson. I'm just shocked that not as many people are talking about him as they should. His expression is just really good and sets the tone well. I'm just going to keep going back to tone since it really interested me throughout. Mark Korven's score is so good. I noticed it a lot in a good way. Sometimes scores can be overbearing and over the top but this was perfect for how it was. There's a sound of some machine in the lighthouse that blares constantly throughout and it's really an annoying sound, but that helped make the audience feel the story with them. Right for the start it's annoying and I felt almost like losing my mind the more I heard it. The characters, more Pattinson, loathe that sound so I'm pretty sure it's intentional. The aspect ratio is really cool. It's in a 1.19:1 ratio (nobody would really get this unless you are into this sort of stuff) so it's basically a square and looks like how old films and tv shows were, but smaller. It captured the era, though there weren't TVs or stuff like that, and just was really a great idea. I could feel the claustrophobic atmosphere just by looking at the screen. It was also grainy and black and white, I love that and once again captured the era and all of that. The set was just marvelous inside and outside of the lighthouse. I haven't seen a simplified set this good in so long. I don't know if it was visual effects or something, but the background looked sort of fake and blurred which added to the surreal atmosphere. I could just talk about all of this stuff for a long time. The only problem I really had was there was a short period where it slowed down, but that's it. The Lighthouse is brilliant and I hope it will someday be considered a classic. People may or may not like it since there's some analysis to be taken into consideration. I'd definitely recommend it and I hope it's considered with the awards season.My Grade: A",The Lighthouse

143,HEFILM,Actor's scene study but not a movie,3,26 October 2019,"If you've ever taken an acting class where the instructor gives the actors some thin idea and then two actors go on about 4 times longer than is interesting--well that's the flaw in this film.The two actors are good, Pattinson better than I thought possible, maybe even great but how much drunker can you get? How much crazier can you get?That's all a good part of this story is about. There isn't any development just another scene just like the one before, two guys in a barely illuminated room getting drunk and babbling, just like the previous scene that lasted 7 minutes and just ended was.The film feels like it's 2 and a half hours long. This is a misfire from a promising director. People argued if his previous film, The Witch, was really a horror film people may argue if this is even a movie.I saw it opening night. The audience was small, two women walked out about ten minutes from the end.Neither actor really has a character to play just a type and in lessor acting hands it would have all been even worse. Around the edges of the, 2 guys in a room being drunk and crazy sequences, there is moody B and W, purposely narrow framed atmosphere, The music and sound design are well done.There are few real supernatural visuals and of these I just say, more mermaid please.I guess it's more like THE LOST WEEKEND on an island than an island based supernatural story, just don't expect much in the way of story and gobs of exposition and talk talk talk, a movie that doesn't show and just tells.It has various gross out bits that the director avoided in his first film and also lacks an ending--instead opting for film schoolish ambiguity and feels much much longer than it is. Slow and steady becomes laborious and also frankly though its visual tricks are impressive at first they really don't develop much and the lack of color also weighs the film down, though really the script is what just isn't there.It feels like it's written by the two brothers while on cocaine, lots of focus on details that don't add up, energetic over-concentration on small details and no perception of anything else. No building momentum exists to bring it all off as a story of as a feature film. A few bits of intentionally dark humor get lost in the general grime as do the few vivid Lovecraftian tentacles. Really a let down this film is.",The Lighthouse
144,ethanbresnett,Weird but in a good way (I think),9,19 March 2020,"I just don't know about this film. Is it worth an 8, a 5, a 10? Depending on which sort of mood you catch me in it could be any one of them, but I settled on a rating of 8.The acting was always incredible with two vivid, jarring, haunting and powerful performances from Dafoe and Pattinson. I'll be honest I wasn't entirely sure what they were talking about for the most part, yet somehow it was still engaging. I couldn't take my eyes off what was happening in front of me.There wasn't necessarily too much in the way of plot. At times The Lighthouse felt more like a collection of short scenes than one cohesive and connected story. This was partly intended I'm sure to mirror the way that the two men descended into madness, giving the whole film a feeling of being one long fever dream. Some people may really like this, but for me it ended up resulting in a lack of purpose and direction for the film.The ending of the film was somehow simultaneously predictable yet confusing. I was left feeling slightly unsatisfied, but also content. The Lighthouse will leave you feeling lots of contrasting emotions I'm sure.One thing that can't be disputed about The Lighthouse is the atmosphere and tone, cultivated through sublime direction and cinematography. The film looks incredible and is uniquely haunting, with the decision to film in black and white with the retro aspect ratio really paying off.The Lighthouse is bizarre, haunting, confusing, wild... a lot to digest. Perhaps what I enjoyed most about it is that I don't know what to make of it and therefore will be thinking about it for a while yet.

147,SkullScreamerReturns,Creative but a bit too abstract lightmadhouse,4,7 May 2021,"Well, this was at least something different. The Lighthouse surely is quite original and I understand if some people love the visual style and atmosphere. But also if some will find it unpleasant and too strange.What I first noticed is the picture aspect ratio. It's shaped like in old tv's, almost like a square. I found this detail both creative and annoying, feeling as if something is blocking the view. Also the characters and the setting made me feel uncomfortable, almost depressing in the beginning. I thought the whole film is going to be just a pain to watch.Then I started to enjoy a bit because the characters started to unfold a bit and the acting was so good. I loved the weird rants and monologues the characters occasionally threw against each other. That was the best aspect of the film. And Willem Dafoe is a perfect face for a bearded old sailor! (Perfectly creepy that is.) And of course the visual side was quite nice. The lighthouse in black and white gave quite eerie feel, and the directing camerawork was quite good.The weakest part was maybe the story. Is there a story? Does it mean anything? I didn't really understand the ending which was a bit disappointing. More than a traditional story the whole movie was more like an abstract series of scenes. I was also deceived a bit because I expected a horror film. Well, it can be vaguely put into the category of psychological horror/thriller but even that feels a bit stretch. I'd say it's just a weird artistic psychological (supernatural) drama or something.Not entirely my cup of tea but I some give credit for trying something wildly creative.",The Lighthouse

149,gsygsy,Outstanding,9,7 December 2019,"It's easy to confuse originality and novelty. This entirely original film is built on what's already out there: tropes, images, myths and legends about sailors and the sea. Writer-brothers Robert and Max Eggers have created from this scavenging exercise a strong and simple tale of two mismatched lighthouse keepers, cut off from the outside world while on a month's tour of duty on an island somewhere off the North-East Atlantic shore.The film is amazingly atmospheric, superbly served by its design team and cinematographer, working with monochrome and a non-standard aspect ratio. Editing (Louise Ford) and direction (Robert Eggers) are simiarly faultless.The relationship between the two ""wickies"" is the centre of the film. Fortunately, one of them is played by Willem Dafoe. He is a great actor, whose trademark intensity is reinforced here by a fearlessness that can only come with a strong theatrical background. His commanding delivery of some extraordinarily dense and florid language is quite something to experience.His acting partner here is Robert Pattinson. No one can seriously suggest that he and Mr Dafoe are on an equal footing. For the first hour or so, Mr Pattinson's lack of depth is not a hindrance. But the second hour requires a different gear. To my amazement, he upped his game. This could be because he couldn't help but do so in the presence of such an artist as Willem Dafoe. Or perhaps Robert Eggers is, amongst his other talents, a fine director of actors. I think it more likely that even second-rate actors can be brilliant when their characters have to go to the extremes that are required here. Whatever the reason, Pattinson rises to the occasion, especially in the astonishing final 20 minutes of the film. If the experience stays with him and he manages to hold on to some of the discoveries he's made here, he may go on to be worthy of the challenges he's taken on in a career that has gone out of its way to play against his pretty-boy looks.To sum up, an outstanding film in every respect.",The Lighthouse
150,TwistedContent,I Was Left In Pieces,10,3 December 2019,"If there's an Aster or Eggers movie coming out, I'm in for it all - rarely have I been as excited for a movie as I was for months for ""The Lighthouse"". It took a while to be able to see it where I live, and when I finally did, I was blown away, thrown into the void, left in pieces. ""The Lighthouse"" is a unique and truly maddening experience, quite possibly a masterpiece in regards of acting and directing. It's also a tough one to discuss - this is not an easy review to write, I can tell You that much.""The Lighthouse"" is a tale of two lighthouse keepers, living in isolation on a small far-away island, inspired by a true story of two welsh lighthouse keepers stranded on such an island during a storm back in the year of 1801, as well as by an unfinished story by Edgar Allan Poe and the atmospheric works by H. P. Lovecraft and Algernon Blackwood. It's filmed in a style that resembles the films of early 20th century, using custom built cameras, modified with authentic lenses and adjusted technology pieces from the 1930's - as far as the technicalities behind this movie go, it's an impressive effort, I can only suggest reading up about it. The stories behind the filming processes of ""The Lighthouse"" are exquisitly interesting - let's just say that the real Pattinson and real Daffoe met three months after the filming.I always enjoy the many infinite ways madness / going insane / mental trials and tribulations can and are portrayed in movies, particularly in the flexible and no-borders-needed horror genre. ""The Lighthouse"" might just be the most terrifying example I've seen so far. Admiteddly, there's not much of a story, a plot in its more classical sense, but I feel like there was no place for anything else. It would've been a different movie in that case. I can't even begin to describe the way Eggers makes the movie flow, the way he unravels each tick of degrading sanity. Eggers goes beyond the general, routine borders, breaking conventional boundaries by succesfully combining disturbing horror with dreadful and sneaky psychodrama and seasoning it with sharp absurdist comedy. The result is a devious piece of art that'll crawl under your skin before you know it.And it's also the buddy movie of the year - when was the last time there was such a powerful, electrifying duo anywhere? And they're almost literally the only faces in ""The Lighthouse"". A day ago I was sure that Joaquin Phoenix owns the performance of the year, now I'm questioning myself heavily. It's a shame Daffoe and/or Pattinson probably won't get nominated for an Oscar, I just don't believe it - simply because of the nature of this movie. I desperately want to be wrong about that, I do. Both Daffoe and Pattinson were ridiculously amazing, hypnotising performances, the kind to be remembered. The range of emotions explored is oh so wide. There's something uncannily authentic about the portraits of these wickies.For a modern person with a modern mind ""The Lighthouse"" might not be very appealing visually, the aspect ratio is practically a square, it's black'n'white, and, apart from some modern cinematography tricks, it really does look exactly like the movies of the 30's - I watched 1933's ""The Invisible Man"" just a day before. It's an impressive feat & an atmosphere-filling choice of style, the gloom can be felt on the skin. There's not one complaint I can speak about. The sound design fits the movie like a glove as well, the original score is composed by Mark Corven, who also is the author of the extremely spooky and awesome score for Eggers's previous feature ""The Witch"". As I was going home after ""The Lighthouse"", I listened to the entirety of its score, it was the only remedy right then and there. Every technicality and every aesthetical choice is just another perfect ingredient for the madness we experience.There's no doubt in my heart that out of the 73 horror movies of 2019 that I've seen ""The Lighthouse"" is the number one, with Aster's ""Midsommar"" being a close second. To sum this all up, the main thing I want to say is this: If you have a chance of seeing ""The Lighthouse"", just do it. My rating: 10/10.",The Lighthouse

Very arthouse. So, if the word 'pretentious' leaves you cold leave The Lighthouse by the only exit, downstairs centre.Robert Pattinson (an increasingly accomplished actor) and Willem Dafoe ( a criminally underrated performer) perform two-man psychological warfare as they set sale, in the fog, to the 19th century eponymous structure.Silent and brooding, the two take a good 15 minutes to utter a word to each other and even then only grudgingly. Dafoe, the old hand and the extremely domineering boss, and Pattinson, the new charge on his first tour of duty, play a curmudgeonly duo (think Steptoe and Son, but without the laughs) that only gradually begin to come to terms with one another when their hooch starts to flow.Pattinson has a secret to hide, Dafoe is just a bullying old git that gets his rocks off on the rock by exposing himself to the lighthouse lens deep into the night. Meanwhile, Pattinson fantasises about mermaids.Gradually it unravels as the hooch takes hold and it becomes a battle of wits and strength between the two, the prize unknown and the purpose unclear.As a vicious storm takes hold it's uncertain as to whether they will ever leave the rock, let alone alive.Shot in gorgeous black and white in an interesting square format (think Son of Saul and Grand Budapest Hotel) it's a beautiful experience, albeit pretty grim.It's clearly not going to be of universal interest and I felt it outstayed its welcome a little, but it's an interesting cinematic (not TV) experience and I'd recommend it with strong caveats.",The Lighthouse

With each fall or injury, the steering helps a lot in this aggravation, but it is still a great performance, Willem Dafoe is also great, as always, the actor makes a grumpy and mysterious old man, the actor disappears in the midst of his character and frightens with Their performance and especially the wonderful execution of their monologues and phrases, both actors, despite the strong competition this year, deserve an Oscar nomination.The director's new feature film ""The Witch"" has many hits and similarities to his latest film, such as the geographic isolation and cover-up of the monster itself, the creation of suspense through the track and direction is also present, but we have negative points. , such as the difficulty of objectivity in delimiting the concept of his horror film, since we only come to an understanding - even if it is not clear - after the end of the film, another point is the comic relief that sometimes breaks all the narrative mood, finally, ""The Lighthouse"" is good, has great direction and acting and if we press with a cosmic horror, is one of the best of its kind, but we still get a feeling that the movie could be better if it had less execution issues.

157,jamiedarlow-37510,I came out of this one.... not knowing what to think!,6,23 February 2020,"Two lightkeepers (Willem Dafoe and Robert Pattinson) journey to a remote island with an ominous lighthouse at its centre. Their job is to generally house keep and maintain the standards of the building over the following 4 weeks. Over this time, they get to know each other and each others sanity is severely questioned the longer they spend in isolation. That's essentially the plot in a nutshell but what makes the film tick is the character interactions and the atmosphere. There were a couple of times I caught myself tensing my shoulders so hard just from the effect the atmosphere oozing from the film has on the viewer; it's a visually and auditory mesmerising piece with disturbing psychological content accompanied really well by its square box ratio presentation, black and white pallet and beautiful performances. Dafoe and Pattinson are both incredible here. Much like writer/Director Robert Eggers' previous film The Witch, it's certainly unusual and has powerful sequences although admittedly I did feel a little disappointed in places due to the hype surrounding the movie. It felt as though there wasn't enough focus on the mariner mythology aspect which is really interesting whenever it arises but never delivers on a payoff. I appreciate the cinematography and the acting and the filmmaking passion behind the film but I wouldn't necessarily watch it again as I felt it does get a little too pretentious at times. However, it's still a good film in terms of its eerie style and it's also surprisingly funny! The interactions between the two leads had me giggling out loud in places and some of the dialogue, particularly in a great monologue delivered by Dafoe, is masterful. And the ending is just wonderfully insane",The Lighthouse

159,fciocca,An uncomfortable descent into madness.,7,20 October 2021,"""The Lighthouse"" depicts the descent into madness of two lightkeepers, as they are stranded on an island. They are supposed to stay there for four weeks, but due to some storm, they are obliged to remain, with little to no rations nor water. Robert Eggers escalated the movie slowly, but effectively.The cinematography is stunning, the 1.19:1 aspect ratio represents amazingly the sense of claustrophobia and hopelessness that the protagonists feel. Visuals are extremely compelling: the black and white style and the lighting reminded me of a proper old school film. Willem Dafoe is amazing in his performance and he always had my undivided attention. The guy was completely dedicated to the role and he was fantastic. For sure one of his best interpretations in recent years. Robert Pattinson was good, this was a really demanding and taxing job to pull off. I am happy that he was able to do it, at the age of only 32, at the time. The plot is straightforward, with basically no room for personal interpretation. I liked that the director and screenwriters did not over-complicate the script and kept it simple. My only complaint about this film is its length. The story is very thin and there was just not enough material for two hours. It could have worked better if it was around an hour and a half; maybe something from the second act could have been cut out from the final release.Overall I feel that the praise for ""The Lighthouse"" is deserved. It is not for everyone and I understand why someone might not be particularly fond of it. It is so different than the average film nowadays, but if you are searching for something different, or you are a cinema lover, you might find this interesting.",The Lighthouse
160,DeBBss,Pretty Good...,8,28 September 2020,"The lighthouse is such a strange ride to experience in my opinion. It's obvious that the filmmakers wanted the audience to feel the same way as Ephraim Winslow/Thomas Howard (the main character), and they achieved that perfectly. The editing was extremely good when you really think about it. The film feels fragmented at times and it does such a service to what the movie is about.The plot is very simple, as this is a film about characters and human nature. The acting was some of the best I've ever seen. The Lighthouse is easily a top 5 film when it comes to the acting alone. The vocal performances is what made the acting so amazing, and although you can understand what Willem Dafoe is saying, you could at least appreciate the realism and effort. Ironically, The Lighthouse didn't win any Oscars when it came to the acting.The Lighthouse is definitely one of the more strange movies to come out in 2019, but it was it a great experience. Watching the two characters slowly go mad was interesting to say the least. But I just find it insane that The Lighthouse didn't win too many acting nominations or wins.",The Lighthouse
161,jayjaycee,To kill a seabird,8,2 December 2020,"""The Lighthouse"" is a 2019 horror drama directed by Robert Eggers starring Robert Pattinson and Willem Dafoe.
⚪
All in all, Robert Eggers' second directorial work intriguingly illuminates the shady abysses and the ever-growing insanity of two men exposed to isolation, extreme weather conditions and hard work, and thanks to an nauseatingly unsettling direction, an utterly creepy cinematography, eerie sounds as well as two powerful leading performances by Dafoe and Pattinson, it becomes a disturbingly hypnotic and unsettlingly surreal tale that is as deep and dark as the roaring sea itself, even if it might not scuttle everyone.
⚪
Even though I personally know many people who heavily disliked Robert Eggers' two-thousand fifteen directorial debut ""The VVitch"" with Anya Taylor-Joy, I surprisingly ended up loving it, because despite its slow pace and dragging narration, it offered fine suggestive horror that deprived me of sleep for many days. Yes, I was fond of it a lot, hence I was accordingly stoked for the director's subsequent project. My best friend, who was so generous to gift me his Blu-Ray, has seen it and called it one of the weirdest films he has ever seen, and since I knew that it was an A24 production, his reaction was comprehensible, but as I famously love most of the titles of the independent production company for their oddly experimental approaches, I knew I was in for a ride. As I expected it no differently, the film was exactly what I thought it was gonna be, in other words, unconventional brilliance. While his debut thematised the possible existence of witches in New England during the time of the pilgrims, this one depicts the spiritual journeys of two lighthouse guards whose minds increasingly more fall prey to insanity, isolation and resentment in the nineteen-hundred-nineties. I recently heard someone saying that ""Portrait Of A Lady On Fire"" is what happens when two women are left on a deserted island, while Eggers' parable depicts what takes place when two men are left on their own, and even if this joke draws on gender roles, it made me chuckle cause to some degree it is oddly true. Céline Sciamma's wonderful romance is all harmonious and civilized, while Eggers' feature is a pure horror trip, a nasty descent into the deepest depths of madness. Seriously, this film is crazy from start to finish. Pattinson and Dafoe play a lighthouse keeper and his foreman, respectively, and the unlikely couple are a key element to why this film works out so well. First, who is more than Edward Cullen or Cedric Diggory, performs splendidly and does an undeniably great job, but in direct comparison to the storm of a performance that his co-star displays, he looks like an amateur. However, I think that both (especially latter!) where tremendously snubbed at the Oscars, for what they show here is nothing short of terrific acting. Their relationship, employee and employer, is defined by a constantly fluctuating mix of sympathy and antipathy, and that is what makes the whole film so unpredictable. When it seems like they get along easily in one, the next scene makes it seem like they are going to kill each other immediately. The more time passes, the more insane the film becomes. Hard work, extreme weather conditions and, most importantly, isolation, change the men and affects them deeply. While it is fairly civilized in the beginning, when they work in shifts, eat together and do their jobs in quiet, unforeseen events change the course of the film tremendously. Originally, they are supposed to guard the lighthouse for four weeks, but as no ship can arrive due to the storm, they are literally stranded. Seriously, after that the movie becomes indescribably surreal and utterly intriguing. The black and white cinematography as well as the bleak scenery make for a constant feeling of distress, and when the sounds, namely a frequently blaring foghorn, come into play as well, it becomes unsettlingly hypnotic. Not only a sequence in which Dafoe hobblingly chases his co-star with an axe, but also the gloomy symbiosis of visuals and acoustics are highly reminiscent of Stanley Kubrick, and even if is not always the case, the master's influences are palpable and go along wonderfully with Eggers' own directorial style. After a time, with the madness still increasing, mostly thanks to excessive consumption of alcohol, the film loses grip from reality completely, and makes no sense at all, but in a positive way. How long have they been on this rock? What is true about what they tell each other? Who is who and who killed whom? Are they even alive? I asked myself questions like these, and couldn't really answer them at all, but I think this is one of film's pivotal elements. You experience the disorientation and insanity of the characters yourself and lose your mind completely as well. In some weird way, it becomes funny too, but isn't there something hilarious about madness? Well, furthermore, the film also displays an abstract symbolism that underlines its odd nature even more. From mermaid fantasies that resemble the abstinence of the protagonist to Thomas' tentacles that stand for the way he oppresses his colleague, there are many little details, but one central metaphor stands out completely: the light. Thomas doesn't allow Winslow to see it all, but after the balance of power changes in the favour of the latter, he sees it in the end is dazzled by it. However, the viewer doesn't get to see it, only the effect it has on the characters. What is it, then? Well, in my opinion the whole story extremely resembles the legend of Prometheus, the man who thought he could put himself over the gods. In a nutshell, Prometheus is a titan who thinks that the humans are under his control, and after Zeus takes the fire away from them, the titan later on decides to steal it back from the gods and give it back to his people. After that, he is punished by Zeus, when he is chained on a rock where an eagle frequently eats his liver that magically regenerates itself over the time, so that he has to endure this torture for all eternity. In some way, I think that Winslow is a promethean character: he wants to see the light, defeats the one he is subjected to and in the end, we even see how seagulls eat his guts. Prometheus is an ambiguous character, because on one hand he is a hero for bringing back the fire, on the other hand he is an arrogant being who, influenced by his hybris, thinks that he can fool gods, and eventually pays for his haughtiness. I think, in an abstract way, this applies to the character Winslow in many aspects. He thinks that he can fool Thomas, the one who stands above him, to see the light that, in my opinion, is probably a direct connection to the gods himself, but since he is a mortal and unable to comprehend what he sees, he is banned from the light, what explains him falling down the stairs and ending up as seagull food. In the end, this feature is a typical A24 production that knows to entertain in an unconventional but nevertheless effective way, because it is an intensive horror trip that knows to disturb as well as to be thought-provoking. It's a film where mythology meats reality and surrealism, and even if it is not everyone's mix, I found it extremely dazzling and breathtakingly packing, even epical at times. Considering that many of the dialogues where inspired or taken from original logs from that time, I really don't wanna know what of what I have seen has in fact taken place. Indeed, an insane an surreal gem.",The Lighthouse

Director: Robert Eggers
Starring: Robert Pattinson and Willem Defoe
Overall rating 92/100The lighthouse focuses on the characters of Thomas Howard ( Robert Pattinson and Thomas Wake (Willem Defoe) as they try and keep their sanity whilst being stranded on an island with a lighthouse. Their relationship will be tested, and the lighthouse isn't as normal as it seems. Wow what an experience this film was. It might not be everyone's cup of tea but from an artistic perspective it's one of the most interesting films I have ever seen let's talk about this more in detail.First of all the films cinematography and soundtrack was some of the best I have seen. Wow this films soundtrack was really exceptional. The film did a really effective job at repeating the same noises for effect but they somehow. The use of the horn from the lighthouse got louder and louder the more tense the film got. This was used really effectively and did a great job at making you feel on edge and uncomfortable so therefore setting up and achieving this fantastic tone throughout the film. Also, the films cinematography was truly fantastic. Making the stylistic choice to make the whole movie in black and white was a really bold and interesting decision. But it really payed off. So, when there a scene of strong gore it made it more effective as it clashed with the black. And the films use of the curse from the lighthouse with the mermaid/siren was really effective at making the film scary and uncomfortable.Next the film was also fairly funny and had good character development. The film actually managed to balance the two tones of humour and horror very well. Both Willem and Robert had great comedic chemistry. As you got to dive deep into what life living so close to each other every day is really life the dynamic between the both of them was very interesting. As Willem Defoe's character had bad toilet habits and when they got drunk together at the start it worked really well as you got to see the fun side of there characters a little bit more. And the film had a good amount of character development. Due to there only being two characters they had more time to flesh out both of the characters which they managed to do fairly well. You got to understand both of there lives and why they decided to stay on the lighthouse. You got to find out about Willem Dafoe's character love life and reasoning behind the collapse of his marriage, and you also got to understand about Robert Pattinson's character and how he has never stuck at a job for very long so the 6 weeks at the lighthouse was the perfect job for him. And they just got to really flesh out both of the characters personalities and how they changed throughout the film, especially with Robert Pattinson's character.Next the film executed its disturbing imagery very well and it had a excellent building of tension throughout as well. The film managed to somehow make a lighthouse seem the most terrifying and intimidating place to be. They also managed to balance out the fantasy/curse side of the plot very well with disturbing imagery of mermaids/sirens constant use of gulls and claustrophobic situations. As the film progressed the imagery got more and more frequent and disturbing which made you feel more and more tense throughout. Talking about how tense it was that they did an excellent job at building the tension throughout. As both of the characters descended further and further into madness throughout the film just got more and more uncomfortable and frightening to watch, so the director showed a true talent here at building and developing characters and increasing the amount of fear as the film progresses.My only two negatives would be the slight pacing issues and the overcomplicated plot in places. I would say that there was a short period of time about halfway through were they decided to focus more on the scenery of the lighthouse and the characters reactions instead of the increased imagery. This made the narrative slightly clunky for a little while but it was soon sorted so didn't affect me to much but it did stop the film from getting a score in the high 90's. And also I would say that the films plot did get slightly overcomplicated towards the end. It got slightly difficult to figure out who was the actual good and bad guy as both of the characters descended into madness. Due to both of there names being Thomas it just became slightly confusing as to who the characters were talking about. I got roughly what was going on but I wasn't completely understanding what was going on.However, my final two positives have to be the phenomenal performances from Willem Defoe and Robert Pattinson. Willem Defoe was truly fantastic. He showed huge amounts of diversity with his acting. As he managed to portray all sides of his character in the most believable and realistic way possible which made the film even more disturbing as I don't think it would of worked as well if they didn't have as good actors. But my biggest surprise was Robert Pattinson. Due to me only seeing him in Harry Potter and Twilight. I was slightly sceptical as to whether he would hold his own against Defoe. But I was completely proven wrong. He somehow managed to portray an even more believable and realistic portrayal of madness they Willem did. With a truly disturbing, exciting and thrilling performance that makes me excited for his future films.Overall despite the pacing and the plot not being consistently fleshed out or used effectively. The lighthouse is one of the most disturbing experiences I have had with a film in a good way. With some of the best uses of sound, cinematography and acting I have seen.",The Lighthouse

165,Coffee_in_the_Clink,"""Why'd ye spill yer beans?""",10,3 February 2020,"Every once in a while a movie comes along that just knocks you down and leaves you feeling drained and exhilarated. Robert Eggers's ""The Lighthouse"" is that kind of movie. It is sheer brilliance on every scale and in every department, from the haunting, gorgeous cinematography to the magnum opus performances from Willem Dafoe and Robert Pattinson. Every scene is like a page from the finest works of literature in that it demands attention and may require further viewings to truly appreciate. From the foreboding opening scene of the lighthouse coming into view, accompanied by an amazing, eerie score and the menacing sound effects of the foghorn, to the disturbing and horrific final scene, ""The Lighthouse"" gets a hold of you and does not let go, not even after the end credits roll.Robert Pattinson and Willem Dafoe are two lighthouse workers who arrive on an isolated island off the North American coast to begin a four-week stint. Pattinson is the junior man and a drifter who has only recently joined the job. Dafoe is the sea-weathered old dog who speaks in riddles and tells tall tales of sailor legends and superstitions, Ancient Mariner style. When a storm hits, and the pair settle in waiting for relief that might not come for months, they drink hooch and start to go insane.Eggers displays phenomenal and exceptional skill in creating this film. I only recently watched his debut film ""The Witch"", which garnered him much acclaim, and I've come to the view that he has a fine directorial talent in getting the very best, and more, out of his actors. The black and white photography, on a 1.19:1 aspect ration that Eggers chose to film on (this is the way films from the 1920s were done) is absolutely perfect, and was a critical component in generating the unique atmosphere that the film achieved. I don't throw the word masterpiece around much, but that is exactly what ""The Lighthouse"" is. It is a crazy, exhilarating two hours where the lines of reality and horror are bent and blended, before we are left with a snapshot of the human mind that shows how vulnerable and prone to madness it is, once you take away the thin foundations that sustain it.",The Lighthouse

The dialogues, especially Defoe's are rich in antiquated English and may not be easily decipherable without subtitles.

Willem Dafoe and Robert Pattinson shine as the lighthouse keepers who endure the torment of solitude and familiarity in their oppressive encroachment. Dafoe plays the gruff, oddball elder who harasses and cajoles the sully and withdrawn Pattinson as the two men tolerate each other in the middle of nowhere. Pushed toward the breaking point, the protagonists drag each other to a tragic fate that's as bizarre as it is unreal. Long and slow, one can imagine being one of the unfortunates in that secluded hell as the boredom piles up. A strange character study on humans placed in situations that tests them to their limit this film will appeal to few but should be of interest to art house fans and those with a little more adventurous and open minded appreciation of the arts.",The Lighthouse

From the way the film was shot and the incredible music and sound mixing this is one of the best films of the year. Shot in black and white and in an odd, squared projection the film immediately felt foreign and different. It only gets more and more uneasy as the cast of Wilem Dafoe and Robbert Pattinson give stellar and flawless performances.This was a stylistic bombardment and a cinematic experience, the film sucks you in, chews you and spits you back out as audiences are mesmerised and stuck in the world of the film. As the main characters slowly descend into conflict and madness, as an audience you feel that saem slow descent, with obscure shots and an air of untrustworthy characters stumble about on the screen.This film is not for everyone as it is blakc and white and it does take some very obscure turns that could be a turn off for some. But I don't believe The lighthouse was being pretentious, but really just trying to create an engaging and surrounding film that evokes feelings of anxiety, and if audiences are willing to give it a shot they definitely should, it has great performances, is visually interesting and has an ambiguous ending that would leave viewers contemplating its true meaning for years to come.",The Lighthouse

184,danybur,A pretentious and failed tale,5,24 July 2021,"Summary:Beyond the beauty of certain images and the successful interpretations of its protagonists (particularly of Pattinson, a character with more nuances), The Lighthouse is a pretentious and unsuccessful bet from the narrative and dramatic point of view, since it does not achieve grow its exalted characters and convincingly escalate the conflict between them, or, in any case, does not make them interesting.A film that is nothing more than the sum of its parts and leaves us without understanding what Eggers was up to with it.Review:Old lighthouse keeper Thomas Wake (Willem Dafoe) and his temporary assistant Ephraim Winslow arrive at a remote New England island at the end of the 19th century to operate its lighthouse for four weeks. The coexistence between the two will be conflictive from the start.Faced with certain films, I sometimes wonder what the director set out to tell or show me. In general, the answer comes spontaneously and I don't even ask myself the question. I understand that, like any artistic product, every film, in one way or another, contains a message and embodies an objective of its author. And I confess that in El Faro I have not found the answers to these questions.From the beginning, the film poses a severe conflict between a despotic Wake who owns the place and subjects Winslow to harsh and even humiliating maintenance tasks and a Winslow who decides to abide by and understands that those four weeks will have to be spent as best he can. This conflictive relationship (with its ups and downs), obviously accentuated by forced coexistence, absolute isolation and inclement weather, is adorned with elements between dreamlike and fantastic, with a fairly obvious marine symbolism, which supposedly should pay a dramatic crescendo and enrich the description of their characters and their motivations. But no.The director and co-writer Robert Eggers chose to shoot his film in black and white (perhaps to reinforce the period atmosphere and an expressionist aesthetic) and with a square screen format, thinking that it would return the most oppressive and claustrophobic story. But no.Dafoe's character is expressed many times with philippic theatricals. The final titles clarify that the dialogues are inspired by texts from that period, from Melville (Wake is an explicitly Melvillian character) and lighthouse keepers' diaries and especially from the work of the novelist and short story writer from the second half of the 19th century Sarah Orno Jewett.I can't help but relate this film to Antichrist by Lars von Trier (precisely also with Defoe), also a story about the isolation of two people, but the results of which are much more terrifying.Beyond the beauty of certain images and the successful interpretations of its protagonists (particularly of Pattinson, a character with more nuances), The Lighthouse is a pretentious and unsuccessful bet from the narrative point of view, since it fails to make it grow convincingly its exalted characters and the conflict between them.A film that is nothing more than the sum of its parts and leaves us, ultimately, without understanding what Eggers was up to with it.",The Lighthouse

186,daniewhite-1,The Lowlife,6,14 February 2020,"The Lighthouse contains two speaking parts and focuses necessarily on two performances portraying two ramshackle and uncomfortable characters.'The Lighthouse' is utterly unlike the writer-director's previous feature film, 'The Witch' despite sharing historical and horror genres as well as the same creative font.In 'The Witch' location, sets, props, costumes, sound effects, dialogues and indeed animals are materially vital construction blocks for the films entire folk horror dramatas.In 'The Lighthouse' these physical aspects are of almost utter inconsequence in and of themselves; they serve as totemic maguffins only, serving the film to arrive at a situation whereby two men share in prolonged, isolated, confined, proximity to each other, to foster an 'inner psychology' thriller/horror in the ""two men alone in the woods"" narrative.Essentially a one trick ""cabin fever"" men going mad off of each other. Physically and metaphysically ""bouncing off each other"".This is developed within a film which is stylistically deceptive in that it vehemently insists upon the historicity of it's cinematic form: aspect ratio, b/w film, vintage camera/lenses/lighting whilst being utterly unconcerned with the physicality of the forms captured therein and thereby.I found that the two performances were uncomplimentary and actually often undercut and undersold each other in many scenes. I had the impression that the two actors did not actually form a cohesive and collaborative team. Whether the direction, the scripting or the casting, or all three are at blame I am unsure but recasting or re-writing would have enhanced the effect of the film.Willem Defoe in particular appeared to be acting ""the method"" and at times he wasn't acting by pretending he was acting by actually doing and I believe that neither the director nor his co-star adapted successfully to this.Overall I liked much of the technical artifice and vision contained with 'The Lighthouse' and some moments of black comedy added greatly to my enjoyment.I rate a 6/10 and I genuinely have a mixed reaction to this feature. I would recommend only hesitantly to interested genre fans but not to general horror or film fans.Personally I quite enjoyed 'The Lighthouse', within a broader disappointment, formed by my own elevated expectations; but I will not be a repeat viewer I expect.",The Lighthouse

189,dakjets,Claustrophobic and intense movie with amazing actors,8,28 February 2020,"This movie has received great reviews. And it is not without reason. Still, I have some objections. To start with what is extraordinary: Willem Dafoe and Robert Pattinson. The fact that Dafoe is a character actor is not surprising, given the many accomplishments he made in his long career. More exciting and surprising was the fact that Robert Pattinson also makes a fantastic performance in this film. Without these two, their efforts and compelling acting, this movie would not have worked as well as it does. Impressive and also unusual. The two are the only ones to play the roles in this dark, and claustrophobic story. Filmed in black and white, in narrow canvas, one really feels the atmosphere these two experience, left to themselves on an island with a lighthouse. Without the possibility of contact with others.When I still have objections, it is about a standstill in history. This is a psychological drama, and the main characters' state of mind and ability are put to great test. Nevertheless, there is something stagnant and one-dimensional about what is happening. As the movie progresses. But by all means, it's definitely worth a visit, and we should pay tribute to filmmakers like Rober Eggers who dare to challenge us with such stories and films in this format. For this is not easy entertainment, but demanding to watch. I bet Robert Pattinson's doors will be open after the feat he does as an actor in this gruesome and intense movie.",The Lighthouse
190,Bertaut,"A superbly made film about madness, isolation, alcohol, a cheesed-off one-eyed seagull, and farts",8,15 November 2020,"A manic fever dream fusing Greek mythology, Jungian psychology, and German Expressionism with Herman Melville and H.P. Lovecraft, The Lighthouse is about isolation, insanity, competitive masculinity, alcoholism, and farting. The second film from writer/director Robert Eggers, who exploded onto the scene with the masterful The VVitch: A New-England Folktale (2015), The Lighthouse was co-written with his brother, Max Eggers, and is very loosely based on the ""Smalls Lighthouse Tragedy"" (1801). A bizarre film in just about every way, from its glorious visual and aural design to its grandiose acting to its jet black humour to its wonderful ambiguity to its avenging angels/seagulls, if you thought The VVitch was somewhat inaccessible, then you'll most likely despise every second of The Lighthouse. However, if you favour the cerebral, difficult-to-define, and always slightly off-camera terror that was the foundational principle of The VVitch and films such as The Blair Witch Project (1999), The Babadook (2014), and The Wind (2018), or the oppressive dread of classic German Expressionist films such as Das Cabinet des Dr. Caligari (1920), Der müde Tod (1921), and Nosferatu, eine Symphonie des Grauens (1922), then you'll find much here to appreciate.In the late 1890s, Ephraim Winslow (Robert Pattinson) and Thomas Wake (Willem Dafoe) arrive on an outcropping off the coast of New England to begin their four-week rotation manning the lighthouse. The more experienced Wake assigns Winslow menial tasks such as cleaning the floors, emptying the chamber pots, oiling the gears in the basement etc., whilst he himself attends to the Fresnel lens, telling Winslow that he is never, ever to approach it. Although Winslow has some unnerving dreams, and is being pestered by a one-eyed seagull, the four weeks pass without too much incident. However, on the night before their relief is due, the wind suddenly changes, and the island is hit by a violent storm. The following morning, their ferry doesn't arrive, and with no way of contacting the mainland, the duo find themselves trapped.The first thing that jumps out at you in The Lighthouse is the aesthetic. The importance of Damian Volpe's incredible sound design is indicated immediately, as before we see anything, we hear the wind blowing and a foghorn rumbling in the distance. That horn is omnipresent throughout the film, and to say it gets under your skin is an understatement. You know the siren from the Silent Hill games that sounds right before the town transitions from the Real World to the Otherworld? Well, imagine that sound bellowing out every minute or so for an entire film. It's unsettling, it's disturbing, and it makes it impossible to ever really acclimate yourself to this strange milieu. There's only one sequence in which we don't hear the foghorn, the pivotal opening scene of the third act, and the silence is oppressive - it's one of those instances where you don't realise how loud something was until it suddenly goes quiet and you're left with a ringing in your ears.The sound design is matched by the stunning monochrome visuals. Working with cinematographer Jarin Blaschke, who also photographed The VVitch, Eggers shot The Lighthouse on 35mm black & white celluloid in the relatively unheard format of 1.19:1. This ratio was a transitional format that was only used briefly during the shift from silent cinema to sound (1926-1932). And that's exactly why Eggers and Blaschke chose it. Yes, they do match form to content insofar as the nearly square format traps the characters within the frame. Beyond that, however, this is a folktale, a fable from a by-gone age, so what better way to present that fable than by replicating the way the film would have looked had it been made during the early years of sound filmmaking? At the same time, although shot with modern cameras, Blaschke used period-specific Baltar lenses and an off-cyan filter to more accurately emulate the look of late 19th-century photography. Taken together, the black & white images, the square frame, the lens design, the patina, and the haunting sound design all work in glorious tandem to create the sense that the film is a disturbing artefact, an antique vestige from a different era, into whose very DNA dread has burrowed.One also has to praise Craig Lathrop's production design. The lighthouse used in the film wasn't an existing structure, but was custom-built to scale on Cape Forchu, an outcropping off the coast of Nova Scotia. However, you'd never know it. Most of the interiors were shot on soundstages, but all exteriors were shot on Forchu. And Lathrop has imbued every inch of the building, both inside and out, with an existentialist dread - from the industrial hell of the gears in the basement to the almost Eden like peace of the lantern room high above, from the cramped and crude bedroom to the squalid kitchen. Malevolence stalks every nook and cranny.Eggers also does something interesting with the narrative itself. I've seen some critics refer to Winslow and Wake as ""unreliable narrators"", and whilst such critics are on the right track, to call the characters narrators is, in strict narratological terms, inaccurate. Both characters are, in fact, focalisers - the world is filtered through their perspective, but they don't narrate. Indeed, although we shift from one character to the other, meaning there is a narrative presence at the extradigetic level, Eggers never leaves their perspective, nor does he present any kind of omniscient or overt heterodiegetic narration; we're imprisoned within their perspective for the duration of the film. Also important here is the use of ""fallible focalisation"". The story is one of madness, and it's abundantly clear that neither man is a reliable witness, so everything filtered through their perspective (i.e. the whole film) could be tainted or unreliable (which is why critics erroneously refer to them as unreliable narrators). As things begin to fall apart, this sense becomes ever more prevalent - for example, in an important scene near the end, we see Wake do something, and in the next scene, when Winslow confronts him about it, a confused Wake points out it was actually Winslow who did it. Is Wake lying? Is Winslow projecting his own actions onto his companion? Who exactly is misleading who here? It's a wonderful use of a defamiliarising technique which works to keep the audience constantly on edge and constantly second-guessing everything they see insofar as we know that some, none, or all of it could be the figment of a failing mind.The film's storyline is slight enough as to suggest several themes without really going too heavily into any of them. For example, one could certainly read Winslow and Wake's relationship as homoerotic, maybe a study of the suppression of desire, whilst the societal construct of masculinity, particularly as manifested in competitiveness, is never far from the surface. Another reading would be that the film is an allegory for class struggle á la J.G. Ballard's High Rise (1975) - the lantern room high above is the upper class, with Wake doggedly protecting the room; meanwhile, the bowels of the lighthouse is the working class, with Winslow performing menial tasks assigned him by Wake. Alcoholism is also omnipresent, with the duo progressively drinking more and more each night, until they run out of rum, and so try to mix turpentine and honey, so dependent have they become on the numbing effects of drink.The Lighthouse definitely isn't for everyone, and is challenging and rewarding in equal measure. Personally, I loved every crazy minute of it. There's a lot that has gone into making this film what it is, both in terms of crafting the folkloric story and in the more mechanical sense of putting the finished film together - it's an aesthetic marvel in pretty much every way. Thick with mood and atmosphere, The Lighthouse proves that The VVitch was no fluke.",The Lighthouse
191,Michael Fargo,The tricks the mind can play,5,8 November 2019,"Egger's film ""The Witch"" is my favorite horror film. Fiercely intelligent and thoroughly researched, the horror is not knowing what's happening in unfamiliar surroundings. The imagination can run wild with blame and suspicion when simply a good meal and a grounding in reality would be a much better approach.There are projects that the filmmakers can get so deep into the material/process they undertake they forget there's going to be an audience watching that doesn't have the luxury of knowing why choices were made or the significance of allusions, visual or in dialogue. I felt this film fell very far off that cliff. It's beautifully made, incredibly well-acted and a beautifully shot movie. But the tension between the two characters quickly becomes their problem, and the audience is left outside the struggle, and I thought, ""Well, hope you guys can work it out. I've got better things to do.""True, I may have had unrealistic expectations knowing who made the film and the actors that were cast. But the stilted dialogue (which works well in ""The Witch"") becomes so dense and full of allusion, I quickly lost interest.What is most impressive is the look of the film. It recreates the chiaroscuro of the master filmmakers of the silent era in a very eerie way. The sound/music, as well, is haunting and sets the viewer in dread. But the two characters are so locked in their own individual struggles, I just didn't care. Defoe in particular is such a force and so thoroughly intimidating, I'd have moved to the other end of the island rather than put up with him. Pattinson is always interesting and as impressive as Defoe. But their struggle starts out at a very high level and never lets up. It became tedious to watch.",The Lighthouse

It looked and sounded quite good but without a somewhat coherent story/point of view, I struggled to get through to the end.",The Lighthouse
193,Lewis_Heather787,Yeah ok...............this film is strange !,7,5 January 2020,"The trailers for this film don't even give you a hint at how completely bonkers this film gets!! I wasn't prepared for it.............shocking to say the least, fascinating to watch, but some of which goes completely over my head. There are a lot of things that aren't explained in this film, which I can live with but might leave some people not so happy.Robert Pattison is a star..............anybody who doubts the man doesn't have talent by now needs to see this, yeah I'm gonna say it!! Its his best performance to date, the accent only is an incredible achievement........shows how dedicated to the roll he was. The character is at the start quite a reserved guy............but soon after he starts to drink he unravels. Incredibly good performance from start to finish, he simply has to get nominated for some awards for this!!! I am convinced that this will stop the negativity around the man, its not right give him a break.Now this doesn't happen very often but I'm talking about Willem Dafoe's performance second in this review, that should give you an indication on how good Pattinson is. Thats not to say that Dafoe doesn't bring his A gams as well, unfortunately these days I am to use to Dafoe giving great performances...........I cant remember a film he wasn't good in!?!? Plays a weird old man who definitely has his secrets, I thought there was something off about his character straight from the get go......I had no idea where it would lead. Nominations again maybe???Robert Eggers is a strange man!!! What sort of bleach, paint thinner or white spirit was he sniffing when he thought of this film???? Now don't get me wrong the opening 15 or so minutes is pretty ordinary nothing weird yet. But whats with the strange seagulls??? The mermaid sex scene???? The tentacles/Octopus whatever is happening scene???? Willem Dafoe being a dog??? Pattison's angry having ""personal time"" scene??? Who thinks of this stuff?? In some ways I'm glad he did because its not everyday you get a completely original and bonkers film like this.............This film needs exposure, I implore as many as possible to see it.Overall even thought I completely understand the 9 or 10 out of 10's for this film, yes probably on an acting and technical level its that good, but for the big question is. Am I ever going to watch it again??? The answer is probably no............well not any time soon. You've got to be a real film lover to appreciate this film, and you've got to be in the mood........its slow and heavy going. So for me its only 70% out of 100 its still a good film with incredible performances but its not one I'm gonna keep coming back to!!! Doesn't change the fact that this film needs to be recognised!!!",The Lighthouse
194,treywillwest,nope,8,13 November 2019,"This is a beautiful and haunting film. I was, nevertheless, slightly disappointed in the direction taken by filmmaker Robert Eggers in his sophomore feature. The first movie Eggers directed, The Witch, suggested an artist about to launch an extremely unique style. It is hard to call the aesthetics of The Lighthouse unique because they are an intentional hommage to an established master of the medium, the celebrated Hungarian auteur Bella Tarr.This is not to say that the craftsmanship here is inferior to that displayed in The Witch, indeed it might be more impressive. For Eggers and his team do deliver a work fully worthy of Tarr, hardly an accomplishment to be scoffed at. Yet, specific shots and sequences are lifted from Tarr's work, especially The Turin Horse. This hardly seems a way for an emerging young talent to hone a unique style.One can tell, however, that this came from the mind of the man behind The Witch, and not Tarr. Tarr's films are about humanity being overcome by our inner emptiness. Tarr's humanity is petulant, but mostly because it knows deep down inside that it amounts to nothing. Eggers's universe, on the other hand, is not empty. It is filled with an exceptionally sinister meaning. I can't think of a film that made baby eating seem as rich in metaphysical suggestion as did The Witch. You REALLY don't want to discover the secret meaning of Eggers's world in a dark alley.There's a Promethean theme running through The Lighthouse that I didn't fully get. Indeed, the film is a bit heavy on symbolism for my taste. But both here and in The Witch the characters become vestibules for a divine chaos. In The Witch the messenger of this chaos is nature and repressed sexuality. In The Lighthouse it is alcohol. I don't know that any film I've seen has been as detailed a study of drunkenness, of the ways drink shatters the self, and in doing so sets it free to be the confused, paradoxical thing it is. Willem Dafoe and Robert Pattinson do fine jobs of convincing the viewer they've had plenty of first hand experience.",The Lighthouse
195,AdrenalinDragon,Artistic Horror Masterpiece,10,24 October 2019,"I managed to sneak in a festival showing of The Lighthouse and boy was it worth the long trip to see it! One of the most intriguing and fascinating movies I have ever seen on the big screen, The Lighthouse sticks with you long after you've seen it and there is so much to think about even though it only had two characters almost the whole time. I was hooked in seeing the whole experience from start to finish and loving every second of it. Not only is The Lighthouse probably the best movie of 2019, it's also up there with the very best too!First of all, the way this movie is shot is not used for gimmicks. The camera is deliberately shot in a boxed aspect ratio with specific types of lenses to mimic the time frame the movie set in the 1890s. This sets a specific mood and tone throughout the whole experience and really highlights the desolate location of the island and the lighthouse. Every single shot, every single effect, every single thing you could think of on a technical level in this movie is flawless, and I literally mean flawless. A large number of shots could have been used as paintings in your house. I hope Robert Eggers gets recognized big time for the insane work he did here.As for the performances themselves, give these men all the awards you can give them! Both Willem Dafoe and Robert Pattinson knock it out of the park playing as two Lighthouse Keepers with interesting personalities. Willem Dafoe as Thomas Wake gets the Sea Man Captain's accent down so perfectly that I found him such a joy to watch and make jokes and quips constantly throughout large chunks of his dialogue. Robert Pattinson as Ephraim Winslow is more a more subtle and less experienced lighthouse keeper who is there to counterbalance Thomas Wake's personality and call him out in various situations. The two characters were so fun to watch on screen, that the movie's deliberate slow pacing never bothered me at all.The story itself is interesting. The Lighthouse plants so many different seeds on what is going on throughout the movie that there is never a concrete answer to what is actually happening and what isn't, and despite this being a turn-off for some viewers, for me personally it made the movie way more memorable and less predictable. There was so much to discuss after seeing the film and many different interpretations you could take with everything. Every line of dialogue feels genuine and leads to some very funny Comic Relief dotted around with the main characters that even when things seem very dark and grim, there is perfect chemistry between these two characters no matter what.The Lighthouse is more of a Horror movie in the psychological sense. The movie effectively creates tension and dread as the film progresses with these two characters slowly descending into madness and unsure of what to think of their partner and their surroundings. There's pretty much no cliched jump scares or anything like that, just a really good haunting musical score and some disturbing imagery here and there. The slow pacing works beautifully and I definitely got some Shining-like vibes here and there in places. I really wish there were more Horror movies like this, and even though I won't be able to see The Lighthouse again for another few months, I'm looking forward to revisiting this masterpiece and watch these two characters banter together, admire the artistry, and interpret the story in multiple ways again.10/10",The Lighthouse

The character of Robert Pattinson is a man who is beginning to experience psychosis while he is working on a small isolated island as a lighthouse keeper.This film isn't really ""horror"" as it's sometimes advertised to be. It's kinda slow, and it's like one of those slow artsy films with plenty of hidden meanings or something. I didn't know what's real or what's not as I watch the film. It's a very strange movie.

It has booming performances by Willem Dafoe and Robert Pattison, atmospheric production design and a lavishly bizarre story, which granted does require a lot of thought and attention to context clues to grasp. It's probably not the most welcoming film to the mainstream, but it's so powerfully dark and technically superb that I highly recommend it and would like to absorb other viewpoints.",The Lighthouse
198,TheOny13,Foghorn!,5,1 December 2020,"You know sometimes when you get introduced to someone at a party and everyone raves about them like they are some enlightened intellectual, so you naturally assume it might be true. And when you first shake hands they seemed to be well dressed and polite and it's all going great. But the more you talk to them, the more you notice them doing random things with no logic behind them or talking with pretentious words but having no real deep meaning. But you've been told by everyone that they're smart and your brain instinctively tries to reinterpret what it sees to make that true. So, instead you try to convince yourself that it's you who must be wrong. And it's only when they've wandered off and you have a minute to think about the conversation, that you reach a certain inescapable conclusion: that guy was a total idiot! Then the only thing left to do is distract him long enough for you to spike his drinks with turbo laxatives. Well it turns out, it's not just people who can pull these kind of tricks on you, movies are just as good. And what better example than The Lighthouse? A 2019 movie starring Robert Pattinson and Willem Defoe about two men starting their monthly guard of a lighthouse, slowly going insane.You know analysing this movie is kind of a tricky one, because for start, it does some things expertly well while also failling dramatically at other equally important things. For start, this movie has no plot. It's just an amalgamation of random scenes that might be real or imagined that only serve a certain purpose, to build tension between the characters. You can basically boil it down to: Two men get to a lighthouse, they do random things, they go insane and then the movie ends. That's it. And it's drawn on for an hour and 50 minutes of absolute storytelling boredom! I mean, let's get the good things out of the way first: the acting is phenomenal. Both actors deliver what I believe to be their best performances of their entire careers, oscar nomination worthy performances at least, especially Defoe. The movie from a production point of view looks spectacular, perfectly capturing the sense of claustrophobia and slowly building tension and insanity. Needless to say the movie is in black and white with that old squared aspect ratio. The cinematography is also splendid, perfectly encapsulating the sense of claustrophobia and mental insecurity that the two main leads go through during the movie, also having some gorgeous shots. Also the music is pretty fitting but nothing too special. Which is great because the rest of the movie is a big pile of cinematic rubble. The first and biggest problem of the movie is the plot, or better said, the lack of it. There is nothing interesting going on. And even though I knew what this movie was about, I didn't particularly invested emotion into it, so there were maybe people who had no idea about the purpose of this movie until later in it. By that time however most of them didn't have a clue what happened or what the movie is about or trying to say, because basically nothing happens. The movie is just a collection of random things happening with no purpose or logic behind it. Just like the guy in my intro. I mean, I love movies that are ambiguos. In fact some of my favorite movies are ambiguos. And the movie that best came into my mind while watching this movie was Inception. That is also a movie that is very ambiguos. And over the years many theories have come and gone about the movie, it's ending or it's meaning. And the thing about that movie is that it has clues and hints suggesting a multitude of interpretation. And that's the thing missing here. The clues or the hints. There are basically none. The two men say things and later they say completely different things that are absolutely contradictory with everything they said up until that point. And there are no hints of what is or might be real or not, what is or might be true or not. So basically you don't care about what happens in this movie because either way you would look at this movie, it lacks any clues or hints to support any theorie or interpretation of what's happening. If that's a bad thing or a good thing, it depends I guess on every viewer. Next, another praise I've heard about this film is it's multiple interpretations and that the movie is intentionally vague to ask grandios questions of it's audience. Going back to my previous point. See, being ambiguos about something means you need to show more than one interpretation of a scene or event. There must be clues pointing out that everything in this movie is questionable. But here we see events occur, and then we hear the characters say that the event happened in a totaly different way. Which begs the question: Why? Why should I believe anything they say when clearly the movie shows something completely different. The movie doesn't put in the work to maybe be ambiguos about certain scenes, in such a way that when recontextualized they make sense from both men's points of view, that being their insanity. There's nothing here. It's just that things happen, characters say things and then they argue. That's it. And it feels simplistic and underdeveloped. And it's a shame because the idea of this movie had tremendeous potential, but it is eclipsed by power house performances and good production values. Even the logic in this movie is all over the place. I'm all for movies having weird stuff that happen in order to raise the tension and anticipation, but a movie is basically a world before us. So the audience must know what's possible or not, what rules are in it, what purpose some things have in order to fully get invested. And here is where Lighthouse absolutely crumbles, offering such a poorly developed world that it made me question at times: ""What's the point?"" Like, two men go into a Lighthouse on a 200 square yards island. I mean, why would anyone place a lighthouse on such a small island in the middle of nowhere? Aren't Lighthouses supposed to be near big ports or big chunks of land to help sailors reach those lands? But here it's in the middle of nowhere, and it isn't like this island holds a miraculously powerful mineral that everybody wants. Well you might say, obviously it's because of the symbolism and the questions it raises to the audiences. To that I say, movie interpretation is subjective, no doubt about that. Everything in any movie can be interpreted whatever you'd like to interpret. But you can't just throw a pair of men onto an island with no purpose whatsoever, have random things happen, and expect that to stir questions in the viewers minds just as it does in your mind. That's not how good entertainment works in my opinion.Ultimately, The Lighthouse is more of a mix bag, and mostly a bad one. Yeah, it has high production values and the atmosphere is tense and brooding with fantastic performances, but the lack of a logical plot or any rules to govern the place this movie is set in, makes me as a viewer to not get fully invested in it and certainly not see the fantastic deep questions and symbolism this movie had, and just like the guy from my intro the best thing to do is spike his drink and watch him poop himself. 5/10 from me. Oh, and did I mention that there is an annoying foghorn almost every minute of this movie? Oh yeah... foghorn!",The Lighthouse

Two men is supposed to take care of an isolated lighthouse in 1920-1930 for 4 weeks. They quickly get bored and tired of each other as days pass by without anything happening. They work, eat, and masturbate!
Then its time for their relief, but a storm sets in, and they start drinking... First alcohol, then anything that could give a buzz....
In their drunkness they fight, love, imagine, and become suspicious!What a waste of time!",The Lighthouse

Robert Eggers, creates a hypnotic story of two guardians of a lighthouse on a remote and mysterious island of New England, in 1890. It is a lively blend of horror, dark comedy, intense psychological drama and fantasy that will keep charmed cinephiles.Beyond the bold scenario, this study of how lack of intimacy and boredom can manifest as insanity, leads to a surreal, confusing, funny and at the same time shocking film. The actors are excellent and bold in this perfectly audiovisual, black and white nightmare. Dafoe and Pattinson play one of the strangest and most frightening couples on the big screen, and the film works flawlessly precisely because of the excellent interaction of the protagonists and the fear that seems to penetrate everything.

There is a clear story, not too original but captivating nonetheless. I too would prefer a less abstract approach to the characters' journey into madness - as it is, the few supernatural elements seem a little disjointed, just tools to justify or portray Pattinson's growing paranoia rather than helping muddy the waters of what is real and what is not.That said, the main strengths of the film are its superb cinematography and its acting. Robert Pattinson is fantastic, but Willem Dafoe is simply outstanding.With an almost Klaus Kinski-an immersion to the character, Dafoe proves that when he plays a role because he wants to (rather than because it pays well - god knows he's had a lot of those) he is a phenomenally good actor.If you expect to see a horror film, you may be disappointed.

He soon discovers that what initially seems like a grinding job on a drab island might not be so normal after all.This film is sometimes molasses slow and definitely not for impatient or self-indulgent viewers. But it simply draws you in and gradually becomes a winding exercise in madness. It also blurs the line between hallucination, dreams and reality in a way that's reminiscent of ""Black Swan"". The film's cold, stately look initially appears stolid but masks a roiling descent into the abyss. It's ultimately not for the squeamish, it should be noted and one of the strangest films I have seen in a long time. Pattinson proves to be a complex figure and Dafoe, for all his histrionics, manages to elevate his work here such that it never becomes one-note or caricaturish.If you like an austere film with just enough of a dose of dark humor and vivid acting, I strong recommend this.

215,bastille-852-731547,Beautifully Eerie but Imperfect Period Thriller,7,19 October 2019,"This film tells the twisted tale of two lighthouse keepers (Williem Dafoe and Robert Pattison) slowly losing their sanity in 1890s New England. I was looking forward to this film because to the rave reviews and a uniquely appealing mix of seemingly gorgeous black and white aesthetic combined with gripping, Gothic-esque suspense and strong performances. While the film is certainly well-made and gripping, it does have some notable lapses and a few slightly galling narrative choices from time to time.The film doesn't have too much in terms of liminal plot moments, that is not necessarily the point here as many of the key plot points are a variety of events that seem relatively inconsequential at first glance, only to build up as the narrative goes on. This didn't bother me too much, as such events are all unique and originally thought out, almost as unique pieces in a tapestry that Robert Eggers has concocted. Unfortunately, however, some of the more experimental moments in the film that end up being relatively detached from the main story did very little for me. Besides attempting to shock and provoke, I really don't understand the point of them, and feel that the film could have been even more effective if they were cut. It's difficult to say such cuts would make the film much ""tighter,"" per se, as the story is already tight, but still. I was mesmerized by Dafoe's performance in the film, but found Pattison to be a bit annoying and less effective at times--especially as the film goes on. These performances are complemented by meticulous black-and-white cinematography and perfectly humble production design that helps us get a feel for the genuine gauntness of the time period. Serving in the background of such aesthetics is the film's score, which is a prime example of understated elegance, and its sound design, which is serviceable but ultimately repetitive to the detriment of a few scenes. As Eggers builds suspense and ups the ante regarding the narrative's seemingly-small stakes, he begins laying the groundwork to craft an ending that some--including me--may not find ultimately satisfying or optimally enriching. Despite its flaws, this is still a uniquely well-crafted film. 7/10",The Lighthouse
216,pere-25366,"A fantastical blend of art cinema, nightmarish horror and surrealism that reels you in and hooks you right into its world - 10/10 ⭐",10,1 November 2019,"It's an exciting time to be fan of original storytelling in the movies and Robert Eggers is a huge reason why. Showing both a proclivity for mythology and understanding of suspense in his directional debut ""The Witch"", Eggers builds on this profoundly and puts to rest any chance of a sophomore slump (Though from the first glimpses of the film's trailer, I don't think there was ever any doubt.)The Lighthouse (2019) is, to recycle a hackneyed phrase, something that you've never seen before... but seriously. It's a nightmare set in motion from the very first frame where unknown figures in the shadowy distance slowly emerge amid a screen full of murky sea fog. Like a classic Bergman film, the introduction is devoid of dialogue and set only to the ambient sounds of its ambiguous setting.I was hooked from the first frame; there is little explanation as to who the two protagonists are, where they are or why they are there but an acute sense of foreboding is immediately felt thanks to the superb cinematography (shot on hundred-year-old lenses and black-and-white 35mm film stock with a tight square aspect ratio 1.19:1 used all the way back in the silent era) and incredibly atmospheric sound design. Technically, it's a marvel.As for the 3 performances (if we're counting the seagull), they were absolutely spot on. Dafoe and Pattinson take this material and totally lose themselves in it, showing the full emotional extent one can go through in such a claustrophobic maddening. I can't seem them not at least garnering nominations for their extraordinary commitment and manic turns on display here; they're both sublime.There's twists at every turn and all the while establishing an increasing sense of dread and claustrophobia that never lets up. Even in the moments of dark humour (and there are certainly a few), there's an unsettling energy growing that's constantly brewing beneath the surface and one that's able to gets under your skin in ways few films are able to do. The direction, cinematography, score, production design, sound design all combine here to create a psychologically draining film of the highest art form conceivable. Now, when did I start writing this review... Five weeks? Two days? Help me to recollect.",The Lighthouse

The two give excellent performances - they unfold across the span of the film.Cinematography by Jarin Blaschke is phenomenal with great detailing in an aspect ratio fitting of the film's setting, and especially the use of pans is breathtaking. And the production design is impressive as well.There is little plot, there is much art, and there is a lot of tense moments and disturbing visuals. Recommended.",The Lighthouse
219,eelen-seth,An instant classic! - intoscreens.com,10,28 January 2020,"Robert Eggers' The Lighthouse could've easily been perceived a classic film from about a century ago. It isn't just disturbingly strange and undeniably tense, this original fantasy gothic horror also has some pitch-black comedy blended in. It's unlike anything you've ever seen before - and that in 2020?Two lighthouse keepers try to maintain their sanity whilst living on a remote and mysterious New England island in the 1890s. What was supposed to be a four week stay, turns into something more surreal when time and space isn't exactly what it seems anymore, and Thomas Howard (Robert Pattinson) and Thomas Wake (Willem Dafoe) flirt with insanity and all kinds of mythical sea creatures. Or are they?The mysteries pile up while a fog horn can be heard all over the island. But while Howard is rather new to the job, Wake isn't exactly telling him everything he knows when taking care of ""the light"" at night. What should have been an easy job, has now become something much more complex in which boundaries are being pushed between two men who are keeping all kinds of secrets, and playing a dangerous game of dominant versus submissive. Director Eggers (The Witch) has masterfully crafted something distinctively peculiar that lures you in like a siren ready to seduce and kill you. Going in blind, is the best way to experience The Lighthouse, but nothing can prepare you for the ingenious work that has been put into this folk tale brought to the big screen.It's nothing like you've ever seen before. So odd it becomes hilarious and disconcerting. The choice to film in black and white, makes A24's newest film in their catalogue, one for the ages. Nothing that has been made (even in black and white) comes close to what Eggers has skilfully achieved here. Together with his cinematographer Jarin Blaschke (who just received an Oscar nomination for his work on this film) and composer Mark Korven, they've designed something that only lives in books - old books. Bringing it alive in the most sonically and unconventionally cursed way, is almost poetic. Especially when Dafoe (At Eternity's Gate) constantly speaks in riddles and old marine terms with an accent almost in need of subtitles. Dafoe acts like his life depends on it, going total-loss and disappearing in someone so shamelessly repulsive and reticent, delivering his lines in one breath, sucking you into his powerful presence on screen.Pattinson (High Life), while very well known as someone who started his career in the blockbuster box office phenomenon The Twilight Saga, once again proves he is more than capable of standing his own next to a remarkable actor such as Dafoe. Their dynamic is out-of-this-world perfection. Pattinson's Howard, being the most enigmatic character in the film, runs from constant reminders of what exactly occurred before arriving on the island. With nowhere to go but the rough saltwater waves that surround the obscure island and its soul-stirring towering lighthouse that compels whoever faces its rotating soul, the cliffs towards the depths of madness seem closer than ever.When it comes to the production design and how the director and crew use the surroundings and its shadows to frame an extra dimension, they've created this gritty eeriness in which everything just falls into the right place to keep you interested in observing the lighthouse keepers' every move. Nothing is what it seems and The Lighthouse will linger far longer in your mind than you might anticipate. Without a doubt, this is a film that will divide audiences. A creatively cursed fable that's not only memorable, but especially flawless when it comes to conjuring something as unusual and mesmerising as Egger's newest film.",The Lighthouse

There are no scares, gore or action sequences.
Its basically a psychological horror of a similar tone to A Field in England in which two men with questionable sanity lose their grip on reality during a storm.

The sort of people who rate movies like this highly are the kind who wont actually admit it doesn't make any sense.
Its ok as an atmospheric movie for a period and the production and acting are great, however there is a good reason why movies resolve clearly at the end.
To not do so just to be ""arty"" or different doesn't make it any better an experience for the audience. Unfortunately watching this to its conclusion was not a satisfying experience.

Robert Eggers knows exactly how to hold your interest while ensuring the film leaves behind a lingering chill.The aged look and feel of 'The Lighthouse' unsurprisingly does wonders, but it's also strengthened by two powerhouse performances from Willem Dafoe and Robert Pattinson, who continuously meet the demands of the material with crazy vigour.Overall, this confirms Robert Eggers as a director to keep track of. His script is just as strong as his vision, and 'The Lighthouse' represents his most accomplished effort to date; a psychological horror that generates a suitably uncomfortable atmosphere and produces some bizarre and unforgettable imagery.8/10",The Lighthouse

Great craft: the images, the cinematography, the set, the 'color', the deep, rich contrasts... the sound (nature vs deep, howling sirens...), the nature, the set, the pace. The acting.Personally, I must say, I am not a big ""story""-sucker, which means I don't care too much about logic, reason and construction of it in a story... if the feeling is right. If the emotional space is wide and strong enough to suck one in... and this is what this film is GENIUS in doing. It sucks you in, you can feel the rain on your skin, the goosebumps from the siren calling, the heartbreaking chill from the deep howl of the lighthouse-bells, the grumping and farting and fighting and roughness of both men. It is deep.In the end, a lot of people say ""I am not sure what this want's to tell me"" and yip, it is not easy to dissect... but honestly: mankind seems to always need to. To rip the guts out of the story to understand 'how the world works' in this films universe. But...the world is dark, and vast and uncompromising and very, very scary due to the lack of understanding. It is chaos. CHAOS. And for me, this works very well. The characters (or one of them?) can't get much hold of a normal 'reality', both are they lost in the cruelty of nature and external forces (is the ship coming?)... they lose sense of time, sense of reality, sense of themselves, literally drowning in sea-mythology. What is true, and what is not?We will never know. Like they won't. But we know: CRUELTY and CHAOS rule mankind, no matter how hard we try to escape. Come, get hit by the storm, drink yourself to madness and swim with the sirens. See the light of the lighthouse and drown,drown,drown.(and please watch it in CINEMA or somewhere with proper sound.

225,justinwfirestone,A dark and wet devolution,7,30 October 2019,"Having never been to a lighthouse, I imagined a movie called The Lighthouse would be something like a nostalgic series of vignettes about how quaint everything used to be. Can you believe there was a time, not too long ago with respect to the total history of seafaring, when boats sailed right into the craggy shore and crashed, because they could not see whither they wenteth?Whenever a movie is presented in black and white and involves a small number of characters, you can be about 90% sure (180 proof) there will be heavy drinking, and thereby some yelling, and some items get broken, often with a difficult lesson or two learned. Willem Dafoe and Robert Pattinson do not buck those chances, and each gets their turns to yell the loud and crazy words with wild and crazy eyes, all with plenty of chiaroscuro and wetness to satiate about two hours of gradual devolution into whatever it is two dudes who spend too much time alone together do.Like Ren and Stimpy arguing whether the shiny, red button should be pushed, Dafoe and Pattinson argue about how clean is clean, which farts are acceptable, and whether honesty is the best policy.

This is the only film which I think the black and white color was better than colors(Even in Schindler's List I though black and white wasn't necessary, but it was still a nice touch for sure). This film was a psychological thriller with a great quality and a lot of symbolisms. The thing is the story doesn't conclude as some might expect. The ending and actually the whole story can be viewed from a different point of view for all of the people. You might just think this movie has no messages and love it whereas some people will compare this with mythology. Dafoe was incredible, he really was that paranoid old guy, this is probably one of the best if not the best acting from Pattinson, he crushed it. Black and white increases the absurdity of this movie therefore makes it more interesting and weird in all the right ways.",The Lighthouse
227,schroederagustavo,Wow,10,9 January 2020,"So, The Witch is one of my favorite movies ever. The experience I had in an almost empty theater watching that film for the first time is one of the best movie-going memories of my life. In the same fashion as The Witch, The Lighthouse blew me away upon first viewing (this time in a packed theater).And just like The Witch, The Lighthouse is a period piece, with real 1890's seamen dialect. The film was shot on 35mm black and white film with an aspect ratio of 1.19:1, which is almost square. All of these things could be seen at a distance as gimmicky, but they really work in favor of the tone, atmosphere and the period in which the film takes place in.It is very reminiscent of The Shining, in the sense of it being about people in isolation going insane, including one particular scene that is straight up paying homage to Kubrick's film I would assume. But The Lighthouse always feels original and fresh, the pacing excellent.This is just an expertly crafted film in every possible area. The direction, cinematography, editing, sound design, lighting, music, acting, everything is on point. Robert Pattinson is truly amazing in the movie, being able to convey so many emotions. However, Willem Defoe 100% absolutely takes the cake as the best actor in the film, seriously, one of the best performances of the last decade, perhaps even ever.This movie is a masterpiece.

This is one of those few times where I feel a film has no flaws at all. Most of this movie""s greatness comes from the performances of Robert Pattinson and Willem Dafoe, especially Dafoe. What these two do in their respective roles is crazy and awesome. Watching them go through this slow descent into madness is awesome, mesmerizing, and terrifying to watch but Willem Dafoe absolutely steals the show. At certain points in the film, Dafoe goes on a 2 minute tirad about something and it's one steady, uncut shot of him and it's incredibly intense and terrifying. Dafoe was 100 percent born for this role. He fits so perfectly into it and this is probably a career best performance from him so far. This is also a career best for Robert Pattinson as well. Although his performance isn't as fantastic as Dafoe's, he still does an outstanding job. I want Joaquin Phoenix, Willem Dafoe, and Robert Pattinson to get nominated for Best Actor at the Oscars but Willem Dafoe deserves to win the award. The script is phenomenal. Each line of dialogue is well written and clever and any jokes the film makes fit well. The Lighthouse has in my opinion the best cinematography of the year. Every single shot of the film is unique and memorable and there are tons of beautiful shots. There are a lot of one shot takes with the characters talking or working on something which are the best shots in the film for the most part. The aspect ratio for the film is much smaller than the standard aspect ratio. This aspect ratio change and camerawork mixes together a claustrophobic atmosphere which is perfect for what The Lighthouse is going for. I felt that these characters genuinely had no escape from this place because of these filmmaking techniques. The production design of the actual Lighthouse is fantastic. The sets look beautiful even in black and white. Anything the film does with sound is breathtaking. The sound design for the foghorn that plays throughout the film and certain elements of the film I can't spoil all sounds awesome. The score by Mark Korven is so far, my favorite score of the year. Every single piece fits perfectly into its respective scene. Each piece is so unique and different from the one before and each is memorable in their own way. My favorite piece would be the first track titled Arrival. The Lighthouse's major themes that I caught are isolation and insanity. While themes like that are common in film, the way The Lighthouse uses these themes makes it so unique. Watching these two men go insane on this island is mesmerizing thanks to Robert Eggers incredibly direction. Overall, The Lighthouse is a fantastic take on isolation with career bests from Pattinson and Dafoe along with outstanding cinematography, an intelligent script, and a jaw dropping story, and an intense musical score.",The Lighthouse

As a side note, following in that vein, this also heavily reminded me of the 1963 English movie The Servant. The movie itself is shot excellently, and the sound design, though at times overwhelming the picture, is used extremely efficiently, effectively enhancing the eerie tone. I wouldn't necessarily call the movie exactly boring, but I did frequently space out for seconds at a time, particularly during the very dialogue heavy scenes, so there's a good chance I may have missed crucial details, but all the more good reason to rewatch it. Also the ending, while I don't mind ambiguous endings at all, this one was a little too random - Pattinson finally reaches the lighthouse lamp, burns his hand, tumbles down the stairs, and then cut to him completely naked outside and being pecked by gulls... how'd he get there? He could've crawled out, but what happened to his clothes? Did Defoe live and do that to him? All that aside, the technical prowess far outweighs the lack of entertainment some viewers might have.

Robert Pattison has come a long way from vampire Edward Cullen from The twilight Saga to the young, lonely, angry, power hungry Winslow in the movie The Lighthouse.

I can't say I ever have been but I bet none of us would be able to say we've been stuck in an isolated location such as the titular one of Robert Eggers' The Lighthouse, a film that takes madness to a whole new level.
Two lighthouse keepers (Willem Dafoe & Robert Pattinson) try to maintain their sanity whilst living on a mysterious and remote New England island in the 1890s.There's a hold that The Lighthouse had on me from the very beginning, the mysterious nature of the narrative and the hypnotic nature of the performances leaving me in a trance-like state for the majority of all the yelling, drinking, dancing and farting. I wasn't too enamoured with Robert Eggers' The Witch however, his work on the direction and writing, sharing duties with his brother Max, of The Lighthouse is something I can really admire. He's created something here so different, and I'm sure it will alienate a lot of audiences, but it's a film that should be championed for it's willingness to stand-out from the crowd.
There's a lot to admire about the craft of The Lighthouse, its visuals in particular having a very archaic vibe, the aspect ratio and being shot in black and white harking back to films of old. Jarin Blaschke's cinematography is truly beautiful and a work of art itself, the darkness shrouding the minds of these men brought to life with the shadows and the staging of the camera as we linger on their paranoid faces bringing a powerful punch right off the screen. There's also a wickedly haunting score from Mark Korven that accompanies the film as if we are heading to the depths of Davy Jones' locker ourselves.
The film would be nothing mind without the barnstorming performances from both Willem Dafoe and Robert Pattinson. You could always see Dafoe as a madman isolated on an island but it's Pattinson that really surprised me here, his descent into madness utterly disturbing yet one you won't want to take your eyes off. The pair bounce off each other so naturally, particularly during their moments of madness, and it's a real surprise to me that neither performance has gained any awards recognition this year.
There's always method to the madness so don't let flatulence or stand-offs with seagulls put you off this psychological horror from Robert Eggers. The Lighthouse may just be the craziest cinematic experience I will have all year and sometimes you just need to embrace the madness.",The Lighthouse
234,iamkeysersoze-13228,Incredible,10,27 January 2020,"The Lighthouse is flat out brilliant although not as good as The VVitch, this film is a win for horror, it's a win for Eggers and another hit for A24The film Is absolutely gorgeous in everyway from it's direction to it's incredible cinematography incorporated with some brilliant stylistic choices of using natural lighting and shooting in black and white.Both Robert Pattinson and Willem Dafoe are incredible.

237,Ziglet_mir,A Dark and Beautiful Sea-Faring Ode to Madness,10,29 December 2019,"HARK!Willem Dafoe hands in the performance of his illustrious career, while Pattinson proves he can throw his chops down with the best (maybe even stealing the show from Dafoe?). The dark, ominous sea-faring New England coast is perfect for this horror, and Robert Eggers direction in black and white fits the mood all too well. Returning to silver was a must for this project as the floorboards and salty sea mists just ooze with mystery as we see Thomas Wake (Dafoe) and Ephraim Winslow (Pattinson) perform their duties in taking care of the lighthouse.The film is entirely poetic as we see these two characters descend into madness due to being around the other too much. Wake farts, guzzles alcohol and tells tall-tales in his borderline Irish-pirate accent, while Pattinson stays subdued, smokes and works his chores as he is told (later on reluctantly), also holding down the truer New England wickie accent (Farts, FAAAARTS).The Lighthouse is truly beautiful, mystical and gothic in its elements. It's winning trait is it's high-caliber visual poetry that never gets boring as we watch the duo masterclass create two incredible performances for us to watch.The film is quotable all over the place (not that this particular trait makes or breaks a film in its rating), but be ready for the cult following that will quote it all the time.I know the Oscars aren't the end all be all, but I think Dafoe finally will get his due while I would not be surprised if Pattinson gets a nod. Maybe even a best director/writing for Robert Eggers and a best picture.""What'd spill yer beans fer?""

238,bernie-122,It's neither masterpiece nor trash,4,14 August 2021,"I didn't want to do this, but this movie seems to have created polarization equalled only by the baffling politics that's going on now. Firstly, there's the cringeworthy reviews by people loudly complaining that there's no colour and the screen is half chopped off. Many don't even have the concept of Aspect Ratio, or can allow that B&W with cramped aspect is a valid way to treat something set in century before last. Others complain simplistically that there's no plot, no coherence, no sense at all, which is obviously overstating the problem. Sure, there's almost complete lack of cohesion, and there's no forgiving that; we can also say that calling it a masterpiece is vastly overstating things in the opposite direction. What bothered me was that what artsy gimmicks there were, were too transparent or just overdone. Big dollops of subtlety are necessary when you tread this ground. None of that here. And if you were still there by the ending, well, that was the icing on the cake. All I could do was shake my head and whisper ""Wtf??"" Willem DaFoe and Robert Pattinson basically did pretty well, with DaFoe hamming it up to the hilt, while demonstrating that he's still got what it takes. Pattinson did nearly as well, although his accent was all over the place. In the end I have to evaluate this in terms of what effect it had on me, and I can only say I was left scratching my head. The only thing I can remotely compare this to is Lynch's Eraserhead, which, unlike this one, I went back and watched repeatedly until I was sure I understood it.

The Witch by this director was another over rated piece of film that was nothing new, even though it had the wonderful Kate Dickie in it ...I'm afraid Robert Eggers just seems like some shallow hipster passing phase as far as I can see and certainly isn't doing anything original for cinema apart from for people who haven't seen a lot of films",The Lighthouse

The black and white 4:3 filming adds nothing to the story and feels like a gimmic. Nothing about the characters, atmosphere or pacing lends itself to that style so instead it comes off as cloying, begging you for praise. Instead of any kind of build up of tension our two leads just scream each other for 2 hours until we get an oh so tiresome violent ending I couldnt bring myself to be upset over.Im giving this a 5 because dafoe and patterson I think played their parts well, but frankly this added nothing to the genre and felt as disingenious as a mandatory highschool christmas play.

247,BeanieCore,A masterpiece of psychological horror.,9,14 January 2021,"I personally wasn't blown away by Robert Egger's debut film; ""The Witch"". It was a good film, but to me, not the great one that most suggested. So imagine my surprise that his sophomore effort became my favorite horror film of 2019. One may expect a horror flick about a secluded lighthouse to simply be a ghost story, or a Lovecraftian tale of deep sea terrors. And while this film pays tribute to those notions and legends, it's purely a psychological horror. Egger's direction is fantastic, with a cramped aspect ratio lending a feeling of increasing claustrophobia, and the black and white cinematography making the already dimly lit film, even darker and more ethereal. There is a thick, inescapable and uncomfortable feeling of dread and anxiety smothering the entire film, yet, it's darkness is engaging and hypnotizing. But the utmost praise must be given to Robert Pattison and Willem Dafoe. This is their two-man show, and they both give some of the most shattering, vulnerable, fiery and terrifying performances I have ever witnessed on film.This is, at the end of the day, a film about the mental deterioration of two men with horrible secrets. Two men who were broken long before they wound up trapped on a tiny island. It's also about masculinity, with Pattison's character always eager to please his gruff boss, and Dafoe obviously wanting for a son, but afraid to let anyone close. I'm not sure why so many are so confused by the film's events. There are plenty of hallucinations, dreams and metaphors, but with at least two viewings, the reality is quite clear to me. It's about guilt, shame, insanity and isolation. Whether it be isolation on an island, or isolation from one man to the other. And the fantastic, brutal performances are what carry the film.The atmosphere envelops you in a haunting, uncomfortable realm, and the acting forces you to probe the depths of mental illness and loneliness. There is so much craftsmanship and small inflections to pick up, that each viewing leaves you with more to think on. It's not an easy film to watch, and it won't leave you feeling good. But it's truly a disturbing, unnerving film, that terrifies you in a deeper manner than most horror films attempt to. I could go rattle on, and on about it, but suffice to say, it's a masterwork.",The Lighthouse

Any movie that involves life on a lighthouse (when they were still actually manned) has potential with the solitude and mental anguish of separation and loneliness as companions.
I wonder, from the aspect ratio in which this is filmed and the stark black and white, whether this movie was supposed to pay homage to the early Bergman movies. If so, for me it fell a very long way short. Bergman was the master of this kind of movie and, if I'm right, this is a tenth rate attempt to copy.
I found this movie unutterably boring despite the action that I guess was supposed to keep it moving along. One of those movies where I anxiously waited for the end credits which took way too long to arrive.

I went in to see it with an open mind, without any certainty of what was in store for me, but knowing that it was something crazy, and in part, I was right. The film completely surprised me with its insane madness and its masterful presentation. It is probably one of the best representations of psychological/cosmic horror I have ever seen. For the second film directed by Robert Eggers, we have before us a jewel in the rough in a range of unparalleled genres; if he manages to maintain his consistency and hand in the creation of these fascinating films, we may have a king of terror in the years to come.Totally intense and delirious, we have two masterful performances from the protagonists, accompanied by incredible sound design, editing and beautiful cinematography.

254,emryse,Never a Dull Moment,9,7 November 2021,"Going in to this I knew very little about it, I'd heard it was quite good but wasn't really expecting much, however, I was really pleasantly surprised. First off the cast is brilliant, it's pretty much just Robert Pattinson and Willem Dafoe, both of whom are brilliant actors in their own rights but mesh really well here with some great chemistry, with the two of them being practically the only two faces you see in this movie it makes it so whenever you see anyone else it feels jaunting, that's the way I'd describe this whole film to be honest, jaunting. It never really managed to scare me but on a psychological side it does make you doubt everything you think you know, if I were to compare it to another film it would have to be Shutter Island, both of them have similar settings and mess with the main characters, as well as the audiences, perception of what is real and what is not.The cinematography is brilliant and while it is often very dark in terms of subject matter and lighting, there were shots that made me laugh out loud, in terms of music there wasn't very much going on but the sound design is brilliant. The film never lets up with there constantly being the hum of the lighthouse and over ambient noises never leaving a moment of silence, this blends in seamlessly so that most of the time you don't even notice it's there but when the film finished I found myself letting out a breath of air, not realising I had been holding my breath for almost the entire time. I really have nothing negative to say about this film, it passed by incredibly quickly and, at least for me, there was never a dull moment. 9/10.",The Lighthouse
255,IamROCKAS,Where's the line between horror and just another tale of someone going mad?,5,10 June 2021,"This is the kind of movie that made me distant from movies for a while. I don't know but I didn't feel like watching anything after going through The Lighthouse. It's not that it was bad or disturbing but it was executed in such a boring way that everything just seemed dull for a while.From the very beginning, you can notice that something is wrong. I think everyone who watched this movie for the first time, whether it was at the cinema or from the comfort of their home, noticed the weird aspect ratio. In my case, I thought that I got a corrupted version of the movie but apparently, it was actually shot at a 1.19:1 ratio. Personally, I think this is a good choice and fits the theme of the film. An odd and not a traditional choice but still a good one. It was also filmed on a black and white 35mm negative, which just added up to the mimic of the film being old. As bizarre as it is for modern cinema, you get used to it quickly and it doesn't bother you after a relatively short time.What you don't get used to is the foghorn. It varies in loudness from scene to scene but it stays in the background for the whole movie. At some points it seems that it bellows louder than usual, penetrating deep through my ears and even giving my whole body a shock. Audibly, the movie was not a good experience. Besides the foghorn, the list of unpleasant sounds included chugging industrial machinery. When not being exposed to those, we usually either hear roaring winds or crashing waves, sometimes a mix of both.The first line of the movie was provided by the younger ""gentleman"" that we followed for the duration of the movie. He simply said ""Son-of-a-""under his breath after bumping his head on a low ceiling when climbing the stairs. I don't know why but even after two weeks have passed, this is one of the moments I remember vividly. Without doing much thinking, I believe that is because it just felt natural, something I did multiple times in my life and as it happened after a long sequence of nothing but foghorn bellowing, water dribbling, and grey foggy visuals, it just felt like this movie will have some life after all. This just shows how small details can have an impact on the viewing experience.Though I liked that one little moment in the starting phase of the film, I can't really say I felt the same all the time going forward. That whole scene was soon followed old fellow farting, almost as to show dominance. And he did it more than once, from what I can remember. Literal fart humor in a movie that is supposed to be an entry in the (psychological?) horror genre. The plot felt more like the classic tale of someone going mad in some sort of confinement. To me, the plot felt like a drunken journey that resulted in some beans being spilled and emotions, predominantly anger and envy, getting their way. I wasn't a palpable horror story in my book.Though I didn't like the story, I did get a sense of enjoyment from the dialogue. They weren't always comfortable but they were definitely delivered cleverly. Both actors are gifted speakers and that was the biggest strength of the movie. Though just a thought but the uncomfortable audio effects did do something right - they made me appreciate the dialogues more as they were rarely interrupted by other sounds. I don't remember a particular quote after all this time but I remember that even when both of them got drunk and went on bizarre rambles, you still felt like that they can say something and sound classier under those circumstances than I could ever sound sober. For the most part, I loved listening to them interact with each other, even though the old-timer did make me pop out a few nerves with the things he said.Overall, my feelings for the movie are as close to neutral as they can get. I was a bit provoked and unpleased but at the same time, it made me feel something. There are too many movies that just take it safe and slow and that's just boring, if one thing this movie is, it's not boring. I'd rather have unpleasant than boring. On the other hand, this movie tried to achieve too much and ended up being sort of a mess, both audibly and story-wise. The other thing that this movie overdid what the ambiguity. I didn't talk about it but I just want to briefly mention that there's a lot that's not clear after the closing moment. You can even go as far as to say that he faked the story of his real name as it's not clear where the madness ends, where it begins and how it manifests, are the mermaids/sirens just a dream or not, and what the light actually holds, if it holds anything at all. Combing all these elements that this movie brings, I kind of want to recommend others to watch it just to see if they take out from it more than I did.",The Lighthouse

Absolutely gorgeous cinematography. And insanely good acting on an other level. I think these are the things most can agree on but this film seems to be dividing people on the story.Personally, I found the story to be just great. Very character driven, claustrophobic and intense but also revealing to the human psyche. Now, this is a heavy film to watch and should definitely not be watched if someone feels to be entertained in some lighthearted way. No, you almost have to be in a certain mood I think, to invest yourself in it completely, you can't just half watch it, then you miss it.Now, what is it about? Well, I guess it's up for interpretation. To me it was about isolation and pride. What isolation can do to a man, drive him mad, beacuse it deprives him of some basic human needs and it also at the same time reveals him to himself. And it was also about two lost men, that deeply feel like complete failures and losers but are trying to hide this behind a mask of pride, both in their own way. They both have no clue on how to sort themselves out or how to even communicate, they only manage to communicate somewhat when they're drunk but the alcohol also brings out their inner demons.Why I think the storytelling was done so greatly, is because it tells this story with accuracy all though with a artistic perception and even if it also goes to the extremes. On top of that, it was a nice tale of sealife and a throwback to another time. Even if this movie was abstract in some ways, it felt real to me. It shows that horror doesn't have to be about supernatural demons, ghost or flesheating zombies, nor some psychotic serial killer (not saying movies like that are bad in anyway no no). Sometimes the horror is just simply life itself and what we have within us, in our own psyche. Scary stuff.",The Lighthouse

It is made to look and feel like a classic horror film, it's shot in black and white with a 4:3 aspect ratio.

Is all this crazy horrific stuff really going on, or are the characters just going insane? It really sucks you in and makes you think. This, along with Midsommar, are my favourite movies of the year. This is a must-see! Turn all the lights off and get lost in this beautiful, haunting film. I gotta tell you, if that Blumhouse Universal Monsters reboot doesn't do well, they NEED to give the rights to A24! Seeing some of the most classic horror characters reimagined by the most brilliant modern horror directors would be freaking awesome!! Make it happen, Universal!",The Lighthouse

273,TheCasualReviewer,"This movie is a trip, let me tell ya.",6,13 December 2019,"This is one of those movies where it's hard for me to put a finger on. Unfortunately, for me, when it's hard for me to decide whether I really like it or really don't, I get stuck on the feeling that it was just an ""okay"" movie.
SYNOPSIS:
Two men by the names of Thomas (Willem Dafoe) and Ephraim (Robert Pattinson) are stuck on a New England island looking over a lighthouse. As time goes on, the isolation from humanity and the mysterious essence of the light within the lighthouse causes Ephraim to lose track of the time he's been on the island and questions his own sanity.DIRECTION:
The direction of this film is fantastic. One of the highlights. It's shot in a very strange aspect ratio which adds a bit of mystique to the film. I was also a fan of the choice to make it black and white giving it a weirdly noir feel to it even though it's the furthest thing from noir. Robert Eggers is coming off ""The Witch"" which is a film that I liked a lot so I was naturally curious to see where this film would go. The way he captures the performances of Pattinson and Dafoe really adds to the performances themselves using angles that make you, the audience member, question the sanity of the film.WRITING:
The writing for this film is where I find the most flaws. I understand that this writing was based around some sort of Greek mythology, however, to me it didn't make the film that much better for me. Through that understanding I did get where they were going and it helped me not totally dislike this film (along with the directing and phenomenal performances). Unfortunately, for me the writing didn't always keep my attention. I didn't really leave this film thinking about it other than just wondering what in the world this film was trying to express. I'm not a damn Greek mythologist.ACTING:
WILLEM DAFOE FOR PRESIDENT! Is there any role that this man can't play? He's been Jesus, Vincent Van Gogh, a Motel owner and Norman Osborn in a padded Halloween costume. Now he's a crazy wicky (however you spell that). He's so good at playing a drunk lighthouse worker that's playing off your own sanity. Then you have Robert Pattinson who has just proven that the Twilight films were solely for exposure and had poor direction. Between this and Good Time, I can not wait to see him as Batman. Both Dafoe and Pattinson also work so well off of each other that in the end I think they're who totally saved this film from going off the rails.CONCLUSION:
This film resulted as a disappointment for me when I was so excited after Robert Eggers' ""The Witch."" There was a real element of suspense that I was interested in pursuing in The Witch, but the element of suspense in this film, a.k.a the lighthouse, didn't keep me interested and in my opinion didn't satisfy me in the end. The shots were really well done and both acting performances were definitely worth a nomination. To answer the question if I believe this film will be nominated for Best Picture or if either Dafoe or Pattinson will be nominated, I doubt it. I do believe Pattinson should for Best Supporting, but the Acting category is a little too stacked for Dafoe, although I wouldn't be mad if he was.",The Lighthouse
274,WooderIce64,A Cinematic Experience,9,22 January 2020,"The Lighthouse is a film that cannot be explained. There is no way to grasp this film other than to see it for yourself. No one can tell you about this movie. It's something that needs to be experienced. The premise is simple on paper. It follows two lighthouse keepers (Robert Pattinson and Willem Dafoe) as they descend into madness together after months of isolation. That's only what it is on the surface level. There is much beneath it, most of which is up for interpretation. There are several fan theories that exist about this movie. I personally think it's about the innate human desire to seek something greater than itself. The thing that binds them is the connection to Greek mythology. For instance, the film's final scene clearly refers to the story of Prometheus.It's the work of Robert Eggers, who previously directed The VVitch. One thing that those two movies share is the fact that they use period accurate language. In the case of The Lighthouse, they talk in sailor lingo, particularly Willem Dafoe's character. It adds a sense of authenticity, like a window into a different era. Speaking of authenticity, the movie features a square frame and is shot in black and white. The cinematography is excellent. The performances, especially from Dafoe, are unforgettable, with the dialogue and contrast between these characters build tension, which concludes in chaos. The ending, without giving too much away, was also similar to that of The VVitch, in a good way. Another great thing about this movie is that it makes the sea itself feel like a character.The Lighthouse is an experience. It's not for everyone, though. It takes an open mind to see meaning in the madness. It's not a movie that you can go into without knowing what you're getting into. And if you go in with an open mind, maybe some background knowledge, you'll find a masterpiece of film.",The Lighthouse

If it was color I think it would still be good but not as effective. The color pallet is beautiful, I hope for the ONE Oscar it was nominated for it wins because it needs to win SOMETHING, I mean come on this is nearly a masterpiece if not A MASTERPIECE",The Lighthouse

The atmosphere is intense and dark and cinematography is beautiful and the acting is just phenomenal. But what the story tries to tell is largely symbolic and as it unfolds it shows how the two characters warm upto each other and their pasts are revealed have some shades of homoerotic tension.

278,ernestsavesxmas,The blackest black comedy ever made?,9,18 December 2019,"I loved The Lighthouse. I loved it in a way where I don't really care if its myriad and fully insane THINGS/IDEAS are backed up by discernable thematic intentions. I could go down a million rabbit holes and come out someplace different each time. And I kind of love that. And the criticism of that is fair: that it's just a series of Choose Your Own Adventure Rorschach tests. Personally I felt like there was a clear indication of ""what was really going on."" And if my interpretation is completely off-base, that's fine. I'll refrain from sharing it here as I feel like the movie is still too new to pollute the web with theories; just go see it, make up your own mind. There was that viral review of Endgame recently about how Endgame was critic-proof. A film like The Lighthouse is also critic-proof in a way, though for completely antithetical reasons perhaps. So I'll keep this brief.There are two things I feel worth mentioning. One, as you might have heard or read: this does play like a black comedy, it hits all the beats. It actually might be the blackest black comedy ever made. Secondly, while it also works as a perfect pair to Eggers's first film The Witch (themes of isolation, funny language, etc etc), it's so completely different in a lot of different ways (my previous point being the best example). It's one of the best films of 2019 period, and Eggers is proving to be nothing short of a genius, entering the shortlist of directors whose films you MUST go see in theaters. I'll leave it at that. Now go see for yourself. I don't wanna spill the beans.",The Lighthouse

It's a stunning achievement of filmmaking right here with it's jaw-dropping cinematography, fantastic screenplay, amazing and creepy sound design, outstanding performances from both Willem Dafoe and Robert Pattinson, striking editing, fascinating characters and magnificent direction. It's a haunting and engaging film that will stay with me forever, despite the fact that it's just a story about two people, who are trapped on a island going insane and experiencing some weird stuff.The cinematography is probably the biggest highlight of the film, since it's shot in 35 mm film, 1.19:1 aspect ratio and being black and white, which is amazing to look at and the lighting really helped to create the atmosphere, which also helps a lot to not make the whole film stale, since it's set in only one location, which is the island. This and alongside with it's costume design and production design really gives the feeling that the film was made in the early 1900s, which is fantastic.The music was also one of the aspects that was the highlight of the film. It was fantastic in the way it builds the atmosphere and was used in the right moments and it's definitely the best score of 2019.The only complain that i have with the music may not be a huge problem for many, since it can be easily forgiven, but there are a few occasions where the music sounded a bit generic (i had the chance of listening to the soundtrack after i saw the film for the first time. There are over 13 tracks and there are only four that i didn't liked. Those tracks are ""Mermaid Lust / Stabbing the Charm"", ""Why'd Ya Spill Yer Beans?"", ""Filthy Dog"" and ""The Light Belongs to Me"". You can tell from the names of the tracks what moments they play them in the film) and unfortunately the soundtrack doesn't work on it's own if you decide to buy it and listen to it.""The Lighthouse"" is excellent. It's unfortunate that it didn't managed to get the perfect 10/10 from me, because of the problem that i have with it, but the experience was something that i haven't had before and it will be very hard to forget. It completely deserves all of the praises that it's getting. For now it's my favorite film of 2019 and it's definitely one of the best film of the decade and one of my favorite film of all time.

However, it is not based on a true story, so the movie had all the opportunities to make this a suspenseful watch - it did not.The story's premise is very cliched and had everyone fooled that it would not turn out to be the predictable story it was heading for. The characters are well acted, but they are not really compelling. Perhaps due to their conversations, which may be accurate at the time, felt completely void of substance. So was the conclusion of the movie, which gave the feeling of wasted time.The aspect ratio and the black & white colouring were simply unnecessary gimmicks and the overly sexual content and off-putting imagery throughout were sad attempts to cover up for the very lacking story.The movie was busy having Dafoe fart in the first 15 minutes, which was a red-flag about this being a movie void of substance.

285,c-kelsall,An incomparable vision of Hell on Earth,9,2 March 2020,"Robert Eggers' second (?) feature is a superb piece of mind-bending cinema. There are parallels with his earlier film, The Witch, elements of psychological horror which Eggers clearly finds interesting and hopefully hasn't finished exploring just yet.
The decision to film in black and white is a stroke of genius. Every scene is filled with ominous portent and obscuring shadows. The film plays with our perceptions and moods throughout. There are moments of comedy amongst the gloom, the two men stranded on the rock endure a tumultuous relationship, by turns suspicious, angry and even savage, then there are unexpected moments of comradeship fuelled by alcohol. We are forced to question constantly who is mad, or perhaps madder? Are they in the grip of a storm, or are they in Hell?
And the soundtrack! No one I can think of uses sound to create atmosphere quite like Eggers. Foghorns, the relentlessly howling wind, the seagulls; is it any wonder if they were as mad as a box of frogs?
Willem Dafoe is absolutely fantastic in The Lighthouse. He really should be considered for an Oscar for his turn as the saltiest of old seadogs, spouting rage-filled Melville-esque invective straight from Davey Jones' locker, at sporadic intervals. I don't think there are many actors who could've pulled off that performance with such aplomb. He chews the scenery mercilessly, but it is exactly what the role requires; his Thomas Wake is a force of nature in human form.
The Lighthouse won't be to everyone's taste, and it would be a mistake to view it as a moody twin sister of The Witch (which was a genuine horror); but I found it to be mesmerising and intriguing, and a fabulously well-crafted psychological drama with trimmings of horror.",The Lighthouse

Like The Witch, I think folk can read what they want into what the point of this movie was, but the script is not existent and the viewer does the work so that the Eggers brothers don't have to.

I was left wondering if the film was an allegory for something, and normally I would let myself savor and consider that, but by the time I got to the end of Lighthouse didn't care, all my good will was used up by all that bickering.

290,adeckofcards,The magic of uncertainty,10,2 May 2020,"From the first moment, when the characters arrive at the lighthouse, we realize that we are facing an atypical work in the horror genre.
With very few characters, only two perfectly portrayed by Dafoe and Pattinson, Robert Eggers teaches a very different horror tale. There are no scares or monstrous threats, simply a narrative written through images with the sole aim of confusing the viewer. Eggers frames the shots within a ratio of ¾ to increase the feeling of confinement, uses a linear montage to create uncertainty between what is real and what could be hallucination. All this creates an atmosphere where the viewer is in charge of creating his own story regarding what he is experiencing. The film never gives a very clear signal about any correct interpretation, which greatly favors this tape.
Robert Eggers has managed to create a story or narrative with such a well-crafted visual narrative that it is impossible to be unsatisfied when the end comes. With all this in mind, it is not unreasonable to claim that 'The Lighthouse' is a masterpiece of horror cinema.",The Lighthouse

299,rustonreviews,"Egger's second film is a sombre, haunting experience.",8,13 February 2020,"Arguably, the sophomore effort of any artist (whether they're a filmmaker, musician or author) stands as one of the most vital pieces of work in their career. There is no mistaking the importance of an impressive debut, but it's that 'difficult second album syndrome' that can make or break an artist. Any medium has their fair share of one hit wonders. Just look at Richard Kelly, the writer/director of Donnie Darko (2001). Robert Eggers arrived on the scene with a striking debut in the form of The Witch (2015); a terrifying, unnerving horror film that established him as one of the most innovative upcoming voices in horror cinema. Loosely influenced by Edgar Allan Poe's unfinished The Light-House, Egger's sophomore effort follows two lighthouse keepers, Ephraim Wilmslow (Pattinson) and Thomas Wake (Dafoe) who fight to maintain hold of their sanity once they're left stranded on a remote island. Shot in black and white with an aspect ratio of 1.19:1 to ensure a claustrophobic aesthetic, The Lighthouse is an absurd descent into insanity and a remarkably bizarre experience that is both nightmarish and oddly beautiful all at once.Dafoe and Pattinson are on top form here; they're a fantastic duo and their unhinged performances carry the film entirely. Though Eggers choses not to fixate on character development, the power of the performances comes from the maddening depictions of desperation, lunacy and cold-blooded fury as the storm intensifies and the surreal hallucinations elevate in intensity. The Lighthouse isn't a film dedicated to telling a concrete storyline, either. Instead, it finds its own unique style of storytelling through haunting soundscapes and distorted visuals. At times, it all feels very Lynchian. Jarin Blaschke's cinematography is gorgeously sombre, and Valeriia Karaman makes a brief yet unsettling appearance as the alluring Mermaid who sparks both fear and arousal within the two leading men. Much of the film could be interpreted as one never-ending nightmare when factoring in the bleakness of its aesthetic, the claustrophobia of its aspect ratio and the eeriness of its atmosphere. It's hard not to be utterly transfixed by what Eggers has crafted here. The Lighthouse is all parts haunting, baffling, unsettling, intense and occasionally humorous. This is a sophomore effort is a fascinating and supremely memorable watch, cementing Egger's as one of the most interesting voices in contemporary cinema.",The Lighthouse
300,andrewburgereviews,Light in the madness,7,19 January 2020,"Often when we get a movie which involves its characters going insane, the viewer is obscured, safeguarded and immune to the maddening effects that its characters endures. We vicariously watch on as people become consumed by insanity. Robert Eggers' ""The Lighthouse"" does not work that way. Up until its ending I was asking myself about the nature of its supernatural elements. How much of what I'm seeing is real and how much of it involves my experience filtered through the eyes of the young Thomas (Robert Pattinson).The movie involves two characters. Thomas Howard (Robert Pattinson) and Willem Dafoe (Thomas Wake). Howard arrives at an isolated lighthouse of a New England coast in the 1890s as a caretaker under the command of Wake. The latter is quite the character. He is a superstitious, quirky but also irritating (and flatulent) old man, who has spent so much time in that lighthouse that his vocabulary involves sea-savvy whimsical idioms more than actual English. Seriously, this guy would give Captain K'nuckles and the entire cast of ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" a run for their money. Not to mention how articulate he is portrayed by Willem Dafoe in a role built for him. So, Wake and the monotony, isolation and sheer nature of the island slowly drives Howard insane.Speaking of which, let me recall a scene. Later in the movie, Wake chases Howard with an axe after which he tells Howard that it was him who did the chasing. The fact that this scene takes place late in the movie is a good choice because we are already under the influence of its mischievous nature. Was Wake lying or did we simply experience the scene from Howard's twisted point of view? Was it real? It also helps the movie is filmed in an unconventional 1.19:1 aspect ratio which is thinner than the classic 4:3. It helps the claustrophobic effects. The black-and-white also helps. Many shots involve darkness and only one source of light often placed in the middle of the shot which would then seem to fade towards its margins giving the illusion of barely anything on the screen.This light is what all the characters aspire to. Wake would climb the lighthouse every night and lock himself up venerating it. It is a symbol of serenity and clarity of mind. So dear to him, that its presence gives him uncontrollable, even sexual pleasure as Howard sees him naked and masturbating one time. This is such a crucial element to these two characters' survival that Wake wants it all for itself. At first, he argues that Howard should not go up there because is none of its business and that he should see to his chores. Later in the movie, ""The light is mine!"" Wake yells. At this point it is confirmed its importance to him is of a spiritual, theological nature.So while ""The Lighthouse"" is a success, it also nearly ruins itself by its exaggerated self-awareness and self-consciousness. Like Peter Griffin would say: ""it insists upon itself... it insists upon itself, Lois."" But here is true! Through its augmented audio-visual effects this movie wants you to know how great it is. Yet it just comes off as proud and is uncalled for. The way it torments its characters also makes me confused on how should I distribute my care. As it was getting closer to its ending, I couldn't care less how it ended. No ending would be wrong, but then again, no ending would be the singular correct one either.",The Lighthouse

Using black and white helps create a moody atmosphere and it helps create dynamic tension and a sense of the movie's time-period. As others pointed out, the story is not the main thrust here. Rather, it's the grittiness and the antagonism between the characters. The two men are almost like members in a bad marriage who despise each other but still remain together. Their portrayal of the characters is amusing and pithy. As the movie progresses, it becomes more of an art piece with supernatural realism. It's an interesting endeavor and I believe it succeeds well.",The Lighthouse

When it comes to acting both actors did amazing especially Pattinson. The movie also has a lot of mythology mentions and we can see that in the mermaid and seagull scenes and as well in a lot of quotes, and I personally love mythology. Although all these positive points the hard to rate part is due the narrative. This is clearly an interpretive movie where everybody can make a different meaning out of the same scene and a lot of the theories I've read are really interesting. I love interpretative movies and visually of this are a 10/10 but the narrative although being interpretative didn't captivated my attention as much as the visuals, and for that fact I think that the story could have been better crafted and implied more thinks that it already does because that ending seems really loose to me, the other interpretative movies that I've watched the ending clearly implied something but not directly and then every person would make his own mind, this movie ending didn't implied nothing at all so as far as I Know I can think that all of this was just a dream.
And that Is hard to rate because I loved it and I don't at the same time, all of this movie means everything and nothing at the same time like that lantern scene we didn't saw what's in there but it could be everything and nothing it doesn't matter because was enough to drive Ephraim crazy like the movie is driving me crazy right now.",The Lighthouse
310,LProductions-837-667666,A True Rarity: A Horror Film for Intelligent Adults,10,20 December 2019,"In one of my 1-Star rants on IMBd, I declared that for a ""horror"" movie with a very high rating (7.7, I believe) a new film admittance rating should be crated which would assure that an audience would be strictly limited to girls 14 or younger who had never seen a horror movie (and their parents could wait in the parking lot).Back when I was growing up in the 1960s we had fright flicks starring the unforgettable Vincent Price, many of which hold up today, and the campy William Castle gimmick-driven scream-fests. Then in the 1970s came William Friedkin's ""The Exorcist"" and, even more important, a redefinition of the genre by Stanley Kubrick with ""The Shining:"" a true horror film for adults.But it was a once in a lifetime masterwork. Soon came the seemingly-endless era of the franchises: ""Halloween,"" ""Nightmare on Elm Street,"" etc. all geared to the teenage crowd.So I was totally surprised that Robert Eggers' ""The Lighthouse"" turned out to be a companion to Kubrick's one-time delve into the genre, and is strictly aimed at adults.Where do I start?The lighting and black-and-white cinematography of Jarin Blaschke is simultaneously beautiful, haunting, chilling, and totally riveting, and elevates Craig Lathrop's production design to high art. All the while Mark Korvin's score is geared to perfection in every frame of the film. Eggers' screen play, co-authored with his brother, Max, draws upon many historic sources ranging from Shakespeare to actual logs of 19th century lighthouse keepers.Eggers is a newcomer to directing, with only one 2015 feature on his résumé, and delivers a stunning film, magnificently paced, and gets what promises to be two legendary performances from his stars.Big ""spoiler"" here:There are only two people in the entire film.Willem Dafoe, a favourite for mine for many years (I particularly enjoy his gleefully disgusting Bobby Peru in David Lynch's 1990 ""Wild at Heart""), has been nominated for fours Oscars over a 32-year-period, and it's a sin he hasn't won at least won. Here he again shows the unbelievable range of his craft. That's actually him buried under his own facial hair as the demented lighthouse keeper Thomas Wake.(Do read all of the trivia supplied by IMDb: it is truly fascinating.)Robert Pattinson is new to me as, it seems, he is most known for a recurring role in the ""Twilight"" franchise, another series geared to teenagers to which I would never consider giving a minute of my time. He is stunning in every aspect and virtually carries the greater weight of the film (rather literally!). I enjoyed his crazed Dauphin in this year's ""The King"" and look forward to seeing him expand his range of roles as he gains maturity (although I doubt if his chance at recreating Batman will interest me).Kids will find this a bore: too slow, not gory enough, no love scenes, black-and-white, in an almost square aspect ratio (no glaring Technicolor widescreen blood and guts in this one), and a screen play far above their comprehension.For adults it's a marvel, a stunning achievement which will send shivers down your spine for days after your first viewing. It's a film which demands to be seen more than once.",The Lighthouse

I'm not sure what the point of this film was. I realize it was horror, but I found no inspiring message to cull here, and the stunning cinematography and talented acting can only carry you so far.

312,k_g_barreto,One of the best films of the decade,10,3 January 2020,"The Lighthouse is one of the best films of the decade. The story, set in the 19th century, follows Ephraim Winslow, that is contrated to be a wickie on an island for four weeks, and he is under supervision of Thomas Wake. Here, the psychological horror is present. Thomas doesn't allow that Ephrain access the lighthouse for some reason, making Ephrain curious on why and what's on the light. The film is incredibly done, it is a masterpiece, I watched two times, the first one I didn't really feel it, but the second changed my vision. The horror tone here is more 'sophisticated', for the lack of a better word, than in The VVitch, previous film of Robert Eggers. There is two scenes that were really disturbing and unsettling that made me scared: When Ephrain sees a mermaid in a nightmare. Ephrain enters the waters and the sight of the mermaid swimming, and then her cry, a sound that is frightening, disturbing, that thing gave me shivers, some king of ancient fear, I never thought I woulf be scared of mermaids, that whole sequence have something lovecraftian, as the whole movie. And when Ephrain goes to the light, when he's already completely mad. He's sees the light and begins to scream, while the light begins to 'cover' his face. The sound when he screams is also disturbing, and macabre.The Sound Design here is something special. The lighthouse sound, that is loud and unsettling, the mermaid cry, those helped create this horror atmosphere, as well as the wind blowing loud, the storms, that we hear trough the whole film, those are really perfectly done. The atmosphere here is astonishing, Robert Eggers is perfect on this, the atmosphere of both The VVitch and The Lighthouse have transports you into the period the film takes place, here, the black-and-white and the 1.19:1 ratio helped give the late 19th century feeling. There is also the lovecraftian feeling: the tentacles, sinister sea creatures, the unreliable narrator, the madness and the psychological horror.Of course, the perfomances here are outstanding. Robert Pattinson portrays Ephrain, a character you can't rely on, spectacularly. In his eyes and looks, you can sense the tension and some king of evilness. Pattinson is good portraying the kind of characters you can't trust or that are morally grey, as seen in Good Time. Also, he portrayed the shyness Ephrain has with excellence. And in the last moments, when Ephrain goes completely mad, Pattinson really nailed it. The same goes to Willem Dafoe, portraying Thomas Wake as the older man who is dominant over Pattinson. His accent is really catchy, really well done, makes the film even more immersive. The best parts are absolutelly when he goes 'berserk' and the monologues. ""Neptune strike ye dead, Winslow"", and the 'protean forms' monologue when he's being buried.Incredible direction, cinematograpy, soundtrack, sound design, the atmosphere, the acting, the psychological horror, and many more, make this film on of my favorite of the past decade, and personally, one of my favorite films of all time.",The Lighthouse

Even Pattinson is good as the lumberjack fleeing his past by hiding away on an island.

Is there a possibility that you watch a movie that stylistically you appreciate, due to the quality of the filmmaking craft, but due to its surreal nature you might not enjoy it?
That is indeed possibility.Watching 'The LIGHTHOUSE' I was asking myself what am I actually witnessing. This film is unlike any other in resent memory. Yes, not that long ago there were movies made in black and white as 'IDA', 'COLD WAR' and 'ROMA'. All of them were highly stylised, but non of them can compere to what director Robert Eggers who had already success with brilliant period horror 'THE WITCH' delivered with 'THE LIGHTHOUSE', a surreal, hypnotic and hallucinatory tale of two lighthouse keepers on a remote and mysterious New England island in the 1890s.Everything about this film is highly unusual.
From 1.19:1 very square aspect ratio, to an old fashioned Mono sound mix. There are elements of film noir as well as German impressionism which 'The Lighthouse' borrows heavily from. This is a very strange movie indeed. Alfred Hichcock once famously said; ""If it's a good movie, the sound could go off, and audience would have perfectly clear idea of what was going on""Now, in 'The Lighthouse' the actual sound design is superb and I strongly believe that it might get the nomination for an Oscar early this year. Though 19 people are listed on IMDb in sound department, so it might be difficult to single one person out and reward them for this very immersive sound design. It's the sound which creates the horror atmosphere that caries the viewers till the film climax. The cinematography is heavily stylised looks amazingly believable to the 1890's period full of shadows and textures which being back German Impressionists and film Noir masters from the past to mind. The production design and costumes are brilliantly historically accurate, helping with selling the overall atmosphere of the movie.However what truly elevates this film to Oscar worthy contention is acting.
Considering that this film consists of only 3 actors, it's very special indeed due to their performances we are engaged in their surreal drama till the end.
I have to be honest, half way through the movie I wanted the film to end due to heavy assault on our senses. Just like both lighthouse keepers we are pulled in to world of madness which isn't a good feeling at all. It must be said Robert Pattinson moved light years away from his youthful performance in 'Twilight' and became solid leading man.
In this film he shows his acting ability using heavy old British dialect which sometimes might be difficult to understand, His characterization is full of depth and will forward him further on to the quest on perfecting his craft. This role has been very heavy on him not only mentally but also physically.But the real highlight of 'The Lighthouse' is often underrated Willem Dafoe. It would be a huge shame if the Academy wouldn't showcase their good taste and snub Defoe from a rightful nomination for the Best Supporting Actor on this year's Oscar awards.
His performance is mesmerizing! He totally inhabits his role, from brilliant accent to intensity and duality that often is rewarded by the Academy. Also in this film he truly physically suffers. There is one scene which starts in a long shot, where he crawls like a dog for close to 30 seconds going through mud and stones only to be buried alive as he delivers one of the movie's most powerful monologs. He does't play the character he simply becomes him and this is what makes him one of the best character actors of his generation, the depth and reality of his choices. Simply brilliant!!In 'The Lighthouse' director Robert Eggers delivers very original movie in age of cinema dominated by films which often lack originality. Will you enjoy this film is up to personal taste of the movie goer. The one who likes arthouse cinema will definitely appreciate the originality of how the style of the story is being told, but more casual audience which likes more commercial narrative movies might leave cinema disappointed.I for one, although this film is not for everyone and its open to interpretation considering its surreal style, feel that 'The Lighthouse' belongs in the top 5 best films of the year and should be rewarded, for venturing in highly stylised world, crafted by the whole cast and crew, which makes this film a surreal masterpiece.",The Lighthouse
316,lumieretrain,The Lighthouse by Robert Eggers,8,5 March 2021,"The stories set in an isolated island, where there is not so many things left, are usually told in the psychological way to see how the main characters would move forward with their job; by even facing, in the most unexpected ways, some nightmare scenarios which would affect the main characters psychologically and bring them into madness. Some stories would end with the main characters, who have imagined everything to be an illusion; other stories would end with the main characters, who face some of the most horrifying consequences. The filmmaker Robert Eggers seems intrigued to tell a story, which is set in an isolated island; to be specifically concentrated most of the time in the lighthouse, but set in the 1890s rather than in nowadays. After a long time work, in 2019 came out The Lighthouse by Robert Eggers with Willem Dafoe and Robert Pattinson. The movie's plot: In the 1890s, two lighthouse keepers, Thomas Wake (Willem Dafoe) and Ephraim Winslow (Robert Pattinson), who arrived in a remote island of New England to work; while they move forward with their job, they slowly start to lose sanity by having horrifying images, which make them lose their reality. From the beginning to the end, the movie captures the audience attention; especially by telling the story in the darkest way, with atmospheric moments to scare the audience as well as to elevate the tension. The dialogues and the monologues have been elaborated, to be expressed in the old English of 1890s; by making the story much expressive of the time set in 1890s, which show the way the main characters would talk with each other. The production designer Craig Lathrop has created the settings, which have all of the specific details to make them look periodic in every spaces walked and touched by the main characters. The costume designer Linda Muir has elaborated the costumes, to be accurate with the period and the way the main character would dress. The cinematographer Jarin Blaschke has captured some of the essential frames, needed to create dark atmospheres to connect with the themes of the movie. By creating the atmospheres much darker, it has been used the lighting in the precise way, to let the darkness surround the settings and light in the specific angles, by creating visually the darkness of the images to be unforgettable. The movie uses the aspect ratio of 1.19:1, instead of a wide aspect ratio, which is the same aspect ratio used by the classic movies of 1900s; as the square aspect ratio describes, how both of the main characters are the only ones to be in the remote island. In the same way, by maintaining the dark atmospheres and elevate the tension of the audience, the story is told in black & white instead of being told in colors; as the black & white images, connects with the dark settings of the story as well as with the themes of the movie. The editor Louise Ford has elaborated the narration's rhythm, with unexpected moments which would surprise the audience; especially by using different scenes to combine with each other, to create some scary sequences which the suspense works from getting a slow rhythm until it accelerates to elevate the audience tension. The score by Mark Korven has been elaborated to connect with the dark atmospheres, as well as with the madness of the main characters, which is slowly increasingly to get worse. Willem Dafoe was extraordinary as Thomas Wake, the older lighthouse keeper who would give most of the time orders to Ephraim Winslow, while he controls most of the things to be put in order; since the madness starts to take, he starts to tell absurd stories as well as to shout and insult Ephraim. Robert Pattinson was excellent as Ephraim Winslow, the younger lighthouse keeper who would obey all of the orders and do the heaviest jobs; since the madness starts to take, he starts to have hallucinations, to be mostly images of horror. The Lighthouse is one of the best movies of 2019, as well as one of the scariest movies filled with unforgettable dark images.",The Lighthouse

I watched the precursor to this effort, the 30s mono one and that was passably good so in some respects a remake might make some sense but sadly this film made no sense whatsoever... plot? Not much sign of that essential.... And I really like The Shining which needs no explanation re booze and barminess. And have read SF stories about loneliness in space arks etc or maybe up in the log cabin... the Simpsons episode springs to mind and at least that was funny, Lighthouse is devoid of a lighter touch (ouch, sorry about that pun) either in the action/dialog or cinematography...
Finally, it puzzles me how such a seemingly fragile house next to the tower would survive a storm... later not a slate is dislodged and it's dry everywhere... but that is a minor point in this morass of a movie which would likely just get by were it a 15 minute art project.",The Lighthouse

This is the set-up for Mr. Eggers' newest movie, already famous for being made in black&white and using a squarish screen similar to the earliest screen frames in cinema; and also for being essentially a two character movie. Strike one, strike two, strike three - sounds like a recipe for disaster, on the surface. And, despite the many glowing reviews, it will never, of course, be really popular. But until recent times, a movie was considered a hit if it made just a little bit of money beyond its production costs.
By those once normal standards, The Lighthouse should be a hit. Kubrick explored similar thematic material in THE SHINING, but in that movie, Jack Torrance had victims (his wife and son) which were targets of his madness. These lighthouse keepers have no one but each other on which to unleash their growing rages. No plot summary can ever get at the energy, creepiness and intensity that permeates this masterpiece. Finally the movie becomes a shocking vision of the human condition: humanity on the edge, self-destructive and filled with rage - horror, indeed.",The Lighthouse

It's very bizarre and lacks any real mainstream hook that could get an audience really invested in its story. It boils down to just two guys, working in a lighthouse, they're both are stranded on an island, and they slowly descend into madness until they turn on each other. While it maybe lacking in the story department, the execution is flawless to me. Robert Eggers is a director that seems really invested in the worlds he creates in his head, and the words he writes on the page. Everything about this film has so much detail from the biggest monologue to the smallest prop on a set. I can't wrap my head around how atmospheric and well crafted the production design is. The way it's shot, the way it's photographed in black and white. I just fall in complete awe with this film every time I watch it. Is there a point? In the general scheme of things probably not. But the experience of learning about these characters, getting to know one another, and seeing them slowly turn on each other is just mesmerizing. It makes for an excellent acting study especially from the great Mr. Willem Defoe who was totally robbed an Oscar nomination for this film. The Lighthouse is a film from 2019 that I still think about on a daily basis that's how much of an impact it had on me. It's a movie that's made by someone who really understands the purpose of the art form, and how it can make us feel so many different emotions. There's horror, but there's also comedy. There's drama, but also romance possibly? I think it's a film that will make an impact on people for years in a way the Witch did. And I will definitely do my best to share it with people as much as I can!!",The Lighthouse
321,faroukgulsara,The invention that saved a million ships,8,20 March 2020,"When we were young, we were fascinated with the lighthouse. Any sketch of nature would include seas, boats, seagulls, clouds and flashing beacons. As Penang, our hometown is a port city, we had the pleasure of seeing many in our lifetimes.Many stories have been written on the heroic deeds of many a keeper or 'wickies' as they were referred to put their lives at stake to provide a continuous beacon of light to the safety of travelling vessels. The job is an unrewarding one with boredom being the most significant and dangerous occupational hazard to beat. Being located far from civilisation and at precarious locations, access to these places may be easily compromised by inclement weather. Hence, the keepers may sometimes be stranded for months altogether. Solitude was thought to be the single most typical reason for the prevalence of madness in the profession. Another possible aetiology of insanity could be mercury poisoning. In the older models of Fresnel Lens that were used in lighthouses, the lens and light were floated on mercury. The job of regularly cleaning the mercury of impurities exposed the 'wickies' to mercury poisoning. One of the symptoms of mercury poisoning can be the onset of mental derangement.Neurological symptoms used to be seen in hat makers. The felt used in their work contained mercury. Thus, came the saying, 'mad as a hatter'.In this day and age, with the advancements in GPS and navigational technologies, are lighthouses still relevant? These days, they are automated and are there just as a backup just in case all the modern tools crash, fail or run out of power supply.Edgar Allan Poe's last book that he had hardly started before his death in 1849 was unofficially named 'The Light House'. It was a collection of log entries of a newly appointed lighthouse keeper, and the theme was loneliness.This 2019 film was written with that idea in mind. A rookie is employed to be in a lighthouse under the supervision of a grumpy elderly keeper. The dynamics of their relationship, their unrelenting efforts to keep the beacon of light alive while maintaining their sanity in that cold, damp and hostile environment forms the basis of this psychological drama. Like 1963 'Birds', viewers will never look at a seagull in the same way again. Those scary birds can peck your eyeballs out!",The Lighthouse

William Dafoe was great as usual. He deserves himself an Oscar but I'm afraid this won't be the year. Pattinson... well, I'm cautiously optimistic when seeing the star from Twilight fame pop up in anything but his performance was good too. It's likely the best of his career so far.My praise stops there. As far as Eggers goes, The Witch was one of my most hated films in recent memory. With that, I should've known better than to trust it again. After seeing The Lighthouse...

326,ShaeSpencer,A tremendously ballsy film to make.,9,16 August 2020,"It was shocking and delightful how funny this movie is when it wants to be, and those moments are made all the funnier by the earnestness with which they're performed, and especially by the juxtaposition against the surreal, abstract, abject, gnawing horror that churns and crashes throughout the film. Willem Dafoe was tremendously good. Rob was great. The cinematography, music, sound, writing, experimentation (the moment of extreme sound distortion near the very end!!), THE DIALOGUE, and the performances were all great. Every scene where they got wasted together was such a treasure.",The Lighthouse

Illuminated by stellar performances from Dafoe and Pattinson, The Lighthouse is a psychological intrigue that will leave audiences baffling, both in a good and bad way, but undeniably evoked by it's imagery and seemingly flawless banter and chemistry among it's leads.

Films that claim art by confusing an audience are missed opportunities and Lighthouse is very proud of itself in delivering a very unsatisfying finish. Just as things start to get pieced together, you are bombarded with extremely bizarre visuals that ultimately lead nowhere. Yes, you figure out almost as soon as the film starts that madness is the true protagonist. As our two main characters are forced into feeding off each other's madness we learn more about them, but there's no reveals regarding anything at all that makes them interesting. This film is an in depth exploration of what it means to go mad, but there is no context to show where anything is leading. It could have been a masterpiece, and that in itself makes it that much more irritating.",The Lighthouse

Not that there's anything ""uplifting"" about it. It's as grim as can be. Reminds me of the black & white masterpieces of Ingmar Bergman.
Willem Dafoe never gets enough credit for how fantastic he can be.
I'd like to see Eggers do Kafka, in black & white of course. Maybe ""The Metamorphosis,"" or ""The Trial,"" if he'd like to challenge those who came before.
I think Eggers is one of the guys who could take on Pynchon, but B&W wouldn't do. He'd have to expand into color.",The Lighthouse

I don't often say this but I wish I could have my 1 hour and 50 minutes back as I've never been so bored watching a film. The only reason this has 2 stars and not 1 is because of the absolutely brilliant acting from both leads. Second to none and I applaud them both for that. But unfortunately, how I see is, there's no film without a good storyline. I could've wrote a script like that with a bucket full of randomness occuring.It actually reminded me of Birdman in that aspect.

There was no development in its bleakness. Didn t even feel empathic for the character trying to see and experience the light and get out of his psychosis without success. Not a film without its merits though. Would have been better on stage instead on film",The Lighthouse
338,jonsefcik,The Lighthouse: A Religious Hot Take,10,22 October 2020,"Robert Eggers is quickly becoming one of my favorite filmmakers. His unorthodox style is as entrancing as it is unsettling. Some may write this movie off as pretentious garbage, others call it a masterpiece of psychological horror. If you haven't guessed yet, I fall in line with the latter, and have my own off-the-wall literary hot take on The Lighthouse:Winslow is Tom Howard, a man who murdered his coworker and later died while he was still a logger by the Hudson Bay. He really did die by drowning or hypothermia like Tom Wake hypothesizes. Since Wake and Howard have the same first name, a lot of people like to interpret the film as all happening in the subconscious of the main character. I like to think Tom Howard is dead from the very start, and this film is the afterlife.My interpretation makes a lot more sense if you've read The Great Divorce by C.S. Lewis. I don't think the filmmakers had this intention in mind, but for me so much adds up. The novel is basically an analogy for the afterlife, where ""purgatory"" is this expansive grey plain next to mountains, which you must climb to attain a higher state of being or ""heaven"". Everyone starts off on the grey plain. If you are able to continue climbing the mountain to the point where your state of being would make it uncondicive to turn back, you'll find you had started off in purgatory but ascended to heaven, or at least the first level of it. If you stay on the grey plain, you'll find you were in hell all along.The island and lighthouse are purgatory, and if he can attend to his duties and not kill a seabird for four weeks, he earns the right to heaven. How appropriate this ""grey plain"" is filmed in black and white. Coincidence? I think not! Anyways, not killing a seabird is one of the rules because if he has the capacity to achieve the objective good despite the temptation, he proves he at the very least has the capacity for further reform. When he kills the gull, Tom has sealed his fate. He is now in hell, and his Promethean fate is inevitable. I'm undecided as to whether Wake is an angel or demon. I like to believe angel since Dafoe portrays a hint of fear and regret when reciting the sea curse to resign Tom to his fate. Either way, he is an agent sent to test Tom by being his annoying farting coworker, while at the same time playing a fair game and laying down the ground rules to give him a chance. The rules are you can't kill a seabird, you can't go into the top of the lighthouse, the weather and food are terrible, and every time you pleasure yourself it will always be to a shrieking freaky mermaid. After he kills the bird, the weather keeps getting worse, and the boat (a substitute for the bus in The Great Divorce) will never return.The lighthouse represents, in the broadest sense, the truth. They say no mortal can experience God without completely losing their sanity. A lighthouse is usually a beacon of hope and offers a course of guidance. Now that Winslow is damned, he will never be worthy, and the light simply serves as an inevitable temptation. When he does look at it, he is so overwhelmed he cannot function anymore. Its also worth noting that in The Great Divorce, none of characters can die since they're already dead. You can get gravely injured though, and you just have to lie there in agony for weeks while your ""body"" heals. In that respect, the Promethean fate is a brilliantly twisted form of torture for him.",The Lighthouse

340,d_carlotaj,"""The Lighthouse,"" Perfection",10,28 January 2020,"""The Lighthouse,"" (2019). Director, Robert Eggers. Written by Robert and Max Eggers. Starring Willem Dafoe and Robert Pattinson. This film is absolutely a tour de force and a most remarkable film. As you might guess, light and dark figure predominately. The director chose to shoot it in black and white to evoke a more dramatic effect. Lots of shadows and play on light, adding mystery to the mix. The two-man cast was perfect casting. Willem Dafoe as the Old Salt standing his ground as the captain in charge while Robert Pattinson played to perfection the new seaman working on getting his sea legs. The lighthouse was built for the movie set, a remarkable feat, making the setting a character on its own. The story had elements which echoed plot points in Billy Budd, Two Years Before the Mast, and The Long Voyage Home. Lots of research went into this screenplay: sea lore, terminology, props, myths, symbolism, costumes, characterization. The most evident characteristic of ""The Lighthouse"" was the massive amount of research that went into the writing. And there was, I dare say, not one crack in the execution of this production. But the most remarkable talent of Willem Dafoe was evident in the prodigious amount of dialog in seaman's dialect and mannerisms that he delivered to perfection. I was duly impressed. Herman Melville would have been impressed. And Eggers was inspired by him. I am sure that you will be impressed as well. I give this film 5 of 5 stars. It's on Amazon Prime. Enjoy!",The Lighthouse

The cinematography is gorgeous, the almost square aspect ratio aiding the claustrophobic feel of the entire thing. The direction is excellent, almost surgical, with not one unnecessary camera movement. This is an extremely unsettling, creepy movie, with an incredible music score to deepen the effect, with a very ambiguous story to boot, requiring multiple viewings.

I get that the black and white photography was supposed to add to the moody atmosphere but the film was downright bleak and would have been bleak even in color. As others have said, it went on seemingly forever without actually going anywhere. Pattison deserves an award for the hard work he put into the role. It really was a tour de force. Some of Defoe's monologues were poetic and delivered exceedingly well, but they also came off as pretentious.
It seemed like the director was aiming to get awards for his brilliance, but, sadly, that attempt at brilliance was far too obvious. He was successful in highlighting the talents of the two actors, but the story was rather pointless.
After watching it, I read that it was the same director who did ""The Witch"", which was another overly long movie with an unsatisfying conclusion. Both films, despite the hype they got, were disappointing.",The Lighthouse

Apart from its interesting cinematography, poetic dialogue, and excellent acting, where the movie comes into its own is in the manifold interpretations that can be gleaned.There was a lot of depth to the movie that many might write off as pretense just because of the noir flair and the purple passages of dialogue.

There is a scene where Robert Pattinson kills a gull - I wanted to do that to this movie. THE ONLY REDEEMING FACTOR IS the movie is filmed in black and white and is a great example of cinematography - otherwise, put the dvd's in the $3.00 bin at Walmart.

Director Robert Eggers uses a simple premise to create an engrossing and memorable viewing experience that will keep you on the edge of your seat. I liked aspects of his previous film, ""The Witch,"" but I found the third act underwhelming. ""The Lighthouse"" is a vast improvement - and a great example of how to get a horror movie right.Willem Dafoe, who's always good, does an amazing job. Having been familiar with Robert Pattinson only from his unremarkable turn as Edward Cullen, I was pleasantly surprised by his intense but complicated performance. The music, sound design, and visuals of ""The Lighthouse"" are captivating. However I found a few scenes poorly lit, and Willem Dafoe's dialogue is difficult to understand due to the thickness of his sailor dialect.

Incredible script.
Simply one of the most powerful pieces of filmmaking I've seen.For a real treat, read on IMDB the trivia associated with the movie-----which says more about the quality of the enterprise of writing/setting/staging/filming/editing than anything I can say here. Eggers and his brother wrote a brilliant script, and then had two extraordinary actors dramatize it so well it etches into the viewer's mind.
There have been a handful of movies with this kind of kick-in-the-seat (or gut) quality over the years. Sophie's Choice, Schindler's List, Twelve Years a Slave, .The Deerhunter, Requiem for a Dream, Ironweed.......movies like these which tattoo themselves into memory. Unforgettable visions.
The Lighthouse is one of them.
That the movie, the actors, the director, were ignored by the Oscars nominating committee --?!?!? Did they not see this movie?
The Academy award for Best Actor should have gone to both Pattinson and Dafoe. Best Director to Egger. His movie The Witch was quite good, but Lighthouse took things to a completely different level of skill.

Great music was probably the best thing I found from The Lighthouse, music that adds to the desperation and hopelessness of the two characters situation. In general, the movie could easily have been a theatre performance and I bet both Pattinson and Dafoe made quite a few improvisations along the way. To be frank, I never needed this movie to acknowledge that both are great actors.

Making winter black and white and summer techicolor, is just too contrived. If was done on a shoestring budget by up and coming film makers, well fine, but this title has household name actors.Anyway loads of tense things happen, some between the two lighthousemen who are sometimes friends sometimes enemies, but both are repulsive. The acting is excellent, filming good and but the story meh and is mostly just a collection of incidents. They seem to go mad from isloation, but in reality lighthousmen are introverts that are more than happy on their own. One man's bleak and depressing is another man's rugged and invigorating. Plenty of lighthouses are actually near villages, only a few are on some rocky island cut off from civilization.

The pretty-boy from the Stephanie Meyer vampire romances has partaken one what can only be described as a vanity project.The Lighthouse has all the trappings of an art school student film. Unconventional aspect ratio, singular setting, unintelligible dialogue, and yes, copious amounts of sex and violence. The film apparently draws inspiration from Hemingway and Edgar Allen Poe stories, although it reminds one of a particular short by science fiction author Ray Bradbury: ""The Foghorn"" - similarly about two men working in a lighthouse who unintentionally attract a large sea monster (which later became the basis for 1953's ""The Beast from 20,000 Fathoms""). Perhaps this Eggers fellow would have been better served adapting that story instead, with a tangible antagonist. What we get here is your typical psychological exploration of the monster inside us all, slowly being driven insane on a barren rocky island, as our protagonist grappled with a dark secret, with the light in the lighthouse meant to symbolize... something about the human condition. Perhaps the ending was an allusion to the Greek myth of Prometheus, although it is all very open-ended that you could read anything into it. A film about a man's internal struggle, but nothing much in the way of big ideas.I must commend the writers for giving the actors what appears to be authentic 19th century New England dialects to work with, but it was disconcerting the director did not have more faith in scaring his audience than using obligatory loud sound effects (an obnoxious piercing cry of a siren or the irritating blare of a fog horn) to make them uneasy. Never mind the blood, gore, and nudity. Subtlety is not Eggers' forte.One's time would be better spent watching the works of David Lynch or Lars Von Trier if they're in the mood for surreal, postmodern deconstructions of cinematic expressionism. Save this one for die-hard Dafoe fans.",The Lighthouse

375,Francois84,Greatness marred by ungreatness,7,6 October 2020,"'The Lighthouse' is directed and co-wrote by Robert Eggers, the same guy who directed (and I think wrote, or maybe co-wrote?) 'The Witch', a low-key horror movie set in the 1700's (I think), which seem to really nail the period setting really well in terms of bleakness and spoken dialogue.Anyway, this one is set a bit later, in early 1900's, about two men tasked by being caretakers to a lighthouse. The acting by both Willem Dafoe and Robert Pattinson is superb, but especially by Dafoe. This is some of the best character acting I've seen in some time. He really deserves an award for this performance. Similarly to 'The Witch', the look of the film feels authentic for the period, as does the spoken dialogue. Not that I'm an expert. So the acting, cinematography, and spoken dialogue is very effective. Unfortunately, I found myself being quite bored at times. There are isolated moments and flourishes of intrigue and greatness, but I found they quickly petered out. The flow of events were disjointed and fragmented, and didn't really serve the whole. In a way, you could say that the movie was less than the sum of some of its considerable strengths, but was let down by general bizarreness for the sale of it, and the likelihood is you'll be left with the sense of, 'What the hell did I just watch'? Whilst some films explain far too much, this one felt the need to explain nothing, and seemingly aimed to deliberately confound its audience. I reckon o could watch it again, because there is so much to like about this film. I just felt it fell short of greatness and lulled too often for it to be recommended without reservation.",The Lighthouse

The films sound design is perfection and perfectly builds an extremely disturbing atmosphere. The Lighthouse is the most disturbing movie I have ever seen and I fear for the mental health of Robert Eggers, the film is that insane.

382,Seb_3,What a weird movie!,8,23 July 2021,"I won't try to understand this movie to its fullest, because I simply know I wouldn't be able to after one watch. That being said I know that I loved the one hour and forty minutes and, what it thought to be, a well paced movie even if it might seem like it goes around in circles for some time. I didn't find the story to be, while interesting, the center of attention, but rather the way the story was told through the tools the filmmaker had at his disposal, like camera angles and sound - Something it accomplishes amazingly.I love the cinematography, the use of sound and the performances from Willem Dafoe and Robert Patterson, this is surely the best thing I have seen from the latter and where the movie truly shines its brightest.Everything feels well thought out and planned. You can feel the craftsmanship from the director, actors and everyone involved in the production of the light house. Through the movie you watch it open as it opens up, starting out being closed off and ""normal"" might be the right word and slowly it creeps onto you and you realize at I would say a very specific moment that it is a quite a different movie than what your first impression lead you to believe. It evolves into weird and bizarre almost other-worldly, while still consisting and telling its story on the confined space of that damned rock.The way it feels extremely different from main stream block buster movies, and frankly anything I have watched in a while is great. I really enjoyed that despite it being weird and ""black and white"" which might turn a certain amount of people of immediately. While, as I said in the beginning, I don't understand this movie to the fullest it was still a great time, maybe not a fun one per say but and interpreting one, and all I know is that I found it quite entertaining and worthwhile!8/10.",The Lighthouse

387,neoclone07,Outstanding performances and direction,8,6 January 2020,"I was eager to watch ""The lighthouse"". As a horror fan, I pay heavy attention to whatever arises as a promisse of good frightening. I enjoy all genres of dark stuff, but those with an extra detail, caring to a honed production, acting and script please me even more. So, when I read that ""The witch"" director was going to engage into a black and white ghost tale, I got anxious and waited impatientelly for the movie to come out.
I have to say that this is not a movie to every audiences. It's closer to an art film than horror per se. Movies like ""Black swan"" (which I consider a horror drama), ""Hereditary"", ""It folows"", ""Midsommar"", ""The babadook"" all got strong supernatural aspects or filled with gore moments.
The Lighthouse clearly has horrific scenes, although very few. The terror around it is built on the growing bad blood between the characters. You can't tell who's getting crazy or if both seamen are insane.
Talking about insanity, Willem Dafoe is simply superb. I guess there were no other character could fit him as perfect as this one. Robert Pattinson is totally overshadowed by him. Not that he also delivers an outstanding performance, but Dafoe is nothing less than perfect as the old former sailorman, the way he speaks his lines, limps, is jealous of his Lighthouse and portraying a sullen, glum persona.
As for the direction, we can see a patern here. The gloomy minimalistic style of Robert Eggers we can see in ""The Witch"" is back even more poignant. First, it's a black and white movie, filmed in a 1.19:1 aspect, being pratically square. His choice proved being most adequate to the movie's closed quarters scenes. There are some wideshots, but most of the movie is made through middle to close shots, which creates a claustrophobic atmosphere.
Talking about black and white... that's something one must know how to deal with. And Eggers masterfully helms it. I can say that other than Dafoe's perfomance, the other great asset here is the enviroment built upon the gray scale theme. It's like watching german expressionism, modernized to our days.
Finally, is this a horror movie? Yes and no. If you're seeking something scary that'll make you jump off your seat, better look somewhere else. ""The Lighthouse"" is a drama/thriller of insanity, despair and is made to taste fine for those who enjoy a somber tale. As horror fan, I can say it's not scaring at all. As a cinephile, I can say it's a creative murky and dreary masterpiece.",The Lighthouse

393,dpg-87522,The best of Pattinson is here,8,7 February 2020,"The ""Lighthouse"" is a film that was acclaimed by many people, whether they find it deep, with hidden meaning or were fans of ""The Witch"" (2015), and honestly I really don't have any problem with that. The direction of Eggers is very good I recognize him, the photography also, in fact, I think he should win the Oscar for best photography, the performances of Dafoe and Pattinson are very good, as they read in the title, Pattinson gives his best acting in my opinion and most likely many agree with me. And of course Dafoe also gives one of his best interpretations, and I'm really surprised that they haven't nominated him, at least his performance was better than Jonathan Pryce's ""The Two Popes"" (2019), that this was nominated, but hey I'm not from the academy. Continuing with the subject I consider that the narration is not very good in the sense that, it does not catch you, you can get lost very quickly and not want to continue paying attention, the only reason I waited for the end was because I expected something that my head flew and it was not so, although the final scene I understand that it should not be taken literally because it is rather a reference to a myth of Prometheus, that on an mountain an eagle will devour its liver to the End times, and in the end it's not the big deal. One of the problems I had with the film would be that, in reality, there was no moment in which I said ""Wow incredible"", what I try to say is that there are no tension scenes in which you worry about the characters, no They misunderstand me, I'm not saying they are poorly written, they just aren't well written enough to empathize with them. Another not very positive aspect of the film is that its message is not very clear, by this I mean you don't know what the movie meant, yes, although it is true that it deals with the theme of madness, but for a movie whose positive reviews talk about deep messages or topics, I just can't see any of that, I even took the liberty to watch videos in which they explained the hidden meaning of this or the explanation of the end and many more, and each one said something different , for example, some said that the film spoke mainly that as a man I could go crazy being alone, he said that the character of Pattinson ""Thomas Howard"" was actually a product of the imagination of Thomas Wake, another video explained that everything what happened in the movie was real because the island was haunted and another said that the biggest pate in the movie was a hallucination of Thomas Howard, and so on, this is what the movie It is not very clear, but well maybe for most this is a hallucinating detail but for me not. In conclusion ""The Lighthouse"" is a film with a good direction, a very good photograph, good performances, but with a narration not very good and characters that are not as interesting as they look, but despite everything I recognize the work of Eggers , and I highly respect your tastes if you liked me, maybe the movie just wasn't for me.",The Lighthouse
394,kaneeddy,The Lighthouse is film making at its finest,10,6 February 2020,"Let me just start this review by saying that this film is near perfect. Robert Eggers, writer and director of the Witch, which was a promising debut feature but showed a film maker that hadn't quite refined his craft yet. This film shows him at his best. The Lighthouse is one of the most brilliantly shot films I have ever seen. Its use of Black and White and a 1.19:1 Aspect ratio just makes you immersed in the world and setting that Robert Eggers has created, giving us some excellent writing by using a form of old sailor talk English that just puts you into this atmosphere. The production design is fantastic and having it filmed at a real location further enhances the experience.The performances in this film are also flawless. Starting with Willem Dafoe who completely disappears into this character giving us a character you feel exists in this world and only this world, he also gives some fantastic monologues that are bone chilling and engaging. Robert Pattinson absolutely nails his performance here too giving us his best performance ever by far, his monologues are just as equally bone chilling and engaging. Both of these characters lead by these two knockout performances take us on an emotional roller coaster, at some points you sympathise with them, at other points you hate them, which only shows that these performances are of the highest standard.Overall, The Lighthouse is a great film that will require 2 or 3 viewings as there is a lot of things to interpret, but that won't matter as the career defining performances from Willem Dafoe, and Robert Pattinson will transport you to one of the most intriguing, thought provoking and atmospheric worlds in cinema.

Instead of a woman in a bathtub in room 237 there is a mermaid. There's a surprising moment with an axe and instead of a door being smashed through the life boat cops it. There is a storm making things difficult to get away which is rainy but not snowy. The music is strange and brooding and adds wonderfully to the atmosphere and tension as do the sound effects of the fog horn and the mermaid's whale song mixed with female scream (loved that bit when he first sees the mermaid). The comparisons to the Shining are a complement - I really enjoyed this film and it reminded me of the Shining but also Bergman films. It looked amazing and it was great how use was made of the real elements - you could see the actors being buffeted by the wind at one point.

It was shot perfectly, but it was drawn out and some of the things (the mermaid) didn't really make sense and seemed out of place.6 out of 10. Give it a shot",The Lighthouse
413,joshuarob-33141,Insight to the male brain.,10,4 November 2019,"This movie perfectly depicts the old mentor/young trainee dynamic between men and how that relationship can quickly become convoluted with ones own insecurity and paranoia. as an apprentice in the construction industry, this movie not only spoke to me... It was almost a glimpse into day to day life of working in close proximity with some one older than you, whose orders you follow closer than your job description, and you'll like it.Yes that includes the farts and pissing, which between men can be a joke but quickly played out when its a daily happening.The scenes of ephraim and his deepening sexual frustration is yet again a spot on depiction of how the male brain can descend into madness if needs are not met, like an itch that just can't be scratched...The movie itself if taken at face value is a tale of how isolation destroys the brain or is a retelling of the story of Prometheus, both fit the bill. The lighthouse is packed with meaning, symbolism, and hidden messages. To me, the movie is about the working man battling his own existence in his mind. Are we a man like Ephraim, who is pretending to be something else or are we like tom, so consumed with some false beliefs and self made morlas that do more harm than good?This movie is not a smash hit now, much like the shinning was during its initial release, but for years people will dissect the symbolism and meaning in the lighthouse for some time to come.And willem Defoe is a savage.

But ultimately, it feels like an Edgar Allen Poe short story stretched out into a feature-length film.I mean, grim is great, creepy is great, conflict is great, but two hours of grim creepy conflict gets as torturous to viewers as it does to the protagonist. And it seems this is a common theme in my reviews lately: it doesn't harm to make your audience care about the characters.Like so many horror films these days, it seems the atmosphere and the creepiness are more important than simple character development. It's too bad, because it is such a beautiful creepy film, but also heartless and soulless. Even 'The Tell-Tale Heart' had a heart in it.",The Lighthouse

418,Akash_Menon,"""Boredom makes men to villains""",9,27 April 2020,"Rating: 9This is such a beautifully shot movie. It has been a long time since a black and white movie came up in 2019. This is Robert Egger's second movie after The Witch. The movie has themes set up on solitude, superstition, alcoholism, sexuality and what not.The Good - I love the performances of Dafoe & Pattinson. Robert Pattinson has come a long way from Twilight and *shined* in his performance. However Dafoe was undoubtedly remarkable. He hard carried this movie. I like how the movie implores on sailor's myth bringing in Kraken, Siren kinda monsters and who's gonna forget those damned seagulls. The black & white cinematography gives you an old meets modern amalgam vibe. The eerie soundtrack, the Foghorns, waves cracking up the shore give this movie such a cursed atmosphere.The Bad - I don't have anything to say. I am still left haunted by the monologue's in the movie. The dialogues are so brilliantly written. The only bad would be the feeling I am left with.....and that is I want more of this movie.This is definitely a must watch movie. Dafoe and Pattinson give their best performances. The movie dwells deep into the psychology of being stranded on a piece of land especially when surrounded by superstition. I am disappointed with the Academy Awards because they totally snubbed this movie. It is an underrated gem which deserves more, much more.",The Lighthouse

I am a fan of movies that can be interpreted 20 different ways, but this movie just didn't really make any sense, and had a terrible ending, such that the movie can only be interpreted one way: it wasn't the actors who went insane, it was the writers.

Willem Dafoe should easily get an Oscar nomination. He's fantastic in this. You forget it's even him. Pattinson is good but I never fully believe his character.

Yeah, I know, the important here is the atmosphere of abandonment and claustrophobia... the symbolism of the lighthouse as a phallus... the combination of old sea myths with the Prometheus' thing... ok, but either you are able to make (at least) a little sense of all this and deliver a minimally believable and coherent story or you just ellaborate a pastiche, and in the end this is what the film mostly turns out to be. A pity, since the photography is truly remarkable and the natural stormy place chosen for the filming is great.And one last recommendation for Mr. Eggers, it's not really necessary to put such amount of disgusting stuff (farts, sewage even in drinking cups, semen, feces...) on the screen to transmit the idea of filthiness and squalor... other directors have been able to convey this atmosphere in ways that did not make many people abandon the theatre halfway through.",The Lighthouse
422,joshteggert,"Eggers' latest is immersive, transfixing and enchanting from the offset, a must-see film of this year for its sheer quirkiness, beguiling setting, and outstanding leads.",10,4 February 2020,"Robert Eggers is a relatively new face on the film scene, known for his divisive if utterly enthralling first directional feature, the supernatural period horror 'The Witch'. The release of his second film, 'The Lighthouse', solidifies Eggers' prominence as a contemporary pioneer of the modern horror genre, a film that blends its technical intricacies remarkably to create a tantalising viewing experience which progressively consumes itself and the viewer in a dark and haunting uncovering of the human condition.'The Lighthouse' is set in the late 19th century and follows two lighthouse keepers on a remote island who start to lose their sanity when a storm leaves them stranded. Shot in 35mm black and white film with a 1.19:1 aspect ratio, the film stars Willem Dafoe and Robert Pattinson as the two leads, an ingenious coupling with a tremendous end product. 'The Lighthouse' is a uniquely unsettling, thoroughly mesmerising cinema experience, one which manages to not only call into question the sanity of the characters involved but strains the mind of the viewer in precisely the same way.By far the greatest achievement of Eggers' film is its technical aspects. It's shot in a way that makes it look and feel like it's come straight from the 1910s, the aspect ratio and monochrome palette intending to induce a similar sense of claustrophobia as endured by its characters. Yet the inclusion of Mark Koven's score along with some stunning composition from cinematographer Jarin Blaschke implements a notably modern aesthetic and aura, generating a disconcerting intermingling of old and new, reflecting the conflict between its two leads. A lot of 'The Lighthouse''s resonance stems from the allure of its composition; despite its absence of colour, the exactitude of the cinematography means there is never a dull moment.As with 'The Witch', the dialogue is fascinating. Penned by Eggers and his brother Max Eggers, the screenplay floats along seamlessly, like a sailor out at sea. Yet at every corner, a new storm erupts as a plateau of fresh and challenging new developments emerge progressively, allowing the dialogue to shift wondrously between tranquillity and electrifying intensity.The true impact of 'The Lighthouse', however, would be unattainable without the flawless execution of both Dafoe and Pattinson. Given such exquisite material to work with, Dafoe and Pattinson stretch the bounds of their acting abilities to extraordinary lengths. Dafoe is a bewitching consistent, the true on-screen tour de force delivering some of the most hypnotic monologues ever to grace cinema with enrapturing conviction. All the while, Pattinson is an absorbing presence operating as the bridge between characters and audience with his gradual descent into madness. The slow-burning nature of the film is channelled through the equivocality of Pattinson's character; Eggers chooses not to explicitly define the temperament of the pair's insanity until very late on, which makes the more supernatural facets of the film even more spellbinding.Nerve-wracking to devastating effects, and far from any sort of convention, 'The Lighthouse' is unlike any other film. Robert Eggers' latest is immersive, transfixing and enchanting from the offset, a must-see film of this year for its sheer quirkiness, beguiling setting, and outstanding lead performances.",The Lighthouse

426,grantpaulsen,The Best Film of 2019 So Far,10,20 October 2019,"This film is a psychological horror masterpiece. The filmmaking is so out there and different along with allusions and questions that go unanswered which adds to the uneasiness of the film. There is so much detail in the production design, everything was purposeful even if you aren't sure what the purpose was. Which makes this film demand repeat viewings, similar to films like The Shining, this film will be studied, analyzed, and picked apart in years to come. The possible hallucinations in this film are clearly inspired by tales and legends of old, and I can't wait to discover the meaning and symbolism behind this film. A lot of the film is open-ended to interpretation, because you could view it in a literal sense and get a lot of enjoyment out of it, but there's certainly a metaphorical view that could be interpreted here. The writing and dialogue was absolutely spectacular, they clearly did a lot of research as to what dialect characters like this would've used during the time period in which the film takes place. And apparently they got their hands on actual ledgers from old lighthouse keepers to write the dialogue of this film. And the dialect alone sets this film apart from all others because it's so unique and interesting. The only issue I can foresee with this is that some may have a hard time understanding some of what the characters are saying, so this might be a film that requires subtitles. The cinematography and visuals were all perfect, they filmed this on location in Nova Scoatia, so everything you see on screen is real as far as I could tell. The black and white color scheme and the 1.91:1 aspect ratio bring a real sense of claustrophobia to the environment. The film puts in a lot of effort and detail into the atmosphere of the film, there's so much dread and uneasiness going on that it makes you feel like you're there. This film really does a great job showcasing what isolation can do to someone, and the lengths some go through to amend sins from their past or just simply accepting it. Robert Pattinson and Willem Dafoe give nothing short of career best performances in this film. I've never seen such dedication to a role before because they clearly had to go through a lot in order to make their performances convincing and the best they could be. Witnessing their slow descent into madness makes this film endlessly fun and rewatchable. It's the kind of film that have so many quotes that will be remembered, because almost every line that came out of their mouths was pure gold. Robert Eggers has solidified himself as a masterful director and I will see anything that has his name attached to the project. I absolutely adored this film, I think it's the best of the year so far and one of the best so far this decade. And the best part is, this film feels like a rated R classic episode of SpongeBob Squarepants. I have a feeling this film will go down as a classic in years to come.

2. Some of the most haunting visuals I think I might've ever seen on film, beautifully framed.
3. The cinematography is just as beautiful and atmospheric as it is gritty and maddening.
4. It is definitely ambitious and daring. A24 gets a lot of credit for this one. They've done it again. They continue to green-light uncompromising features, which I admire.
5. The lead performances, of course goes without saying.
6. The 4:3 aspect ratio adds to the cabin fever, and might even resemble a lighthouse if you look at it too closely ;)What I didn't like (some of these might be trivial depending on how you experienced the movie)1. The dialogue and the accents (for me, at least) took some effort to get used to. It's a little hard to keep up with.
2. It is slooooooooooow, albeit, worth it.
3. There's not much surface plot, it's mostly theater of the mind, very heady. Although, I fully expected this to be a repeat viewing kind of movie. This one could be a pro as well, because, I now realize, that's basically the point.The pros outweigh the cons, but be aware of what kind of consumer you are (just like with all A24 releases, at this point), this is not for everyone, but it fascinates and does what a good movie should, stay with you after viewing.",The Lighthouse

The entire Film looks and sounds as if the viewer is truly back in the 1890's (when it is set) - a younger man arrives as the underling to an 'old salt' Lighthouse keeper - the two of them having to endure the loneliness and drab daily routine of keeping the Lighthouse functional - and then a storm arrives. Slowly, both men begin slipping away from reality, not helped by the isolation, boredom and excess drinking, not to mention an increasing paranoia as to what the other is 'up to'.
This is very much a tale of maritime myths, mermaids and madness. Both Actors are excellent and the Cinematic storytelling is unique. The monologues are crafted from original writings of the period from nautical men of the 19th Century - and this certainly places the viewer into the time and place of the two main characters. The combination of monochrome photography and the strange sound effects - an insistent foghorn, screeching Gulls - combine to make this an unsettling experience. This is more of an Art Film than scary movie - and many will not appreciate the ultimate finale but for those who love their Cinema to be bold and challenging, this is a fine piece of work.",The Lighthouse

Sure, some common traits of the Titans have been altered but it's furthermore engaging to witness an original take on the legend of Prometheus and his conquest.Both actors are incredible in the film, Pattinson stands out though, as his character(whether literal or metaphorical) has more of an arc. I do admit that if you don't know the myths, the story isn't as comprehensive. However, you can easily see this as a tale of two men going insane in a claustrophobic and isolated environment, with a tad bit of mysticism thrown in there(to explain Pattinson getting his guts eaten by seagulls in the last scene, as Dafoe warned him about killing the birds).I hope people that read this review will stop bashing the movie, as it is absolutely against the mainstream extravaganza of Star Wars and superhero flicks that albeit fun, are starting to become highly repetitive.

I've never seen a film that simultaneously felt so artsy and so unpretentious. Here we get this slow-burning, black and white, mythology-infused psychological drama about isolation and madness yet, with so much humor. I will never forget seeing Robert Pattinson swinging a dead seagull carcass around.
The aspect ratio was a little weird at first but I quickly got use to it. It really helped to create a claustrophobic atmosphere for the audience. The lighting, shapes, and shadows were so well executed, especially for using camera lens from that time period. It really takes a director with a keen eye to perfect making a black and white movie in this age.
More about the movie. William Defoe's monologue about Neptune was amazing. He just keeps going on and on about how Neptune will kill Winslow; all this because Winslow didn't like Tom's cooking. The hurt and on Tom's face was priceless. ""I seen it, yer fond of me lobster"". Lol
The mermaid scene was utterly terrifying. The way she screeches right before Winslow wakes up was nightmare fuel.

454,asen-75377,Just love this movie..my favourite A24 movie now,9,25 December 2019,"The Lighthouse is an outstanding example black and white art house drama..It's nominally a psychological horror film, set in the brutal isolation of a remote, storm-wracked coastal lighthouse in the 1890s.The story follows two lighthouse keepers who are forced to work together for several weeks at an isolated lighthouse separated from civilization. Thomas Wake (Willem Dafoe) is the cranky old-hand who adheres to superstition, drinks heavily and make the situation tough for Ephraim Winslow( Robert Pattinson) who is new to this job..make him to do the all work but he doesn't allow him to control the light.. coming to the point of acting Pattinson and Dafoe both just nailed in their role..and deserve recognition.At the end, this film is nothing short of a tour de force..it gives me certain vibes of Tarkovsky, Lynch and also Hitchcock's work...and all praises go to Eggers for making this film and Cinematography of this movie is just brilliant. Definitely one of the best movies of this year.",The Lighthouse
455,dlbott,"Wow, such disinfo reviews. NO WAY...",4,22 December 2019,"First, I love Defoe. He is one of the all time best and has shown that good looks does not make a good actor. He can carry a movie like this by himself. But, this simply was too much for even him to carry...First, the black and white.. it is 2020 lol... the only reason for this is simply the lack of money and a complete story to carry a plot. Simply ridiculous... Anyone who tries to praise this use is just lying to you and not telling the truth. Black and white brings nothing to a story and is just a way to hide the lack of production and direction, period... it is used to cover flaws..Having said that, this story has been told before and more than once. Loosely based on two true stories, one in America and one across the pond, both having some things in common.Simply put, these kinds of stories with one or in this case two or three actors is extremely difficult and can be incredibly boring for the patron. 
Defoe is brilliant as always... but I wish he had not done this film. It just takes away from the brilliant actor that he is. If you have some mind numbing time to waste go for it. It is like finger nails on chalk board..watch togo to see how defoe can carry a film and the great use of color and the surroundings to make a film.They could have filmed the surroundings in beautiful color and really spiced it up and at least made it watchable. The other films, even the foreign film, were way better. Suggest you look for them and skip this... these over rated reviews are just an attempt to get you to watch... this is a real review from a person like you who does not have the money or time to waste... don't waste either...",The Lighthouse

457,Dragoneagle144,A Modern Horror Masterpiece,10,27 October 2019,"The Lighthouse is a masterful horror film. Robert Eggers returns with a huge bang and actually surpassed his first film with a massive margin. I don't even know where to start. The performances by Willem Dafoe and Robert Pattinson are both career best for them and these are both amazing actors. The directing is top notch and brings you into a sort of hypnotic state throughout. The story of two lighthouse going insane after being secluded on an island together is really elevated by the hypnotic editing and suspenseful feeling through the entire runtime. Since the first shot you can already tell that something is wrong due to the strange shot composition and editing. Speaking of the cinematography, every shot in this film looks like it could be a gorgeous painting. Another thing I liked a lot is while it is an artsy movie it doesn't alienate any audience as it is also not above something like a fart joke. This movie is also like really funny without ever breaking the tension that it has set up. Robert Eggers has put period dialogue in both of his films and while I felt it could sometimes hinder the comprehension in The Witch here it feels natural and is a huge strength of this movie. This movie should seriously be seen by everyone who loves horror and I'm going to give it A+.",The Lighthouse

The script was great. It has a lot of references and symbolism but it feels like it was written just to mess with our head and it only did a very small and part time resolution throughout the movie. The direction of the film is insanely good, teaming with the tone set that results to constant chill to the bones when every action takes place. The cinematography is great. The camera movement and the angle setting makes an artful approach and seemingly creating a suggestion that the film is better in black and white than colored. And the two most beautiful thing about this movie is the performances of Willem Dafoe and Robert Pattinson who delivered an outstanding, out-of-the-league performance. From screenplay, to directing, to cinematography, and to acting, this film really deserved to be considered one of the biggest Academy Awards snub from the past 10 years.",The Lighthouse
459,gatheringsnow,There is Darkness in the Light,8,30 October 2019,"I just finished watching Robert Eggers sophomore feature film release of ""The Lighthouse"" just three years after his 2016 feature film debut of ""The VVitch: A New England Folktale"" both films which were released by the A24 production company which I'm slowly beginning to become obsessed with, as nearly every film they produce is exactly the sort of film I dream about crafting someday if I ever get into the film industry. Dark, visceral, haunting, surreal, and psychological are all words that come to find when viewing the trailer for The Lighthouse and while I got all of those sensations while watching the film as well, I did NOT except the sensations of insane hilarity and gross out moments which unexpectedly accompanied the aforementioned darker elements.Set in a fairly claustrophobic setting, a rocky, windswept New England isle in the late 19th century. The Lighthouse looms ominously over the dark stormy oceans surrounding it on all sides. Ordinarily, images of lighthouses evoke associations with hope, sanctuary, warmth, and life however this film's titular Lighthouse acts (almost as a character in and of itself) as a complete inversion to these tropes, replacing them with nightmarish imagery more reminiscent of an lunatic asylum with just two hapless protagonists, rookie lighthouse keeper Ephraim Winslow (Robert Pattinson) and veteran Thomas Wake (Willem Dafoe) slowly losing their minds together while desperately searching for an escape from the increasing monotony and loneliness which becomes an ever increasing catalyst for the horrific events which unfold as the film progresses towards it's final destination.As mentioned before, the titular lighthouse, despite seeming at first fairly unassuming and even benevolent with it's immaculate whitewashed exterior and transparent glass dome both protecting the vital beacon of light and reflecting it outwards into the cold gray void, certainly seems to live up to it's established purpose of serving as a barrier against darkness, death, and disaster. However, delving deeper into the structure's shadowed interior and ascending up the spiral staircase towards the solitary light in the darkness and it's essence slowly takes on a far more sinister aspect, with the hypnotic, almost blinding quality of the light simultaneously repulsing and enchanting the eyes, infecting their minds with madness and paranoia until they're unable to distinguish what's real and what's not causing them to forget who they even are and distorting their perception of the passing of time.It's only through Ephraim Winslow's character that we get to witness this gradual descent into madness and the true nature of the light becomes more clear. Even at the film's start it's heavily implied that Thomas Wake, portrayed by Willem Dafoe as a darkly humorous caricature of Captain Ahab, a fact which is even remarked upon by Winslow in the film itself, has long since been taken over by it and is a lost cause cursed to dwell upon that god forsaken rock until his last breath. However, once he is able to coax Winslow into listening to his ""tall tales"" and partake in drinking alcohol, something he is very hesitant to do, not necessarily because he doesn't enjoy drinking or conversing with others but because his primary focus is on doing his job right and not losing his position and especially his sanity even though Wake, the lighthouse, and everything else on the accursed isle from the howling winds, to the almost mocking cries of a one eyed seagull, seems to have conspired against him to make sure that goal is never achieved.",The Lighthouse

462,sebastianschlicht,"""God who hear'st the surges roll, deign to save a suppliant soul""",10,22 February 2020,"Robert Egger's ""The Witch"" was an ambitious film debut that gave the horror genre a breath of fresh air. Now his second film came to the cinemas: ""The Lighthouse"". Eggers has similar approaches here but tells a completely different story. The reviews for this film have been extremely positive and I can not only agree with this, but also think that ""The Lighthouse"" is one of the best films of recent years and certainly one of the film highlights of 2019!The end of the 19th century: Two lighthouse keepers are supposed to take over the shift on a remote island for four weeks. Over time, more and more truths come to light from both men ...Of course, nothing is revealed here, that would almost be a crime! The less you know about a film, the better, only the genre should perhaps be known, but even that can't really be determined here. Egger's ""The Lighthouse"" combines many elements from different film genres. The film primarily convinces with its magical, dark atmosphere, has surreal elements, horror aspects, but can also come up with skillful humorous moments and above all has approaches of a psycho-thriller. This film was never boring, I always wanted to know what was going to happen. Over time, I lost myself more and more in this black and white world and was captivated by the strong play of the two main actors and their actions.Robert Pattinson and Willem Dafoe are fantastic in their roles and may even be doing their best in their careers. Pattinson has shown what a talented actor he is in recent years and luckily is slowly drifting away from the ""Twilight""-stereotype! I am really happy for him because he shows how multifaceted he can play. And Willem Dafoe is the secret star in this mesmerizing movie. He gives the experienced and almost exaggerated sailor, but in such a captivating and authentic way that it is difficult to escape from his character (which fits perfectly into the theme of the movie). I was still happy for the subtitles because it was not always perfectly understandable linguistically, which is the only criticism I can offer. And even that I could take as a compliment, because Eggers already made sure in ""The Witch"" that the language not only sounds old but is really spoken differently. This shows the work behind the camera, since Eggers & Co used old lighthouse keeper records as a template for many dialogues. And Pattinson and especially Dafoe are doing this wonderfully. Both of them give a first-class acting performance (a shame that nobody received a Academy-nomination!).Let's get to the look of the film: Eggers not only shot the film in black and white, but also in the atypical ratio of 1, 19: 1. The box-shaped neckline makes a perfect contribution to making you feel restricted. The crew also built the lighthouse in a real location. Almost everything is real in this film, the locations, the weather and above all the emotions of the actors. Jarin Blaschke again took over the fantastic camera work. He captures the dark images in a surprising, creative and powerful way. A beautiful movie to watch!Mark Korven's score is also terrific, although I also have to praise the fantastic sound design. The use of the lighthouse horn in particular had a magical and nightmarish effect that inspired me.Conclusion: ""The Lighthouse"" is a terrific horror thriller with comedy elements and much more. A captivating story that was magically implemented and leaves plenty of room for your own thoughts.",The Lighthouse
463,jneiberger-1,"Absolutely brilliant movie, but not for everyone",9,30 June 2020,"This movie is strange, surreal, and increasingly mad. It's slow, tense, and deep. The cinematography is a masterclass. The directing, score and acting are absolutely top notch. This movie invokes a lot of feelings, and it's as much about the sense of madness and uneasiness as it is about any plot. Don't go into this thinking it's a typical Hollywood movie, because it most certainly is not. Try not to have any expectations, including that it makes obvious sense, although it helps to know that the characters are very loosely based on Proteus and Prometheus from Greek mythology.Sit back, remove any distractions, and enjoy the ride.",The Lighthouse

Performances are near perfect by both leads as Pattinson surprised us with his unique sense of blending into character and Defoe just made our experience memorable with his experience.

The film gave off a cheap look any way, so the addition of the b&w, made it worse. I still don;t really understand the point of this movie. Was there something up in the lighhouse that Tom didnt want Ephraim to know about? I found myself confused throughout the movie, with nothing to focus on. This movie was all the place.

470,VisionThing,"Full of sound and fury, signifying nothing.",3,8 April 2021,"A movie can be artistic, incoherent, black-and-white, hard to follow, have a very abstract story with no real resolution, and still be great. I love Eraserhead, for example. But The Lighthouse...The Lighthouse has a very promising setting, great actors, and in the beginning, great visual and aural atmosphere. Both characters are unlikable, they are borderline caricatures, but the first half of the movie still succeeds in building up enough mystery and tension to make the watcher wonder what it all will really be about.But then it goes nowhere from there. All the build-up is for nothing. Nothing gets developed into fruition nor resolved. It seems like the creators had a script for the first half only.The latter half of the movie is repetitive, unwatchable mess. It loses the tension, loses the atmosphere, loses any semblance of coherence. It is horrid. It is the worst piece of cinema I recall ever seeing, vastly subpar to trash classics like Plan 9 from the Outer Space. There is no mystery. There is no story. Anything interesting built during the first half goes out of the window. There is nothing worth watching anymore, just endless, pointless rambling and raving. It is like a parody of all the worst qualities of an art house movie.Anyone praising this sorry turd as a 10/10 cinema masterpiece is paid, trolling, or totally clueless. You'd be better off watching two drunkards fight on the street. The same intellectual content, but at least there would be a resolution, and it would not last this long.",The Lighthouse

Madness... Ok... So, what?There was no getting further into something.Don't get me wrong, it was not the actors, it was the writers.It seems like the writers got stuck expressing what was advertised, the idea of madness on an island due to isolation, and didn't have the time to write the actual story line.It's rather more like an incomplete introduction to something. Almost as if a pretentious writer decided to turn a 10 minute introductory scene into a one hour long and a bit more of nothingness.You keep watching because at every step of the way, into this empty torture, somehow, you always have the hope that it will get somewhere.In every random piece of story line, you slowly start to regain the confidence that something will finally happen, just to then, in a state of pure confusion as to how can something made by a human being be so massively dense of nothingness like a black hole, understand that it was in fact your mind the one that constructed a mirage through a non-existent possibility of a real plot, to get you through the excruciating boredom that was this more then one hour long paragraph.Just bits of randomness, which, considering the duration of the film, just makes it a waste of time.This is quite an artsy movie.The best part of this movie were the actors and to finally turn off my computer.However, writing this was a lot of fun, it got me through the post-traumatic pain of watching this, so instead of 4, I will give it a 5.By: João Neves (SHIVAYL),

472,Miasmakoala,Madness and the damage done,9,10 December 2019,"Robert Pattinson falling into madness was a stunning performance and what's better is that it's the second best performance in the movie. Willem Dafoe captured every scene in which he was, even when he was in the distance staring at Pattinson. As the movie went on Pattinson's dreams and nightmares got even darker and darker and the final scene at the Fresnel Lens (thanks wikipedia) was a perfect ending. Whatever he sees in the light was so beyond his understanding, that in a Lovecraftian fashion, his sanity is torn into shreds.The movie is full of neat symbolism and there are many ways to interpret the story. Both the relationship and individual meaning of the lighthouse with each of the men was so well put and each scene gave so much more to think about the movie. In one of the nightmares, Dafoe is shown towering over Pattinson with light coming out of his face. The characters interacted in a genuinely crazy manner. The ""why'd you spill your beans"" scene was so great.The aspect ratio supported the film's claustrophobic scenes, many of them were so barely lit that most of the time I forgot about the narrow ratio. The soundtrack supported every scene very well and even silence was used in perfect places.There are also other references to stories and legends like Icarus and Prometheus.

And after months of waiting I finally got to see it.I'm not really sure I understood the whole of the film as I'm sure a lot of the people that watched before me. If you're expecting a straightforward story about two lighthouse keepers then you'd be disappointed. It's a lot more biblical, lovecraftian and ambiguous. From a technical point of view the movie is really really REALLY REALLY well made. It is absolute flawless at what it tries to do. Downright absolute flawless.But I can't say this is the best movie of the year or this is going to make it in my top 10 list of 2019. I'm not even sure I particularly liked the movie aside my undying respect and admiration for such a masterfully crafted film. What is shown here is absolutely brilliant but I'm not sure this is what I wanted to see.The acting in this movie is through the roof. Any halfwit still saying ""Pattinson can't act"" or ""vampire sparkles"" would personally get a kick in the shin from me. And what to even say about Dafoe?This just might be his greatest role yet and that's saying something when he's a bonafide master. I would nominate Dafoe for ""Best supporting actor"" and Pattinson for ""Best lead actor"" and atleast Dafoe should better win. 2019 has been a very strong year but these two deserve it.The imagery is quite striking, visceral and often repulsive. It also has few funny moments unexpectedly.I cannot say enough about the excellence of Robert Eggers and how the film was shot in black&white in a 1.19:1 aspect ratio. The things that made the movie were how it was shot and every single technical aspect. The sound design was superb, the use of light was astounding and the setting is truly fitting.Honestly I can't say if you'll like it or not as I myself am not sure I did.

The film has an eye-catching black and white cinematography and the soundtrack remembers one at some very old movies. In my opinion this movie is a masterpiece: They are so left alone on the island, and one is trying to have the light for his own that it shows the true nature of jealousy. The light is a symbol for the knowledge, which can destroy someone who is not capable for the truth.Still I could have thought of an more enlightening ending, but this is kept to the viewer.",The Lighthouse

To me, ""the Light"" was heaven and the island, purgatory, where Pattinson was forced to revisit the sins he committed against Dafoe's character, in his life. I'm just, admittedly, not a fan of heavy handed art films that choose the path of expressionism, symblism and / or surrealism, over cohesion of plot. If that's your kind of film, The Lighthouse might very well be a Masterpiece in your eyes. Don't get me wrong, I enjoyed it, and consider it a very good film. However, The Witch i found far superior if for no other reason that it didn't sacrifice story for showmanship.As for the positives, The Lighthouse looks and sounds amazing and the performances are outstanding, especially from Dafoe.

Is it just a product of your imagination? We also began to question the reliability of the story and the ambiguity of the film keeps us in doubt even after watching it.The initial scenes of the movie seem sublime to me and I think they define the movie perfectly, Wake and Winslow arriving on the island with the exciting background sound that will remain throughout the movie, at a certain moment both men come to the camera breaking the fourth wall, subliminally near the end of the movie they do it again, after many minutes of silence and after presenting the island and the environment where the story will take place, the character of Dafoe says a kind of prayer in the middle of dinner, this is also the last quote said in the movie but this last time Winslow says it.Few films have left me with as much uncertainty and desire to debate as i left The Lighthouse.",The Lighthouse

Even after all those years there is something about a black and white movie that gives you that Hitchcock chills. Well done I say!Although I have to agree the end is a little anti climactic.

The Lighthouse is a masterful piece of art like nothing I've seen before. Following Defoe and Pattinson as they tend a Lighthouse. The film wastes no time turning into a disturbing submersion into insanity.The Lighthouse is undoubtedly an unconventional and bizarre film. Giving the viewer nothing more than two men in one location. The movie manages to pull it off masterfully. Defoe's acting is really one of, if not the strongest aspects of The Lighthouse. His scary ramblings, his facial expressions, his level of commitment to the role are all second to none. I believe so far from what I've seen he deserves the oscar for what would be Best Supporting Actor. A24 recently said they will campaign Pattinson for best actor. Make no mistake, Pattinson absolutely kills it too. However for me, Defoe is the true tour de force performance.Despite not having a conventional plot, their are some plot points and it's all this film needed to stay cohesive. The imagery in the film is very unsettling and surreal. The dialogue is expertly written and pungent. The score and the sound of The Lighthouse is another strong point, loudly ominous... it works perfectly. The cinematography is beautiful. Everything is firing on all cylinders and it creates one hell of a ride.The Lighthouse is surely a one of a kind work and one of the best psychological horror films in recent memory. It falls just short of a 10/10 masterpiece for me due some pacing issues and certain events in the film feeling meaningless and repetitive. That being said, The Lighthouse is a true achievement in cinema and currently the best of 2019 for me. I can't wait to see it again. 9.5/10.",The Lighthouse

It was an artwork that, although beautiful, felt annoyingly artificial and lacked consistency. I think it didn't quite know what it was supposed to be.

It failed as a horror as it was just plain bizarre and not in the least bit scary and it also failed as a thriller as it went nowhere. The supposed climax was unexciting and a frankly dull end to a very dull film. Both characters were unlikeable so from the get go you really didn't care what happened to either. After about 30 minutes you were hoping the movie would actually go somewhere as it seemed to be protracted scene after scene of nothing but 'yah' talk monologues and BS symbolism alluding to some higher plane of understanding but no, it was just a very pretentious boring film that started with promise but floundered on the rocks.

Willem Defoe is always a pleasure and in this instance he builds a character so interesting that you just can't take your eyes off him.

501,timmyminh,Lovecraftian or Freudian?,9,6 January 2021,"The Lighthouse is probably the closest we have to a modern day The Shining. I'm surprised nobody points out how Lovecraftian this picture is, the fact that there could be some overarching cosmic ancient thalassic forces puppeteering the lives and mental planes of these two men. The film references numerous mythological details to support that (killing of a seagull, Neptune's curse, tales and visions of mermaids, the prophetic fate of Winslow). Thomas Wake resembles a high priest, chosen to be exposed to the sacred knowledge in the light and assigned to guard and worship the divinity of the sea. Winslow resembles the mortal man who covets for that knowledge and mystery be shared to him. And then curiosity kills the cat. The cosmic forces damned him, through Thomas Wake as its medium, for desiring and coveting this secret as he is unworthy and too fallen to dare to look upon the face of the divine. This resembles a chapter in the Exodus that says, ""You shall not look upon my face, for no one can see me and live"".On the other hand, it could be all Freudian, two men doomed to isolation, no one from civilization but themselves and no women to meet their sexual impulse. Surrounding you nothing but rocks and sea and seagulls and one lighthouse, and your daily activities and meals are mundane and mediocre. All of which factors can drive a man insane. Not to mention, residing on that island carrying with you emotional and psychological baggage while being stuck with a man with facetious and authoritarian habits. And amidst of this, the two men look to a tower of light as a source of beauty and majesty. While in actuality, it's just a lighthouse.Finally, on the lighthouse. The final scene, Winslow finally uncovers what is in the light, which drives him to scream in a state of delirium and befallen to his prophetic fate. This is where the ""Lovecraftian or Freudian"" element is strongest: whether he looks into the light and sees everything or he looks into the light and see nothing. Both possibilities so terrifying and so existential it can descend a man to madness...",The Lighthouse

Firstly - upon arrival the incoming team doesn't exchange one single word with outgoing team. Really? There was no information to be shared? No routines?
Then comes the water. The old salt sits and waits for the new man to discover the water has gone bad. Which is pretty critical and no game.
Then comes the madness. It takes them a few hours and they're practically on their way to insanity. Oh, please. These are two adult men with a past from working the forest and the seas, and they can't take the isolation?

Moreover, the effect even produces something claustrophobic out of all the setting.Additionally, the growing tension is skillfully conveyed through harsh sounds and steady uncomfortable shrieks the nature manifests itself: sea gulls, ocean waves or just plain deafening silence. The heroes themselves look very much in place and are played brilliantly as if an inherent pair of parts in this mysterious jigsaw.Unfortunately, at times the film turns into pure art: a specimen of an impressionistic experiment understandable to only a few experts. All the vague hints and madness bring far more questions than answers and leave the spectators rather unsatisfied and certainly deceived.In other words, the whole experience resembles going to a museum of modern art: there is some beauty in it, but it lacks cohesion and can hardly be taken in by general public, even though plenty of them nod in agreement scared of appearing ignorant.",The Lighthouse

509,ssnake_z,Just a Black Mirror episode,6,13 November 2019,"THE LIGHTHOUSE
RATING: 3.2/5This is kind of a hard movie to rate because it really doesn't play like a movie. The film was released in a 1.19:1 aspect ratio, which i think is the biggest offense the movie makes. It's honestly not meant to be seen in theaters, THE LIGHTHOUSE is a movie that plays as is if it was meant to be seen at home on the small screen. Like really small, we're talking CRT televisions. They say the 1.19:1 is supposed to help with the claustrophobic feel, but i saw the movie BURIED and this didn't get anywhere near that level of claustrophobia, and it was full screen. Granted, Ryan Reynolds spent the entire movie buried in a coffin, but it's hard to feel claustrophobic when your characters are surrounded by ocean on all sides, no matter what aspect ratio you use.Anyways, Robert Pattinson puts on the performance of a lifetime here and yet somehow manages to get overshadowed by Willem Dafoe. It's really kind of tragic in that way. Willem Dafoe just has too much charisma for Robert Pattinson to match, but he tries his hardest even though he comes up short. It doesn't help that the movie is filled with piss and fart moments for him to react to, or were they jokes? I'm not sure what it was supposed to be, but i didn't find it funny and it honestly undercut some scenes and Robert Pattinson's performance.By the time you get to the end, the black and white theme, the madness storyline, having only two leads, being stuck in one location it, it all feels like one big cheat to keep things super cheap and under budget. Upon doing some research, it turns out the budget was around 4 million, and it really shows by the end. There is a moment in the 3rd Act where the film has the potential to venture into cinematic territory, but it stops itself and stays in ""Made for TV"" land. The Lighthouse is definitely not a movie worth watching in the theater, because again, it plays as if it's meant to be watched at home. I walked out of the theater not thinking about the performances that i saw. Instead, i left with this nagging feeling that I just paid over ten dollars to watch a classic episode of the Twilight Zone on the big screen. In the end, this really should have just been an episode of Black Mirror, or been simply tossed up on Netflix.",The Lighthouse

Obviously I've heard so so much about this film and seen a fair few clips so I had high hopes and they were most definitely met. I'm big on atmosphere, psychological torment, single-setting films and films with only two actors. So I think you can see why this film has become an instant favourite for me. I knew Eggers had a knack for creating atmosphere and this film justifies that entirely, I don't think an atmosphere so foreboding, unpredictable, liminal and terrifying has ever been created. The Lighthouuse is literally on par with The Overlook Hotel. The score helped largely in this with it being ominous and highly immersive; I was wearing noise cancelling headphones when I watched this and the score and sounds did literally invade my senses and that's what a horror (or psychological thriller I'm not sure which genre this film falls into more) should do because that makes the immersion fully effective. I find this film ground-breaking because it's so obscure with such a sense of otherness, yet incredibly theatrical with the heavy use of dialogue (the dialogue is insanely impressive) for example and that combination makes the film so unpredictable and ultimately masterful in its tone and atmosphere. You really saw two men's mind unravel as they fall further and further into insanity because of their isolation and it got in your own head. But then it may not be two men's insanity: it could be one of the Tom's insanity and the other being victim to it, it could be neither there may be a genuine supernatural force or it actually could be two men who really just have spent too much time alone with each other and the fact all of these are possibilities make this film a contemporary masterpiece. We all know the best films are those without answers (i.e 2001: A Space Odyssey, The Shining which I've already compared this movie too). My review really did not do this film justice and I definitely have not mentioned everything that The Lighthouse made me feel, but it is one of those films where the effect speaks for itself. With Egger's innovative film-making approach along with Paterson's and Dafoe's incredibly disturbing performances, I honestly can not fault it.",The Lighthouse

Contrast any of the great Hitchcock films with this drivel! Hitchcock could have us on the edge of our seats, even in rather mundane circumatances.

522,Nhirscher,There is enchantment in the light.,9,26 October 2019,"After walking out of the The Lighthouse (2019), I asked myself: what is the best part of Robert Egger's eerie sea chanty? Is it Defoe's Protean performance? Is it the horrifying and precise lighting techniques? Is it the blurred line between symbolism and reality? Is it Defoe's beard? Then, as I began writing this review, I decided that all of these things are equally the best thing about this film.The performances in this film are explosive, furious, and terrifying. Defoe's Tom has multiple maniacal rants that are deserving of Oscar love. As Tom proclaims damnation for Winslow (because Winslow wouldn't admit to liking Tom's cooking), my mouth was agape out of awe for Defoe's violent outburst over something so hilariously trivial. Defoe's ""Hark"" booms with thunderous vehemence (literally). Pattison also brings fury to his mysteriously haunted performance. The dialogue, dripping with maritime jargon, is layered and immaculately performed.""Why'd ya spill yer beans,"" is a quote I will forever attribute to Defoe's bearded face. Even scenes where the dialogue is minimalistic, the actors bring fervor to every line---look no further than the soon-to-be-iconic ""What"" scene. The two leads seep layers of meaning into every glance, every snivel, every bark.Outside of the horrifying surface level story, The Lighthouse is a shadowy fable that leaves the audience questioning what is real and what isn't. Is that one-eyed bird Tom's previous wickie partner? How long have we been on this rock? And, what the hell is in the light? These questions just scrape the surface of what Eggers may truly be communicating. Brilliance resides in the narrative's dual function as both a symbolic reinvention of Greek mythology (pitting Defoe's Proteus vs. Pattinson's Prometheus) and also a story of two lonely men descending into madness. Whether sailors' souls do literally transmigrate into the bodies of seagulls or not is presented ambiguously, yet either answer is equally satisfying. If they do, then the world is supernaturally enchanted; and, if they do not, then the mysterious gulls and visions can be explained by the characters' descent into drunken madness. It is of my opinion that the world truly is supernatural, and Tom's superstitions were not to be dismissed. Winslow should have heeded Tom's advice, best not to spar with the sea birds.Outside of the power dynamic between the two characters, the film is rich in its thematic ideas. Loneliness, sexual gratification, fear, trust in another, guilt, and the suffocating nature of isolation---these ideas supplement the dynamic of domination/subservience between Tom and Winslow. The tight walls of the 1.91:1 aspect ratio further point to these themes, appearing to suffocate the two characters at every turn. Eggers makes the smothering atmosphere felt in every shot, as both characters are often shot in close proximity to each other. The rain also serves this purpose, never giving Winslow respite or a breath.This is one of the best horror films of the decade, and should be nominated for Best Director, Best Actor(s), and many more. No matter whether the film is supernatural or not, it is unambiguous to say that there is enchantment in the light.",The Lighthouse

The producers get my praise for that. However, this movie suffers from being drawn out and long-winding. The amount of violence is not necessary and does not make the characters more credible. It is as if the director repeatedly tries to break through a barrier but never really gets where he wants to be headed. There are good scenes and the cast tries its best, but what remains is a rather unconvincing, albeit a bit entertaining, attempt to produce a horror movie. I suspect the cause of this is in the script and the planning because in terms of environment and actors this movie has all that is needed as good acting and background material.

525,SimonsRants,A Lot of People Don't Know What Makes Good Acting,6,18 May 2021,"I keep seeing reviews where people say that the two leads were snubbed by the Oscars and although it's true that neither got nominated it's also true neither deserved it. The acting in this movie is overall okay; there are some good moments, but they're dominating by over rehearsed melodrama. The thing is, most people don't know the difference and so get offended when performances like this don't get nominated.Acting aside, this movie has some really good things to point out; the cinematography is astoundingly beautiful. The black and white visuals are hard enough to deal with, but even if this were shot in color it would have been beautiful. The camera work is easily the best thing about this movie which is both a compliment and a flaw with the film.The story is... okay. I was a fan of Egger's previous film the VVitch which similarly deals with horror elements in vague, mysterious ways but I found the former film much more thought provoking and self serious than this one. Some may point to the moments of levity in Lighthouse as an improvement, I found it annoying. The farting and poop humor displayed throughout took me out of the suspense immediately and I never fully recovered; it wasn't funny and it wasn't clever.The payoff ending is rather lackluster to me as well; not bad necessarily, but I was hoping for a lot more. This movie shines with so much potential but ended up being merely passable to me. When most people rave about this movie they really only have two things to say: the acting and the cinematography were amazing. I've already addressed the acting and good - or great - cinematography alone cannot make a good film. The rest of the movie isn't bad, but it's hardly good enough to receive the praise it's gotten.I think overall this is another case of an indie film doing things in a unique and quirky way so the artistic crowd decides to like the film before even seeing it - actual value of the film be damned. I usually prefer indie films over the Hollywood stuff, but just because it's indie doesn't mean it's good. Just because it's different doesn't mean it's better. This was only okay.",The Lighthouse
526,callumkirk81,Robert Eggers - The Lighthouse,9,27 January 2021,"Had a good time with ""The Lighthouse"". Rewatched it many times and with each viewing I find something enjoyable to take away from it. I wasn't too familiar with ""Robert Eggers"" work until this. The way he tackles film making really stands out stylistically. The film definitely benefits from being in a black/white format and the aspect ratio gives the film an old fashioned feel, evoking the era that's being portrayed. ""Willem Dafoe"" and ""Robert Pattinson's"" are the only actors performing. Their acting is eerily captivating and there's some scenes that are truly mind bending. Get it watched!",The Lighthouse

They are the heart, soul and engine of this movie.The ever-haunting score (Mark Korven) and on-point cinematography (Jarin Blaschke) are just phenomenal.

530,CinePete,Way offshore,6,5 November 2019,"Two wickies (lighthouse keepers) on a life-denying pile of rocks somewhere off the New England coast become subject to a wild hallucinatory experience, or, should I say, many of them. The mainland is far away, and a storm rises, and all hold on civilized sanity loudly and rapidly disintegrates.Such is The Lighthouse, with narrow restricted focus on two men in almost endless antagonism. But we don't know who these two men are. The slender backstory comes in bits and pieces, but we never get enough definite knowledge of their characters to either empathize or sympathize with their most singular situation. We look on as in a scientific experiment, detached, uninvolved.The Lighthouse is fraught with dense obscure symbolism. I thought of Ingmar Bergman's visionary fantasies in the late 1960s -- there is something Nordic, cold, and perplexing in this apparent fable. There are mysteries never solved, a mystical dimension to the actual light that is never explained, a scary mermaid and ravenous seagulls of a quite alarming nature. All narrative logic, time scheme and clearly laid-out plot structure are -- as in a true visionary experience -- pushed aside.The Lighthouse offers two splendid performances from two very dedicated guys, Robert Pattinson and Willem Dafoe. They emit every single line as if they really believed in the material. These are committed performances, and they overpower the entire film. There is a rage deep inside both men that boils up like the sea around them. These inner passions are unfettered, far from mainland reason and thinking -- and they surge in motiveless frenzy for almost two intense hours.This is an old-salt sea story, half-legend, half-horror and in the imagination of creator Robert Eggers and his cameraman Jarin Blaschke, the basis for a real fireworks of possibilities. It's experimental, and daring -- elaborate black-and-white photography and confined aspect ratio give the film a distinct visual look.Overall, it's a bit tedious after a while, despite some compelling aspects. For the most part The Lighthouse, is too far out to sea.",The Lighthouse

534,tinjo23,Psychological horror mixed with a delicious amount of humour and absurdity. With two outstanding performances from Pattinson and Dafoe.,8,23 December 2019,"A two hander/chamber piece/psychological thriller, shot and cut like a black and white 1920's horror classic. So much could've derailed this project. Yet with Eggers at the helm (who directed 2016's brilliant folk horror 'The Witch') and Dafoe and Pattinson as the sole pair on screen, this seemed only marked for success.
The result is a 100 minute horror masterclass with a 5 minute blip. It's tragic because this was on it's way to being a horror masterpiece. But the ending is messy and uncharacteristically absurd (even for this type of movie).
The rest however is insatiably demented and surprisingly entertaining. Few movies really capture a descent into madness with the unflinching confidence of this nut job film. And the two performances are some of the best this year. Dafoe, the veteran, is the least surprising though completely deserving of all his accolades. But it is Pattinson that turns in the career best performance. Nothing is left to the imagination and yet none of it feels out of control. Even as he howls, grimaces, shouts and even at one points bawks and claps like a seal, it feels like an actor taking full reigns of what could have been a total parody of a character.

After i saw the movie i looked up for the meaning behind it and everyone seems to be having different opinions about the movie which is props to the movie to make us think like that but i coudnt find something satisfactory. They say its loosely portrays aspects of Greek Mythology (which i was never familiar with plus dont know why that was important to put in the film) but i still have so many things that i didnt get and now i have just stopped searching for it.Its definitely a movie to spark questions and people will be talking about it years from now.

539,mike_diamond,Don't spill yer beans,10,13 June 2020,"HAAAARK! Should ye be seekin to dredge the depth of madness, then ye be in luck. Robert Eggers new film stars the brilliant Willem Defoe and Robert Pattinson as Thomas Wake and Ephraim Winslow, a disparate pair of 19th century lighthouse keepers on a secluded island. Thomas is lead wickie and therefore mans the light, as he likes to frequently remind his subordinate. Ephraim does the fetching, fixing, and swabbing when he's not in a dispute, either with Thomas or a seabird. The men's work is challenging but maintaining their sanity more so. Amidst a cacophony of crashing waves, squawking gulls, and an incessant foghorn, the men are trapped in close quarters with an enemy they cannot escape: each other. To cope, they drink, they dance, they fight, and occasionally, they spill their beans. Their soliloquies are Shakespearian, grandiose in language and spirited in delivery, though topically crude, often focusing on their colleagues farts or lack of appreciation for boiled lobster. The pettiness of their power dynamic is exasperated by their isolation. Beset by conflict and bad omens, the men eagerly await the relief boat, but when the barometer swings, a squall socks them in. Unable to escape, they're forced to batten down the hatches and weather the storm. Yer fond of me reviews ain't ye?",The Lighthouse

541,sorearm,8 good things 2 bad/ evil,8,18 February 2020,"1 Cinematography
The Lighthouse is amazing to look at. Every frame could be a photograph in it's own right and not just any photograph, but probably the best one you have ever seen. The monochrome is so rich sometimes you think it must have switched to animation, so perfect are the forms on display. As is the lighting, which unashamedly pushes for the perfect image every time.2 Willem Dafoe
Completely inhabited the role of the old-timer seadog, bad tempered and half mad. Fantastic acting, complimented by unique dialogue and a visual look that just makes you believe Willem Dafoe is that lighthouse keeper.3 Thoughts
While watching this film and straight after, it seemed like there was one or more subtexts and it is interesting trying to keep hold of the strands, as some slipped away but others beg questions:
Is Tom Howard a terrible alkie, that's why he refuses a drink at first, but when he gets into it, is it that which will make things take a turn for the worse? Admittedly that strand didn't go the distance
Is Tom Howard gay? The breaking of the mermaid doll in two, separating the woman from the fish.
Are Tom Wake and Tom Howard really the same man? The rumour that Tom Wake done away with his lighthouse partner years ago (as we see Tom Howard pull up a severed head in the lobster cage) Is that what Tom Howard is about to do?4 Speech
As in The Witch, the filmmaker uses antique dialect to great effect, on one hand we totally understand what's being spoken but on the other there's also an alien quality which helps the period being depicted more believable. It gives you the same pleasure as keeping up with the subtitles in a foreign film except the language is your own.5 Sound
That foghorn sound at the beginning is edited around so beautifully and was shaking the seats of the cinema. The full force of the wind and rain could almost be felt it was so wild. Also the sounds inside lighthouse, the floorboards, the creaks etc all enhanced the feeling that this is not a place for peace and quiet.6 Weather
Wind and rain, rain in particular has never been so evocatively shown. The sense of being battered by the elements was pictured so well. I wish from now on, all weather reports just show clips of The Lighthouse for rain and wind.7 Thingy8 Thingy II1 Directionless
Near the end of the film there were perhaps one too many nods to There will be blood. Also there seemed to be a few unrelated, creamy black & white MTV style setups that were a bit too loosely stitched on.2 Robert Pattinson
For the camera's sake is the reason this actor got the role. He looks the part and probably had the look the filmmakers wanted but his talent looked shallow next to Willem Dafoe's.",The Lighthouse

The sound design is dynamic, acting as a third actor (or greek chorus) throughout, setting up action, red-herrings and the like with aplomb.

I've decided to give this an 8 for the reasons I will explain below.The good: This movie has gorgeous cinematography. The fact that this was shot on ~100 year old camera equipment and film stock makes you wonder why every movie from a 100 years ago didn't look this stunning. The framing and composition are flawless. The set decoration and costume design are perfect, and the lighting is sublime. The acting is breathtaking. I can't even begin to understand how Willem Dafoe was able to memorize his mesmerizing one-take monologue that seemed to go on for minutes, and deliver it with such fervor. (Obviously I'm not an actor.) And Robert Pattinson proves beyond the shadow of a doubt that he's no one-hit wonder. Both characters are extremely believable and intense.The bad: The script can at times feel a little empty. I understand that that was probably something the director did on purpose to convey the sense of desolation the characters feel, but it may have gone too far in some places. But my main gripe is with the ending. Yeah yeah, I get it. It harkens back to the myth of Prometheus and all that, but a little more story would've helped so much in assuaging the frustration the ending brings. And yes, I suppose this too was a deliberate choice by the director, and I get it, but it's a little empty. Not enough to ruin the movie, but not something that does it any favors either.All in all, I enjoyed it and I'd recommend it. But be prepared for a slightly frustrating ending.",The Lighthouse

But as the conditions at the lighthouse worsen the two become more reliant on each other for grounding; with dire consequence.It is no insult to say Robert Eggers replicates his genius storytelling skills in the same fashion he did when he brought into our lives horror movie visionaire, The Witch. It's no insult as Eggers thus far knows success.As one would imagine The Lighthouse explores the effects of isolation and grueling natural conditions on the body, mind and soul. It begs the question, if you had nothing except a small parcel of land on a rock then infinite ocean, what would be your basis for reality? Late 1800's New England serves as the backdrop for The Lighthouse. The time and location are equally important as the characters themselves.Fans with a specificity for the horror genre payoff will not find it as black and white as was laid in The Witch; when against all odds we gazed in awe as Thomasin (Anya Taylor-Joy) flies ecstatically into the night sky with her coven.

The landscape is nice, not much to say about the camerawork since most of the shots are just still shots. The effects are kinda neat and do their job of trying to emulate that old movie feel. But the movie does not make you uncomfortable or anything like it wants you to be, the whole film is just really dumb and the dialogue between the two characters just comes off as awkward and stiff.

10/10⛈🔦""Robert Eggers has proved that he is yet to become an iconic director in cinema history with this sophomore entry that will leave your blood running cold and leave you laughing uncomfortably during it's final moments.""The Lighthouse is a film of many names. Whether you call it funny, weird, or just flat out disturbing, at the end of the day, the movie just works as it's own little terrifying tale. With a classic 4:3 Aspect Ratio and in Black and White nonetheless, Eggers creates an atmosphere unlike any other, and puts a twist on the cabin fever concept. Though seemingly impossible, the cinematography in 4:3 Aspect Ratio is astounding in The Lighthouse. Even if it doesn't show color, there lies a sense of unease when each shot hits the screen, moreover when the score hits too; straight out of a Kubrick movie. With a little help from the two leads (Robert Pattinson and Willem Dafoe), who deliver some of the finest performances I've ever seen in a horror movie, we are able to see the human psychological breakdown at the hand of impatience and frustration. The script is the stronghold for the characters being that they're so opposite of each other; sometimes they're at each other's throats, next thing you know, they're drinking buddies. While I can admit that The Lighthouse is a slow burn movie on purpose, any horror fan will come to appreciate the efforts the film displays.Verdict: The Lighthouse is definitely my favorite horror movie of 2019, let alone one of my favorites of the decade. Robert Eggers has become worthy and has gifted yet once again another classic.",The Lighthouse

Every little detail feels like part of something bigger conspiracy. They would even kill for it. This desire is like a disease, devouring, rotting the soul at its root. And then after all the time and efforts spared, the sacrifices and struggles, they manage to climb to the top.

Or cimply as people - with or without all the madness. But don´t get me wrong - both Dafoe and Pattinson are excellent as lunatics. After 15 minutes i couldn´t stop laughing when Dafoes sour old fart of a character showed up on the screen.Neither of the two (Dafoe and Pattinson) were the least bit scary just unduly crazy, in sometimes, tragic-comical Ways. So as a horror or mystery movie this film is a joke but due to the actors ability to express madness and the creators over the top weird scenes - it often became laughable instead (even though it probably wasnt ment to be).

Add to that the powerful ocean waves writhing & crashing around the lighthouse ""rock"" & I was transported back to a very different era with no modern comforts. I could almost feel the harsh unpredictable weather & the weight of the gritty filthy hard work that had to be done by newbie lighthouse keeper Ephraim Winslow (Rob Pattinson) taking his orders from old timer, Thomas Wake, (Willem Dafoe). We find out in the first 10 minutes that Ephraim signed on for this job not knowing what he was in for. The pair put in outstanding performances together that at times made me cringe, laugh out loud, shudder, & feel creeped out. There isn't much of a plot, what we mainly get is watching these 2 very different men descend into an alcohol fueled hellish madness while stuck on the rock over several weeks.

566,rfolks-46580,Slow Descent into Madness,7,28 December 2020,"As someone who simply enjoys movies without calling myself a critic, I'm not sure I really ""got"" The Lighthouse, and I'm not sure I was supposed to.On a technical level, this is objectively a very good film.
Some kind of old or vintage film must have been used in shooting, because the movie is displayed (at least on the Amazon prime video player) in a very strange aspect ratio. This coupled with the black and white cinematography and the use of lamps to light night scenes gives the film a unique stylistic touch. Speaking of the Amazon player, I think this movie is hurt by it in parts. The compression artifacts make some scenes look like garbage, so if you can watch this on bluray or download a uncompressed version, then that will likely make the film look way better on your screen.The acting is superb. Dafoe and Pattinson get the only speaking roles in the movie, and when get the chance to flex their acting chops, and oh man, they do. They play the whole gambit from awkward acquaintances to drunken friends to bloodthirsty psychopaths. What impressed me the most was the accents they pulled out. Both Dafoe and Pattinson had to each nail their own individual, esoteric, and weird regional dialect and to my surprise I never noticed them slip up or change accents on any words, Dafoe was a 19th century sailor and Pattinson was a Maine farmer from start to finish. Their performances are what tie together and sell this movie as a total package.The plot is something else entirely though. The story of the lighthouse is about two men who find themselves slowly losing sanity as they take care of the lighthouse over days and weeks. At the start of the film, the sounds and shots are standard and, I would say, beautiful. The island looks good, and the lighthouse is quaint. However, as the movie progresses, the style of the film starts to get more and more erratic and surreal. Without giving away the plot, things really start to fall apart, and the style of the movie matches what is going on in the plot. In its final moments, The Lighthouse's one climactic moment reaches an apex where the whole movie goes insane: cinematography, sound design, plot, acting, everything; it all reaches a surreal zeitgeist.If a more artistic and surreal thriller movie is your jam, then The Lighthouse will be a 10 for you. For me, and I think many other viewers, the appeal of The Lighthouse to other viewers will leave you confused and jarred but entertained nonetheless.",The Lighthouse

Again, very weird.I will copy/paste words from another review simply because I can not say it better: ""Essentially, after the first hour this became narratively unclear and focused instead on repetitive fever dream scenarios and bombastic speeches and emotional conflict between the two characters - all of which were well done and well executed but only raised question marks without a clear story or message.""So true.",The Lighthouse

The shots were clearly dragged to extend the duration of the film, which is pretty amateurish move.

The first 30 minutes or so were decent, as you're waiting for the suspense to ramp up. But there's no real hooks, just confusing symbolism, repeated scenes, and ultimately an ending that doesn't really deliver much of anything. I'll never understand why people laud directors like this as visionaries - he has a good technical sense, and the cramped screen aspect was a nice touch, but it's sort of like he set up the scene and simply said, ""do something"" to the actors. There's no story there, nothing that really compels the viewer to the next scene. I thought about leaving the theater around the halfway mark, but stuck it out till the end, which was all sort of wasted time, really.

579,trrsb,Reality becomes nightmare - but not sure why.,6,19 April 2021,"I won't be long here. This film has several important boxes checked for a possibly great psychodrama but fails in the end with a lack of cohesion in storyline and an ending that did not correspond in any sense to what it needed to - a simple semblance of a stark (not dark yet) reality that occurred at the beginning of the film where two men sit and talk from different backgrounds and have to learn to live with each other for a few weeks, alone and without many distractions. Why did both go insane and not just one? Why did either go insane when this wouldn't happen to 99% of the population in the same circumstances? If there was provocation for insanity it seemed a false premise that only loneliness and booze would do the trick. It missed something here that was crucial and unexplained for the descent into a crazy nightmare to make sense. In summary:Acting:7
Cinematography: 8
Music: 9
Sets and Atmosphere: 7
Story: 1The closest thing I can recall seeing, which was infinitely better at creating the Nightmare that exists in every human mind, was David Lynch's Eraserhead. This film was also shot in Black and Whiter and I give Eggers kudos for making that all important choice. If you watched the movie on DVD with a good Home Stereo (or in theater) you likely noticed very low frequencies as was used in Lynchs Eraserhead. This was done to good effect because there is nothing more unsettling than low frequencies that seem to shake the walls not because of volume but because of 28 Hz.But where the great Eraserhead and Lighthouse are similar (like the Mermaid and the strangely captivating Woman next door in Eraserhead) their respective differences are what makes The Lighthouse fail on the level of creating and impossible dream seem remotely possible. Eraserhead was impossible from the start and you knew that. With Lighthouse I expected more of a logical fall into Hell.The Lighthouse begins with a relatively normal encounter between men that are isolated together and must learn to live with one another until their term together is ended. There were a lot of interesting relational segments and banters back and forth in Moby Dick language but the Homosexual drama seemed out of place and you don't know if this was a real emotion before total insanity or simply an insane response (for these two men who were clearly not HS) to loneliness that could be real, or maybe not. It seemed superfluous. Insanity leads to homosexuality in obviously non HS men? Unliikely in reality and if in a dreamstate (was it someone's dream or not?) was not believable. .And that's the problem with the film for me. For most of the movie it goes back and forth from sanity to insanity until it seems to fall right off the insanity cliff but does so in a totally wretched way with no connection to what led up to the allegorical sequences that came out of nowhere and at times that were random and simply did not make sequential sense. In other words, the film went from reality to unreality with nothing to connect the two cinematically or by story line. Of course, films that are purely psychodramas don't always have.to be linear with a logical progression along the way but this one blew into insanity as if the two men were given hallucinogenic drugs inside of delirium tremens. That for me was the biggest failure of the film.Yes, there were some redeeming qualities. However, for me, this was a film that only Charles ""No Sense Makes Sense"" Manson would or should like.It also fails my ""would I see again test"". Never.",The Lighthouse

584,thomasheaney,Interesting...,8,8 June 2020,"This was definitely a weird film, with strong artistic decisions and fantastic performances from both Patterson and Defoe.
This is not your traditional film in any way shape or form and that is what it makes it so special. The decision to do the film in black and white, along with a square aspect ratio, succeeds in making each scene seem darker, more repetitive and claustrophobic, which in a way is the pure essence of the film.
I love films such as this, that feel fresh, intuitive, intelligent and an unaltered vision from the director, which are qualities often missing in hollywood films.
If you want a relaxed film or something easy to watch, this is not the film. It is slow, artistic and powerful (a little but trippy too).
Overall 8/10",The Lighthouse
585,louis_southwood,The Lighthouse - BFF review,9,7 October 2019,"Film festival sweetheart The Lighthouse is a movie that a lot of film buffs have been looking forward to. The buzz has been real since it's premiere at Cannes festival and has been my personal most anticipated movie of the year for a while now. I'm more than happy to report that this movie lived up to my expectations in every way imaginable and is probably the best movie from 2019By far the most interesting thing about this movie is it's technical aspects. The movie is shot in 35mm black and white film at a 1,19x1 aspect ratio, basically the Lighthouse is shot to look like something that came out in the 1910s. Robert Eggers and his team have done such a phenomenal job here recreating this time period. And it works asolutely perfectly beacuse not only is it fitting for the time period that the movie is set in but it also adds to the claustrophobia and the atmosphere of the setting. Alot of thought was clearly put into shot composition as every single shot in this movie is breathtaking. Seriously there is some gorgeous cinematography on display here, some shots will stay with you long after you see the movie. Whilst the film is made to look and feel like a movie from the early 1900s, it's also not afraid to implement modern elements into the film aswell. camera movements and music composition add a unique modern spice that really adds to the movies unique presentation, there is truly nothing quite like this.
With the setting and the premise, for this movie to work it it needed two actors to pull this all together. Which is where Willam Dafoe and Robert pattinson come in, who both give career best performances. Both actors are given such brilliant material that allows them to go parody level insane, but it works beutifuly for the world in which they inhabit. Dafoe especially is hamming it up to cartoon levels of parody (Which the film does address) and it's absolutely amazing. Pattinson also continues to prove himself as one of the finest actors working in the industry.Overall this is nothing short of spectacular. I truly cannot think of a single flaw. This is one of those movies that completely transcends you into its world and by the time the credits roll you will just want to go back in.",The Lighthouse

Ever since I first heard about it due to the fuzz in Cannes I had a feeling this was going to be my type of film. I can confirm this now. The Lighthouse is a mad ride. Robbert Pattinson put out maybe one of the BEST performances I have ever seen. He is just one hell of a actor and I got blown away by the pure talent he showcased by the side of Willem. The pure rawness of the acting make this so much better than what it actually is. The story, well its kinda confusing. Both are deeply insane so you really can't tell what is real and what is fake, but it does not really matter. What matters is they manage to make you understand that it don't matter. Not an easy thing to do. The first part is kinda slow and not in the Tarkovsky way and I can't lie that I was impressed with the start. Sure some nice cinematography but nothing we have not seen before. Its a bit in to the movie things start to get incredible. I don't want to spoil but when they start drinking, shit start to go down.

593,jashaw-58240,Pretentious and wholly unikable,4,27 October 2019,"This movie is bad. It has a great IMDB score, but I think that's wholly undeserving. It's pretentious garbage. Robert Eggers has made two stinkers now, and some people are lapping these up. Meanwhile, I'd rather see Jordan Peele and Ari Aster continue to refine 'Artistic Suspense"", since they've created the two strongest films in this new sub-genera with Get Out and Midsommar.Like he did with the ""The Witch"", Eggers puts a ridiculous amount of research onscreen, here mid 20th century lighthouse rigmarole. The problem, which is the same ""The Witch"" has, is that the characters, plot, you know, the movie-ness of it all, is shoe-horned into a visual exhibit. There is no plot here. There are lines, weird visuals, allusions to insanity; none of it goes anywhere because it was an afterthought. Eggers next movie will probably be a silent film. He seems made for it.The big injustice, is that Willem Dafoe and Robert Pattinson are amazing actors. Even here, they do some justice to the horrible routine of it all. Dafoe has never looked crazier, and Robert Pattinson does a fair bit of physical transformation. It's all for naught though; these people appear to go crazy, or they don't. There might be a mermaid, but probably not. The sea-gull might have been possessed. Maybe. Ultimately, ambiguity is a clichéd plot device you use when you haven't figured out how things should fit together.I doubt people really enjoyed this movie.

603,alexismaria02,Modern Masterpiece,10,5 September 2020,"""How Long Have We Been On This Rock? Five Weeks? Two Days? Help Me Recollect.""This is one of those films that stick with you long after your first wach. Well, I've seen this film three times already and I can honestly say that this is nothing but a modern horror masterpiece. It is so raw, pure, depressing, mesmerizing and astonishing at the same time. Rarely do horror-fantasy films manage to keep you glued to the screen like ""The Lighthouse"" did. It is one of those films that get better and better each time you see it and not only that, but it also made me love it even more.
I've been a fan of Robert Eggers for quite some time now and after the VVitch, I honestly couldn't wait to see his upcoming projects(I'm also very excited about The Nothman). He is such a talented filmmaker and he's got so much potential. His writing skills are brilliant and there is actually not a single part of the dialogue in the film that I didn't enjoy. His direction is simply so unique and every shot in this was nothing but exquisite. The way everything looked so authentic and real was unbelievable. Eggers managed to capture my attention from the very first few seconds of the film and after that I immediately felt like I was transported to a whole different time and place. I love his style and I think he will become one of the greatests in the years to come.
Willem Dafoe and Robert Pattinson were absolutely out of this world. It was so mesmerizing to watch them turn to madness. Their accents were such a great touch to their characters and I honestly think that no one else could've done a better job. You could see how committed both of them were to these characters and I just love that. Dafoe was amazing as always and Pattinson just killed it. Hats off to both of them for their surreal performances!
The cinematography in this particular film was so, so dazzling and marvelous, that it made feel part of their world. The setting was fabulous and every single part of the lighthouse was so well built and looked amazing. The score was also magnificent and I do believe that it helped make everything more intense and terrifying.
I personally love each and every second of this film and I am confident in saying that this is one of the best films of the last decade without a doubt. It might not be for everybody, but it will sure as hell amaze you in one way or another. If you haven't checked it out yet, then do so!

604,artanis_mark,Don't Get Off The Boat!,7,25 April 2020,"Here are my thoughts on this monochrome, gross out horror pas de deux in no particular order:The movie does do an excellent job of creating a sense of ceaseless, steadily mounting dread, something horror movies rarely achieve. Shots of monstrous, violent surf crashing against steep cliffs, an oppressive film palette consisting entirely of blacks, grays, and washed out hints of white, gulls' shrieks, and most of all the foghorn's constant, awful groan, add up to an increasing case of the creeps as the film goes on.Speaking of monochrome, I thought young'uns nowadays couldn't hang with watching anything not in color. The Lighthouse must be the exception that proves the rule. In some ways it resembles a film from the '40's or '50's when it was an accepted convention to shoot horror and crime/mystery films in b&w precisely because you got a scarier atmosphere that way.Basically no male bodily function or fluid goes unexplored. The sole characters, Defoe and Pattinson, live in close quarters, trapped on an island rock with no escape. Over time, what starts out as a hostile supervisor-subordinate relationship takes some decidedly weird twists and turns with Defoe alternating between miserable sessions of bullying Pattinson and other times when he butters him up, guzzling rotgut redeye the whole while. The steadily deteriorating dynamic between the two men is in itself one of the film's most unpleasant aspects.The film shows an impressionistic, swirling series of details, vague plot threads involving matters like the previous, one eyed junior keeper's death (suicide or murder?), the appearance in dreams and possibly real life of a young, naked mermaid with a disturbingly anatomically correct body as an object of fantasy and terror, and the Defoe character's jealous obsession with the lighthouse's lantern to the point of sexual mania. None of this adds up to a coherent, relatable narrative, but despite this cinematic obfuscation, The Lighthouse does still have a discernible story arc. No spoilers, but it turns on the junior keeper's past life as a lumberjack and a mortal sin committed by deliberate omission. His awful fate is one of Promethean grotesqueness.Lastly and most importantly, Willem Defoe does an excellent, spot on imitation of Poopdeck Pappy, Popeye the Sailor's worthless, reprobate father, right down to the salty sea talk and an ill tempered, heavily alcoholic personality. His arr, matey, begob there shtick does add some needed comic relief to what is ultimately a truly grim flick.I'd say The Lighthouse is pretty much for hardcore horror fans.",The Lighthouse
605,wire_,The Lighthouse (2019),5,26 October 2019,"The Lighthouse (2019)If movie-makers can only write what they know, and increasingly all they know is other movies, then this art form is eating itself.And this is what is to be found in The Lighthouse: a shaggy dog story about the pitfalls of making a movie when you don't know a lot about it, or about anything else. The lighthouse itself is the movie projector, and it caused two actors go drunkenly mad in awe and obsession with the light it shines around them.The whole thing is deliberately affected to create a sense of foreboding. Like you are looking through some portal at an aged and foreign world, that is timeless and placeless but for being in a dream. The picture is cropped, confined, opaquely grey, cold and moody. You struggle to see half of it. It's un-cinematic in the same way that a zombie is un-dead. The camera is just a keyhole, but the leaden views is punctuated by some lovely filmic textures.Sound / noise are used to great effect to expand the frame into bombastic, threatening and eerie dimensions. But as this non-story drags on, what worked to establish setting and tone gives way to the sensation of tedious loops.Everything in this movie is a nod to some prior art; nothing is original; repetitions.The director has remarked about folklore and impressionism, but avoids comment about his intentions and influences. As an artist he doesn't need to explain his work. His modest repertoire can't afford the status of auteur, and this work is more ritualistic and gimmicky than expressive, so his regards seem evasive. I mention this because the movie superficially appears to have the heft to justify deep thoughts about creative drives and intentions, and questions about the world on the other side of the camera. I found it too harsh, elliptical and boring to be entertaining. So what is being proffered? It's oddly close to a superhero movie, except its colorless and has an immense horn honking all the way through it.Dafoe and Pattinson have a blast chewing each other up. They manage to create some laughs in what is otherwise a literal shtshow between bunk mates trapped in an actors studio located on some ethereal mound of coastal rock. They resort to fart jokes and oddly dull slapstick to create enough pressure in a scene to justify a cut. But in all but a few transitions, its a cut to nowhere.There are some brightly monstrous images which are exceptional, and linger in my mind. Too bad there's nothing binding them together into a story. The additional work required to convey 3 acts would have been minimal, so it seems to have been deliberately avoided.It's like storytelling is dead and movies are now collectively dreaming.The Nolan Bros were on to something with Inception.If the intent of this device-and device is all this is because it eschews essential cinematic architecture-is to artistically convey the madness of modern movie production, then success!Will you enjoy this ride?

But this is an industry-wide problem in this cinematic era.Happily I got a 15 minute nap in the middle. I'm sure I missed nothing. I would've walked if not for my company. For enduring it I was rewarded with a couple of remarkably strange sights at end which in no way justify remaining, but I got to see nonetheless.This might make a good late nite date movie if you are completely infatuated. You might remember it as a weird or quasi-mystical emotional or psychic aberration to the pleasures of new love.As to awards, I like the idea of a class of audience that's not enjoying this sort of thing but but they laugh nervously and stick around out of respect for all the hard work that went into it, and because they paid for the ticket.

609,productionslykos,Another Robert Eggers masterpiece that dares challenge modern day film making yet exhales an almost post modernistic aura,9,24 June 2020,"Another Robert Eggers masterpiece that dares challenge modern day film making yet exhales an almost post modernistic aura. From the beginning, a beautifully unwelcome repugnance of an atmosphere unveils itself and lingers until the final letter of the credits. A huge part of this displeasantness manifests from Mark Korven's somewhat antiquated and preternatural score that instinctively exerts every muscle in a body to wince in its discomfort. In addition, every naturally lit scene hollers an undesired sensation at the sight of each gorgeously trenchant and harsh shadow shed. And in charity, every frame is stimulatingly picturesque and illustrates a story in its story. The character development is phenomenal, in that we witness the plummet of two men and their sagacity into an abyss where unrecoverable to which Pattinson and Dafoe, whom are perfectly cast, incarcerate with perfection down to every South West English accented utter. Every sea gull caw, every crack of lightning, all accumulates towards the plethora of crisp, haunting sound effects that immerses further than any visual imagery could; conjointly birthing a constant disturbance that is additionally fueled through the claustrophobic intensity of a secluded rock being shot through a boxed 1.19:1 aspect ratio. This story of suffocation echoes a somewhat 'The Shining' sentiment and although nonsensical, is effortless to follow and is interestingly deep despite lack of a linear narrative and in all moreover disseminates a raw, experimental cinematic piece. This flick is extremely bizarre and not for everyone but exemplifies the A24 studio and Robert Eggers fashion perfectly for everyone that loves it.",The Lighthouse

611,filipovnanastassja,"Very original, complex, and simple",10,30 May 2020,"As others have said by now, this movie is gore, sometimes shocking, sometimes cruel, and sometimes you let out a chuckle. It has mythological and literature subtext, but even if you don't know about Prometheus and Protheus or Ahab - it won't prevent you in enjoying this film. Why? Because, at the end - it's a very simple story we lived through on the past three months: two guys in a lockdown - nowhere to go. Also, I don't know has anybody noticed it yet, but I felt like it has a little bit of Bergman's Persona: two people alone - figuring out what and who they are,merging identites, black and white picture? It suprised me in a positive way. From the first scene you know if you'll like it or not. The atmosphere is so thick you can cut it with a knife, it feels as if you are THERE with them, and as if you're also going insane. You know what it feels like when the power's out and you sit with your family around a candle? And everything is a tad creepy? Yeah, that's what it's like. It's also very oniric - like a bad dream you have, and you know it's a dream but are still very frightened? Like that too. I felt like Pattinson's character is supposed to face himself and his actions, but, in doing so - he loses his mind. He can't stand this obnoxious man he's trapped with, his presence suffocates him and at the same time he feels like he's alone. As some would say: it be like that sometimes. Some mark this as a horror, but if you're here for horror in terms of slashing and screaming and creepiness, you should keep in mind that this film, even thought has these elements, is also a character and insanity study and not only a tool to make you jump in your seat every two seconds. I mean, sometimes you can't even tell who the bad guy is: fatum, perhaps?

I was stunned that it not receive a single award. And that, now famous picture, where Dafoe and Pattinson shows middle finger to that whole situation is truly justified. Because they killed it. This movie is perfection. So different from anything I've watched. New way of lighting, storytelling, editing, acting, sound mixing. Filmmaking technique is exceptional. Square film frame adds to the claustrophobia and blurs the lines between physical space and head space. The way that is demonstrated wind howling, sea roaring really is terrifying, creepy and chilling. The movie is dark, and scary, but also funny. What a combo isn't it? Unbelievable. It shows what cold, isolated, rainy places bring in people. Black-and-white cinematography deepens the film's shadows and unease, sharpening their cheekbones, and their faces in close-up become more frightening.For Dafoe we know how outstanding actor he is, but Pattinson grow on me with every new film. Every role brings on the next level. He is not here to play. These two go hand in hand.This film is strange and will not be everyones cup of tea, but different is always good.

While the acting is superb, and the cinematography great, everything beyond that is a clumsy mess so full of itself that it's bursting.At its core the story is an obvious ode to Prometheus, with a side serving of identity crisis, and a possible exploration into the timeloop spectrum (Thomas and Thomas both have very similar mustaches, after all).While the actors and crew were clearly giving their all to this performance, in the end it's hard to actually care about anything that happens. Everything is so isolated and vague, that all you come away with is the feeling that nothing you just saw matters. The story is so distant from any conceptual reality that it doesn't seem worth the effort to further analyze the themes and lore that inspire it, and that's where this arthouse movie falls apart.I don't want to spoil it beyond that because while I'm critical of its reputation, the film itself is bizarre, disturbing, and hilarious enough to deserve a watch.

The camerawork, aspect ratio and bizarre imagery throughout perfectly captures this sense of insanity.Dafoe and Pattinson are both excellent and pretty much carry the entire film with their performances. There is also a lot of shock value here as well which I didn't expect from this movie, most notably a scene where Pattinsons character, 'Winslow', brutally and senselessly bashes the brains out of a seagull against a wall.The ending was also hauntingly sinister in the scene in which 'Winslow' finally manages to get to the top of the lighthouse and discover what is up there. Despite you never see it, his reaction leaves enough to the imagination.Due to his work on both this and 'The VVitch', it is easy to see why Robert Eggers deserves to be hailed as one of the great new horror filmmakers.",The Lighthouse

I myself did not agree with the end, which is why I did a lot of research on the Internet for answers. And I got it. However, there is no clear end. There are different ways of looking at this film that could be understood. In terms of art, this is one of the best films that have appeared in recent decades. The picture, based on old masterpiece from the young film era, great theater play by Willem Dafoe and Robert Pattinson, which continues to develop into a character actor.* And on the other hand, it depends on the taste of the viewer. It depends on whether you like such a film with such a special rare style. Due to this difficult-to-see style, this film gives the viewer a bitter aftertaste and the tension is completely eliminated, because of this hard style. The film is not exciting. Only special.

It is a claustrophobic, and dizzying nightmare with Pattinson and Dafoe each giving possibly the performances of their lengthy careers. They both are required to show a ton of range and a variety of emotions for their characters, and they both give (In All Honesty) Oscar worthy performances with Pattinson as the Lead and Dafoe in Supporting.Robert Eggers has made this film feel legitimately like a film from the 1950s, with Hitchcock being a clear inspiration. He has this time period nailed down to a T, with the costumes, accents production and score seriously make the film set in the 1890s. I also have to acknowledge the score, which is haunting and elevates the film.I don't want to dive too deep into the story, but the premise is that Pattinsons character has been assigned to this lighthouse as a keeper with Dafoe, who slowly realizes the island is not what it seems.

The Lighthouse is a very unconventional film. It is shot in 35mm film with an aspect ratio of 1.19:1 and it's in black and white. All of this combined with the production and costume design makes this feel like a film that would have come out back in the early 1900s. Here Robert Pattinson gives what is arguably his best performance. The range of emotion that he is able to put on screen is unparalleled. Willem Dafoe keeps up with Pattinson with such masterful skill, also giving one his best performances. The chemistry between these two is the pillar in which this film is leaning on. For almost the entire runtime it's them on screen. Robert Eggers paired up with cinematographer Jarin Blaschke gave this film a particular look you won't find anywhere else.

643,sebastiannagra,"Visually striking, leaves you thinking.",8,21 June 2021,"I watched this film alone at midnight. In one word, this film was dreamlike, or more accurately, nightmarish.This film is so far from anything else I've seen, in visuals, dialogue, story, characters, structure. The 3:4 aspect ratio coupled with the black and white palette creates a distinct look, allowing the film to detach itself from modern cinema and experiment with visuals. Light has been perfected, and it's used to tell story as much as a conversation or monologue does. Often, there will be stretches of time in which not a single word is said, instead offering imagery for the viewer to discern the story. When speech is used, it's accurate to the time period and heavily accented, making it difficult to tell what is being said, however this poses less of a problem than most films, as dialogue is only a small part of what is needed to understand. Plus, it means the small snippets of speech that you hear are ones that will stick in your mind for days to come. This film is formless, not relying on a simple three-act structure, but rather, creating its own, slow descent of an experience. Every scene is equally gripping as the last, culminating to an ending that will burn itself into your mind. And, it goes without saying that Willem Dafoe's and Robert Pattinson's acting is flawless. The two carry the entire film between them, making you forget they're even actors and not really the characters they play. I'm genuinely excited to see where these two go next.All of this comes together to create an ascended cinematic experience, and a fantastic technical feat. However, the film's lack of reliance on cinematic norms may make the film almost entirely impenetrable and meaningless for many viewers.83/100--Admin--

+ Cinematography is wonderful. Very thoughtful and atmospheric. Plays with shadows exceptionally well
+ Interesting aspect ratio brings black and white to fashion yet againEverything else is incoherent and/or pretentious series of sequences which as a whole do not make an art form which we call a film (movie).Cons
Film shifts perspective in arbitrary fashion. One moment you follow hyper-realist psycho-drama, and the next you're witnessing D-grade monster flick. Without any point, it should be mentioned.Extensive use of symbolism (much like a goat in The Witch). Again, without any point but to fulfill its own purpose - kinda like that line in Ni***s in Paris ""Nobody knows what it means, but it's provocative!""I do not mind slow films (one of my favorites is Barry Lyndon, not a blockbuster).

So many teasers! So much foreboding!But then it all fell flat. The story fell apart; the substance that was there in the first part just vanished.

I'm sure they thought that shooting the film in black and white, in a 4 to 3 aspect ratio, with almost every scene dark and dreary was very arty, but I just found it boring. I'm sure that many viewers found it thrilling to watch Pattinson schlepping coal in a wheelbarrow and then shoveling it into a boiler fascinating, but I found it pointless. I don't think I'm giving anything away by saying that the whole plot could be summed up by saying two unpleasant characters, stranding in a remote and unpleasant place tediously descend into madness. I'm sure that many people found this descent to be fascinating, but I found it totally unconvincing. The Dafoe character spouts long, meaningless sentences in a very high-blown, pseudo-classical style that I'm sure many fans thought 'what an interesting character"", but my reaction was ""what a load of crap"" Maybe the Dafoe character is supposed to symbolize something, but to me he only symbolized a wasted afternoon and $9 down the drain.",The Lighthouse

I fell asleep a couple of times it was so bad but when I woke back up, it's not like anything had changed - more drinking, more farting, more jerking off, more harassing of sea gulls, etc. And the damn fog horn. Maybe that's what drove them crazy. But it's not like other lighthouse keepers during that period all went nuts over such a short period of time, I mean 5 weeks is hardly a huge length of time.and then it just sort of ended.

The actors were amazing, the sets were striking, the filming was okay... so here's the 'but'... But the script was too weak. Here you have these actors giving their lives up to the screen in period costumes, authentic looking sets and moody filming but the dialogue was both difficult to understand and while you're straining to understand that they just said they say more meaningless stuff and jump around signing and dancing drunk. And then it's daylight and everything has changed. I think someone forgot to read Aristotle's poetics. Things happening out of sequence without purpose. Characters entering the story line without enough information to understand why they are there. And finally only the weakest links to the characters behavior and history to account for them going mad like that. If you don't want to tell a story but just give some randomly connected images to the audience and let them make up their own story, well then okay.

This is another gross failure in the story, because his exaggerated behaviour gradually destroys a better way tp face Pattinson's role.

Quick shots stimulate the mind, wizzing machines, bright white fire that roars through the medium of 33mm film. Even the straight on shots of the men at work, at inanimate objects at rest and in movement pay homage to a time in cinema long gone, while also drawing us in further to the scene than we would like, working on us subconsciously to make sure we are never at ease.A boxy aspect ratio pens us in, like the keepers of the light, bound to the confines of a wind harassed island, curbed from the world by fog and squall, so are we restricted, held in, by the limitation of out vision. Colour has been drained from this world. We spend out time with these men whom we know nothing about, who know nothing about each other. All that is clear is the differences. The hale youth of one in comparison to the age of the other; their accents, not just worlds apart, but eons too; ones reticent vs the others nostalgic openness. What is sure, however, is that there is more to the history of these men than they let on.For most people this will be a strange movie, a conundrum that will live somewhere in the back of their head, rising up every now and again, to only perplex them further. What is clear for me, however, is that is a work of strong auteurship from a young director coming into the strength of his powers. The cast numbers two, Defoe and Patterson who while alone on the screen, or together, lay down some of their best work, for one in a decade, for the other ever. This movies is odd, it is original while being reminiscent of an old world mostly forgotten - there is something of it that reminds one of Beckett, and then a moment later something that sparks the mind towards The Ring. Elements here persist that show of an education in, and understanding of film accruable only over a life time.For what this movie attempts it succeeds. What it needs to do, it does with out need for convoluted plot. This is a movie to be felt: its unease, its discomfort, its growing madness.

Unfortunately, they have been snubbed like Toni Collette and Lupita Nyong'o, as horror, or even horror/psychological-type films, will not be recognized by The Academy, which is just a joke at this point.Personally, the very slow pacing and use of repetitiveness to tell the story worked well, but honestly was not really my cup of tea.

Uh-oh, I sense a new Hollywood motif developing. Both have been classified by many critics as "" masterpieces "" although I regard a master cinematic work as one that merits repeated viewings over the years. This film will deservedly be forgotten and abandoned well before the end of the decade. Nonetheless, this feature does display impressive cinematography along with the skilled acting prowess of its principal stars, while failing to convey any truly potent narrative behind all the neo-Bergmanesque imagery. Maybe it's a study of the struggle for power even in the face of deteriorating physical and mental health. Perhaps it's about mythical sea monsters that crawl from the sea to haunt landlocked mortals or maybe it's simply a severe case of seasonal affective disorder, as Robert Pattinson seems deliriously happy once he finally gets a massive sun lamp tanning treatment via the tower's high watt beacon. To break up the isolation and drudgery, he tries getting it on with the local mermaid, obviously preferable to the grisly alternative scenarios of passionate embraces with gnarly old salt Willem Dafoe, only to ultimately get weirded out by the concept of a relationship with a hybrid animal species. It might have worked out if he was a Pisces. I recall reading that classic Hollywood execs once bemoaned the absence of a third act in screenplays.

700,Mister_F11,Intriguing story with ambitious artistic level,9,1 January 2020,"Screenplay 10/10
Robert Eggers just did a intriging movie in his second one. In about 90 minutes he told us about two men getting crazy in a lighthouse. But in the end the viewer doesn't know what is real and what's not. I discussed three hours in a row with my friends about how to interpret the story of the movie. Brilliant!Direction 9/10
Just like ,,The Witch'' ,,The Lighthouse'' is a very atmospheric movie which is very well paced and keeps the adrenaline up very high throughout the whole movie. The black-and-white and the small ratio which is nearly square are keeping up the artistic level of the work. In the end it is maybe a bit too artistic for somebody.Acting 9/10
The movie contains three actors. One of those is simply just screaming but Robert Pattinson and Willem Dafoe absolutely delivered a massive performance. Pattinson is a professional actor, which can be huge one day, and not the charming ,,Twilight'' vampire anymore.Soundtrack 8/10

704,greatbun,Mixed Bag,7,5 August 2020,"The Lighthouse had some of the greatest cinematography and acting I've ever seen. Dafoe and Pattinson give outstanding performances and Eggers goes in a direction that not many other directors have. However, the story was a little difficult for me. I understood it and I appreciated it, but I couldn't help but feel uncomfortable and unsatisfied throughout the film.

705,geovannyboss,The storytelling style and shooting techniques are very good,8,8 July 2020,"Filled with metaphors; a movie that can be considered successful in terms of katharsis. Actually, it is not fantastic; As a result, he handled the concept of reality in such a way and used it in such ways that it was extremely good in terms of cinema. 7.6 in terms of IMDB Score; as if it was a bit exaggerated, but ... I don't know.In terms of acting, it's pretty groundbreaking for Robert Pattinson. Both performances are successful. ""Worskhop"" performances were exhibited for someone who is interested in acting or acting. The appearance of a highly stereotypical spiritual portrait in terms of whether the characters are suitable for such a task did not make the film bad. After all, the stereotype always does work. The reason why anything cliché can be cliché is already!A gamble on the concepts of nightmare, hallucinatory elements, reality and time and space is almost. The reliance of uncertainty is also relied upon abundantly. In fact, this mystery would be a much more spectacular movie if it was raised a little more. It is worth noting that there is no movie that everyone will love.There is no similarity with the movie ""Cold Skin"", which I watched previously, is an old production. To some extent, I even thought that the script would be shot again. To be mentioned in the absence of ""spoilers"", characteristic features, surveillance scenes and all the situations there; the first incident witnessed in the lighthouse and the fantastic situation there; exactly the same with that movie!

710,Juan_Atreides,Elevated Horror? A director's onanism.,3,23 January 2020,"Watching ""The Lighthouse"" you will watch several onanisms: Robert Pattinson's character onanisms and director's onanism: the movie itself.
Well crafted (nice photography and music), correct cinematography and well played by Pattinson and Dafoe, but soulless, boring and repetitive. This movie has the same problem than ""Midsommar"" and ""Us"", it is too self conscious, and the director likes himself a lot. All these films have great imagery, but you can't build a movie only with that. A good example: Mandy. A masterpiece with a fantastic imagery and with soul, a movie that leaves you with a deep impression and impact. If elevated horror are Eggers, Aster's Midsommar (Hereditary is great) and Peele, I will always be a prosaic horror guy.",The Lighthouse

Don't expect the be guided.It was harder to follow what was going on compared to the VVitch, which is one of my favorite horror movies, but that didn't take anything out of the story. Dafoe and Pattinson are both brilliant in this, Dafoe especially with all the madness, confusion and the ups and downs. Some scenes between those too made me feel like I was witnessing an actual storm.By the end you might have some questions about what actually happened and honestly, I don't really know either. As I said it's open to interpretation. However, that doesn't affect the story negatively I think, because whatever the reality is doesn't change the fact that this is a brilliantly acted and written piece of cinema.",The Lighthouse
712,adam-m-fontenot,A brilliant and beautiful story,9,20 October 2019,"It's rare to see a new director develop such a strong personal style so early as Robert Eggers, but one really feels as though he has come into his own with The Lighthouse. While The Witch was certainly a wonderful film, and I don't want to say this one is better, the director's fingerprints are on even clearer display in The Lighthouse. Some themes are in common. We see, for example, how the stories we tell each other reflect our own weaknesses and our shared human frailties. We see how the supernatural (and the stories we tell about it) says as much about how human beings relate to one another as how we relate to it. Yet what shines forth from The Lighthouse is the care put into every moment and the consistency of vision; watching the film is akin to sitting around a warm fireside with Eggers, listening to his stories.It's tempting to try to reduce the film to a small set of central themes, but doing so belies the complexity of the characters that makes any summary necessarily inadequate. Despite the fact that the story can accurately be called a yarn, the characters themselves are entirely believable as real people. It's impossible to come away from the film without understanding that the back stories of each character, shadowy though they are, play an irreducible part in defining the people we see on the screen. No one in this film can be entirely a drunkard, madman, or fiend, because any of these descriptions falls short of explaining them to us. Their authenticity as real people alone would make this film a must-see, as they are wonderfully portrayed by Pattinson and Dafoe.Despite this, it is clear that Eggers has something to say about masculinity, and once again it's the subtlety of his approach that makes it exceptional. The Lighthouse is not out to preach to anyone. What another film would argue for, or rudely declare, Eggers gently portrays and leaves us to do the interpreting. Rather than give a rational breakdown of masculinity, or take a subversive approach by revealing its emotional side, Eggers chooses to depict. He gives us two characters who are quite aligned in personality, to reveal how two wills inevitably clash because of their similarities, not their differences. For Eggers, masculinity does not argue its case rationally, nor compel with emotional weight, but seduces, insists, and demands.We see in the film the forces of guilt, power, libido, knowledge, and homoeroticism, and how they necessarily interlock in the masculine. While the sexual always plays out in terms of power relations, likewise power relations cannot exist without the sexual. Though one character tries to follow ""the rules"", applying his whole will and rationality to resist these urges, their enchanting power proves great enough to strain him to the breaking point. Throughout, the light they maintain together functions as a symbol of the irresistibly potent combination of knowledge, sexuality, and power that forms the ideological subject of the film. In one memorable flourish, Eggers ties these specific characters and their conflict to Greek mythology with a shocking visual - one that suggests the curse that lies on the path these characters follow. The scenes in the film dealing with these concepts provide a rather heady brew, but fortunately everything stays grounded in the excellent story-telling.As most people have heard already, the performances and direction are both superb. Likewise, the cinematography and almost unnoticeable musical backing are not only beautiful and successful at making their mark on the viewer, they also intimate the same care and unique perspective as the script. It's not common to see a film with this much artistry in every shot; anyone who appreciates film will enjoy every minute.My one serious criticism is about the pacing of a 10 minute stretch around halfway through the film. I did love the moderate pace of the long introduction, which really gives you time to sink into the atmosphere and these characters. But once the story seems to have picked up, it takes a brief tangent that slows the momentum built up by the middle of the movie. For those seeing it in theaters, I also noticed what seemed to be some strange moire-like artifacts in the grain during the first five minutes or so of the film, possibly caused by compression problems in the DCP. This wasn't too distracting, however, and I believe it went away after that.Overall, Eggers has delivered another near perfect film that has quite a lot in it for everyone to enjoy. It's beautiful without being showy, and interesting without being didactic. Consider this review a 9.5/10.",The Lighthouse

The black and white setting resurrected from a past era, the nubilous fog rolling in from the sea, even the absence of dialogue during the introduction immediately triggers an intense foreboding. You know you're in for a suspenseful journey.If you hadn't already come to such a conclusion by this point, as soon as the dialogue begins you know you are watching a masterpiece that was artfully developed from both sides of the antiquated lens used to shoot the film. From the cinematic marvel created behind the camera to the absolutely INCREDIBLE, emotional performances on the other side of the lens by Robert Pattinson and Willem Dafoe, it just doesn't get any better than this.The blending of horror, suspense and dark humor throughout a claustrophobic and emotional descent into a type of madness portrayed by both men is literally captivating. Even if you aren't typically a horror fan, you owe it to yourself to see this movie.Everything about The Lighthouse has Oscar written all over it. It would be a sad day for the Academy if there aren't, at the very least, nominations for Robert Pattinson for Best Actor, Willem Dafoe for Best Supporting Actor and Robert Eggers for Best Director. In my opinion, there should also be a nomination for Best Cinematography.

First off, the way the film looks is beautiful. I love the greyscale and the aspect ratio made to look like an early 1900s film. The movie is filled with beautiful shots especially of Dafoe's face. His character at times looks so intense. Both Dafoe and Pattinson do an incredible performance. Dafoe I've always like and he here is maybe my favorite acting he's done. His character is wild and he certainly pulls that off very convincingly. I've never watched any of the Twilight movies and have never seen anything else Pattinson was in, so this really is my first introduction to his acting. He too is incredible at portraying a worried young man turning into a complete lunatic. They both act well to a great script full of such interesting and bizarre dialogue. I really enjoyed just listening to what they both were saying throughout the whole film.
However, the plot and point of the film I still am not quite sure of. It seems maybe there isn't one and the point is just to feel to atmosphere the film creates. I've read people comparing this to a Lovecraftian type of story and I totally can see that. But normally those sorts of stories aren't really interesting to me. I enjoy a movie more when it has a clear plot. Yes, again the movie looks beautiful, the acting is great, the dialogue is interesting, and the atmosphere is memorable, but I wish somehow it could have been more comprehensible.

Nothing is even remotely answered, let alone hinted at.When you break it down, this film mostly amounts to two people getting drunk and bemused, singing, and fighting. Throw in a few cryptic visuals, then rinse and repeat.The film amounts to nothing. Absolutely nothing happens in the entire movie that makes a lick of sense. Sure, you can come up with your own interpretations, but there is zero and I mean ZERO consensus on what this film is about, because the pretentious script was designed to appeal to the type of person who is so in love with themselves that they think people want to hear their made-up interpretations and analysis' of hidden themes in stories.",The Lighthouse

Even The Green Goblin and Batman can't propel this beyond Eggers' weak material, and boy do they try. On the one hand, gone are all the cheesy supernatural elements. Mostly anyway. Unfortunately, he also took out the tense drama of The Witch as well. In its place are cliche metaphors and a predictable conclusion set to drunken rants and tense music. Such tense music. If they handout out awards for scores that carried films, this would surely win it.I shouldn't be so hard on this one. This is the sort of film that people just getting into art films will surly declare a masterpiece.

However, this was a very masculine movie. And no I'm not talking about ""toxic masculinity"" or an feminist view point here at all, but it was very masculine and boring for me.
The story is about two very masculine men who end up competing with one another on a desolate island in the middle of the sea. I'm not sure what they were competing for exactly, which is why I believe this movie would have spoken far deeper to a mans sub conscious, than a woman's.
Either way, they both seemed to have turned crazy with the alcohol consumption and isolation.
The sexual aspects of the movie were very real and honest and I appreciated that part of the film, because I'd imagine, sexually speaking, the isolation would drive you mad. You'd start imagining insane things to turn yourself on etc. Which is what seemed to have happened for both of them.
Anyways, I would check this movie out for the sole purpose of it is a beautiful film, well written, well acted, very honest and slightly disturbing which is exactly what life is deep down.

While there is a huge amount of visual storytelling, the film really ignites during the conversational sparring between the two leads who bicker and sally like an old psychotic couple, ever shifting one's sympathies and expectations. As the story unfolds, the island itself becomes insidiously hostile and frightening, depicted in bleak, surreal monochrome reminiscent of early silent horror movies - all beautifully composed and incredibly atmospheric.A lot is being said of the two leads, both are being praised and rightly so but this is Willem Dafoe's movie. He is so good that I struggle to think of a more impressive leading performance. He veers between subtle and ripe at exactly the right beats in every moment, delivers the best monologue since Robert Shaw in Jaws and perfectly embellishes Egger's excellent dialogue beyond any reasonable expectation. Phenomenal acting.Alongside the brooding intensity and psychodrama, the film moves at a click with a roll of intriguing sequences, mixing mystery and dark maritime mythology into a completely original and decisively cinematic experience.

He pulls energy from his costar and does not merely reflect it but he internalizes it in his performance. I am looking forward to more of his dramatic, adult roles. With this outing, he leaves no doubt that he is in the ranks of Juaquin Phoenix, Matthew McConahey, Adam Driver and the like.
The overlooked parts of this film are the Art/Set Direction, Costume Design, Film Editing, Directing, Screenplay and the Dialect coaching.
The Cinematography is in a ballpark all of its own. Using the 1.19:1 ratio, black and white film with the filters made me feel as though I was watching a film dated before ""The Ghost and Mrs. Muir"". The was ZERO problem with source lighting issues, which makes me honor the Director, Cinematography and Lighting Department for taking such a risk to keep the film's claustrophobic authenticity to the time period it was trying to emulate.
I wish this Film could be re-released to a wider market, since I know very few people who have seen it.
A note to Mr. Pattinson... BE SELECTIVE IN ALL SCRIPTS YOU ACCEPT FROM THIS FILM FORWARD. YOU ARE NOW BEING TAKEN SERIOUSLY, SO ONLY CHOOSE ROLES THAT WILL PROGRESS YOUR CAREER. DON'T TAKE A ROLE SIMPLY FOR MONEY... ask JODIE FOSTER.",The Lighthouse

754,mzucker-39574,THIS MOVIE IS NOT FOR EVERYONE,9,28 November 2020,The Lighthouse is a 2019 horror drama black comedy gobbledy gook kind of movie. It has two of the best performances *checks notes* of all time.It has a very VERY simple premise: two guys chilling in a lighthouse five feet apart because they're insane. Now let me make this clear THIS MOVIE IS NOT FOR EVERYONE! This is a very artsy hypnotic movie that is more than a little low on plot but certainly makes up in fantastic directing and the aforementioned powerhouse performances. If you're into creepy layered deeply weird gross adventures you will probably love it. If not that's okay too. Just remember to put on the subtitles.Okay thank you love you byyyyyyyyyye!,The Lighthouse

The message of the story is not clear for me as everyone claimed. I like The Witch. I get the message of The Witch. This one is vague, ambiguous, unless you think too hard (or watch a YouTube video for someone to explain it). I like the cast. I like the acting. I like the dialogues. I like the cinematography.

757,jonathanzeidman,"Great dialogue, lousy plot.",6,1 February 2020,"Simply put, I thought the dialogue was rich and the acting was credible. The plot, if you can call it that, consists of a personal dynamic between two isolated individuals that starts off distant and deteriorates with time. One, or both, are suffering a psychotic break. As the movie progresses, it is difficult to determine what is real, or whose perspective is more real. It remains vague enough, and it is drawn out for so long, that by the end of the movie, I found I didn't care anymore.Despite great cinematography, rich characters and I have to repeat, excellent dialogue, I was exceedingly glad to get out of that theatre when it was, finally, over.",The Lighthouse
758,samapholt,Weird and wonderful,9,16 February 2020,This movie at it's core wouldn't work without it's two powerhouse performances. Pattinson and Dafoe do their best work ever in my opinion and the fact that neither of them even got a nomination is a real shame. The film is bonkers and it really pulls off that insanity. The movie is also incredibly pretty and really should have won the Oscar for cinematography.,The Lighthouse
759,estaugas,Brilliant,10,1 March 2020,"The best thing going for the lighthouse is definitely its music, perfectly menacing and foreboding and in combination with the choice of a black and white palette gives rise to a very tense and suspenseful atmosphere solidifying itself as a horror film.The cinematography is very engaging making it easy to be sucked into the movie and immersed, allowing the film's atmosphere and suspense to really grip you and put you on edge.Both Robert Pattinson and Willem Dafoe give outstanding performances. They pull of the 1890s English dialect flawlessly adding a lot of fidelity to the film. However, at times it is a bit hard to follow along with what they're saying.The film also has a decent bit of dark comedy running throughout it, balancing its intensity and keeping it from becoming tiresome.",The Lighthouse

Maybe I need to read more about ocean mythology. Robert Pattinson is improving all the time as an actor but his accent sounds strange although it matches the tone of the movie perfectly. Willem Dafoe clearly has a lot of fun in his role and is entertaining to watch. He always manages to successfully tread the fine line between comedy and slapstick and while the result here would best be described as comedy horror, it belongs to its own genre entirely. I enjoyed the director's last movie The Witch a lot more than this film but am happy to see that he and his brother seem to be interested in exploring surreal themes in their filmmaking which is not that common today. The way the movie was shot, as a series of vignettes didn't work as well here as for the Witch but I liked the square aspect ratio and the soundtrack was excellent. They could have included some colour (blue of the ocean, greens and yellows in the grass) to bring some of the scenes to life - the low grey sky bearing down on a baron island already conveys the bleakness and claustrophobia the directors are after.

It's hard to pinpoint exactly where this film goes wrong, but I felt that the run time was too long and there were some moments in the film that came off as awkward comedy that just didn't fit.Having just watched the movie I may need to give it a second viewing.The Lighthouse (2019) is about two lighthouse keepers trying to maintain their sanity while living on a remote New England island in the 1890s.This film reminded me a lot of Stanley Kubrick's The Shining (1980). In The Shining, a film also about isolation and madness, one of the most common complaints was that the lead character seems to go insane almost immediately without any build up. I felt that with this film as well. Right from the beginning the characters seem strange. There's no moment in the film where you think, okay this person has finally lost it, because it all seems strange right from the beginning. There's no setup or build up to anything.Right out of the gate this isn't a movie for everyone. Even if this had met my expectations it wouldn't be the type of film that the average moviegoer would enjoy. Having enjoyed the director's previous film The Witch (2015) and not being your typical moviegoer I still can't recommend this movie.",The Lighthouse

771,jessemorrison99,"A mesmerizing, nightmarish tale.",9,27 October 2019,"I went into this movie not really knowing what to expect.I was drawn to it because of its very authentically aged style and appearance. I wanted to see how well a modern film could accomplish the look and feel of a film from nearly a hundred years ago. It delivered tremendously well, with static camera shots, the entire thing being pillarboxed (fullscreen as opposed to widescreen), beautiful graininess, fog straight out of The Wolfman, incredible acting performances and a dark, secluded set that felt too real, like it was the result of traveling backwards through time. Never before have I seen a movie try for and accomplish this strange task so perfectly. It truly feels like a lost film from the 1930s that was just discovered in pristine condition and released in theaters.The sound design is among the best I've experienced. The crashing waves, howling winds, the deafening drone of the lighthouse repeating over and over again, it all comes together to create the terrifyingly real soundscape of a dangerous and claustrophobic place. The soundtrack of horns and strings feels right at home in the 30s as well, compounding on the ever present dread that is as strong at the imposing beginning as it is at the wild finish.Dafoe delivers unbelievable unbroken dialogue, barely having time for a breath, leaving you astounded at the writing, memorization and performance therein.I would absolutely call this a horror movie, but only of the highest tier possible. It doesn't rely on crutches such as jump scares and an overabundance of shocking and gruesome moments. It expertly instills a sense of mysterious dread and unease that simply result in a very scary experience.",The Lighthouse
772,jeremyknight10,Stunning visuals but deliberately trying to haunt you,3,11 March 2020,"Hype and film snobbery have propelled this film to it's "" must see"" status. It looks beautiful, the sound is not clear- with both actors trying accents that make the incomprehensible at times. The scenes don't hang together, the narrative is patchy.

Could have fooled me.,9,3 November 2019,"You may read among these opinions terribly miscast as ""reviews"" how ""boring"" this film is, or how ""silly things"" happen that ""confused"" the writer, or how ""nothing happens"". I'm here to tell you that those are wrong. Period.Look; just because one doesn't understand the actions before them, or the meaning and cadence of 19th century English, or cannot fathom the consequences befalling characters or their predicaments, does not mean that such complaints are justifiable when clearly the issue is the inability to comprehend the material. I'm sure, for instance, that some would look on the Mona Lisa and pronounce the piece amateurish and without much to merit it's fame. This is the case regarding these misrepresentations of The Lighthouse. Every detail of this story is supported by either dialogue, action or imagery, the plot has no ambiguity, and all contrivances are derived from the environment the characters inhabit or the history they have brought with them.*** Spoilers ***Simply explained, this is a Promethean tale: Dafoe is the Zeusian taskmaster under the influence of the worldly and otherworldly, while Pattinson, haunted by his conscience, covets what is forbidden. However, it is much, much more than that.Pattinson plays convincingly a godforsaken Maine transient, a timberman of late, looking for anonymity in becoming a wickie, a lighthouse keeper, and Willem Dafoe will most certainly receive the Oscar for Best Actor (if there remains any integrity in the Academy's process of selection) for his salty portrayal of the current keeper of the flame, a Protean Old Man of the Sea. While none of the sub-themes are particularly original (solitude and madness, heavy consciences), it is the telling of them that impresses viewers (after all, there are only 7 archetypal storylines, the themes of which have been visited and revisited endlessly) and Eggers proves masterful at his craft yet again.Besides the outstanding performances from both actors, the incredible sound design fosters the idea that the lighthouse itself is alive, an unmoving, evil kaiju, not unlike Ishiro Honda's Godzilla in some regards and, coupled with another excellent unsettling Michael Korven soundtrack, gives an overwhelming sense of dread at times. The gorgeous black and white photography, filmed in Movietone ratio (1.19:1, popular in the 1920's, it was 1.33:1 that lost ratio due to a synchronized soundtrack) at once recollects German expressionism (as does the set design), and hints at the foreboding and murderousness of Fritz Lang's ""M"".The film is as simple as it is complex, imaginative as it is familiar, psychological as it is physical, and every bit as entertaining as it is horrifying. I'm thrilled as can be by Mr. Eggers' storytelling and anticipate further greatness from him.",The Lighthouse

776,templescroll,Music is LOUD / B&W make this film what it is,6,19 January 2020,"I really wanted to love this movie. William Defoe's acting was superb and his dialect as an old salty lighthouse keeper was spot on. Robert Pattinson not so much. Pattinson did look the part as a brooding lighthouse newbie, his voice was not convincing. Also, with many Hollywood movies, background noise, sound effects & music are used to add dimension and tension. But often these instruments just overtake the scene and destroy the dialogue. The movie is B&W, its already foreboding so why the HD sound effects? Its not 'Hitcock-ian' or 'Orsen Well-ian' to add loudness over top of the dialogue without adding anything compelling.(unless its a Poke-Mon movie, films don't need this kind of cacophony of sound to keep viewers' attention) Are they trying to add tension where there is none or are they trying prompt us when to be scared or gasp? The black & white imagery of this film needs no sound prompting really to be excellent; maybe directors are trying to appeal to the ADHD in all of us who can't just sit and watch pure imagery without blasting something into our ears. I feel manipulated. I watched this entire movie with no sound a second time and it was better! If you're streaming this film, be sure to have a remote in hand to adjust volume or you'll miss half the dialogue...while at the same time waking up your entire neighborhood with over the top sound affects and music. Aside from these , the film has all your typical Cannes Film Award coziness using the ""we're edgy while at the same time artsy"" formula you'd expect from Cannes winners.

777,phoenix780-193-818687,Powerhouse movie full of symbolism and subliminal images,9,30 October 2019,"This isn't a movie, but a work or art, visually stunning, full of symbolism and subliminal messages. Williem Dafoe as Wake and Robert Pattinson as Winslow give powerhouse performances as two lighthouse keepers who inadvertently become stranded on the lighthouse island during a storm.
As the film progresses we later learn that Winslow has assumed the identity of a fellow timberman after an accident that Winslow (really Thomas Howard) failed to stop. We also learn how raging violent Howard can be when he visciously grabs and kills a one eyed seagull that has been spying him. It is this violent rage that we really get a feeling of what Howard is capable of and really become fearful.
I believe that this film is a metaphor of Howard's death and judgment at the hand's of his creator. Numerous times in the movie Wake (Dafoe) is filmed to look like Moses in DeMile's Exodus. He also looks at times like Neptune. Since there is talk of the trident, this would be Neptune's three prong spear. The symbolisim is exquisite. After Howard confesses his involement in the other timberman's demise, this is when I started to believe that he is at the pearly gates and Wake is his judge and jury. When Howard finds the log where Wake has recorded all his perceived infraction, this is the nail in the coffin. The lifetime register of our sins. At some point in the film he also confesses to be a God fearing man. This film is actually about Howard's death and judgment thereafter. A visually frightening journey to Hell and back. I don't think it was the pearly gates he was at after all, with the images of raging fire and floods. This was a film about Howard's death, and the rest was like Dante's Inferno - a journey into Hell.",The Lighthouse

A lot of random stuff goes on at that light house that makes you wonder if it's happening or if it's one of Patterson's delusions.

I had to research the mythology after I watched the movie because it left me confused and disturbed. It's very difficult to watch; it's very dark; it's very strange.If you're looking for something intense, and disturbing with great acting and real, muted visuals this is the movie for you. The cinematography is wonderful. It takes place in the late 1800s so the black and white seems relevant and necessary.I was ultimately left confused and disturbed but in a really strange, good way.

About 45 minutes in while I was completely immersed in it my wife was having a different experience. The movie set off an anxiety attack in her and we had to leave.

After six months of eager anticipation, not many movies would live up to the hype. In many ways, The Lighthouse did. The black and white cinematography is exceptionally beautiful yet suitably gritty. Performances by Pattinson and Dafoe are nothing short of superb. Dafoe's appearance and accent easily deserve an extra star. Majestic sounds of thunder and the ominous foghorn complete the unique yet realistic atmosphere.Yes, the story does feel somewhat incomplete. There's a lot to decypher, yet there could have been more. Dream(like) sequences are not tied together properly. But it's all intentional, of course. If I'm mesmerized for the whole running time of a film, I don't feel like I should understand everything. Or even a single thing.It seems the negative reviews concentrate on ""I am educated and exceptionally smart, but even I didn't understand anything. All the hipsters and cinephiles are just pretending they liked it, because they are ashamed to admit they didn't understand it either"". It must be really frustrating, if one needs to understand everything in order to enjoy it. Just get absorbed in the atmosphere and give your brain a break.

791,natebarbone,"A haunting, surreal experience that will enamor some and alienate others",8,3 November 2019,"I was excited for this movie ever since I saw the trailer, even saying that I had been waiting for black and white movies to come back into style. Robert Eggers is quietly revitalizing the art of film-making in a world overrun by super heroes and rehashes. It's also worth noting that The Lighthouse (much like The Witch) is not your typical ""horror"" movie. It's foreboding and creates sickness about the unknown. True horror is psychological, not startling you with loud noises.Firstly, I will admit that I was a bit miffed by the aspect ratio since I was already seeing it on a small screen. This might turn people off, especially because you want to see all of the glorious shots and set pieces. The cinematography is fantastic and every shot is mesmerizing. The technical achievements are fully on display both in front of and behind the camera, bringing together an experience like no other. The sound design immerses you in their world and creates tension and looming dread throughout. It's apparent how much care was put into the whole production, which makes this movie even more enjoyable.The performances by Dafoe and Pattinson are incredible. They truly rose to the occasion and carried a nearly 2 hour movie by themselves. Other reviews complain about the dialogue, but pay no heed. The dialogue is what makes this movie! Eggers is one of (if not) the only film makers to actually use historical vernacular and production design. As much as I love Tarantino, he still doesn't go all the way with it. I always think of The Hateful Eight when Minny asks if she has a fat butt. It's so out of place. The Lighthouse goes for no frills, it's a cold look at the harrowing life of 19th century lighthouse keepers. Dafoe and Pattinson's characters are prone to go off on extended soliloquies that are woefully engaging, and these were my favorite parts of the movie. It's like watching poetry come to life, and the long takes focused on their insane looks make these moments stand out from any lesser diatribe on film.As expected, the general story arc is pretty vague and left up to the viewer to interpret. There are all kinds of references to old sea faring myths and such, so if you're into that sort of thing you'll probably get even more out of this. I liked how it didn't give too much away so you can experience their madness, but I also wanted to know more at the end. This movie definitely seems like it will benefit from repeat viewings. Every scene is tense and reveals more about our characters. I was always engaged and wanting to know what happens next, there isn't a lull in the whole film.The Lighthouse is for fans of the art. Everything is here in spades- the acting, sound, visuals, history, and technical aspects. It is a welcome breath of fresh air and I hope that Robert Eggers continues to make such daring and original movies for years to come.",The Lighthouse
792,GabeDoesReviews,Otherwordly,10,21 January 2020,"The Lighthouse is nothing short of a masterpiece. From its grim setting to its two main leads, this movie never holds back on its insanity. The Lighthouse never ceases the opportunity to ease its tension but instead makes itself more uncomfortable. Even when things seem to be joyous, it never really is due to the tense nature between Robert Pattinson and Willem Dafoe, who really seem to be at each other's throats. The whole movie is based around these two being stuck with each other on this hell like landscape, where escape is improbable. All they have is each other and enough liquor to last their entire scourge. Not only is the setting fit for the most uncomfortable vacation, but the ominous score also heightens the fear of being trapped on the rock. Other sounds such as the foghorn that constantly bellows throughout the film's run and seagulls screeching in the air really furthers the experience of being trapped on an island. The entire movie is shot in black and white 1.19:1 aspect ratio which enhances the claustrophobia the movie aims for. Certain shots from the movie range from beautiful to terrifying or even both in some occasions. Just like Waves, keeping this movie vague only enhances it. For a real trippy ride filled with farts and ocean water, this film will certainly appeal for those who appreciate its qualities.",The Lighthouse
793,richardW68,Masterpiece,10,26 December 2019,"This movie is amaizing. I mean the performances from both actors are haunting, perfectly delivered. The script, the music EVERYTHING is great. I'm dissapointed... that there aren't many genres like this",The Lighthouse
794,Kevin0202,One of the best claustrophobic movies,8,10 October 2020,"It is one of the most claustrophobic films of this decade, the 4x3 (Square) format and the black and white of the film give it the perfect touch to make it so.
This film seems to me more like a Psychological Drama than a horror one since it makes you perfectly convey what the film wants, it is very dense to watch it but that helps it transmit many things and the whole film you stay on the edge of the chair waiting for something to happen Now, and I love that because it makes you reflect the same feeling that the characters feel, the sounds and music are perfectly used since they use it at the precise moment and in the most tense scenes they do not put anything and it ends up being perfect since It puts you into the movie 100% and this is obviously due to the great performance of Pattinson and DaFoe that broke it with their interpretation, scenes that have made you reach the extreme of claustrophobia that was felt and the great tension between the characters .The film has quite a few references, but if you understand them more or less, you get in and enjoy the film a lot, and its shots and lighting are perfect. It is a film that you have to find time to see, since its level of tension and claustrophobia has a very strong power. It is not a movie to watch calmly, you have to find your moment to see it.The only thing I didn't like about this film was its very slow character development and you get to know very little about them, therefore you don't feel identified with them. but that is the only ""bad"" thing that I find in the film after the other is done very well, with such a small budget they made a movie that gets you to transmit a lot.",The Lighthouse

This film must have taken a physical toll on the actors, knowing Nova Scotia's harsh conditions, & it was mesmerizing to watch onscreen. Dafoe was good as expected but its Pattinson that really surprised. It would be a tragedy if these men didn't get nominated for awards. Cinematography nomination is a certainty. This film was just beautiful & artistic & amazing on all fronts. Well done Eggers",The Lighthouse
796,danthebruv,"Absolute Insanity, in the best way possible",9,15 April 2020,"It's about time I watched this one, I've been waiting all year. I kind of knew what weirdness I was getting myself into but honestly I still wasn't prepared for how surreal this movie feels. It truly captures isolation and descent into insanity and it is one of the strangest depictions of Cabin Fever I've ever seen. Robert Pattinson and Willem Dafoe were captivating in their roles and I'm not sure which one I liked more, they play off of each other in a darkly hilarious way and there are multiple scenes that were both hilarious and made me unusually disturbed. The entire film feels confining and claustrophobic and I think the 1.19:1 aspect ratio and the black and white aesthetic definitely lend to it. Both of the leads portray the disgusting life and habits of sailors, especially Dafoe and throughout the film you feel bad for both of them. It ends in a way that was very reminiscent of Midsommar for me, except I preferred this movie much more, probably due to the fantastic cinematography that makes the most of the smaller ratio and creates a picture that's genuinely hard to look away from. It's rough going for sure, but I honestly love this stuff. I love artsy cinema, although I can see why some may not. A confusing and possibly simplistic plot mixed with genuine disgusting weirdness doesn't exactly appeal to the masses. But for who it was intended for, I think this movie excels a lot more than others. It's a psychological horror that's hard to not pay attention to and if you can get past the unusual aspect ratio, the black and white filter and the craziness of this film, you might just be able to love it for what it is; a genuinely disturbing arthouse film that further proves that A24 movies are some of the best in the business. It's hideous, it's insanity put purely on to screen, it's damn crazy, it's hilarious and it's strangely captivating. It's an odd case but it's somehow really good.",The Lighthouse

The dark theater, the unusual aspect ratio, and the monochromatic film creates a sense of claustrophobia and tension that only increases as the film progresses further and further towards stark-raving madness.Acting-wise, Pattinson and Dafoe are brilliant. The chemistry and tension between them was stunning; I never would have expected such a stellar performance from Pattinson, and never, ever would have considered paring the two.I've been thinking about this movie since I saw it, and don't see myself stopping anytime soon.

This is another one of those movies where it's extremely hard to find something wrong with the movie. All the technical aspects are spot on, the acting is brilliant, both Robert Pattinson and Willem Dafoe embodied their characters. The tight 1:19:1 aspect ratio is very well used for most of the scenes with the characters are close ups and when Robert Eggers does use wide shots, the cinematography is breath taking. The script really elevates this movie through the roof, making it unpredictable and hard to take your eyes off of.
SPOILERS
The only thing I can think of that was flawed in the film was when Dafoe's character attacks Pattinson and has a clear chance to kill him but misses.

I honestly believe if this was filmed in colour it's ratings would be 'on the rocks'.This is not about descent into madness, there is no descent. 15 minutes in and everyone is as mad as a box of frogs. No stress, no confusion no battle to keep a grip on reality just an instant embracing of lunacy, which is as dull as it is unrealistic.The characters have no substance, no back story, no personality. It becomes a selection of random scenes and images in short order, somewhat akin to Twin Peaks, but Twin Peaks maintains twisted cohesion, it reflects metaphor and symobolism in it's images, it tantalises, it's as clever and artful as it is weird. This has none of that, it's a dull procession of pointless predictable scenes. But it's in black and white so *looks around at room* it's cool right?If you're a normal average film watcher avoid at all costs, you'll regret it.If you're someone who enjoys psychology or art in any of it's forms avoid at all costs, you'll regret it.If you like to drink starbucks coffee whilst watching drake videos on your Macbook, whilst simultaneously pretending to read the guardian then this is probably for you.",The Lighthouse
808,andischoon-86512,Recommending this is like Russian roulette,10,26 January 2021,"I personally love this film. Robert Eggers clearly knows what he's doing. Beautiful cinematography, soundtrack as in literal lighthouse sirens and eye-candy scenery. Pattinson and (especially) Dafoe are outstanding, that we can all agree on. The film is confusing, most of the time it's a slow burner with dialogue reaching from nonsensical everyday talk to theatrical and powerful speeches. Suddenly it becomes extremely graphic, violent and sexual for a moment and returns to normal in the next. Two men are trapped on a small island with limited rations, too much alcohol, mystical creatures and a hostile gull. Besides the strange story the building tension between these mysterious characters is what makes this one of my favorite films.
After recommending it to all of my friends, colleagues and family I quickly found out how polarizing The Lighthouse is. People either loved it on first sight or absolutely hated watching it so I guess you'll have to find out which one you are. If you like artsy stuff with unconventional stories, black and white film and phenomenal actors in not so deep roles you will love it.",The Lighthouse

You can look at this movie any way you want but at the end of the day it's a very engaging watch.Like the title says, this movie is dirty and crisp. Everything about it seethes. As the story goes on things keep going wrong for our characters, and they certainly are characters. The relationship between the two Thomas's are a mysterious but nonetheless convincing and confusing. The setting is extremely well done and the acting is immaculate. Willem Dafoe give one of the best monologues I've ever seen.This movie isn't for everyone but it's too niche. It's a good movie and there was a lot of work put into it.

From the halfway point of the film, it was difficult to follow the plot that the director wants us to follow. The two (and only) actors are both excellent. My personal choice for best actor (in this film) would, for sure, go to Robert Pattinson. Unrecognizable in the role of Ephraim Winslow. Willem Dafoe is not far behind and, perhaps, level with his portrayal of Thomas Wake yet both actors seem to be unaware of the destination that the film is taking. When the film finally comes to a close, I was left wondering what it was all about! An attempt to enter the mind of a fragile mind? Perhaps, but, in my opinion, a failed attempt.",The Lighthouse

The story is pretty simple. There is no twist, nothing confusing.The time and the place of the story is somewhat vague, making the story somewhat abstract. It is about two guys who are in charge of maintaining a remote lighthouse for one month, their interaction, boredom, etc. There is almost no other cast in the movie (except for a girl for a total of ~20 seconds of screentime). Willem Dafoe is naturally amazing, but I was quite impressed by the superb performance of Robert Pattinson. He truly showed his immense talent in this movie.My two only small concerns with the movie are: The two actors have thick accents in the movie and it is a bit hard to understand what they say to each other at times. The movie is also a bit slow overall, but if you watch it with that mindset, you should be fine.",The Lighthouse
813,integrity_bj,Poetry on screen,10,23 February 2020,"I was stunned by this movie. I have anticipated it for some time. Lighthouses have always been mysterious buildings to me. Always felt a sense of unknown nostalgia and wonderment to them, and the men who run and maintain them.Firstly I was so happy this movie gave much of its thought and process to delving deep into the psyche of the men who devote their lives to working the beacons.
I was flawed by the ratio used which is 1.19:1 A ratio used on early sound movies. Also the use of black and white combined with the box format gave the movie the clostraphobic feel it needed in portraying this kind of storytelling of man's feeble mind.The symbology used throughout the film and references to hp lovecraft, moby dick and various classic poets, makes it stand out to me as such a masterfully crafted movie, from script to set design, cast and cinematography, then editing.The dialogue of poetry told by willems character was so gut wrenching it left the hairs on my arms standing for aboit an hour after seeing it, then beautifully yet grotesquely portraying Prometheus and his eternal perpetual rot to the gulls, in the final fading sequence into the fog.Both actors take it on excellently but willem defoe somehow bends reality with his delivery of the poetic back and forth banter with his foe, friend, confidant.I wish i left every cinema feeling inspired to write better poetry and script ideas.

Both performances were seriously just breathtaking. I can honestly say that either of them have the opportunity to win an Oscar this year.

I hope you all know I feel bad for saying this, but the story was just not it. I absolutely love horror movies and the feeling of watching them and this movie did a great job with the feeling but honestly there wasn't really a story. It was just a movie about two men going insane. There wasn't really a point: no resolution, no climax, seriously just a bunch of artistic horror implemented here and there.

841,ingareik,Great performances with no substance,4,22 January 2020,"The first thing you notice in this movie is that it is shot in black-and-white with a box aspect ratio; yes this is a homage to old-school films but adds nothing to the film itself.I'm sure if you dig deep enough you can find metaphors and symbolisisms to sea-shantys and ancient greek tales and what-not, but I get the feeling that this movie is merely TRYING to be deep and smart just so the edgy critics get some material for their circlejerk. This isn't a movie like Egger's previous work, The Witch, where you're left bedazzled at the end, because this movie simply has no ending. It just makes the viewer ask themselves; ""was this whole thing real or imaginary?"", which is a boring movie trope.I will however give it four stars because both the actors had and incredible performance, which atleast made the film beliavable to some degree.",The Lighthouse

845,davidepresciuttini,"Undeniable virtuosity, but it is a bit an end in itself",6,5 March 2021,"This movie is indeed well shot and acted, brings us with success in a disturbing atmosphere of horror, the kind of horror linked to the depths of the unconscious. We sense that everything that happens is meant to be a metaphor of something from the very beginning, nothing is natural nor ordinary and everything is dramatic in a theatrical way. This island in which there is an old lighthouse keeper and a subordinated worker seems to represent a small world, in which the keeper becomes a godly authoritarian figure that doesn't allow man to get close to the light. Actually, without being precise about it in order to avoid spoilers, at the end there will be a clear reference to an ancient Greek myth that will give a clear reference to what I am talking about and clearly state what the plot is (partially) built around.
Having said this, I think that giving it a metaphorical meaning was just an excuse to make a well crafted exercise of style that even if intense and interesting, can seem a bit pretentious in the end. Overall though, I confirm it is a good product, just that, well, making high brow references and obscure links to the human unconscious doesn't necessarily mean being deep in a meaningful way, I think it was meant to remind us of Bergman's quests into insanity but I don't think it gets anywhere close to that.",The Lighthouse

Two lighthouse keepers on a small island. The acting is very good! especially from Dafoe, Pattinson is doing well too, given how difficult his role is. But i can imagine other actors in the same rolls doing just as well.What makes this movie great is not the story or acting. It is that they have managed to capture how tough and hard it can be to get what you want. it portrays the classic hierarchical and suppression behavior that can be found in male-dominated environments. The movie took me back to my childhood and youth. To situations when I didn't get what I wanted and had to be lectured to understand why.,The film is very well made. Rich in details and beliefs.

859,Heisenberg999,Classic in the making,9,5 November 2019,"If you're a fan of Ingmar Bergman and/or David Lynch, you're going to enjoy this film to the fullest. Atmosphere-wise, this film comes really close to works of those two directors, and that's the one of the biggest compliments a film can receive.
This story is about two lighthouse keepers and their time spent isolated from the rest of the world. The logline sounds really simple, but the film itself is the total opposite of that. Without a rewatch, you'll feel confused and lost after watching it. Many different interpretations could be drawn out from this film. Besides that, the film doesn't have a clear narrative. What's real, and what's not?; Did this happened in the past, the future or in the present?; Who is who and who's telling the truth? Answers to questions like this are left ambiguous. The audience has the freedom to conclude for themselves what actually happened and what was the purpose and the meaning of some imageries. Because of that, this film is going to be talked about for a long time. This film is one of those types of films for which you can break each scene separately and write essays on it. Hidden meanings, inspirations, camera choices, Shakespearean-Esque dialogue, and many more aspects for which you can spend hours analyzing it. What ""Persona"" and ""Eraserhead"" are today, this film could definitely become one day.
From the first shot of this film, you know this is going to be something different compared to today's standards. First of all, the film used unusual aspect ratio (1.19:1) which contributed a lot in giving a claustrophobic feeling and a feeling of isolation. Two of them are on the island and nothing is around them or close to them. They are centered in the middle of the sea, darkness and emptiness is everywhere around them. The director has chosen this aspect ratio to give the same feeling of claustrophobia to the audience. Furthermore, the choice of doing this film in black-and-white palette was excellent. Lack of color greatly emphasized the bleakness of the world they are in. This film would lose a lot if it was done in color, because the lighting would be completely different. In this case, lighting was used excellently to show you what darkness looks like (figuratively) and what does the hope and light at the end of the tunnel look like (although, not very common). You get a lot of information about a state of mind of two main characters just from the usage of various variations of the color black and the color white. Speaking of how the film looks, the cinematography was excellent. There were a lot of long takes which were executed outstandingly well. They mostly served as a tool for making you uncomfortable and uneasy. Also, they were used for excellent closeup shots of monologues whose purpose was to make you feel threatened. A lot of times long shots are used as a gimmick, but in this film, they gave another layer to the script. You feel empathy towards Pattinson's character because you can see what he's going through. While showing those scenes, there were rarely any cuts. The more you see him suffer (without any breaks/cuts from psychological torture), the more you feel for him.
Furthermore, the performances were brilliant. Both Robert Pattinson and Willem Dafoe were unbelievable, probably the best performances of their careers. Their accents, line delivery, gestures and mimic performances were out of this world. Throughout the film, they were constantly topping each other's performance. Because of the indeterminate tone of the film, their performances varied from the comedic to the terrifying and frightening. Their comedic timing was excellent and some monologues are going to be remembered and quoted for an eternity. And on the other side of the coin, when the film had a more serious tone, both of them delivered, especially Pattinson. Also, I don't want to forget a 3rd actor in the film, the seagull. Robert Eggers really likes to use animals as actors in his films. In ""The Witch"" he trained a goat to act, and he did the same thing in this film with a seagull.
Usage of seagull actors and similar unusual aspects contributed to the tone of the film which is quite unique. The film walks on a fine thin line of being an absurd comedy, surrealistic horror and psychological drama. Also, it's filled with many allegories which can be interpreted in many different ways. Props to Eggers for pulling that off, because on the paper, that seemed almost impossible to pull off. But, in here, every single element of the film fits with the other ones. Tonally, this film had no right to be as good as it was. But, somehow because of the excellent editing and direction, the film flows very smoothly without any unnecessary scenes.Just from the surface level, this film is outstanding achievement and it's definitely one of the highlights of 2019.",The Lighthouse

The cinematography is a sight to behold some of the shots in this movie were equal parts unsettling as they were beautiful, a perfect summary of this film. It is a deep look at the human core and the identity of men and is just a complete riveting joy from start to finish.

This film wasn't very scary or even unnerving throughout its run time and most of the scenes that I assume were suppose to make me scared just made me uncomfortable. Perhaps that was the point but I ended up not enjoying it, so maybe that wasn't the best route for the film to take. I ended up not enjoying most of the intended humor either.I think the hardest thing for me to enjoy was the story which I almost felt was intentionally confusing. There is obvious symbolism and purpose to many things in this movie, but that only really works if the movie is very tightly put together and able to be understood on a surface level. Even Robert Eggers' earlier film ""The Witch"" I would sooner watch again than this, because I can at least follow and enjoy that movie. (And ""The Witch"" isn't exactly basic or mainstream in the way its written and presented.

I first watched this film when it came out in theaters, and I must say I did not enjoy it very much (4 stars). The main reason I didn't like it in theaters is because I just didn't really understand the dialogue. Therefore, I never really knew what was going on. The film takes place in the late 1800's, amongst two sailors that drunkenly bumble through their conversations, often mumbling. So I would highly recommend having the subtitles on while watching this, even if you are not one to like that on usually. Now back to the movie. I thought Dafoe and Pattinson did a phenomenal job. Being filmed in black and white gives the setting real depth. The eerie foghorn bellowing through the scenes is unforgettable, and it's hard to really ever feel at ease with what you're witnessing. It's a nightmarish dream-state, where you are never sure if what you see is actually happening, or some type of hallucination the two characters may be going through.

The cinematography is unique and different, crafting an unfamiliar experience when compared to other modern horror pictures.The screenplay is expertly forged, utilising an unusual dialect, accurate to the occupation and time period, whilst making what would normally be a boring tale, a breathtaking spectacle of the human mind being pushed to the depths of madness.'The Lighthouse' is a rare type of film, one that comes along not very often but impeccably checks every box.

904,maysa-63258,"The story is less important than the dusty, musty ambiance",8,21 August 2020,"After the unexpected success of his debut film The Witch, Robert Eggers launches The Lighthouse. The feature is already creating a commotion among critics and audiences in film festivals all over the world. This week the film was in Mostra de Cinema de São Paulo, where the public demanded for more open screenings, as the ones programmed were quickly sold out.The filmmaker paired up with Robert Pattinson (Ephraim Winslow) and Willem Dafoe (Tom Wake) in a very dark black & white period film. The Lighthouse is difficult to be filed in a certain genre. Some say it is a horror movie, but it is too funny to the label. It definitely has the scent of Buñuel and sometimes it gets close to what Guillermo del Toro did in The Shape of Water (2017), but only if we consider the sea monsters and the mysticism. The tone, though, is radically diverse as its musicality is macabre. The story is less important than the dusty, musty ambiance.Leaving Canada behind for the unforgiving terrains of the New England coast, Ephraim Winslow (Robert Pattinson) reluctantly arrives at the begrimed lighthouse where he will work for the next four weeks. Greeted with gruff hostility by Tom Wake (Willem Dafoe), a veteran seafarer with whom he is obliged to share these uncomfortably close quarters, the pair quickly establish a volatile dynamic, with Tom the baiting slave-driver and Ephraim his battered footman.Ephraim and Tom hate each other. With his cranky, drunkard voice, Tom intimidates Ephraim to the point that they punch each other. -- It's a funny scene with no need for stunts. -- There is a creeping sense of fear and paranoia stirring Tom's thoughts. Their dynamics become extraordinarily credible despite the mythical creatures. A mermaid strikes a scene of masturbation. And yet Tom feels uncomfortable endlessly. He isn't able to relax.It is possible that Pattinson's achievement in delivering an uncomfortable feeling comes from the fact that Dafoe is the lighthouse master. He is also mastering the stage. Dafoe never lost his theatrical background whilst Pattinson hasn't had much stage experience. The Lighthouse depends a lot on this weird chemistry called live theatre. The location is crucial for their performances. They feel miserable because they are on a miserable, rainy island surrounded by wild sea birds. They aren't performing for a green screen.The hypnotic fusion of beauty and brutality is marked by folk traditions and heavy sound design. All lines are poetic and Eggers did massive research on dialects and sailors' lifestyle. Filming The Lighthouse must have been a challenge to all cast and crew involved.As Brazilian, I can not not hat tip producer Rodrigo Teixeira, head of RT Features. He is investing heavily in risky productions that have reached successful outcomes. Rodrigo also produced Call Me by Your Name (Luca Guadagnino, 2017), Patti Cake$ (Geremy Jasper, 2017), Frances Ha (Noah Baumbach, 2012) and Severina (Felipe Hirsh, 2018).Follow me at Amayzing Movies.",The Lighthouse

(I'm sure the theme of madness paired with the 19th century desolate setting had something to do with it).The camerawork and usage of shadows was wonderful. I thoroughly enjoyed a lot of the shots in this movie. The b&w made for some beautiful, creepy, and downright interesting imagery.Overall it was a good watch.

911,crushinrussian-52248,A absurdly torturous misfire by a filmaker with vision,4,13 August 2021,"Let's start with the positive aspects of the film. Dafoe and Pattinson surely took these roles to chew scenery and flex their acting skill. They did. Eggers got the aesthetic right for what his story calls for, somewhere between the location and the camerawork.Now...On a basic level, I do not see the entertainment value in watching two men in isolation descend into madness. Adding binge drinking as a major element of a plot which is by no means complicated is just excessive.Mechanically, the film relies on arthouse clichés. Moments of real tension are snuffed out with comedic lines. Sedentary shots of the characters looking into the camera carry on for too long. The script throws everything at the wall from 19th century quips and tantrums to full-on poetic curses that could have been taken from Classical literature.It is a film that successfully puts upon the viewer the excruciating suffering that its characters endure over the course of the film.If there is art I did not see it. If there was craft I could not grasp it. The horror was not scary. The humor was not funny. There seemed to be no method to its madness.I heard another reviewer mention a relation to Greek mythology. I really could not be bothered to check it out because this film was THAT unpleasant.I am writing this review after just finishing a second viewing thinking that maybe I missed something the first time. I enjoyed The VVitch and I generally enjoy A24's work of this nature. I will watch the director's next feature as I will take an original film any day over a sequel/prequel/reboot/re-imagining.This film just did not work for me. On second viewing I dislike it even more.",The Lighthouse

I wouldn't mind but it was only over a four week period, Personally I'd give anything to be isolated for four weeks with only my wartime woes and a beach to keep me company.Enjoyed the actors, but the whole film/story didn't seem necessary enough to warrant telling......",The Lighthouse
913,kadaffy,I'd love to love it.,5,27 December 2019,"But the screenplay is too weak to stand in a row with that meticulously crafted production design, cinematography, and acting.I'm deeply impressed with visuals that authors developed for this film. It is something from another era, it's how the movie made in middle of 19th century could look like, if cinema was invented one century earlier.Casting is fantastic. Loved the performances of both Defoe and Patisson. I heard that shooting conditions were really similar to what wee see on screen. It was cold, wet and miserable. And in cases like that you can truly appreciate the craft of an actor when they manages overcome the physical difficulties and deliver a believable character from another world. I'd like to be invested in those characters but they just fall flat in the end, and I didn't care about them both. Why?So, the script... It was raw and undeveloped. It was all over the places: a bit of father/son drama, some Lovecraft visuals, some Greeks myths, some Shining. Not a clear quote in particular and not an original story by itself. The tone of jokes and quarrels was inconsistent and gave a hard time understanding the motivation of characters. This picture holds so much water that it soaks into the plot.It's clearly a rushed script. Collage of madness that could work if had one core idea, that would shine through all this mess as a... yes, a lighthouse! But then it would be a work of genius. Because it's easy to shoot a fever dream, but it is extra hard to make a great story from kaleidoscope of bad dreams. The authors just put every ingredient they could, hoping that the atmosphere will bring it somewhere. But it didn't. And it's a pity.The VVitch was simpler and more lucid in it's core, - in it's screenplay. And it worked much better in the end. VVitch is a solid movie with simple bold idea.
And Lighthouse feels like a very ambitious student project. I rate it 5, because great production without good script is just half of a movie.But I believe that Robert Eggers can still grow in one of the greatest directors of our time because the way he choose his projects it's a rare case in modern movie world. So I'll keep my searchlight on.",The Lighthouse

It really is a film about 2 filthy drunks rambling rubbish for about 80% of the time. If it was a BBC adaptation of an MR James ghost story it would be half an hour long; and that would make it more bearable (also half an hour long & alarmingly similar is an episode of Steptoe and Son).

924,Metcalf_The_Mega_Critic,arthouse shlock,3,5 November 2020,"These are the movies that really separate your average movie goer from the Cannes/Sundance film festival crowd. If you consider yourself a legitimate professional film critic then for you this is probably a beautifully artistic take on a classic horror but if you prefer your films to have some entertainment value as opposed to pure artistic content this film is not for you - or me for that matter. I'm probably just not classy enough to ""get"" it. I tend to judge my movies much more superficially and on the surface this film has almost nothing to offer. Willem Dafoe absolutely does put out a great performance (does he ever not?) but what can a great performer do when the script offers almost nothing of substance. The climatic monologue delivered by Dafoe is the perfect example of this - full of sound and fury but signifying nothing. If you spend any time stuck thinking about the plot I would say you've probably already gone down the wrong path as clearly the filmmakers here want you to be stunned by the stark visuals, dark and gloomy atmosphere, and superb acting but for me It was just bleak on bleak on bleak along with a story that just can't hold up to even the lightest cross examination. If you love film festivals movies for their originality of content, the risks taken by their filmmakers, and the fact that they don't have to follow the standard Hollywood formula then this is probably a movie you will really like. But if you're like me and enjoy the familiarity brought by formulaic storytelling, a story that actually serves a purpose and a script you can actually follow, then this is probably not for you.

And after finally rewatching the movie for the first time I can safely say this is a very well-made movie.It's incredibly well-acted and well-shot. But, unfortunately I feel absolutely nothing about it. The second time watching it, I realized that in a sort of an anamoly, I don't have feelings when watching the movie. I don't feel scared, excited,
intrigued, or at all connected to anything that is happening on screen. Which is a sharp contrast to Egger's last movie The Witch where I felt almost every single emotion during that entire movie.I think the biggest reason why is that The Witch had an incredibly well-developed and interesting list of characters, specifically Anya Taylor Joy's character who I felt for the entire movie and all that she goes through. But for this movie the characters are sort of developed and are interesting, but there's nothing to connect to with them. I know that all movies don't have to have a huge amount of character development, but in a horror movie I absolutely believe there should be. Because when characters are put in perilous situations, we should care if they make it out or not.I really wanted to love this movie, but the second time watching it I realized that it didn't do anything for me. I'm really glad people are so into this movie and love it so much.

Regardless the tension built makes the film incredibly captivating.For me, the highlight is the on screen chemistry between the two leads. They work well together and their relationships is believable and relatable.The plot is a bit, well, I'm sure it's in there somewhere...

In defense of this film, viewers can expect to enjoy more than good acting: the dialog itself is exquisite and the technical components of the film are a marvel. With that said, any viewer with a modicum of appreciation for engaging stories and rewarding payoffs will come away feeling robbed of their time. Both films by Eggers built intrigue by way of mystery and suspense, but they differ drastically in their final result; where 'The Witch' concludes in a dark and satisfying fashion, 'The Lighthouse' simply concludes.

948,virematthew,Psychological Masterpiece,10,14 February 2020,"First I'll say that despite being labeled a ""horror"" movie I didn't find that it fit in that genre which may have given viewers false expectations. It's hardly horrific at all. It's somewhat disturbing at times but not horrific or even scary in my opinion. There are definitely some wtf moments which not everybody appreciates and I completely understand that. I, however, love that. Dafoe's Performance was masterful. He exaggerated the personality to the highest level which I thought was brilliant though Rob's interpretation and performance wasn't as intense, but he definitely had his moments. It's a slow burner so if that's not your thing you will NOT enjoy this. There's not so much mystery as there is confusion and suspicion that leads to the last scenes. Some people found the ending empty but that's just the way it was written. Not every story has a definitive ending. It doesn't give you an explanation. That's for you decide. I love the black and white tone and the visuals were beautiful. There were times when I wondered if one of them was just a figment of the other's imagination. I would say don't go into this thinking you have any idea what it'll be. I don't go into movies with a ton of ideas or predictions. I just take every movie for what it is. Something that some people aren't able to do. Some of the reviews here are unfairly critical and written by people who assume to be experts on cinema and stories. As a writer I have a different perspective. I noticed how the writer developed the plot(because despite what people might say there is one). It may not be conventional storytelling but it's creative and original. I'm a big fan of period pieces and this is one of my favorites. Give it a chance just once and decide for yourself.",The Lighthouse

950,csvigon,Psychological Metaphor of Human Lives,8,1 February 2020,"The confined scenarios and close way of filming let's you feel the claustrophobic environments that the characters' minds resides, creating a false notion of reality that later justify the very wonder of what was or not real. The deep and complex acting of both Pattinson and Dafoe also adds to the role, establishing them as ambiguous and mysterious characters that can not be trusted simply by their words. Every element of fantasy and art decision of this film feels right and contributes to create a dark atmosphere. The narrative reflects over the human choices and presents symbols of redemption and punishment that are key to understand the hidden message behind the thriller.

From the acting, to the set design, to the old English dialogue, to the score, and so on, it is simply fantastic. Robert Eggers has truly outdone himself, seeming to have improved upon concepts and qualities of his debut film (which I thoroughly enjoyed as well). Pattinson and DaFoe are excellent in their respective roles, and I think Willem DaFoe was especially outstanding and should have not only been nominated, but WON an Oscar. In terms of style and production value, The Lighthouse successfully channels both. The black & white film along with the 1:1.9 aspect ratio serve as a way to immerse you in the time period and in the feeling of being trapped.

I thought the VVitch was a masterpiece and immediately knew what this movie was all about from seeing the trailer. It is very much in the style of Hitchcock, without question. (I believe I even saw an interview where he confirmed that this is one of his biggest influences).Several things that need to be said: amazing acting (despite Robert Pattinson going in and out of his New England accent), tense atmosphere, great look, good score, the dialogue is entertaining as it is well written, camera work very much used in a Hitchcockian way and intriguing story...all just A+++To those who don't ""get"" it or say it's pretentious; you have never seen Hitchcock obviously! The point of this movie is the two men being stranded on this little island in the lighthouse gradually going insane....cabin fever from being secluded for so long. The thing is you can't tell who is telling the truth, who is insane - they both could be or there could actually be magic happening...who knows? There's nothing else to get really. There's no definite answers because that would ruin the premise (although there are some).Listen, this is not a David Lynch film for heaven's sake! It is what it is....no hidden meaning. You can if course give it meaning which is what good art does but you don't need some special art school knowledge to enjoy this film or love it.

973,norowareta,Underrated,9,12 June 2021,"I know I'm late to jump on the bandwagon, but I really enjoyed this. Although I don't watch a lot of horror and therefore probably don't have a professional say in this, I can say this is one of those films that left me scared after watching it. Makes me feel needlessly anxious and alone, which is something a lot of horror movies aren't able to do to me.From the beginning something is off, the shot of Dafoe and Pattinson looking the lighthouse right at the start makes me feel that impending doom. I know most horror movies don't end too happily, but that single shot let me know that this was going to be a spiral into insanity.The acting is well done, especially Dafoe's ""HARK!"" monologue...it's disturbing the first time you watch it, but the second time you watch it it's like figuring out pieces of a puzzle. His monologue suggests the end frame, souls of dead sailors...it's really creepy. And the atmosphere is great too, I really like the desolate and lonely feel of the island. Straight out of a childhood nightmare, with the demented mermaid visions and everything. The entire vibe is hopelessness, and I personally enjoy the black-and-white film. It gives all into the overall feel. Also...the soundtrack is cool (I probably don't have to say it again, but it hits the bullseye with the theme).I'm surprised with the 7.5 rating, this is one of those movies that have a lot of replay value, for the story alone and for capturing the details. I can't think of a person who hasn't seen this, but if you haven't you definitely should if you like horror that relies more on psychological terror and impending doom.

In that I mean he's great at being Willem Defoe, sort of like how Pacino has become a character of himself in his movies. Robert Pattinson does a good job but is crushed by Defoe whenever they share screen time. I don't want to give anything away story wise but I will say this, if you're a fan of vague plots and open endings that you can interpret for yourself then this is for you.

I also loved the way the director embraced the elements; the environment and the weather; you feel that you're with the characters on this deserted island. Off course, both Dafoe and Pattison are doing great roles, great actors as they are. But also, they fit very well together - they are very different types and also type of actors, and it creates a great contrast - so its not just great actors but great casting as well.

980,NiaTheElf,Unsure of what it was meant to be?,6,18 April 2021,"The acting was perhaps the best part about The Lighthouse for me.I completely understand why people are raving about this movie, the cinematography is artistically fantastic and... well, I struggle to think of another positive if I am being honest.Should you enjoy many long conversations between two brilliantly acted characters, the conversations of which devolve frequently into arguments about repetitive topics, and should you enjoy a more artsy visual storytelling of these characters losing their minds, then this is no doubt something you should watch.Approaching this movie, I had rather high expectations; an Oscar nomination and such high praise from word-of-mouth - I was very much hoping to come out of it with a positive view.Perhaps the first half hour to an hour, I enjoyed. It seemed to be building up the characters well, the storyline and the mystery of it all was being carefully crafted for us through each scene. It seemed to be going somewhere that could be absolutely brilliant. But then... It starts to become slow, tiring and repetitive, incoherent and unfocussed on where it wanted to go and what it wanted to be. Maybe that was purposeful, to better reflect how the characters were feeling, but it doesn't make for a very entertaining or easy watch.There is nothing to make you want to back either of the characters - nothing inherently human that makes you want them to find a way out of this nightmare, which makes it all the more gruelling to sit and be dragged through when you're just hoping for anything to pull you in.Anything that could have led to something good just gets swallowed up by the almost gritty, dirty feel of the entire rest of this film. What parts could have grown and really shaken you to the core just got lost out at sea.I really wanted to enjoy it. At the end, I spent some time thinking on what I had just witnessed and how I was meant to feel, what it was all meant to mean. I even read some reviews, trying to make sense of it.Perhaps I am just a little too slow to really get what The Lighthouse was trying to be, or perhaps its only for a select intended audience?All in all, I see The Lighthouse as a portfolio of abstract art characterised into a film, combined with character dialogue studies that you might have been asked to study or create something similar to in class.Give it a go of course if you think you may like it; the acting is what made me rate it a 6/10 so at least you might enjoy that ^^",The Lighthouse

991,jaredwignall,The Lighthouse: The Best Film of 2019.,10,1 November 2021,"One of the best films of the 2010 decade and in my opinion the very best film of 2019. Not only is this a great horror film, but a truly great film. It's a true masterpiece from beginning to end. This is the kind of film where whatever interpretation you take away with this film, is the correct one. My interpretation can be 100% different from yours and we both can be correct. Many have discussed and analyze this film and it's truly interesting to see and read these analysis.From a new telling of the Greek mythology of Prometheus and Proteus, an allegory of being stuck in purgatory, being an actual literal interpretation in what you see on screen is actually going on and to so many more interpretations, it's truly a film that's worth watching and the more times it's watched, any interpreting one has at the ending of the film can be reinforced or possibly change.The ending is truly fantastic as it really makes you have to think what you just watched without giving any sort of spoilers. The director, Robert Eggers who made his film debut 4 years before this with The Witch, has said he wanted everyone to walk out with the thought ""What the hell did I just watch?"" He achieved this and more as this is one of the best psychological horror films I've seen.The performances by Robert Pattinson and Willem Dafoe are truly incredible. Words can only do so much to properly do justice to their performances. I'll just say the fact they didn't get Academy Award nominations for their performances just shows how more out of touch the Academy is these days. They arguably gave the best performances of their careers with this films. Dafoe gives a great showy performance that has a lot of weight to an old sea dog being the keeper of the Light, while Pattinson gave a performance that's truly ensures Dafoe doesn't have to carry the film on his shoulders. Pattinson gives his all and more in this film as having to take orders from Dafoe, anywhere from minimal tasks to manual labor. This is as much Pattinson's film as it is Dafoe's, especially since the film is from the perspective of Pattinson's character.This film was nominated for Best Cinematography, which was deserving and should have won the Oscar, but this film deserved more Oscar nominations than just one. This should have been a film that got a slew of Oscar nominations and wins. This should have been up for Best Picture, Best Director, Best Original Screenplay, Best Actor (Pattinson), Best Supporting Actor (Dafoe), Best Original Score, Best Cinematography, Best Editing, Best Production Design and Best Sound are categories this film could have been up for and to me, it would have been deserving of winning Best Picture, Best Director, Best Actor, Best Supporting Actor, Best Cinematography, Best Production Design and Best Sound.I've often gone back and forth with this film winning Best Original Screenplay with Quentin Tarantino's Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood as both films have great fantastic dialogue that's fitting for both films. I could go on and on with this film, but this is an incredible film from beginning to end. One of the best films of 2019 and as time will go on, people will continue to talk about this for years to come and it will be seen as true masterpiece as many have already called it a modern day masterpiece and those people aren't wrong.",The Lighthouse

The suspense I did not feel enough, and although I understood some references to the ancient Greek myths, the ending was such a drunken, out of touch with reality mess that it left me unsatisfied. Yes they could act a drunkard, really well, but does the viewer really care? I didn't.

The positives; I thought it was shot beautifully, that it was in black and white amplified how beautifully shot it was. It being in black and white also transports you to another time and place. It's cold, wet, stinky, and uncomftorble...well done. I felt it. The music and constant sounds of waves, rain, birds, is unsettling and claustrophobic which adds to that cold, wet, stinky, and uncomftorble feeling. The acting was insanely good. I've only seen Robert Pattinson in Harry Potter and the sparkly vampire movie, so I really enjoyed seeing him as this walking chaos about to snap. The ""g**damn farts"" scene was particularly my favorite. Willem Dafoe; the end. Seriously the man can be in anything and I'll always say he's amazing because, he is. With the several really great qualities this movie has going for it, it was still lacking. Again, what the hell was this about? It was so abstract it was confusing and hard to follow. I didn't connect with either of these characters and struggled to really know anything about them. So I didn't really care what happened to them in the end.

996,jordanucsd,"""I'll tend to the light.""",8,14 February 2020,"Robert Eggers' sophomore outing is a visually outstanding experiment, challenging the modern audience to take an antique point of view. In black and white, and in an aspect ratio straight from the silent film era, The Lighthouse provides an experience more akin to browsing through a photo album in a maritime museum than a modern film. In less capable hands, this might prove a boring eighty minute slog, but Eggers' and his cinematographer, production designer, and actors elevate the script into a dreamy wonderland, or nightmare, of moving Ansel Adams images. It's so hauntingly beautiful - the waves crashing, the light beam in the fog, the lighthouse stairs, the men's quarters, the path to the shore - and so convincing as a product of early America.One might assume it's a found footage documentary that was intercut with new footage to create a work of fiction for greater profits. In fact, some of it was reportedly filmed with cameras and film of the era, providing some explanation of how the filmmakers were able to achieve such striking images. It's a bit like watching 2001: A Space Odyssey, where you're confounded by its visual achievement considering the then primitive visual effects technology of the time. The Lighthouse is simultaneously old school and fresh, requiring modern sophistication and out-of-the-box thinking. Because of these techniques, I was immediately sucked in, forgetting all about the modern world I live in and surrendering to the devastating beauty of historic Maine.To compare to Sam Mendes' 1917, some critics might bash the film for having more style over substance. The story, a simple play involving two men of clashing personalities while they perform lighthouse duties, can at the surface seem redundant and without a more compelling arc for its two men. The not even an hour and a half running time might even suggest there wasn't enough in the script to begin with; a good short film made too long. However, to me the movie felt more like a two and a half hour movie, in a good way. Never boring, but always engrossing, because I recognized the subtle ways Eggers demonstrates the increasing claustrophobia, anxiety, and tension between the men as the story progresses.These subtleties are not achieved so much by the dialog or actions of the men, but by the style of direction and editing. And with regards to 1917, which I also loved, I'm of the opinion that the style IS the substance, and that the visual style of ALL movies should be considered before the script, since unlike a play and more like a painting, it is a style of art that completely surrenders itself to visual perspective. As it's been said a thousand times before, a picture is worth a thousand words.Someone who I think might agree with me is Stanley Kubrick, whose work The Shining provides huge inspiration to The Lighthouse. Like the hallways of the Overlook, the borders of the small aspect ratio frame the claustrophobia of the men. Both movies concern two characters tending to maintenance of an isolated location, with one seemingly doing more work than the other. And both movies are about how people can slowly go insane.I applaud Willem Dafoe and Robert Pattinson for memorable and layered performances, with Eggers' command of the vernacular providing awesome fodder for the actors to chew on. And like The Shining, this is a film meant to haunt you with the questions is raises rather than easy answers it provides. The allusions to Prometheus and Proteus, Icarus and Poseidon, provide a nice backdrop for illuminating (no pun intended) the age-old dilemma of human nature wanting what it cannot have, and the punishment of getting what you wish for. Like The Witch, Eggers' first film, these questions will likely merit several rewatches, drawing me ever closer to its light.",The Lighthouse

1007,calinchiriac,How long have we been on this rock?,8,2 November 2019,"""The Lighthouse"" was my most anticipated movie of the year, not so much because of the incredibly high buzz generated by critics since the film first made its appearance at Cannes back in May, and not even because of the well-respected cast members or of the director in charge of the project (after all, Robert Eggers' first feature film, ""The Witch"", left me ultimately unimpressed despite a strong understanding of physical horror and a bone-chilling atmosphere from beginning to end). Well, it all undoubtedly helped, but really, it might've only been the combination of an unsettling location and the simple premise of the film - two lighthouse keepers going about their usual business on a secluded island (the ""rock"", as Thomas Wake, Willem Dafoe's mad-eyed character, repeatedly calls it) - that drove me to eagerly await its arrival in theaters.From the get-go, ""The Lighthouse"" establishes itself as a dark, grim and joyless piece. One of the opening frames is a haunting and symmetric back shot of the two main characters, somberly standing on a boat's front deck, patiently (and almost mourningly, as if they had lost every last bit of themselves) awaiting to reach their destination: the ""rock"", entirely covered by an overbearing fog miles ahead of them. It sets a dispiriting and depressing tone that is only refined by the excellent use of black and white - the absence of color rapidly becomes inherent to the characters and objects on the screen, to the point where I frankly wasn't able to imagine a colorized version of the keepers' clothes, of the meals they were eating, or of the New England sky. It was all so magnificently dull and devoid of life.Much like the cinematography, the interactions between Pattinson and Dafoe are nothing short of fascinating to observe all throughout the film. I would call both of their performances career-defining if their careers weren't already... well, as solidly defined as they are. Pattinson, incorporating a hopeless and self-loathing man, comes perfectly at odds with his counterpart, an aged sea veteran verging on insanity. The film is in a perpetual state of rising tension - evidently expressed by the score - while the two shout in a raging dialect of 19th-century seamen, fight clumsily with one another and slowly fall into debauchery, completely engulfed by the chaotic weather and tormented by the island's closeness, which highlight the fantastic production design.In spite of the looks, ""The Lighthouse"" is not a horror movie in the common sense of the word (nor does it try to be, really). At least it doesn't feel like one. Rather, it acts like a psychological drama that delves deeply into an ordinary experience to transform it into something much more unique and unexpectedly puzzling. It took me quite a while after leaving the theater to figure out what had actually happened, and I'm still totally unsure that I have the right answer, if there is one. It's an extremely well-crafted film that, without necessarily covering for the ""The Witch""'s faults in terms of overall payoff, stands far ahead of Eggers' directorial debut.",The Lighthouse

These kinds of films interest me because they are very different and unique in every way. This film is no exception. This is not your average movie experience and it is not for everyone.One of the reasons I love this film so much that it uses visual storytelling tools to tell us what is happening on the screen. It creates so many questions and it doesn't always answer those questions. This kind of ambiguity might bothersome, but it fits very well and it respects the audience to analyze and find some answers. It has so many symbolism, metaphors, and visual cues that tell you the story in a very vague and ambitious way.This film is very weird in a very amazing, funny, and terrifying way. It is not a scary film, but it is a suspenseful journey to madness. The film is directed and written so well that you can't help, but get sucked into this crazy world of madness. It has so many cringy, funny and weird dialogs that make you confuse but as it goes on it reveals itself and it becomes crazier and crazier. This a film that becomes part of you. You feel like you are there with them and going crazy with these absurd characters which are very hard to do in film in general.Every scene every shot feels right and each of them tells you about this world and the character's inner selves. They used camera lenses that had used in these time periods. They also changed the aspect ratio which adds to the experience. These kinds of attention to detail is amazing and I have a ton of respect for the people who made this film into a reality.Robert Pattinson and William Dafoe gave their career chancing performances. Especially William Dafoe has one of the best actings I have ever seen. He is out of this world in this film. You feel both sides of this crazy spectrum. These characters are so absurd, weird, crazy, and cringy in a very great way because this film and these characters are written so well.CONCLUSION:I have no problem calling this film "" A MASTERPIECE "" because it is truly one of the best films I have ever seen. As I said in the beginning, not everyone is going to like this movie as much as I did because it is super weird, vague, and ambitious. Everything about this film, acting, the way that it is written, and directed, the attention to detail is mind-blowing. This is a film for cinema lovers. Overall it all adds up and creates this absurd journey to madness. An unforgettable masterpiece to be experienced in a theater.Rating: 10/10",The Lighthouse

The monstrous depiction of mermaids is more in-line with the lore they originated from, before Disney made them cute.The aquatic themes are made clear in many ways from the mermaids, to the tentacles, to Willem Dafoe practically playing Captain Ahab with how stereotypical he is as far as sailor characters go.The acting was absolutely phenomenal, and I can't decide who deserves best actor more at the next Oscars, Pattinson for this or Phoenix for Joker. I can at least tell you Dafoe deserves best supporting at the very least.In the scene where Dafoe is ranting and raving after Pattinson insults his cooking the lighting, acting, cinematography, and acting practically made him look more like a monster than a human.Of the slow descent into madness cannot be complete without an absolutely off the wall insane ending, where the pace of the movie picks up to terminal velocity.

Two moments that need acknowledgement: the magnificent still shot of Defoe naked standing over Pattinson as if a snapshot of a Grecian urn.

The dialogue is at times hard to understand and break down, but it is incredibly written all of the time. The colloquial uses of sailor jargon throughout the film bring a profound sense of character to it that you rarely see in pictures today. The use of the small screen size for the picture compliments the film well, as it makes you feel the sense of claustrophobia and cabin fever that Robert Pattinsons character Ephraim is experiencing. As the characters begin to fall out of their right minds and the story unravels itself you will be hooked. This film contains one of the greatest performances I have ever seen from Willem Dafoe, simply jaw-dropping. I'd like to see any other actor in Holywood right now even come close to this standard.

1035,omranagurgaon,Delightfully strange,7,21 December 2019,"Finally saw ""The Lighthouse"", one of the most anticipated movies of the year, starring the next to be batman Robert Pattinson & everybody's favourite William Dafoe. Ever since it's buzz at the Cannes I knew I had to watch it. Without giving any spoilers I just want to say that this is a kind of movie which will leave you stunned and somewhat petrified because of it's weirdness. Set in the 1890s with a 1.19:1 ratio (which is basically a square) and shot in 35mm black and white film the movie is successful in transferring the audience to that era. I won't call it a horror as some critics have described it but it is more of a fantasy. You'll get a feel that you're watching a film adaptation of yet another Stephen King's books. It reminded me a lot of Stanley Kubrick's iconic horror film ""The Shining"". Exemplary cinematography, horrifying visuals, mind blowing sound editing(best of 2019), an old English dialect and top class acting is what makes this movie special. Full marks to Robert Eggers for direction and Mark Korven for the score.
The best part of this film is that whoever watches it will have a different interpretation of the story and that's what is required from an intense psychological drama.On a personal note I've never seen Robert act before (except for his appearance in Goblet of Fire). I got really disappointed and furious when he was picked for Matt Reeves's Batman Trilogy and then for Nolan's Tenet but after watching him act in the lighthouse I think he's a great pick and he will deliver. Even though I haven't seen him act before but I can say this is the best performance of his career.
And William Dafoe being William Dafoe, never disappoints, just brilliant to watch him act. He has definitely made it more difficult for the jury to pick the best actor in supporting role with Al Pacino and Joe Pesci already in line as strong contenders. It'll be exciting to watch who gets it.",The Lighthouse

A fantastic movie with character development that creates twists right from the beginning. The black and white really aids in creating the mood of isolation and coldness. A+",The Lighthouse
1045,kogoukos,It's a hard movie to watch but,9,31 March 2020,"Its truly great movie. The acting, sound and picture are all amazing. Also the story is deeply mysterious and it makes you wonder what is actually true and what is not. From the beginning you can understand that the movie is heading to a direction far from just 2 guys watching over a lighthouse and it has you to tour edge of your sit, not because of the action, but because it slowly builds something mysterious and crazy. It's my favourite 2019 movie and I do believe its underrated",The Lighthouse
1046,unknownbell,The Lighthouse - One of the Best Films of 2019,10,7 November 2019,"Robert Eggers is one of my favorite directors working today and he succeeds in his second feature film. The Eggers' brother's writing is done expertly well leaving just enough ambiguity and direction to keep audiences invested. Of course, Robert Eggers direction and style of this film is impeccable and is lead by Oscar worthy performances out of Dafoe and Pattinson. The score and sound design is done very well and sounds like a piece of art. The cinematography is quite gorgeous in a lot of shots specifically those taking place outside but the whole film is shot well. Overall, this film is a masterpiece and competes to be my favorite film of the year.",The Lighthouse

1053,alfiemetcalfe-85374,Absolutely captivating. And a cinematography masterpiece.,9,18 February 2020,I really can't understand all the awful reviews. This film is a beautifully constructed masterpiece as we see Winslow/Emphiram/ Thomas (Whatever his name was) mental state completely deteriorate. Performance of a life time for both actors and slept on at the oscars. There's some amazing cinematography in this film and I felt it always had the right angle to capture the exact emotion of the shot. I partly agree with the fact there is a hint of a loose plot hole but wasn't this meant to illustrate the loose mental state of both characters. I think this film is mainly about the fact that if you can evade the law with justice you are never safe from your own mind. Both men had killed and where in complete denial. And it led to the death of both men. Overall I thought this film was a touch of brilliance and unlike anything we have today.,The Lighthouse
1054,mollieholmstrom,Brilliantly surreal!,9,30 December 2019,"I loved this film!I saw this movie at a small, independant theatre in the outskirts of my city as the movie did not air at my usual spot. I'm glad. The experience of seeing this in a small room with 3 strangers seated in wood chairs just added to the whole feeling.This movie tackles masculinity, power, want, and attraction in a very interesring way that I've never seen before. The movie was very unsettling and dreamlike in the best way possible. It's a unique emotional experience that's most certianly not for everyone, but which I'd recommend to every pretentious film student alike myself.Do you enjoy weird, hipstery, unique movies that you'll have to melt and think about for a while? Possibly watch some rando on youtube discuss for a while to compare your own thoughts? Go watch this one!

The movie draws you into its world, even though that world is essentially made up of two people and a barren island. The long shots of the island are gorgeous to look at, and the attention to 19th century details added specifics and life to the characters.

But, i think how they created the movie was just absolutely beautiful. They really brought the old movie production to life. The story itself, it really did play with the brain and made you think that he was seeing all of those unnatural things, Pattinson and Dafoe were probably the best picks to act and the fact that they only stuck with two famous actors to portray the life of two sea men on a remote island is just beyond amazing!",The Lighthouse
1063,hcoleridge,Less is more. This was a case of more is less.,3,3 April 2020,"The claustrophobic atmosphere of this film (the aspect ratio adds to it) is established too soon. There is no build to it. The dim figures off the boat, making their way up to the Lighthouse, lead us straight into a confined hell, and we suffer one hour and forty-nine minutes of this at a pace which is grinding and relentless.Interspersed with frequent bouts of aggression are exchanges of dialogue, which do little to advance a coherent narrative. What is this all about? One only has to look at the long list of Visual Effects artists to understand how visual effect was allowed to eclipse a more subtle approach to a story of two men stuck on an island in charge of a lighthouse.Less is more. This was a case of more is less. If in doubt: throw in a scene of anguished labour in the face of all that the elements can throw. But any explanation of this labour was hard to come by. The lighthouse and its workings remained strangely aloof from the whole proceedings. The two principal actors act their cotton socks off. But the more they rage, the less potent is the ultimate effect. One just longs for the whole ghastly tale to end.That great storyteller Herman Melville is credited as being an influence... He creates his magic with words and one's imagination does the work. In this film, little is left to the imagination. Visual effects are not enough when the screenplay manages to be both cryptic and verbose and altogether annoying in its obfuscation. Fundamentally it is undramatic because the drama is given no room to breathe._",The Lighthouse

caracter as acting an old stubborn grumpy old boss contantly humilating and insulting his employee. Then the second part; over short time these men , entangled in emotions and shoutings combined with blind drunkness sets this film in a crazy overdrive where seagulls have a morbid endscene for you in store.

Given the expanse of the ocean just outside the door, the overwhelming feeling is claustrophobic dread. I knew that going in but got nothing from the film except to admire its ability to trap the viewer in the same hellscape as the characters. All you wish to do is escape. It was a tough watch. These days I try to avoid films like this, so it's saying something that I actually stayed around until the credits started rolling. It was interesting enough that I didn't abandon it.Top notch acting by Pattison and Dafoe.Both of these characters obviously had a bit of a head start on their descent into madness before they even set foot on the island. I can't decide if that was a wise choice or not. Perhaps the men who manned remote lighthouses back in the day had to be a little mad to have the desire to do such a thing in the first place.",The Lighthouse

The story, while simple, is perfectly told and never boring and the way the movie is filmed, from the black and white to the lighting to the unusual aspect ratio suits the movie perfectly well while at the same time making it truly special without being pretentious or weird just for the sake of being weird.

There's no way to tell what the movie is supposed to be saying because it doesn't reveal anything. I'm sorry but that is just a lazy excuse for directors who think they are so clever when they really have nothing. I waited through this movie expecting something to happen at the end which was worth sitting through it, but in typical pretentious art house, awards bait movie fashion, there was nothing. A guy staring at a light and then lying on the beach getting eaten by seagulls. Really?! What did any of that mean. Are we supposed to believe these guys just went crazy because there was a storm and the boat to pick them up was a week or two late? Seriously? What was the point of this? Couldn't the director have at least given us something to reveal whether it was just two crazy guys or some supernatural event or anything. When movies end like this, it does not make people think, it makes them angry. Most people don't want to leave a movie feeling ripped off and angry. Why is this acceptable as a movie making technique. It might have been clever once or twice back in the 60's when people first started doing it, but now it's just trite, lazy and cliched.

That's the REAL plot of The Lighthouse. It's almost as if the audience is part of a sick bet where the makers of this film want to see how far you can push nonsense but still have film critics praise it as genius and everyone else must be lacking in something because normal folk didn't ""get it."" If you open a dictionary and look up the word pretentious this movie poster would be included as illustration.There is nothing wrong with shooting in black and white, there is nothing wrong with having a 4:3 aspect ratio, there is nothing wrong with ""dream"" sequences, the death of this film is the lack of a coherent plot. 2 drunk men alone on an island who both have mental problems and how they both feed off of each other is not a plot. If you isolate each scene and take it out of context from the whole film, the scenes stand on their own and the actors really give their all. They are the only sliver of hope here. It's a damn shame to waste the talents of two great actors on this script. Put it all together though or watch it all in one sitting, it just doesn't work. The film drags us through nearly 2 hours of pain that can only be described as having teeth pulled with dirty pliers in a far flung third world country.I went in full of high hopes and in the end left angry and jaded, like drinking cheap 2 dollar wine that gives you a bad hangover. I understand that A24 has a very high hit rate when it comes to their work and the pressure is extreme to be bleeding edge and profitable. Dropping 4 million on this chance was a mistake, it leaves their fans disappointed and leery and makes people less likely to see the next one at theaters or unable to recommend the next film down the pipe.

Dafoe trumps Pattinson but the latter does his best role to date.All in all, a really great film that's worth the watch for a cineast, but it is a bit of a struggle and a metaphorical maze.

1120,garyalexander-14001,Was Tom a Hallucination to Pattinson's Character?,8,2 November 2019,"I have yet to read any explanations of the plot, but here are some of my thoughts after first viewing.
A lot of positive user reviews on IMDB don't connect w what I took from the movie. If you're looking to just go and expect to see a tense horror movie, you're going to regret it and feel like you are wasting your time.The Lighthouse appears to be open to interpretation as to whether Pattinson is hallucinogenic from the moment he arrives on the island, or he's mildly insane after about 10 days, and spiraling further throughout the movie. Below, I'm going to share my thoughts about plot, so some heavy spoilers coming.The 4:3 aspect and black and white is to help portray the narrow and isolated viewpoint of Pattinson's character...or Dafoe's, or both.
With about 30 minutes left, I had realized the fog horn is mostly constant throughout the film. I am curious to see on second viewing if the fog horn indicates reality is happening, and when the fog horn is absent, it indicates you are witnessing a hallucination.
I think Dafoe's character could be completely made up in Pattinson's head because it could be an amalgam of Moby Dick and Ancient Mariner poem that Pattinson's character could have read and inspired him to imagine what an experienced lighthouseman/ex-sailor would be. After Dafoe's amazing monologue as he's being buried, he comes at Pattinson in the house...I thought he looked clean for having just been buried, and this creates two opposing interpretations. If Pattinson hallucinated burying Dafoe alive, then that monologue delivered by Dafoe would have been made up in Pattinson's mind, and gives weight that Dafoe's character is a complete hallucination of Pattinson's.
Or the plot is just Pattinson's losing and taking Dafoe's sanity with him.
A third interpretation and I think least likely is, Dafoe is all alone and and made up Pattinson to cope with his loneliness.The movie is crazy, and makes you think. Dafoe is a force in this...simply amazing work! The whole movie is a really good work cinema, but the scene at the end when Pattinson looks at the light is just pure cinephile heaven.If you like watching great directors and enjoy multiple viewings of film and see cinema as art, then this movie offers a lot.",The Lighthouse

I would actually prefer being stranded on a rock in the North Atlantic with two murderous chronic mastrubators (somehow a vital theme to this movie) than ever watch The Lighthouse again. Sometimes, even when you do everything right, if the subject matter is garbage, it's just really pretty garbage.

There's a web of Proteus/Prometheus mythology mixed in with the progression of sanity and isolation. I think maybe this movie appeals to the people in life who have had difficulty. If you married your high school sweetheart in a small town and like a good shoot em up, the concepts here will be too difficult for you to comprehend.The dialogue, grueling way the story is put together, and absolute confusion the director tries to inflict makes this a compelling horror movie far better than any of the garbage recent insidious movies or anything I've seen since ""Heredity"".

This also has to be, by far, Rob Pattinson's best movie, it shows the best of his acting. I'm serious, anyone who thinks Rob is not a good actor because of the Twilight movies should definitely watch this. The time this movie is set in, the language, the tone, the look and feel is just so beautiful. There are some really outstanding shots in this movie. It is VERY slow in the beginning but it gives you the vibe that something isn't right, and it really isn't. The location, music, cinematography, everything is just so phenomenal and I call this pure cinema because it definitely is especially during this day and age where Hollywood movies are being taken over by big movie franchises which includes the Fast movies, MCU, DCEU, etc etc. Absolutely crazy performances from Rob Pattinson and Willem Dafoe.

Truly a bizarre ride from start to finish, I personally believe that any opinion of this film is completely valid. There is absolutely no literal meaning to receive from this film; it was incredibly interpretive-almost personal. However, I think it did a good job at displaying the violence in human nature.There is a lot of speculation about the actual plot of this film. Everybody expects, at the very least, a plot out of a movie. This film is different, though. It has an almost carefree story that scatters about the film like a wild animal, but this only adds a layer of indirect storytelling (albeit thin). It's a nightmare to follow- as it should be. With each descending step into madness, the story unwinds and becomes more meaningless and brittle. There is something grasping about this experience.One other thing to note about this piece is the dialogue. While I feel that some parts of this film could have been executed better, the incredible monologues from both actors makes up for it. There are moments in this film where I just wanted to listen to these men speak. It was, in a way, Shakespearean.Really, in the end, it's only a movie. I personally enjoyed it for its thematic value, but I can totally understand how this film is, in it's own way, complete nonsense. I'm looking forward to future films by Eggers, but I'm hoping he relies more on his ability to create a scene rather than the talent of the actors.",The Lighthouse

The foreshadowing given at the beginning by Thomas saying his last hand went insane and was sent home made the entire film predictable and boring. Walking out of the theater I came away with nothing other than it was a shining remake inside of a lighthouse. The cheesy pirate dialogue and unintelligible rants of Willem DaFoe kept me awake but only to decide that it was a worse movie for keeping it like that.

It is seriously a mixture of drama, horror and fantasy. It is little disturbing if you think about it after watching the movie.
Though we still do not know the entire concept of the movie though people say it is based on the Greek mythology it is based on us to take whatever we want from this movie. It is according to us whether we want to believe the things Robert Pattinson saw was true or false or whether to believe William Dafoe or not.

However, upon seeing it, I left the theater initially confused but then after realizing it wasn't worth much energy, I just accepted the reality of my reaction: disappointment. It was underwhelming. The first hour or so was intriguing and certainly set things up in an intriguing manner but what was set up was ultimately neglected in a pursuit for style and atmosphere over substance. The movie is most definitely a play at metaphors, symbolism, hidden meaning, references to seafaring myths, The Rime of the Ancient Mariner, Greek myths (a seeming melding together of Sisyphus and Prometheus), and so on but the muddled execution made me suspect that there wasn't nearly as much going on as the cinephiles and movie theorists will invent for it.Essentially, after the first hour this became narratively unclear and focused instead on repetitive fever dream scenarios and bombastic speeches and emotional conflict between the two characters - all of which were well done and well executed but only raised question marks without a clear story or message. Perhaps it is possible to decrypt it but nothing about the themes or the atmosphere or the story was compelling enough to merit the effort of seeking deeper meaning in this movie.

1174,qstrommer,Best Picture 2019,10,1 November 2019,"Simply put, The Lighthouse by Robert Eggers is the best film of the year. Every single shot in this film is masterfully composed and will sear itself into your mind like a hot branding iron. The 1.19:1 aspect ratio, low key lighting, and black and white camera all meld together to give the film the visual style of the German Expressionist films of the 1920s, such as The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari. This unnatural look causes an intense feeling of dread and unease in the viewer, one that is only aided by the film's audio design. Throughout the entire film the audience can hear the blare of the steam heater, an intrusive and angry sound that turns the stomach and burrows into one's ears. There can also be heard the unearthly cries of aquatic wildlife and the constant thud of rain. Additionally, the soundtrack is heavily distorted. These noises pound away at the audience and character's senses, slowly eroding their sanity and driving them over the brink. The complete disregard for the passage of time makes the 2 hour runtime feel like 5 minutes and 3 months all at once. The icing on top of this haunting cake are the performances from Robert Pattinson and Willem Defoe. Robert Pattinson as a quiet young man running from his past, and Willem Defoe as an old and weathered wickie whose years of work have driven him slightly mad. Over the course of the movie the character's environment and each other push them to the breaking points until eventually reaching a final explosive climax. Each actor delivers a sledge hammer performance that is utterly authentic in its own unique type of depravity. This film presents a discordant and withering look into two men's descent into the depths of utter madness not seen since the likes of the Shining. A completely unique and impactful film that wears you down before hitting you like a train and leaving you reeling. Worth watching again and again.",The Lighthouse

No one denies the amount of work put in this movie both by the actors and the creators. Nonetheless, I can't help but wonder, what was the point. The story of isolation-driven madness, the horror of projecting all the horrible figures of one's life in the one person they're forced to co-exist with, the story of the lying, alcoholic seaman, it has all been said before. What is this movie adding?
It is a nice film with beautiful cinematography, solid performances by both Pattinson and Dafoe (Dafoe's experience really shines through) but it adds nothing more, no unique point of view. Having seen The Witch I didn't see the director's view progressing on this one.",The Lighthouse

It's probably two things for me..... One...it's just boring....nothing much happens...everything that actually does happen isn't a shock doesn't really go anywhere and tries to manifest some sort of emotion but falls flat on it's backside. Two....it's like they've given some movie school students a bit cash and two good actors ( one and a half ) and said "" on yer way"" and they've concocted the most contrived uninteresting Arty drivel they could think of.

I wanted it to be over quite quickly.In saying this, the acting was, and the cinematics were, amazing. It's crazy to think this was snubbed at the Oscars when there's movies like Suicide Squad that have the academy award of merit. Robert Pattison and William Dafoe have chemistry so phenomenal that I'm sure even Mrs Dafoe envies. The wonderful weirdness of this movie beautifully finishes off Robert Pattison reaching the zenith of his indie-acting career; bringing him into being, if not very close to, a thoroughly respected actor. This transformation will be finished off nicely with Batman upcoming, preceded recently by a pretty perfect performance in, Christopher Nolans', Tenet.This movie is definitely not for everyone, but I found it refreshingly unique; sometimes bursting out laughing out of sheer surprise at what was unwrapping in front of me.

1205,carpejoel,One of my favorite films,10,22 April 2020,"A movie that deserves more recognition but is overlooked due to the onslaught of great movies that came out in 2019. Two great performances in this movie, by actors who always find a way to make the scene come to life. Robert Pattinson and Wilem Dafoe seem to enhance each other's performance, feeding off of each other's energy. It's a shame that neither of the actors were nominated for an Oscar.What a wonderful choice to shoot this film in black and white. Before viewing the movie I had my doubts of this decision, but after watching I could not see it any other way. It adds to the suspense of the movie, at night the darkness seems to swallow everything around it, while the main characters are illuminated by a lit candle. The smallest amount of light seems to brighten what is happening on screen, which adds mystery and virtue to the light in the lighthouse. Every scene that takes place with the light I find myself mesmerized by the light, wondering what power and knowledge it has just like the main character.What I love most about the movie is that it can be interpreted in so many different ways. I have read countless reviews, all with their own take on what the film really means. Each review touches base with the Greek mythology stories of Prometheus and Proteus, and how the movie reflects these characters as well as some aspects of the story. I have never read those stories and do not have an opinion on the movie reflecting them. However; I do have a couple of interpretations on what the film is about.The effects isolation can have on a person's psyche. It's brilliant how as a viewer you slowly get to see the deterioration of a person's mental health. The thirst for power and keeping that power at all costs, Wilem Dafoe's character manipulates the mind of his colleague in order to stay in control. Men battling the urges of their attraction for each other. Although I do believe that Robert Pattinson's character is straight, he certainly battles feelings of intimacy for the lighthouse keeper. I think isolation has increased his want for human interaction and the lighthouse keeper is the only one who can offer that. On the other hand I do believe Wilem Dafoe's character is gay. He seems to belittle his employee every chance he gets, creating a dominant position over Thomas. I don't know if he was planning on taking advantage of that dominant role by getting Thomas drunk, or if it was another way to keep the light to himself. His feelings towards Thomas seem more clear and it shows when he leans in for a kiss during an affectionate dance.That's about enough typing for me. This is a movie I cherish, and I wanted to share my thoughts on it. It is a movie that I wish I could experience it for the very first time again.",The Lighthouse
1206,faloom_bwe-bwe,"Seen better, seen worse..",4,18 April 2020,"This well-shot yarn combines the look of a 40's film noir combined with ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" writing...*SPOILER ALERT*So methinks that amid all the gorgeous late 1800's scenery and thick vernacular, these two men are possessed by the idea of something other-worldly lurking in the surf or the premise that some mystery awaits us upstairs in the ever locked ""lantern"" room,.. but I believe that the only ""other-worldly"" thing in that lighthouse was the recent installation of electricity to the lantern and that's why Willem Defoe's character ""Tom"" told ""Ephraim"" that the lantern needs oil that lugging the oil drum all the way upstairs wouldn't do anything, yet gave him a much smaller gas can to use instead,.. and that lantern is HUGE.. so I got to thinkin' maybe, just maybe that that lantern was driven by electricity.. and these goons never seen nor heard of electricity so they thought it was something ethereal.. and it coincides with the period of the film,..1890's.. that's when Edison, Westinghouse and Tesla we're experimenting with various forms of electricity..and to get that lantern so brightly illuminated in that day and time, you may have needed a few arc-tubes or Mazda lamps in the glass envelope..so it was the electricity that slayed the beasts..",The Lighthouse

1210,nveehaey,"Afters spending couple of days continuously thinking of what this complex masterpiece is about and spend quite hours writing this, i would like to share my thoughts about it..",8,27 June 2020,"The idea and what the film represents is the element that i will be focusing on, and i will point on the other movie's aspects at the end.1 - The upper light room in the lighthouse represent heaven. Each person in any religion ever created in order for them to be in heaven they should be spent their lifetime doing, generally speaking, all the types of good generous actions and behaviors otherwise they will be refused and thrown in hell. Thomas Howard after he did unforgiving sins : (not helping his work mate in his previous job or he might was even the one responsible for his death nothing is sure , not feeling any guilt while watching him dying and begging for help instead he just felt like lightning a cigarette, stealing the dead's man name and identity, cowardly run away looking for what he stated im the movie ""a new beginning""...) Thomas doesn't want to pay for his sins or to be forgiven by working hard, which represented as the daily hard work his boss obliged him to do, in the earth the place of the sacrifices and struggles , which is the island he is in, no in contrary he is in hurry to go to heaven, Which is the high lighthouse, he wants the easy path, and he makes it even worse by doing more awful crime by savagely killing Thomas Wake. And when he finally got to ""heaven"" with all of his written sins, face and a life covered by blood he was refused and got pushed back to where he belongs, to hell in which seagulls slowly eat his intestines while he painfully suffers alone for days with no hand to help just as his previous working mate.2 - The main cause of the film' tragedy is that Thomas Howard killed the seagulls. Wake told Howard at the beginning of the film that's it's a bad luck, some sore of a curse, to kill a seagulls because they contain the souls of the dead sailors. And we see that the night after Howard savagely killed the one-eyed seagull the storm began and the the relationship between him and Wake became more complex and tensed.The reason i think why the one-eyed seagull kept bothering Howard is that it has within it the soul of the one-eyed person who was working with Wake before and that he was killed by Wake and not committed suicide as Wake stated. He was actually trying to help him and convince him to leave the island before he ended up being dead like the seagull in the well.3 - Thomas Howard who is not familiar with the very lonely sailors and the lighthouse's keepers lifestyle and routine, went insane little by little. He started emphasizing and imagining that Wake is following a plan by putting that cursed wooden mermaid toy under his bad to affect his mental stability, along side with keep proposing and insisting on him to drink with him each night until they loose track of time and space. And putting him under a hug pressure by ordering him to do all the work by himself to effect his physical abilities and make him tired. Not to forget the scene in which Howard tried to escape using the boat which Wake destroyed and went after him with an axe in his hand, and the fact that Wake didn't allow him to go to lighthouse at all, also the negative reviews he found Wake was writing about him in his notebook. All these elements, which are in this theory not true but only from Howard's own perspective, they made Howard harshly kill Wake after being in an insane's person mental state.And when he went to the lighthouse and opened up the upper room. There are two possibilities which are: 1- He was utterly and madly surprised that he found no secret in there, nothing special at all just a lamp that will burn his hand and made him loudly in scary manner scream because he realized that he did a crime for no reason at all and that it was all shaped in his imagination. 2- He really found something, that i have no idea what it is. Something he couldn't bear or believe that pushed him away to fall down all those stairs, whatever it was good or bad, beautiful or horrible. It was something to much for him to handle.4 - the forth theory all of it is quite similar to the previous one in all the aspects, except for that Walk was really trying to kill Howard and he created and followed not only for him but the one-eyed man before him. This theory i believe it's supported by the second theory i states previously and somehow they fit together.5 - Thomas Howard drowned in the scene in which he saw the mermaid at one the first scenes of the movie and in that state between death and life he imagined and created all the mess we saw in the movie because he couldn't accept being dead in such a helpless naive manner that he dumbly lead himself into with his own feet because of curiosity he felt towards what was floating in the water, that could have been avoided. And after he finds himself thrown by the sea in the edges of an island being eaten by the seagulls. (but this theory does not discuss how he managed to stay alive and does not justify being completely naked at the end with no mark of being hit or smashed by rocks or ...)The other movie's elements are great and kinda perfect for me :
the acting is the most catching thing in the movie. This is my first movie watching Pattinson and he manifests an acting skills and a control over his facial expressions and body language that shocked me. He is very talented and im looking forward to watch other movies of him.The cinematography is very classical especially when they switch from a long shot to a close up by moving the camera forward or backward. At first I didn't like the the decision of using old camera lenses that shoots in a square format,which remind of the seventh seal, because i thought they will get a better a better shoots of the element of the island, the lighthouse, the ocean... But i got habituated with it and frankly they succeeded in taking sensational shots.The moving kinda terrifying songs are catchy and suits perfectly the scenes and transferring and empowering the emotions of the scenes.The black and white theme and the use of lights are awesome, they manifest a very cinema-field-loving professional crew.As a conclusion, I would like to confess that there is no other movie i have watched before made me completely shocked stunned and amazed during the same time as The Lighthouse did.

The sounds and music contributed a lot to that.The story however was somewhat slow but seeing the characters get progressively more insane throughout the movie and the simple yet brilliant dialogues were sublime.I see why people Would rate this lower but this type of film is just something i really really enjoy.

'The Lighthouse' seems to me precisely like a lighthouse: A machine whose powerful fuel and precision-oiled mechanism work perfectly to shine amidst the darkness of mediocrity.
I will not stop to comment on the wonderful photography, the right choice of the square format, the fascinating work of the actors, the wonderful mythical references, the beautiful black and white or the charming sound, incredibly fused with the music. I won't even comment on the mixed feelings that this audiovisual experience provokes in a true adult. Suffice it to say that everything in this film is FIRST CLASS, both on an artistic and technical level, a unique, original, daring and unmitigated jewel to be appreciated from a hundred angles. Because ""The Lighthouse"" is made to be seen over and over again to discover new nuances, new details that enrich your vision of the story... or change it completely.
And you can be sure of one thing: Those who criticize it, or have seen it with too much prejudice, or are not intellectually capable enough, or simply did not pay enough attention. There are no more options.
But I have lied. There is one thing about this film that I do not like. I don't like that for a long time, any other film will seem too cooked up, too hackneyed and too flat.So go ahead and don't be afraid of the light.",The Lighthouse

I believe there are plenty of people who listed all the compliments to this movie, I second them all. It's definitely a masterpiece and its format definitely a great contribution to outstanding acting by both actors. It's definitely worth watching, but you've got to be in an appropriate mood, it's not an entertainment piece. Obviously, for some viewers (just observing some negative reviews), the plot turned out unclear and left them confused. I believe for educated and attentive people the story is very smooth, connotations and references to legends are noticed easily...The only question which disturbed me days after I watched it: why do we need such movies like The Lighthouse? So we need them at all? I did feel very happy for the movie's Director, Dafoe's and Pattinson' (who I actually could barely stand before) acting - great achievement for all of them and their crew, they deserve all the awards. Same time the characters are miserable, their reality is revolting and the main feeling I had while watching - disgust...I am glad I watched it, but I'd never watch it again like most of the movies you once admire...I would be rather careful when recommending it to someone to watch, as it's not for unprepared or sensitive viewer.

Everything, every aspect, every element from start to finish feels like I've indulged into a highly unsettling film, with an incredible amount of interpretation to behold from the subtle details in the visuals, the excellent cinematography, writing, as well as the symbolism displayed in both the characters of the film to Greek mythology.To say that Willem Dafoe and Robert Pattinson both put up for outstanding performances would be undermining the emotional and psychological weight both characters carried on in their narratives of life. Throughout the story, the viewer really can't tell who to trust, and the balance between trust, the gritty production makes for an incredibly disorienting, and compelling sight to see.

The subtle mental/emotional manipulation from Wake with Ephraim, and the slow buildup of hatred for Wake coming from Ephraim had me on the edge of my seat towards the end.

Robert Eggers' ""The Lighthouse"" has that same message and quality.The film started so slowly my interest began to wane. By the end, however, I was riveted. I found myself mulling plot ideas in my mind, wondering which direction the film would take. I did find certain aspects so disturbing, like the bird killing and birds using Robert Pattinson's body as carrion, that I looked away. Otherwise, the film fully had my attention.What a character study on how odd jobs attract odd employees! Or, how the job and work environment shape one's responses to life.The Lighthouse serves as a beacon into the hearts, minds and souls of those who first seek to obscure, then reverse direction, and dig deep into their personal stories and desires - perhaps, to one's demise, but ultimately, to one's truthful reckoning.",The Lighthouse

1261,ferito4,One possible interpretation,7,28 January 2020,"This duel of great performances in a stylish psychological horror film leaves us with a lot of questions and a hunger to understand. Here are some possible answers.Two men arrive at an island to work in a lighthouse. Thomas Wake (William Dafoe) is older, knows better, is very jealous about the lighthouse and boss the other one around. Thomas Howard (Robert Pattinson), the other one, works hard during the day, has sexual fantasys with mermaids and keeps a dirty secret about his past. He may have killed his coworker, or his father, or maybe he just watched him die and took his name. Anyways, he´s ashamed about what happened: """"I ain't the kind to look back what's behind him, see? Ain't nothin' wrong with a man startin' fresh, startin' new"".After Howard kills -¿a seagull? ¿the soul of a sailer? - the wind changes, a storm comes and they cannot escape the island anymore. Time passes, no one knows how much, and Howard descends to madness until he kills his partner, touches the lighhouse and dies. Then he gets eaten by seagulls. ¿What just happened? ¿What is it all about? Here is my take on it.Thomas Wake is actually Thomas Howard´s subconscious. That is why Howard works the day and Wake the night. They take shifts over the same body and they only see each other when they go to sleep or when they awake, a time were our inner world interacts the most with our consciousness. They also can talk freely if they are drunk. That explains why Wake knows everything Howard does and did in the past, keeps notes of his behavier and is awful critical about his work performance. Still Howard has to obey him, as we usually do what our subconscious dictate: ""Well, you ain't a captain of no ship and you never was, you ain't no general, no copper, you ain't the president, and you ain't my father -- and I'm sick of you actin' like you is! And I'm sick of yer smell. I'm sick of it, you goddamned drunk"". This is Howard actually hating himself.¿Why? Because he did something he regrets in the past and is seeking solitude and peace in this lighthouse. But when he kills the seagull the storm comes, he starts to confront his subconscious to the point of madness. He desperate needs to know what is hidden the lighthouse, the thing that Wake sees everynight smiling. Even Howard doesn´t know for sure what he did, his own hidden truth. Wake knows.The mermaid´s mythology indicate that they sing until sailmen fall in love, lose their minds and drown. This is the temptation of Howard to seek the horrible truth, and when he buries his subconscious he can get to it, be burned by his own guilt and comit suicide falling down the stairs. He is finally naked and eaten by the souls of the people he killed. By his own guilt.At the begining the two men arrive at the lighthouse each carrying their own baggage and two men are leaving from it, carrying the baggage between them. That is after they become conscious of their hidden truth.",The Lighthouse

With two great actors, the breathtaking cinematography that was on display in the trailer, an incredibly eerie remote location that placed two characters in isolation for a month and a wacky narrow screen ratio, what could go wrong? Perhaps the only thing is to make both of the characters thoroughly unsympathetic and throw them into a distasteful plot, what plot there is. I knew from pretty early on that the characters probably would not meet the happiest of fates. As the film ground on I increasingly found myself hoping they would meet their fate soon and just get it over with.This film actually makes me angry because it is a waste of opportunities that rarely come along, starting with black and white cinematography on 35mm motion picture film. Had the filmmaker tried for a more mainstream story, rather than playing to the art house crowd who clearly loved it, this could have been a real game-changer and allowed for more experimental films to reach a larger market.

It takes a lot to get me to go see something in the theater, but I made one of my infrequent trips to the local theater to see Robert Eggers' newest film, The Lighthouse. Ever since its premiere at the Cannes Film Festival, this film has been wowing critics all over the world, getting critical acclaim from everyone who saw it. The concept sounded interesting, and I enjoyed the trailer, so I decided to check it out as soon as possible.The first thing many people are mentioning, and the thing that immediately hits you when the film begins, is the aspect ratio it was filmed in. The movie is shot in a boxy format, tossing aside the usual widescreen format in favor of a much more compact frame. This offers an immediate feeling of claustrophobia and gave me hope that I was in for an exciting movie experience.Unfortunately, the atmosphere caused by the aspect ratio and the choice to shoot in black and white over color is where my praise for this movie begins and ends. I am not going to sugar coat it or go in half-way with backwards insults. To put it bluntly: I hated this movie. HATED. I hated everything about it. I hated what passed for a story. I hated the acting. I hated the actual shot composition in every way that wasn't involving the aspect ratio. I hated the damn foghorn that went off seemingly every 30 seconds for the entirety of the film's duration.When I read the buzz on this movie, all I heard about was the amazing acting, the incredible cinematography, and the excellent story. Critics and audiences alike were falling over themselves as they heaped praise on this film, calling it a masterpiece. This leads me to think one of two things has happened here: Either A- I am too stupid to understand what I saw, or B-nobody understood this movie, and didn't want to admit it, so they figured if they found it overly confusing, it must be brilliant.This movie is supposed to be a psychological thriller, following two isolated men's decent into madness, but it actually plays more like a parody of independent film. This movie is one long cliché from start to finish.Black and white? CheckBig movie star in a small movie trying to get taken seriously as more than a tween heart throb? Check.Older character actor in a prominent role? Check.Dream sequences interspersed in such a way that you can't tell what is real and what is fantasy? CheckAtmospheric background ""music"" with zero melody? CheckOpen ended, pretentious non-finale that answers zero questions and can be interpreted any number of ways by an audience too embarrassed to admit nothing they saw made any sense? Check and double check!I would give a spoiler warning, but even though I sat through this movie, I still have no clue what happened. There was a lot of yelling. Foghorns. A lot of screaming. Foghorns. Rain. Foghorns. Fighting. Foghorns. Dream sequences. Rain. Foghorns. More fighting. More foghorns. More yelling. A fight scene between Robert Pattenson and a seagull. Foghorns. Some more fighting. Rain. And for good measure, foghorns. Then a horrible ending.I have been racking my brain trying to figure out the best way to describe the experience of watching The Lighthouse and I think I have come up with the perfect way to do so. Have you ever had somebody try to describe a dream to you, but the dream made zero sense, and they barely remember it? They are rambling on, backtracking, trying to describe something that they themselves didn't understand, makes zero sense, and they don't actually remember? That painful conversation usually lasts about three minutes. Now have that conversation for an hour and forty five minutes, while a foghorn blasts in your ear over and over. That is what watching The Lighthouse is like.There are two people credited with the screenplay for this movie, but I refuse to believe an actual script exists. I have put more thought into this movie review than the screenwriters did the actual movie. It is good that the movie is so dark and everything is hard to make out, because both Willem Dafoe and Robert Pattinson do so much over acting, that I am convinced the scenery had actual bite marks in it. Half of the movie is so confusingly shot, I could barely tell the two actors apart. Even the rain looked overly fake. I swear if the camera panned over a few feet to the side, you would see people with buckets and sprinklers at the ready. The only person who went above and beyond in their job performance in the making of this movie was whomever was responsible for sounding the foghorn. That person deserves a special Oscar for stamina.The characters in this movie spend the majority of the story questioning their sanity, and I have to admit, I know exactly how they feel. I am highly selective in what I go to see, and as a result, I rarely see a movie I don't enjoy to some degree. Yet I absolutely hated every second of this movie. Am I that out of touch with my own tastes? Am I losing my sense of self? I no longer know what is real. Who am I? How could I have been so wrong? Why is a movie I flat out loathed getting such universal acclaim? Is there something I am missing? Have I become incapable of recognizing genius? Or are these critics just covering for the fact that they didn't understand this movie any more than anyone else in my theater did?As I left, I was thinking to myself how I had just witnessed the worst movie I have ever seen in my entire life. I was in stunned silence at being so wrong in thinking I would like this movie, when I overheard other people talking about the film. I felt a small measure of relief in the fact that every single one of them was talking about how terrible the movie was. I didn't hear one positive thing being said by the other movie-goers in my theater. So what did we all miss?I am left with a feeling of confusion as I try to make sense of what I saw. At first, I thought it was not believable that two men would descend into madness over a period of only a few weeks, yet this movie managed to do it to me in less than two hours, so I guess it is more believable than I initially thought. Still, just because the movie was confusing and made me question my own relationship with myself, it did not do so in the way it intended. The only way I could see Robert Pattinson and Willem Dafoe going so crazy so quickly is if they were able to watch themselves in this movie, like the scene in Spaceballs where Rick Moranis is watching the VHS of the movie to figure out what is going on and gets to the part of the movie he is actually doing at that time.Needless to say, I can not recommend this movie in any way. I went in excited, and left heartbroken. I thought this movie was going to be everything that I love about film making, but was instead, almost like a dark parody of it instead. This was (and I say this with all sincerity, and what I believe to be full command of my mental faculties) the worst movie I have ever seen.Foghorn.",The Lighthouse
1283,amernaik,The illuminations of a inept mind,5,2 November 2019,"I didn't see the movie. But the poster is fantastic. It beckons a dark, sinister kind allegory, the likes of which can only be aptly cast by two men with beards. Robert Patterson has never been bolder as man in focus on the left. You can tell he acted the hell out of this movie from the look of disdain and surety. A complexity with no doubt explored in the film. On the right, William Defoe plays man out of focus on the right of the central star and which studio executes assume is carrying the movie. Is it based on evidence? Only the kind that said Hollywood didn't have race problem with casting and read one graph on demographics and felt it mirrored reality. I can quote Maggie Harper on this.

I want to feel compelled to watch it again for symbols or clues I missed. I enjoy thinking through what it all means. The one-eyed albatross, the drinks, the creatures, etc.What's great about the movie is that in the end, it is an event. Like many events in real life that we hear about or read about, we don't get all the answers laid at our feet. In the end, it is merely two people grappling with one person or both people's sanity. That's it.The performances were stellar. Both actors were completely committed to the realistically-rooted characters. The cinematography and design were terrific.

Effective at mood-setting, check. The b&w filming, the shots, the scenery itself... even the set, the old dilapidated coastal shack, all excellent. The dynamic between the two characters is raw and real. Is it a thought-provoking free-fall into insanity? Maybe. But... there is a such a fine line between ""arthouse"", trying something different, leaving much up to subjectivity and imagination, and... just trying a bit too hard. Mermaid labia? Hmmm.

1326,kornelparoczai,Find your own meaning,10,25 December 2020,"This movie isn't for everyone.
People writing bad reviews must have very shallow views on life.
Films aren't about being boring or not, they should be about the meaning behind them.
If it isn't force fed to you it's incoherent and bad? Learn to find your own meaning, rather than accepting that everything you watch, you watch for shallow impulses, rather than diving into human nature, and even to some extent, into your own mind.
This movie is something to dwell on, and recognise, not something to enjoy watching. Though the setting and the acting make it enjoyable enough, for the film to be able to flesh out it's meaning and convey it in a somewhat incoherent manner, to be sure, but using this incohesion to the best effect. The effect, that not many (mainstream atleast) movies have. The effect of making the viewer think for themselves.
Personally, I watched it with my girlfriend, and all the symbolism connected to predominantly male frustrations was something I very much recognised and could identify with. Whereas she could barely do the same, so for her the movie was about a peek into something she couldn't quite fathom, for me it was the realisation of just how stupid my gender can be and is. Which the picture perfectly symbolises. Similarly to us, everyone will get something different from it, which is a rarity nowadays.
This movie, at least for me, was a very much welcome break from mind numbing sensationalism. In short, the movie has problems, and to said problems only you can find the solution.",The Lighthouse

1328,ColtenGoyak,PLEASE WATCH!!!,8,4 May 2020,"I am at a loss for words. Robert Eggers' 'The Lighthouse' is the most breathtaking movie I've seen since 'Blade Runner: 2049'. There are few movies that transport you to the time they are based, and even fewer that pull it off as well as this masterpiece did. Robert Pattinson's transformation into this character shocked me stiff and I can now officially say without hesitation that he is, not only a good actor, but Oscar-worthy. And Willem... oh Willem... let's just say that if he doesn't get an Oscar for best supporting actor, then that will be the stupidest decision the Academy will make since giving Best Picture to 'Shakespeare in Love'. They both give near perfect performances and nail the late 1800's accent, I'm sure this was especially hard for Pattinson considering his accent. Eggers is an outstanding filmmaker and is bursting at the seams with potential, and after watching this I cannot wait to see what else he brings to the table. The cinematography is flawless and beautiful, it perfectly captures every shot and emphasizes isolation. The soundtrack is also superb and fits the setting perfectly. They also chose the best place on earth to film the movie... Canada, the greatest country on earth, Yarmouth, Nova Scotia to be exact which is only about a 4 hour travel from where I live. The one complaint I have (which is very minute) is that the movie gave me a lot of 'The Shining' vibes, which actually may have been why I liked it so much (considering 'The Shining' is one of my favorite movies of all time) but there was a very thin line between paying homage and copying. I won't get into the reasons why but if you are familiar with 'The Shining' then you'll know what I'm talking about.

Yes it will leave you contemplating your our state of mind... maybe I could better sell it by saying...This film is dark and daring. Eggers alienates the audience with abstract themes of mythology and psychological theories that scream to the rooted evil human desire for power. The imagery within this film will leave you contemplating the characters reality.,The Lighthouse
1341,paul-07880,Boring Boring and Boring,1,1 February 2020,"I watch an average of 2 movies per week, for the past 4 years, and without a dought "" This is the worst "" Not just because it's in Black and White, Film screen box shape (4:4) it is the worst quality picture....not even SD... so poorly shot, and sound all over the place.
Take your partner to Bingo, you will be more entertained! Miss it like the plague!",The Lighthouse
1342,alecflackie,Pretentious rubbish,3,27 August 2020,Pretentious inexplicable art-house rubbish. An opportunity for the actors to practice silly accents and pretend that they are better than us. The most horrific prospect of the whole film was having to sit through the final hour.,The Lighthouse
1343,nairshrutis,Pathetic,1,17 April 2020,One of the worst movie ever. Movie is full nonsense from start to end. Don't waste time by watching it.,The Lighthouse
1344,babo-24291,OMG,1,11 April 2020,"Such a rubbish film... after watching half an hour, I turned it off. It was the first time in my life that I couldn't watch a movie.
Sorry folks!",The Lighthouse

1346,stringer-48116,What the?,1,7 March 2020,"I've never left a review for a movie, yet after the torture of watching the lighthouse I felt the need for the first time to do so. So here it is... UTTER RUBBISH. I dont give up on movies half way through, even if i dislike them but this thing was hard to endure. Random scenes thrown in everywhere to make it look like people are losing their mind. That's about it. I can't even find one good thing about this movie. Maybe when he kills the seagull, that was good effects but even then nothing to write home about. So thats it. Over an hour and a half to watch a seagull die. Boring as bat sh*#. Definitely in my top 10 hated movies and to make that list it has to be really bad.",The Lighthouse
1347,dixiecowboy,Had high hopes.,1,26 October 2019,"Could have been a really great movie, but it made no sense. No ending with any conclusion. Waste of time and money.",The Lighthouse
1348,Waechter48,Yes,10,21 May 2020,"I loved this film, everyone was in there A-game for this project; The directing, the writing, the lighting, the editing, the cinematography, the score and WILLEM DEFOE. Pattinson was also great.Quick take:
Winslow lights Tom's pipe, giving the gift of fire. Prometheus was banished and pecked by birds for giving the gift of fire to man.",The Lighthouse
1349,sethragsdale,Wow,10,28 February 2020,"I have not a single bad thing to say about this film, it is simply mesmerizing. I wanted to see this in theaters but it was made difficult where I live so I opted to wait for the blu ray release and now I wish I would have drove the 3.5 hours to see it. This is a masterpiece in my eyes and have seen it 3 times now trying to form my own speculation on what exactly is going on and I won't say my interpretation because I want everyone to try and form their own. The performances are both amazing especially Willem Dafoe who just steals every scene, but Robert Pattinson is great also. The cinematography, set design, writing, directing, everything is greatly done. This is my favorite film of 2019 beside Waves and Midsommar. I also think Willem Dafoe not being nominated for best supporting actor is a crime even though most of the academy probably didn't even see it, I'm glad it got a cinematography nom though!",The Lighthouse
1350,rosewitch-31946,4 weeks together and already crazy,4,11 May 2020,"Black and white film always takes me back in time and brought out the lighthouse island desolation. But only 4 weeks together and they were at each other's throats...that didn't make sense. Most lightkeepers lived for years at their posts. The story dragged and got confusing...I could swear they were just both suffering from the DTs with all the poison they drank. Yes you May be left with more questions than answers and literally scratching your head. This turned the meaning of a lighthouse, a warning to ships to sail away from danger into an evil infested light. I'm still trying to wrap my brain around the strange sex scenes, it just made it a bit creepy instead of scarier. One viewing was enough.",The Lighthouse

1352,ajohan-53220,This movie is great,10,10 November 2020,This movie was fantastic. I especially liked the ending cause right when the movie ended a cute girl kissed me.If you watch this movie a cute girl will probably kiss you too. Go watch this movie!Also the other movie parts were pretty cool too I guess.,The Lighthouse
1353,magnificulgibillan,a rare gem,10,29 January 2020,"Few movies have made me feel the same. every human emotion can be felt in this movie, and powerfully. only movies that are in the same tier are for example a clockwork orange, high life, interstellar, the truman show etc",The Lighthouse
1354,lvbentley-05570,This film is terrible.,2,28 May 2020,The acting and the seagulls are good but that's about it.,The Lighthouse
1355,carrollis-04460,"Just a 2 dudes jacking off, screaaming, and fighting",2,26 March 2020,"I bought this film hoping the critics were right about this film.... It was a disaster not a good film the film is a drag, half of it has the men drunk, the other half is great cinematography dragging on for too long, and lets not foreget you'll leave this film empty and confused why it was even made.",The Lighthouse
1356,andyloudon-65613,True story? Apparently so! ....,4,10 February 2020,"Individually I thought the acting, cinematography, editing etc were brilliant but the end felt like an anti-climax.
After the film ended I started googling. Turns out there is a true story from 1801 about two keepers (Thomas & Thomas) that got stuck on a lighthouse for months off the British coast and slowly descended into madness. There was even another film made about it 3 years ago also called The lighthouse that followed the true story a lot better.
It looks to me like the writer director has watched that film and said ""Hold my beer"" and for the most part he did a good job but adding random stuff about sex (Which I understand was meant to show their mental decline) just felt like it was building the film up to be something more mythical but the whole thing fell flat at the end.I think it could have been based more on the true story and still have the brilliant work and acting that was put into it, the time frame could have been spread out over months instead of weeks to make the madness more believable for me and a different ending that gives a better conclusion to it all and I would have happily given this a 10!",The Lighthouse
1357,kylelong-41139,I like,8,23 August 2020,It's kinda like turning the light off at the bottom of the stairs at night but right before you think you see a old naked man in the corner but he's like kinda hot.,The Lighthouse
1358,steggydino,One Of The Best Of The Decade,10,29 October 2019,"The Lighthouse is the quintessential anti-puzzle. It's not a film to be solely taken literally, but to be felt, to be experienced. What we are witnessing is something audacious, a tale that comes spiralling from the depths of Lovecraft and Edgar Allen Poe. On a surface viewing, it does not have much to tell, what seems to be a tale of insanity, when broken down goes deep into the dark fragments of the human psyche. The social isolation, the madness, the insanity, the bitter cruel irony. References to Prometheus and The Fire and Renaissance Paintings. It possesses Bergmans signature contrast and character drama, Bela Tarr's desolate wasteland, Kubrick attention to detail and coldness and Carl Theodor Dreyers Meditative pace. Imagery that carries symbolism and you can unpack it with various ideas. And that's the beauty of The Lighthouse. Not to mention, Willem Dafoes harrowing Neptune's Curse scene",The Lighthouse
1359,fasterboarder,Lighthouse needed a new bulb,1,4 January 2021,"I'm sorry but this is tripe , it's so slow it made think I had hit pause . This is the type of film that I cannot believe actually got made .",The Lighthouse
1360,icantsayrural,"Terrifying, unsettling",6,3 February 2020,"There are no cheap jump scares in this one. Instead they utilise spooky sound effects, black and white cinematography to hit the mark. Once the novelty of deprivation and insanity wears off, the audience is left with repetitive drunken sea shanties and hollering. There's probably some important allegory linking to Greek gods as well but that one went over my head. 5/10 for plot and character development. 8/10 for visuals and cinematography.",The Lighthouse
1361,afairygirl,a puzzle for those who like finding symbols and meanings within,9,28 January 2020,"Despite what negative reviews say, I didn't find the story incoherent or not making sense.quite the opposite, each scene was filled with symbolism, which my mind, as a surgeon, wanted to dissect and decipher with curiosity. overall, the mix of Biblical, Greek and folk references may seem cocophonic, but then isn't the mind of a human like this? especially when confined to isolation and touched with madness from haunting memories and suppressed desires. I enjoyed it greatly and it gave me a good food to thinking. of course, acting and cinematography needs no praise. so I'm stopping here. my suggestion, go and judge for yourself. there's a big chance you'd be stunned.",The Lighthouse
1362,venczodesign,Could have been better,7,21 December 2019,"It is a great acting and a strong film though, robert and williem did it well. As i was saying, this film could have been better. The only thing that i don't like is i still don't get what'e the point of the movie, the ending was horible.",The Lighthouse
