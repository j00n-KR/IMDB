0,MartinHafer,Impossibly overrated and unsettling,6,11 September 2008,"Edward Norton and Brad Pitt form a very strange bond that seems, at times, like it has strong sadomasochistic and gay undertones. They both get off on fighting and at times there seems to be a very odd chemistry between them. During the course of their friendship, Pitt shows Norton how to be more and more and more bizarre and wrapped up in a weird hobby they created, the ""Fight Club"" where testosterone-hyped idiots experience the joy of beating each others' brains in so they can prove their manliness. However, as the film progresses, the club becomes more like a club for anarchists and Norton begins to question where they are headed.This is a movie that had lots of interesting little touches and twists. However, in many cases, they were very cool but also didn't particularly make much sense. The last 20 minutes of the film in particular is really cool--but it just doesn't make sense psychologically and seemed more interested in wowing the audience instead of ringing true. Because of this, I felt that this cult film is impossibly overrated--especially since it's now #25 all-time on IMDb! I won't spoil the surprises, don't worry but suffice to say that by the movie is finished you have absolutely no idea what actually happened.As a high school teacher, I also was alarmed that this film actually encouraged the growth of a sick subculture. A group of boys in my school started their own ""fight club"" and took great pleasure in proving their manliness. I guess if they didn't get off by hurting each other UFC-style, they'd have to ""prove"" their manliness by shooting bunnies or some other mindless guy way--but I hate to see that supposedly civilized people LIKE the idea of watching others become hurt.Additionally, the film is packed with some of the most brutal violence you'll find on celluloid and there is tons of nudity, sexuality and terrorism--just the sort of stuff you'd never want your teens to watch. Unfortunately, among teenage boys, this film is practically a ""must-see"". Parents, exercise some common sense and keep this nihilistic and cruel film away from your kids. If you want to see it yourself, fine, since you probably WON'T be tempted to imitate it. Kids will---I can attest to that.",Fight Club
1,TheLittleSongbird,"You love it or you hate it, personally I loved it",9,18 May 2010,"Perhaps a little too long, but Fight Club is just a very well-made, brilliantly written and superlatively performed film. Essentially a satirical fable, it tells of an insomniac loser teaming up with a seditious soap salesman to form a no-holds-barred-fight club as an outlet for their direction-less aggression. This concept is an intriguing and original one, and works really well. Then there is the script, it is absolutely superb, with dialogue that will make you both laugh and think. Fight Club is very well made, with elaborate production design, great editing and startling images. David Fincher's direction is brilliantly handled and the performances of Edward Norton and Brad Pitt are superb. Overall, just a great film, a mesmerising ride through the 1990s male psyche. 9/10 Bethany Cox",Fight Club
2,Leofwine_draca,Fincher's tour de force is a bruising assault on the senses,10,14 July 2016,"David Fincher's dark, brooding assault on the senses employs much of the same style as he used in SEVEN, to great effect. This is a complex, intelligent film which, for a change, doesn't take the viewer for granted. A big streak of black comedy runs through the centre, making things a bit easier to cope with, but it's still a morose, disturbing film, a good film, yes, but not one which makes you feel good after watching it.The plot twists and turns continually, from beginning to end. Things start off on a relatively small scale to become outrageous and explosive at the film's finale. There's also one of those very-clever twists at the end, so favoured by the likes of THE USUAL SUSPECTS. There is plenty of sick humour, the highlight being the hilarious scene involving the liposuction fat - you'll know it when you see it.With a film like this, the acting has to be brilliant, and it frequently is. Edward Norton excels as the narrator of the story, caught up in all the madness, and it's a multi-faceted, psychologically-focused performance. Brad Pitt doesn't really stretch himself but he fits the bill well and isn't afraid to put off his female fans by appearing broken and bloodied in a film like this. Other actors, ranging from Meat Loaf to Jared Leto, are also very good.The violence is extremely brutal and unglamourised. Heads are knocked hard against concrete, acid is poured over flesh, teeth are knocked out, and noses are split open. This is a hard film to watch, but fascinating at the same time. Fiendishly clever and highly suspenseful, I would rate FIGHT CLUB as one of the best films of 1999 - on par with THE SIXTH SENSE, and just under my favourite, THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT. Buy it, rent it, steal it, but be prepared: you won't be the same afterwards.",Fight Club
3,SnoopyStyle,love the premise at the start but not the twist,6,20 December 2014,"A nameless man (Edward Norton) suffering from insomnia is a traveling investigator for a car company. He goes to a support meeting. He is addicted and starts going to all kinds of support meetings. He encounters another meeting groupie Marla Singer (Bonham Carter). She is uninhibited. On a flight home, he encounters Tyler Durden (Brad Pitt) who makes his own soap. They bond over their dislike of consumerism. Man with no name loses his apartment due to a gas explosion. Outside a bar, Tyler asks him to hit him. He starts staying at Tyler's dilapidated isolated mansion.I want to like this a lot more. I want this movie to say something about consumerism and effeminization of society. I want this movie to take a profound stance on the state of the male position in modern society. It also touches on the isolation of the modern world. It seems set up for something great but then the movie gives a twist that takes much of the punch away. The movie becomes about the twist and I don't know what the movie says about anything else.",Fight Club
4,Hitchcoc,It's Hard to Take Your Eyes Away,9,3 January 2007,"I'm not much into graphic violence. This film transcends that. It has wonderful direction, and, even though it is brutal, it takes things to another ledge. Edward Norton is really controlled as he realizes his power. It's too easy to throw in spoilers so I will leave things to the viewer. The search for self and the growing cult around Fight Club made me suspicious. Still, to watch what happens to the two men at the center and what they are without Fight Club is the core. One of the neat things about this film is seeing it a second town makes it even better. The mental byplay between Pitt and Norton increases tension to explosiveness. If you want to see what can happen to a story when put in masterful hands, read the book (which is outstanding), and see the movie. They show that art forms can treat the same material, each in their own ways.",Fight Club
5,Horst_In_Translation,Solid character study and a good performance from Norton,6,24 February 2015,"""Fight Club"" is an Academy Award nominated (sound effects) movie from roughly 15 years ago starring Edward Norton (a two-time Academy award nominee at under 30), Brad Pitt, Meat Loaf and Helena Bonham Carter. It's possibly the most famous movie from director David Fincher, although it's far from his best in my opinion. That does not mean it's a bad film. Not at all. However, many of the characters are simply way over the top that the film always is in danger of surpassing the fine line of entertainment and ridiculousness. It's based on a Palahniuk novel and the script comes from Jim Uhls, who had a surprisingly insignificant career after coming up with the words for this cult film.The dialogs are witty and almost too hip occasionally. It's not a film for easily offended people as it tends to be vulgar at times and the violence is graphic frequently, although that is certainly not a surprise for a film titled ""Fight Club"". In general, it's a pretty insane film, most of the time in a good way. The fact that two characters visit meetings of dying people, so they can feel better says it pretty much all already. I clearly preferred Norton over Pitt here and it is self-explanatory that Pitt did not get a single awards nomination for his work here. He becomes pretty much a caricature at times. Then again, his character does not really exist, so this can be used as some kind of apology I guess. The final plot twist comes unexpected and reminded me of the one in ""The Usual Suspects"", only that the main character is still unaware of his true identity. By the way, Norton looked pretty much the same age in this film as now 15 years later when he scored another Academy Award nomination for his work in a Best Picture winner.The ending was pretty great though and I liked how, with the disappearance of Pitt after the gunshot, we finally see also the darker side of Norton's character when he and Bonham Carter's character watch the explosions. But how did that gunshot do so little damage? Did the pain make Pitt's character go away? Anyway, ""Fight Club"" is a good movie. Not one of my personal favorites, but an entertaining 140 minutes, during which it almost never drags. One of my favorite scenes was near the end at the police station when he gets interrogated and almost emasculated. That was pretty funny there. Recommended.",Fight Club
6,classicsoncall,"""We have front row seats for this theater of mass destruction"".",8,26 August 2011,"There's a not so subtle irony in the premise of this picture that managed to intrude on my consciousness about the time I learned about Strinne green stripe patterns. Society's obsession with material goods has a dehumanizing effect on the individual, leading some to destructive behavior in an attempt to rid the shackles of mindless adherence to a herd mentality. Whenever this idea is presented in a commercial venture however, it itself falls victim to a form of circular logic. The success of the film depends on it's ability to denigrate itself as a form of commercial enterprise or achievement. The same can be said of the principal players; I highly doubt that Brad Pitt or Ed Norton go around bemoaning the fact that their wealth is somehow an obstacle to their self worth as human beings. There's an element of hypocrisy in all this, but I won't begrudge the actors or director for their part in it. They're trying to make a statement in a unique way, and often have to deliver a punch to the gut to get there.By the way, if you're paying attention, a clue to the identity of the narrator comes early when Tyler Durden (Pitt) opines on his views of life and mentions those same Strinne green stripe patterns. That line jarred me about as much as it did Ed Norton's character; the look on his face at that moment betrayed a moment of introspection that would be revealed at the end of the story. That was actually a clever clue planted by director Fincher, because the odds of two different people coming up with the exact same concept about home furnishing options defies probability.The troubling aspect about the film, aside from it's message however, is the glorification it seems to convey upon a youth culture bent on a form of self destruction. You see it in the copy cat rise of actual fight clubs in the wake of the picture, along with other forms of physical mayhem like extreme wrestling. One doesn't absorb the pain in real life quite as nobly as Tyler did while mocking the garage owner. But I guess some will only learn the hard way.Hey, did you catch that newspaper clipping that mentioned the street violence that was occurring after the fight club concept gained prominence - 'Missing Monkeys Found Shaved'. I wonder if there were twelve of them.",Fight Club
7,lee_eisenberg,This is what great movies are all about!,10,21 October 2005,"In the grand scheme of things, ""Fight Club"" is less about a group of people who like to fight than about how the commercialism inherent in our society drives people over the edge. The unnamed narrator (Edward Norton) joins up with soap-maker Tyler Durden (Brad Pitt) to found Project Mayhem, whose goal is to undermine everything corporate. Part of their modus operandi involves starting fistfights. But at some point, the narrator realizes that it's going too far...and he's helpless to stop the madness.""Fight Club"" was certainly one of the best movies of 1999. Not just because it was a full-scale indictment of commercialism, but also because the acting, script and direction are all top-notch. This movie is one of the best examples of a modern classic.",Fight Club
8,jboothmillard,Fight Club,7,19 April 2006,"From director David Fincher (Alien³, Se7en, Panic Room) this is a very inventive film with some strong violence, great acting and cool twists. Basically The Narrator/Jack (Edward Norton) is the office employee loser suffering severe insomnia, and he starts visiting therapy groups to get some attention from people, all for illnesses he doesn't have, apparently helping him sleep. Then he meets ""tourist Marla Singer (Helena Bonham Carter) who is almost the same. Later, on a plane, he meets soap salesman Tyler Durden (Brad Pitt) who as time goes by becomes a good friend and companion. One day, Tyler asks Jack to hit him as hard as he can, and this inspires them to create their own therapy group, Fight Club, where men can express themselves through extreme violence. Tyler has built up groups of faithful followers from the club, and they soon indulge in anarchic and destructive activities to basically kill commercialism. Jack realises the extent of Tyler's power and doesn't want to be part of it, but the big revelation will be Tyler's true person, he is Jack's alter ego who has been acting through Jack. Also starring singer Meat Loaf as Robert 'Bob' Paulson, Zach Grenier as Richard Chesler, Richmond Arquette as Intern and Terminator 3's David Andrews as Thomas. The iconic moments are Jack fighting himself in front of his boss, and the fights between Jack and Tyler (or technically just himself). It was nominated for the Oscar for Best Sound Effects Editing. Brad Pitt was number 15 on The 100 Greatest Movie Stars, he was number 5 on The 100 Greatest Sex Symbols, Pitt was also number 52 on The 100 Greatest Pop Culture Icons, and Helena Bonham Carter was number 41, and Pitt number 30 on The World's Greatest Actor, Carter was also number 13 on The 50 Greatest British Actresses, and the film was number 36 on Film 4's 50 Films To See Before You Die. Very good!",Fight Club
9,ccthemovieman-1,Sordid Flick That AppealsTo Young Crowd,5,14 March 2006,"Like ""The Sixth Sense,"" this is a film that has such a surprise ending that one almost needs to go back and see this again, from a different perspective. I can't say more without having to provide spoilers.This is a sick movie but I found it interesting in a perverse way. I am sorry so many young people love this movie so much because sordid and sleazy stories should not be so appealing.On the positive side, what I found most interesting was:(1) Pitt's character is totally without God but some of things he says about materialism sound really Biblical in nature. They were fascinating comments. (2) This film is stylishly-shot, a nice movie if you appreciate visuals as I do. (3) Edward Norton's narration was excellent.The characters in here are not clean-cut, high-ideal role models, to say the least. That includes Helena Bonham Carter's role in here. I couldn't take any of these people on the first viewing, but when a profanity filter was invented, I gave this another shot and the rating of the film was elevated from a 3 to a 6.5. Still, even with a filter, this is a bit too sleazy for middle-aged oldies like me. A sad comment that ""nasty"" seems to be so appealing to kids these days.",Fight Club
10,rmax304823,Rebels without a cause.,5,1 October 2007,"It's very impressive visually, nicely directed, well acted, scripted in a literate way, and immeasurably depressing.I suppose the plot has been covered in detail elsewhere so I'll keep it brief. The narrator (Edward Norton)is a bored, anomic insomniac who doesn't know why he's alive. He runs into a creepy and insulting babe (Helena Bonham Carter) who seems to care about nothing. Then he meets a brutally honest Tyler Durden (Brad Pitt) who seems to see through everything and everyone, who actively hates and engages in combat against modern ennui and phoniness, and things start to pop. Pitt and the narrator found Fight Club in which men who would otherwise be leading lives of quiet desperation get to pound the crap out of one another. Fight Club franchises spring up everywhere as men search for their lost cojones. Pitt becomes a cult leader and wages war against corporate art with homemade explosives. The upshot of all this, I won't reveal.I didn't like it at all. At first I thought it was going to turn into one of those Gallic philosophical conundrums with a lot of pointless non sequiturs in the foreground. (Narrator: Is Tyler Durden in my dream? Or am I in his?"") Then it appeared to morph into an excuse for more bloodshed and violence. And then it got really twisted. I never realized a guy could shoot off a large-caliber pistol in his mouth and carry on a normal conversation five minutes later.It will, I suppose, be claimed that this is an original -- in contrast to the formulaic rubbish ground out by Hollywood these days. True enough, but it's not all THAT original. Proving your masculinity by enduring punishment? Is there a Rambo movie in which Stallone doesn't bleed, or get himself dipped in pig excrement, or electrocuted half to death, without flinching? In the stockade, in James Jones' ""From Here to Eternity,"" the guards treat the inmates with unspeakable brutality. So what do the prisoners do to prove their transcendance of authority? They beat hell out of each other, in games, in ways that the guards wouldn't have the imagination to dream up. Not to mention a hundred movies about The Big House and POWs and slaves biting their tongues during whippings.The punishment within the group is only part of the story, of course. It leads to a consideration of secret cults and their desire to rid the world of credit cards. We've had that before too, with Charlie Manson and the Reverend Jim Jones. And if Tyler Durden is going to insult the narrator by calling him ""Ikea Boy"", and if the group is going to assault society by demolishing icons like Starbucks, don't they have some kind of obligation to provide more constructive icons? Shouldn't they have some sense of beauty, truth, and logic that takes them beyond moral nihilism? Or is the movie actually saying that Western civilization SHOULD be destroyed? The film is ugly to watch, partly because the message itself is so banal, and partly because the imagery is so repulsive. The back of somebody's head is blown off. Human fat is boiled down to make soap. Fight Club members lives in an abandoned house near a toxic waste dump amid unutterable squalor. They don't seem to change clothes. (The narrator shows up for work at his office with his own blood on his shirt.) They don't bathe. Brad Pitt shuffles around in a filthy bathrobe wearing a pair of lady's slippers with clotted fur around the tops, as Doris Day might appear during a trip on battery acid. It isn't that I find such voluntarism necessarily bad. I'm sitting here writing this, wearing only a sarong and a pair of eyeglasses in the middle of the desert. But doesn't bodily filth reach a point at which it becomes intolerable to the self, never mind the person you're trying to sell your homemade soap to? Mostly, though, what a beastly message. If you want to swagger around, a member of a cult, dealing out summary punishment to those whose values aren't your own, why not join Blackwater or some other mercenary group and at least get paid more than one thousand dollars a day. Or if you really want to get in your face with respect to bourgeois verities, give away everything you have and serve soup to the homeless at St. Anthony's Dining Room. Or vote Libertarian? Or become a Theravada Buddhist monk, earning merit and living on alms? I guess, though, that nothing like that is going to get your testosterone pumping and that's what concerns this movie. Know when blood testosterone levels peak in men? During late adolescence, when our fantasies are even more limited than our brain power.",Fight Club
11,BA_Harrison,Scrappy.,5,31 January 2016,"After whinging to his doctor about his insomnia, a frustrated office worker (Edward Norton, whose character is simply called The Narrator) is advised to attend a support group for testicular cancer to see what real suffering is like; there, he experiences an emotional release that finally allows him to get some much needed shut-eye. Consequently, The Narrator becomes addicted to support groups, feigning illness to attend, but the appearance of another such 'tourist', Marla Singer (Helena Bonham Carter), makes him feel awkward about his dishonesty, and he once again struggles to sleep.While flying home from a business trip, The Narrator strikes up a conversation with travelling soap salesman Tyler Durden (Brad Pitt). The pair part company at the airport, but when The Narrator discovers that his apartment has been blown up in a freak accident, he calls the number on Durden's business card. The guys meet up and strike up an unlikely friendship which sees The Narrator discovering another solution to his sleep issues: bare knuckle bouts with Durden. Eventually, other guys looking for a release from their mundane existences join in the fun, and Fight Club is born.For a film dealing with ***Spoiler Alert!!!*** dual personality, it seems only fitting that I'm in two minds about Fight Club.I appreciated the sentiment that 'you are not your job, you're not how much money you have in the bank, you are not the car you drive, you're not the contents of your wallet', but disliked the script/story as a whole, which is full of contrivances, inconsistencies and quasi-intellectualism.I loved the dark humour and the brutality of the fight scenes (although cannot accept for one minute that men would line up to be beaten to a pulp), but I hated director David Fincher's showy approach to the rest of the film, which is over-reliant on slick CGI trickery (that actually looks very dated by today's standards).I admired Edward Norton's performance, but disliked Pitt's, and hated Bonham Carter's.I hated the silly twist that could be seen a mile away, but was amused by the subliminal image that appears seconds before the end, and enjoyed hearing The Pixies over the closing credits.To reflect my mixed feelings about Fight Club, I give it a middling rating of 5/10.",Fight Club
12,moonspinner55,Scaled like an apocalyptic street-nightmare...,5,24 May 2002,"...but ""Fight Club"" is much more intriguing in its smaller moments, where it finds a surreal, dream-like quality that seems to snake around at will. The film is tough and unyielding in its machismo, and although it is occasionally off-putting, I was never bored watching it. The acting, by Brad Pitt and Edward Norton in particular, is quite good; the two stars have obviously been put through the wringer in their roles, and director David Fincher keeps cranking up the tension and puts us through the wringer as well. But I felt the filmmakers slipped at the final gate, wherein the script concocts a major plot-twist that just doesn't jell, leading everyone to look a little foolish. **1/2 from ****",Fight Club
13,dbdumonteil,The things you own ends up owning you.,10,27 September 2001,"What's fascinating in David Fincher's work,is that it seems we deal with an auteur.He created his own universe,a nocturnal and filthy one,and a bit misogynous too:it's glaring in this movie;outside Bonham-Carter-made look ugly and dressed as a 1977 punk-,only a black woman has a line to say.Almost everywhere,it is a man's man's world where no women appear even in the settings.This movie was influenced by famous and not-so-famous predecessors:of course ""Dr Jekill and Mister Hide"" to which Bonham Carter hints at in the restaurant,""a clockwork orange"" ,""rebel without a cause"" ""bad influence"" and Joel Schumacher's ""falling down"",the latter seems with hindsight to have been overlooked and underrated.So why does this movie seem so original?it owes a lot to E.Norton (more than Pitt)who had already overshadowed R.Gere in ""primal fear"".Here he plays a very strange kind of peeping tom:watching mental suffering (therapy groups ,dealing almost essentially with male problems),then physical sufferings,eventually enduring them.Does he do that as he would opt for yoga,Buddhism or psychotherapy,to escape from a routine work?To get free from the material world?As Pitt says ""the things you...""The problem is that Norton does not seem to be so free.At first,he may be, when he's only a simple spectator-and the scenes in the restaurant and in the projection room are peaks of black humor-,but,he's potentially a Stevensonian hero.There's a big coup de theatre in this movie, a breathtaking and unexpected twist ,à la ""sixth sense"" ,""Jacob's ladder"" or"" Usual suspects"" ,and it's difficult to comment this movie :all you say is questioned when you KNOW.Of course I won't reveal it,but I think it's the biggest flaw of the movie.Unlike the three mentioned works,this does not seem logical,because of the lack of ""clues"":the only one ,regarding Bonham-Carter, is not really convincing.The last picture seems now terrifying.",Fight Club
14,blanche-2,Quite an accomplishment,10,2 September 2010,"Brad Pitt and Edward Norton are in the ""Fight Club,"" a 1999 film directed by David Fincher and written by Jim Uhls. The movie also stars Helena Bonham Carter, Meat Loaf, and Zach Grenier.Edward Norton is Jack, the Narrator of the film (though there is some controversy over his name). Tired of his job, his life, and his boss, he finds great satisfaction by attending group sessions for alcoholics, drug addicts,compulsive gamblers, compulsive eaters, cancer victims, etc. He soon encounters another group groupie, the bizarre Marla Singer (Carter), and realizes that when she's in a group with him, he has no release of his feelings. So the two make a deal and split up the meetings and the nights they attend.When Jack returns from a trip, his apartment is in flames. With nowhere to go, he calls a man he met on the plane, Tyler Durden, and goes to live with him in an old, decrepit, filthy house. The two soon become involved in forming an underground Fight Club, where Jack finds the release he seeks, learns who he is as a man, and develops assertiveness and courage.Okay, like ""Mulholland Drive,"" that's the story on the surface, but the film isn't really about what was described above. It's a complicated, dark, violent story about tearing down superficial values, ripping into rampant consumerism, and really feeling and living instead of existing.""Fight Club"" starts off as quite funny, actually, with Jack and Marla arguing over who's going to the prostate cancer meeting, and becomes progressively darker, stranger, and faster as it races to a surprising ending. Unfortunately for me, it took me too long to see the film, so the ending wasn't such a surprise. I would have loved to experience the full impact of it.The performances from Norton, Pitt, and Carter are fabulous. All three are shown to their absolute best advantage. Norton for some reason is always a little underrated. He does a beautiful job. Carter years ago made a seamless transition from ingénue to leading lady, and this, like Mrs. Lovett in Sweeney Todd, is more of a character role.""Fight Club"" is horrific to watch in parts because of the violence, but it's worth getting through it to see a truly masterful film.",Fight Club

The movie circles around a man (a usual great performance by Ed Norton, who plays this man but is only know as narrator) who has a dead-end job and life until he meets a man played by Tyler Durden (played well by Brad Pitt) who convinces him that the best way to live is to beat each other senseless.  Soon a club starts, and a type of fascist society of fighting men are abound.  This film takes many turns, many odd ones at that, but it is cool, action packed, and sometimes even funny.

Their concept catches on, with underground ""fight clubs"" forming in every town - until a sensuous and mysterious woman (Helena Bonham Carter) comes between the two men and ignites an out-of-control spiral toward oblivion."" Meatloaf again. As you'll discover, the film's official synopsis isn't even remotely correct; but, it's a good way to ""sell"" ""Fight Club"". This film is violent and *pornographic* - this is a WARNING - but, except for Jared Leto's silly putty face make-up, the cast cleans up well. The beatings are brutal, but help make the film's point, and are a part of the protagonist's madness.

Or, it could be about something else...To Be a Man.The film received an ""Academy Award"" nomination for the ""Sound Effects"" by Richard Hymns and Ren Klyce (beaten by the first ""Matrix"" and the latest ""Star Wars""). ""Fight Club"" is excellent in many ways, but isn't (and shouldn't be) as polished a ""production"" as 1999's big winner, ""American Beauty"" - a film which opened simultaneously, and presented critics with more palpable male angst.

These matches are bare chested and with bare knuckles. The fighters beat the living crap out of each other until one yells stop. Durden is credited with starting fight clubs across the nation; and eventually turns the clubs into aggression laden pranksters releasing their malice on corporate America.Brutal violence and strong language is to be expected along with some pretty graphic images.

The movie was based on the 1996 novel of the same name by Chuck Palahniuk.It was directed by David Fincher.The story involves a nameless narrator(Norton),who happens to be a traveling automobile company employee who suffers from insomnia. His doctor refuses to give him medication and advises him to visit a support group to witness more severe suffering. The narrator attends a support group for testicular cancer victims and, after fooling them into thinking that he is a fellow victim, finds an emotional release that relieves his insomnia. He becomes addicted to attending support groups and pretending to be a victim, but the presence of another impostor, Marla Singer,played by Helena Bonham Carter,disturbs him, so he negotiates with her to avoid their meeting at the same groups.After a flight home from a business trip, the narrator finds his apartment destroyed by an explosion. He calls Tyler Durden (Pitt), a soap salesman whom he befriended on the flight, and they meet at a bar. A conversation about consumerism leads to Tyler inviting the narrator to stay at his place; outside the bar he requests that the narrator hit him. The two engage in a fistfight, and the narrator subsequently moves into Tyler's dilapidated house. They have further fights outside the bar, and these attract a crowd of men. The fighting moves to the bar's basement where the men form a ""fight club"".Marla overdoses on pills and telephones the narrator for help; he ignores her, but Tyler answers the call and saves her. Tyler and Marla become sexually involved, and Tyler warns the narrator never to talk to Marla about him. More fight clubs form across the country, and under Tyler's leadership, they become the anti-materialist and anti-corporate organization called ""Project Mayhem"". The narrator complains to Tyler that he wants to be more involved in the organization, but Tyler suddenly disappears. When a member of Project Mayhem is killed by the police during a botched sabotage operation, the narrator tries to shut down the project, and follows evidence of Tyler's national travels to track him down. In one city, a Project member greets the narrator as Tyler Durden. The narrator calls Marla from his hotel room and discovers that Marla also believes him to be Tyler. He suddenly sees Tyler Durden in his room, and Tyler explains that they are dissociated personalities in the same body. Tyler controls the narrator's body when the narrator is asleep.The narrator blacks out after the conversation. When he wakes, he discovers from his telephone log that Tyler made calls during his blackout. He uncovers Tyler's plans to erase debt by destroying buildings that contain credit card companies' records. The narrator tries to contact the police but finds that the officers are members of the Project. He attempts to disarm explosives in a building, but Tyler subdues him and moves to a safe building to watch the destruction. The narrator, held by Tyler at gunpoint, realizes that in sharing the same body with Tyler, he himself is actually holding the gun. He fires it into his mouth, shooting through the cheek without killing himself. Tyler collapses with an exit wound to the back of his head, and the narrator stops mentally projecting him. Afterward, Project Mayhem members bring a kidnapped Marla to him, believing him to be Tyler, and leave them alone. The explosives detonate, collapsing the buildings, and the narrator and Marla watch the scene, holding hands.The story of the film involves the audience for intelligence and provocation of thoughts about the story's themes on manhood.Also,the nature of this film is something that is far from traditional but it still makes it a great film and arguably one of the best films released in history. Aside from that,the performances of Pitt and Norton were simply outstanding.It truly deserves its place in the top 20 of IMDb.",Fight Club

20,Theo Robertson,So Pretentious . So Overblown . So Overrated,5,12 February 2003,"!!!! POSSIBLE SPOILERS !!!!!The premise of a lonely aimless soul attending cancer therapy groups and AA meetings might have been savagely funny if done right but here it`s badly executed as the first 20 minutes is taken up with Ed Norton droning on in an over literary voice over . I know a cinematic masterwork like APOCALYPSE NOW used voice over but so did THE DUKES OF HAZZARD so it`s just as likely to be the work of a buffoon than a genius . The themes of male grief , alienation and the back lash against 80s consumerism are just as badly developed 
FIGHT CLUB is good in parts like the scene where the members cover a car park with bird seed so that the pigeons s*hit all over the new cars , but the film is unworthy of the praise lavished upon it by large sections of IMDB voters . I can imagine 17 year old males loving this film - I`d be shocked if they didn`t - but for anyone else who`s old enough to have more mature and critical views should be able to recognise this as one extremely overlong overrated one trick pony . As for the metaphysical twist ending it just doesn`t make sense and brings the whole proceedings down . The narrator was beating himself up was he ? Yeah right .If FIGHT CLUB is the masterpiece  it`s supposed to be then how come it was virtually ignored at the Oscars in one of the weakest years for films in a long time ?",Fight Club
21,LeonLouisRicci,Wretched and Unforgivable,1,3 October 2013,"This is one of the most Unpleasant Films you are likely to see. Making you Squirm is perhaps one of its 'Charms"" and part of what makes it a Teen Favorite.This is an Ugly Thing, both in Tone and the way it Looks. It starts out with a lot of Unsightly Stuff. Like the Victim Self-Help Meetings where we have to look at a Homely Woman, about to Die, looking to ""just get laid one more time before it ends"" and Meat Loaf with Huge Man-Breasts drooping to his waste being hugged by Ed Norton while exchanging Affection and Sweat.That's just the beginning. It gets a lot more Repulsive as things go along their Merry Way. We have the Central Conceit and Title of the Movie, that Place where Lonely Guys meet to Beat and Bond. Then things really get out of hand with a Zombie Squad and a lot of Speechifying about the Evils of Capitalism, Consumerism, and Zen Stuff like ""when you own your possessions they own you"" and other Well Worn Witicisims that might have been Insightful a Thousand Years Ago.If you are a Fan of those Bare Knuckle Cage Matches, Guy Ritchie Movies, Neo-Nazis, or Anarchists Anonymous, this may be Entertaining. But it can also be a Pseudo-Intellectual, Inane, Disturbing Diatribe that is not Cathartic, just a Vile, Witless Waste, Pretending to be an Ultra-Cool, Post-Modern Philosophical Guidepost for the New Millennium. The Film is Objectionable, Hideous, Unsightly, Overrated, Trashy, Dumbed-Down, Unforgivable, and Absolutely Awful.

23,zardoz-13,"""Fight Club"" is the main event of the millennium!",10,17 September 2008,"""Fight Club"" is a knock-out! Brad Pitt and Edward Norton star and spar in this bizarre but insightful bare-knuckled, no-holds-barred pugilistic parable. ""Fight Club"" takes some mighty savage but satirical swings at consumerism, anarchy, and male impotence. ""Se7en"" & Alien 3"" director David Fincher delivers another of his kinetically super-charged, darkly lensed, adrenaline-laced epics about guys gelded by a gilded society who come to life when they stain their fists with blood. Penned by ""Jumper"" scenarist Jim Uhls from Chuck Palahniuk's first novel, ""Fight Club"" appears to glorify violence, promote fascism, and degrade women. Instead, ""Fight Club"" denigrates the first, shows contempt for the second, and give Helen Bonham Carter her juiciest role in years.""Fight Club"" spins a yarn every bit as audacious, manipulative and exhilarating as Fincher's earlier opus ""The Game."" Edward Norton of ""Rounders"" serves as our narrator for this 140-minute marathon that goes the distance. Caged in a dead end job, Norton files reams of car accident statistics for a major automaker. Essentially, he must calculate when the best interests of the company are served by paying off car crash survivors rather than demanding a recall. Anyway, he flies everywhere to inspect these wrecks and begins to suffer from more than occupational jet lag.Inevitably, our anonymous narrator turns into a depressed white-collar insomniac. Lack of sleep drives him to the hospital. Incredibly, his doctor refuses to give him any drugs. He suggests instead that our narrator attend a support group for survivors of testicular cancer so that he can appreciate what constitutes real pain. Surprisingly, Norton discovers that he can purge himself emotionally without fear of humiliation. Afterward, his burden sloughed off, he goes home to his luxuriously appointed condo, hits the sack and sleeps like a baby. Franz Kafka couldn't have captured the malaise of modern society as crisply as Jim Uhls has in ""Fight Club."" Soon our unnamed narrator begins to gleefully orchestrate his life around these 12-step meetings and support groups for habits and diseases that he doesn't have. He is hooked and happy about until Marla Singer (Helen Bonham Carter of ""Hamlet"") spoils these gatherings. He knows that she is a fraud and fears she will expose him. They snarl at each other but call a truce and form an uneasy alliance. They will alternate nights at different groups so they won't collide with each other.Marla poses few problems compared with Tyler Durden (Brad Pitt), a mysterious maverick of a man encountered by our hero during a bumpy plane ride. Durden epitomizes cool; he has everything our narrator lacks. Self-assured, scruffily clad, with all the hypnotic charm of a snake, Durden lurks around the narrator. Tyler attracts followers like a magnet. After an unknown arsonist destroys our narrator's condo, he hooks up with Tyler. They create ""Fight Club,"" a form of underground tough man boxing.Remember ""Every Which Way But Loose,"" with Clint Eastwood or Charles Bronson in ""Hard Times?"" They fight in dark, dank basements. Fincher pulls no punches when the combatants start swinging at each other. Quite simply, these fights are brutal, especially when a pretty boy (Jared Leto of ""Urban Legend"") is battered to a pulp until he resembles the elephant kid. Only the knuckle-headed will exit ""Fight Club"" looking for an excuse to scrap. The friendship between Tyler and our hero takes some wildly out-of-control turns. Tyler takes ""Fight Club"" to other cities, and then movies to the next level with ""Project Mayhem,"" a demolitionist's fantasy that involves destroying credit card corporations. Our hero balks at Tyler's outlandish aims and the mindless, skin-headed idiots that he recruits for his cause. But it isn't until the third act, so to speak, when ""Fight Club"" decks you with a shocking revelation: Tyler Durden may not be who we think he is.""Fight Club"" will send some audiences reeling in disgust at its sicko shenaniganslike when Durden urinates in the soap at an expensive restaurant where he waits tables. Don't ask what he puts in the clam chowder. When Tyler works as a projectionist at a movie theatre, he splices frames of male genitalia into family movies! If you cannot handle a film poling fun at you, you probably won't appreciate some of the subversive humor. Twentieth Century Fox appears to have gone out of its way to sanitize ""Fight Club,"" but Fincher is such a good director that his visuals contain more bite than his narrative. Like in ""The Game,"" where Michael Douglas' snotty rich guy had to run a grueling gauntleta present of sorts for the man who has everything""Fight Club"" lowers the boom on hypocrisy. The Uhls script brims with several snappy and quotable one-liners.""Fight Club"" will strike some people as pretty strange, too. Any movie that never reveals its hero's name, especially when he provides the narration, is probably too pretentious for its own good. ""Fight Club"" emerges as an abrasive movie, and Fincher digs his satirical claws in deep. We live in a media jungle, and ""Fight Club"" smirks at the notion that we would want to destroy it to return to lives of quiet destitution. With ""Fight Club,"" Fincher matches anything that Stanley Kubrick helmed in his prime and shows Terry Gilliam a trick or two.""Fight Club"" is the main event of the millennium.",Fight Club
24,grantss,Superb,10,19 April 2014,"Superb, and truly one of the greatest movies of all time.It starts with the screenplay. Adapted from, and very faithful to, an excellent book. The book by Chuck Palahniuk was perfect for a movie: vivid, powerful, challenging, original, unpredictable. Considering how perfectly formed the book already was, the screenplay would have been a doddle.Some very interesting themes are explored - consumerism, class warfare, multiple-personality disorder, male bonding, terrorism and anarchy - without being judgemental. Direction is spot-on. Perfect cinematography, pacing and editing. The twists and nuances of the book are captured perfectly.Edward Norton and Brad Pitt are perfectly cast as the two lead characters, and deliver in spades. Helena Bonham Carter is a strange selection to take on the role of Marla, as she tends to act in Shakespearean dramas and other period pieces. However, despite this, her performance is very convincing.An absolute classic.",Fight Club

Movies that have all those elements are rare and often a great and one of a kind movie.Director David Fincher's directing works effective. It gives the movie both style and substance with a lot of depth. The story makes you want to see the movie over and over again, so you can understand and discover some more things on every viewing.Both Edward Norton and Brad Pitt do a great acting job, although I probably wouldn't have picked Pitt as a leading character. His role comes too soon after his in ""Twelve Monkeys"", both the movie and his character show resemblances. Meat Loaf has a fun role as Bob with the big man-breasts.The story is way more different than you would most likely expect. When you are first watching this movie you expect it to be a fight movie with street boxing. This is not the case, ""Fight Club"" is a personal movie in which the main focus lies on the main character and the anti-society message much like in Kubrick's movies was the case.Highly recommendable movie, although not a classic or masterpiece in my book.9/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",Fight Club
26,TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews,"Interesting and unsettling, possibly David's finest hour",10,23 July 2006,"I haven't read the novel, nor do I know how good this is compared to it, but the author has said that this made him ashamed of the book, which can only really be a positive thing in this case. It's quite difficult to comment on this without giving something essential away. Being a fan of David Fincher and having heard nothing but positive reviews for this film, I eventually bought it. Having just finished it, it's hard to determine what to think of it. I had kind of heard the twist already, and I picked up on many of the hints towards it, so that had less(but still some) effect on me... I urge anyone who is even considering watching this to forget everything they've heard about it, look at no promotional material and just get, borrow or rent a copy of it and see it for yourself, without trying to figure out how it's going to end. The plot is intelligent, and very stylishly told. The whole production has an edge to it, but doesn't come off as pretentious. The satire and critique in the movie is smart, but it should perhaps be noted that no arguments are presented for the opposing view. The acting is all excellent. The visuals are slick and often undeniably disturbing. The whole thing has a rather dark tone. The cinematography is grand. The soundtrack fits like a glove for every scene. The dialog is clever and in-your-face. I've heard it said that this inspires anarchy and violence... that may be. But just because art is misunderstood does not mean it should not be made. Creative expression is one of the few things that make man great. Magnificent work, Mr. Fincher... keep it up. 10/10",Fight Club

If fact, it's so much fun that they recruit others into their Fight Club, and other Fight Clubs start up. And then there is a revelation, welcome to a shock disclosure, which makes everything which has gone before a bit difficult to credit. Then there's a bit more, then it's the end.This is pretentious stuff. But because it is so down, dirty and gritty, it has acquired a reputation as being Significant and Important. It isn't. It is definitely moderately entertaining (if seedy and unpleasant), has some good performances and dialogue, and the twist/reveal is effective, but I am somewhat bemused at finding it occupying 10th best film ever as of today's date.It's OK, but overrated.",Fight Club

It stars Edward Norton who hates his job and suffers from insomnia. He attends support groups where he encounters misfit Marla as well as a heavy set individual described as having one testicle. On a plane he meets the mysterious Tyler Durden who manufactures soap, which he uses to make bombs. Violence is their common lust as they invite bystanders into their fight club. Clever and stylish with an ending where facing one's issues takes on a new form. David Fincher's films often involve traumatic events to accept life as seen in his Seven and The Game. Norton is placed between reason and personal detachment. Brad Pitt mixes insane authority with maddening humour. Their concluding showdown is brilliantly filmed but it raises more questions than answers. Helena Bonham Carter plays Marla who has suicidal tendencies and psychotic sexual conquests. Meatloaf plays a brute at a help group who joins the fight club but despite his intensity he fails to understand the consequences of this decision. Jared Leto plays Angel Face, a fellow member whom Norton views as competition for Durden's favor. Extremely violent yet exhilarating social commentary of violence, trauma and mental stability.

He also meets the beautiful and mysterious Marla(played by Helena Bonham Carter) who attends multiple support group meetings like he does, and begins a relationship with both him and Tyler, and as events grow increasingly violent and bizarre, it becomes clear that Tyler and he are closer than viewer at first realized...

He's finally inspired by an unconventional woman he meets at support groups (Helena Bonham Carter) and, especially, a devil-may-care guy who lives on the outskirts of town (Brad Pitt). They start an underground club where men get together and vent their frustrations by beating the crap out of each other.""Fight Club"" (1999) has a huge reputation as a stylish cult flick and is often ranked with the greatest films ever made. The first half is entertaining enough, both quirky and amusing; and I like the interesting themes explored: Escaping the maternal and material, being a slave to advertising, rebelling against life-stifling conformity, being a blind follower of a charismatic leader, finding your inner wild-man, Dr. Jekyll & Mr. Cool, the nature of lawless ""revolutionaries"" (which is too reminiscent of ANTIFA thugs), the struggle with homosexuality interpretation, etc.That's all highly commendable. Unfortunately, the second half isn't compelling. I sat there bored and couldn't wait for it to end. ""Donnie Darko"" (2001) had the same problem - promising set-up with clever ideas, but a tedious wrap-up. Meanwhile the twist that everyone gushes over is actually underwhelming and not very surprising, although it's relatively interesting.Moreover, watching guys get radically beat up is only entertaining a couple times; after that it gets redundant. Speaking of which, how exactly does bare-knuckled fighting inspire or enlighten? Does it really help one's life to have missing teeth, black eyes and other assorted injuries? Of course the movie doesn't emphasize the long-lasting negative effects of regular brawling. Have you ever met a brawler, boxer or professional football player in his 50s with the perpetual aches & pains?Cult flicks like ""Pulp Fiction"" (1994) deserve the praise and stand the test of time; this one disappoints mainly due to the curiously dull second half. But it's genius on the metaphorical level no doubt.The film is overlong at 2 hours, 19 minutes, and was shot in Los Angeles.GRADE: B-",Fight Club

32,Sylviastel,Ed Norton's Brilliant!,8,19 February 2011,"I have to save that this film is entertaining to watch and can be seen multiple times. To me, the twist in the film wasn't a shock. This film is meant to be shocking and a revolution even in the minds of the general public. This film could be used to examine society where men get together and perform fights in order to prove themselves. The fight club becomes one man's obsession and way of life even leading to anarchy, destruction, and illegal activities trying to break away from the dread of life itself. The narrator played by Ed Norton is played brilliantly. He comes across as the average every guy in a dead end job, unhappy, miserable, and seeking a purpose in life by going to support groups for diseases and conditions that he doesn't have in life. It is Helena Bonham Carter's chain smoking character, Marla Singer, that comes into his life to further cause havoc and destruction. He needs reality of others but not another fake member like Singer in his groups to convey his need of belonging and self worth. I could go on but I think you get it. Brad Pitt does also a fine job in his role. The script has some holes in it but it's well done and entertaining.",Fight Club
33,Mr-Fusion,Clearly I'm not in the target audience,4,11 February 2016,"It's been a good 15 years since I've seen ""Fight Club"", and it never really did anything for me back then (well there is that ""gotcha!"" ending, but that's about all that stuck in my brain). Now, at 35, it does even less. It's not that I don't ""get"" the movie, but I'm leaving that door open just for argument sake.It's mostly a middle finger to the establishment, gift-wrapped for adolescents. Usually, when a movie's satirizing something, it's engaging, maybe even funny. But by the time Brad Pitt says ""The things you own end up owning you"", it's obnoxious. I got that this is railing against consumerism, desk-jockey angst, ennui, whatever you want to call it (hell, the bursts of '90s CGI drove that point home with a battering ram), but when these people keep yammering on about it, subtlety's a distant memory.

Intense with incredible yellow stained darkness throughout and brilliant performances from Brad Pitt and Helena Bonham Carter. Edward Norton is more subdued but this is intended and although his part is central and the largest, he is supposed to better represent the viewer. Apart from the nightmare sets there is the amazingly effective choreography of the fight scenes. Often hard to watch, the combination of fear and horror with a degree of sublime ecstasy creates an undoubted frisson. This becomes increasingly worrying, however, the deeper we get into the apparent organisation of something too big to control. Writer Palahniuk s probably one of the most imaginative, but concerning, talents today and this is a near faultless interpretation of his work. Its just that this level of nihilism is very hard to enjoy.",Fight Club
35,namashi_1,"A Cult Film, lacking universal appeal....",4,2 February 2010,"David Fincher's screen adaptation of the 1996 novel of the same name by Chuck Palahniuk, 'Fight Club' was a box office debacle when released, but has gained a cult following over the years. In my opinion, this 'zany' film caters to a niche audience.'Fight Club' is weird & abstract. Not every cine-lover will understand what's going on, especially the climax, which is very confusing. Honestly, Some films are meant to be made & 'Fight Club' is one of those films. It doesn't matter who praises or hates it, it's just there.Fincher is a accomplished genius of a filmmaker. His body of work is simply remarkable. I am fan, indeed! Jeff Cronenweth's Cinematography stands out. Acting wise, Edward Norton steals the show with a winning performance. This is amongst his finest works. Helena Bonham Carter is fantastic, as always. Brad Pitt's performance has potential.On the whole 'Fight Club' is undoubtedly the wackiest novel-turned-into a film. Reccmended to all!",Fight Club
36,StevePulaski,"Broke two rules writing this, but it was worth it",9,8 July 2011,"Fight Club's tagline is probably one of my favorites and boasts a great question in the world today; ""how much can you know about yourself if you've never been in a fight?"" Never being in a ""true"" fight, I suppose I, myself, and a lot of others don't know their physical strength, their limitations, and abilities under the given circumstances in a real scuffle. When will you call ""uncle?"" When will the anger consume you? When will you bleed out? Let's not talk about it.Being requested by many people to watch this film, why I put it off is something I can't answer. I believe it was because I feared since the film is filled with morals and very subtle messages I would not ""get"" most of it. Out of the countless number of morals Fight Club spat at me, I took two and would like to share them.The number one thing I took out of Fight Club is that men have become sort of ""softies"" in the world we live in, and many no longer sport the ""tough as nails"" image women mistake us for. Here we have an insomniac who loses direction in life, becomes what some will call ""insane,"" and escapes to an underground fighting club where men beat the living hell out of each other for absolutely no reason, no questions asked. I think it's because beating each other to a pulp makes them feel like they still sport this image, and that they haven't gotten soft. They can take a lot of damage, unnecessary and necessary.The other thing is sometimes the worst enemy can be your best friend or yourself. Writing a spoiler free review of this film is difficult, and explaining this moral without stating an example is hard as well. I really don't want to give anything away just to explain the moral I picked up, so I won't. Just go into the movie with that in the back of your mind.On with the plot, our main character, also the narrator, is played by Edward Norton. He remains nameless throughout the entire film, and works as an automobile company employee. He suffers from serve insomnia, often having trouble dictating what is real and what is fake. Director David Fincher describes his character as an ""everyman."" To cope with his insomnia, and forbidden any sort of treatment from his doctor, the man continues to visit support groups. He does this to feel better about himself, and to witness others with more serve problems. He is an impostor at every one of these groups, and creates a fake name for each.Another impostor attends these groups named Marla Singer (Bonham Carter) much to the dismay of our narrator. They talk to each other and work out a deal so that their presences at these groups don't coincide with one another.On a flight home from a meeting, the narrator meets Tyler Durden (Pitt), a soap salesman. They talk at a bar after the narrator returns home to find his apartment in flames, and Tyler forces the narrator to punch him. They continue to fight in the back of this bar, with more people arriving everyday. They soon find a basement in a building they can use and establish their own ""Fight Club"" to get away from society's troubles.Fight Club is scored very well, and its cinematography is beautiful. Why no Oscar nominations for the much deserved Norton and Pitt? Because of the film's extreme marketing. Disappointing in the field of criticism and revenue, Fight Club's trailers looked as if it were a film about a bunch of people beating the hell out of each other for no reason besides personal satisfaction. There is a market for those movies, but I'm pretty sure unless having read the novel of the same name by Chuck Palahniuk or reading up on the internet about this movie, people who went to go see it, were likely, not aware they were seeing a very smart and beautifully crafted film.Sadly, I was mislead upon watching this movie. So many people, including friends and reviewers on various movie sites, described the film as ""life changing"" and many said it changes one's view of movies forever. It did none of that for me. It entertained me, and some moments I couldn't look away. Even at the most grisly times, Fight Club remains classy and stylistic. But it is no way life changing.But I can totally see how it did for some people. Some people enjoy the occasional ""mind-rape"" style of filmmaking, a style that Fincher is very good at. They love making assumptions, hunches, and usually use large amounts of evidence gained from repeated viewings of some movies. Even video games like The Legend of Zelda have caused a legion of fans to take the world of the game very seriously. I don't have the time to do this, especially to this particular film. I can't see myself enjoying it more and more with repeated viewings. It was very enjoyable the first time around, but I feel the more I watch it the less surprised I'll be at certain events in the film that stunned me (IE: the scene with Lou).The on character relationship between Norton and Pitt is excellent, and can't be replaced at all. The various morals in the film are very well crafted and the movie tackles more genres than one may expect. It's a lot like Kubrick's A Clockwork Orange. Critics deemed it ""dark"" when it first came out, but lived on to become a classic. Fight Club took the same route. I'm sorry I delayed my viewing of it for so long.Starring: Edward Norton, Brad Pitt, and Helena Bonham Carter. Directed by: David Fincher.",Fight Club

I found its message stupid and contradictory - it was a hypocritical film that preached against violence yet was more violent than any other recent films including ""The Matrix"" (which is not quite as realistic as ""Fight Club""). I saw it again on television a few years later and thought it was a bit better and not quite as horrible, but still didn't enjoy it much.However I was convinced into buying the DVD and seeing it again just because it had been rated the 37th best film of all time on IMDb (it's now #41).Well I'm happy to report that I found ""Fight Club"" utterly brilliant on third viewing. Since then I've seen it more than a handful of times on DVD and it just gets better each time. Brad Pitt gives a fantastic performance as one of the coolest cinema icons of all time: Tyler Durden (whose name is a reference to Travis Bickle of ""Taxi Driver"" - according to something I read the first name is harsh, the last name simple and soft).Edward Norton gives an Oscar-worthy performance as The Narrator, ""Jack,"" whose actual name isn't ever truly revealed. (Many people don't seem to notice this.) I won't go into the plot and won't go into a deep analysis because so many other people have done it so well. Suffice to say it IS a very violent movie but I find its style infectious and David Fincher's direction wonderful. It is a brutal and weird film and sometimes it is a bit too pretentious and clever for its own good - I won't lie and say that it's flawless and I totally understand why so many critics bagged on it for being ""a laborious dog"" on its initial release. The British DVD includes a mocking pamphlet where the filmmakers brag about how they all knew it was going to be great from the start and I think this is a bit too masturbatory - the fact that they include critics' negative reviews as a mockery is humorous but childish, and I can understand why some might view ""Fight Club"" as a very childish, contradictory film. (After all, I used to think the same thing.) However I really have come to love it despite its flaws. I think Tyler Durden is one of the absolute coolest characters of all time and Pitt plays him so well it's scary. Norton embodies the Bored Working Repressed Everyman flawlessly. Fincher is great behind the camera.And the film's message strikes a chord nowadays when I watch it - it is a bit contradictory and some of the violence really isn't needed, but then again I'm not going to complain because I've never really cared too terribly much about violence in films so I'm not going to start now.Overall this is one of the most important films of the 1990s and its message was missed by a lot of people (myself included) back in 1999. In a year of some really good movies ""Fight Club"" was probably the best and is one of my all-time favorite films.It's easy to see how this might be considered the next ""Taxi Driver"" thirty years from now.",Fight Club
39,KineticSeoul,One of the most amazing movie based on a novel,9,10 October 2009,"David Fincher did a phenomenal job of reinventing Chuck Palahniuk novel into a near perfect adaptation from novel to film. Edward Norton and Brat Pitt were perfect for there roles and I literally can't think of any other actors that would have been able to pull off the phenomenal performances these 2 great actors were able to do, Brad Pitt was nearly flawless. The unnamed narrator of this movie is a insomniac who is getting sick of his repetitious life style and is looking forward to escape and some seminars seemed to be the answers to his prayer. In till a women named Marla Singer intervenes in his way cause he knows and she knows that they are both faking there illnesses to come to the seminars and thus his insomnia starts up again. Soon the narrator meets up with a very unique and interesting character named Tyler Durden and starts up a fight club to release aggression, and thus the mayhem begins from there and goes about in a clever story. This film stands out from other films in several ways with it's numerous memorable quotes and satire. This is a guy film with it's gritty and violent but modern direction they go about it, which totally kicks a**. The plot twist is one of the greatest in movie history, and at face value it's a thick film, which is testosterone filled and anarchic. This film was crafted very well, and the editing was great. I highly recommend everyone to check this film out.9.5/10",Fight Club
40,OllieSuave-007,Battle your inner-demons movie.,7,28 June 2015,"This is a dark film about insomniac office worker dubbed ""The Narrator"" (Edward Norton) who tells about his life battling his insomnia and joining an underground flight club, lead by street-smart soap salesman Tyler Durden (Brad Pitt) in order to change his gloomy life.The film starts off a little slow with Narrator taking us to a slow, lazy-feel overview of his life and him attending these various support groups. But, the story picks up steam when he meets Tyler Durden, who starts an underground fighting club. The Narrator uses it to changes cure his insomnia and change his life, but Tyler uses it to a more extreme extent to take on corporations and consumerism. These back and forth events take us to an intriguing and unpredictable second half of the movie.Director David Fincher did a nice job capturing a moody but captivating film that draws the audience into the Narrator's life and leaves them guessing at all the turn-of-events, making the plot surprisingly unpredictable. It's more of a story than just a bunch of lonely guys beating each each other up - it's also about battling one's own inner-demons and attempting to free himself. The acting I thought was good - not overly emotional or excited, just right.***minor spoiler ahead*** Much bad influences to society are portrayed here, from street violence to vandalism, from vulgar sex to devilish attitudes, and from anti-consumerism/capitalism to anarchistic intentions. However, there are some redeeming qualities in some of the characters toward the second half of the movie, which I thought cleverly balances out the plot and adds meaning to the ""battle your inner-demons"" element.***minor spoiler ends*** Overall, it's an unique film.

41,Red-Barracuda,High on adrenalin and visually inventive,8,15 September 2011,"This often pretty brutal examination of the male psyche is certainly a very dynamic piece of film-making. David Fincher has to be given a great deal of credit for imbuing his film with an enormous amount of energy and invention. It's a movie infused with adrenalin both thematically and stylistically. So job well done. The two lead actors are massive in contributing to this. Ed Norton supplies the edge, while Brad Pitt the movie star charisma. Both are ideal in their respective roles. There is a wicked sense of humour present throughout the film with a number of very funny moments. While the sense of the bizarre is ever present. This is hardly a realist strand of film-making. Fight Club is a dramatic film that is very fantastical. It doesn't really make it's intentions very clear cut. It leaves you the audience to decide for yourself what you make of it. This no doubt contributed to it's initial failure at the box office. It requires a bit more work from the viewer than most films. But it is also one of those movies that demands to be re-watched; it comes at you from an entirely different angle when you know the outcome in advance. Definitely one of the 90's most original studio releases.",Fight Club
42,Hellmant,10th greatest movie of all time!,10,28 March 2013,"'FIGHT CLUB': Five Stars (Out of Five)Director David Fincher's epic masterpiece is now one of the most beloved movies of all time by film buffs but when it was originally released in theaters it was considered a box office and critical failure. The film was made with a budget of $63 million but grossed just a little over $100 million in it's initial theatrical run. Critics were pretty split on the film with the positive reviews being extremely positive and the negative reviews being extremely negative (which is always the sign of a great movie in my opinion). It was one of the most talked about and controversial films released in 1999 and was heavily criticized for it's violence and (what was seen as) immoral content. The movie went on to be a huge hit on DVD, making it's studio a big profit, and quickly developed a cult following. As it's grown immensely in viewer popularity, since it's release, critics have also changed their tune as well (which is often the case). Many now cite it as a great, ground breaking film and most of it's negative criticisms have all but disappeared. The film is based on the 1996 novel, of the same name, by Chuck Palahniuk. It was adapted for the screen by Jim Uhls and stars Edward Norton, Brad Pitt and Helena Bonham Carter. It tells the story of an unnamed 'everyman' (Norton, who also narrates the film) who works for a traveling automobile company and hates his job. Suffering from depression and severe insomnia he attends several different support groups as a form of relief (pretending to have different problems for each one). He meets a woman, named Marla Singer (Carter), at one who appears to be pulling the same scam. He also meets a soap salesman named Tyler Durden (Pitt), on a flight, and he forms a bizarre relationship with him as well. Durden and our narrator turn to fighting one another at a bar one night as a form of therapy and this later develops into a 'fight club' which attracts a lot of other men with similar problems. 'FIGHT CLUB' was named the 10th greatest movie of all time by Empire magazine readers (in 2008) and also currently claims that same ranking on IMDb's Top 250 movies (voted on by IMDb users). That's about where I'd place it on my 'all time greatest films' list. David Fincher is one of my favorite directors and I'd say it's arguably his best movie (although for me 'THE SOCIAL NETWORK' would be a tough rival). I really liked it when I first saw it in 1999 but I actually, initially, liked a few other films even better that year (like 'DOGMA', 'THE SIXTH SENSE' and 'AMERICAN BEAUTY') but with each viewing I've come to like it even more and I'd now say it's probably my favorite movie of 1999 (as well as one of my top ten favorite films of all time). Anyone who's seen it knows how powerful it is but it holds many different qualities and meanings for each viewer. Without going into the twist and all the different layers to the plot and characters here I'll just say it's a movie that really speaks to me. It did when I first saw it in 1999 and it does even more now. I'd say it's arguably one of the greatest films of all time (and I'm definitely not alone in that viewpoint).Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ne8a_WCFo3A",Fight Club

44,sol-kay,Surrealistic Dreams,8,4 January 2004,"******SPOILERS****** The movie ""Fight Club"" starts off where it's about to end as Jack the narrator, Edward Norton, looking the worst for ware, recites his story that led him up to where it got him to that point.Living the life of a 90's yuppie, enslaved by his job and his material possessions, Jack developed a very bad case of insomnia due to the hours he worked and lifestyle he led that made him go for medical attention. Going to see a doctor for p Jack is told that his insomnia is not the end of the world. If he wants to see real suffering to go to a testicular cancer support group and what he sees and hears from those unfortunates there would make him forget he problems. Taking the doctors advice Jack go to that support group and is struck by the suffering that those inflicted by that terrible disease go through. He develops a friendship with one of the members of that group Big Bob Paulson, Meat loaf, a former body builder. Because of his heavy steroid use Big Bob not only lost his testicles to cancer but his wife and two sons as well as his money. Not only did Jack feel he was doing something constructive, by crying along with Big Bob, it also help him cure his insomnia. Jack started going to all kinds of support groups during his time off from work and tried to help those needing his support. Jack also helped himself by his very giving comfort and help to those that needed it. At the meetings Jack noticed a woman Marla, Helena Bonham Carter, attending the same meetings that he attended. It became obvious to Jack that she was not suffering the traumas, like testicles cancer, that those at the meetings were suffering from. It also made Jack very conscious of himself who was doing the same thing.All this brought Jack's insomnia back with a vengeance and one night he confronted her about being a ""tourist"" and not being honest in attending these group meetings. Coming to a decision with Marla not to attend the same group meetings they both exchange phone numbers to keep in touch. Later on one of Jack many plane trips, that's part of his job, he finds himself sitting next to a very interesting man Tyler Durden, Brad Pitt. Tyler happens to have the exact same suitcase that Jack has. Tyler is everything that Jack wishes he could be; free independent and not stuck up with the yuppie lifestyle that Jack so much wants to get away from but can't. After the plane lands two things happens to Jack that changes his life forever. His suitcase is missing in the baggage department and when he goes home to his high-rise condo he sees that it was blown to pieces by an explosion. This sets the stage that led him to get closer to Tyler and at the same time to get involved with Tyler's pet project the weekly Fight Club matches. These strange events started in the basement of a local bar and also brought Marla back into Jacks life, for better or for worse. The Fight Club matches also revealed something very deep and personal about Jack that was locked deep in his sub-conscious mind; they changed Jack forever in his thoughts and actions. In depth and surrealistic film about couping with the stress of modern life and how the mind works in ways that we can never understand to get us through situations that seem almost impossible to handle. Explosive ending shows how ones suppressed and constrictive mind can become mightier then the sword when it unleashes itself on an unsuspecting public.",Fight Club

so many parts stood out to me as something I've never seen before and found very interesting and memorable. like the chemical burn, his name was Robert Paulsen, smiley face vandalism, car recall formula, rich people soap made of rich people lard, waiting on the porch for three days to get in, touring support groups, starting a fight with a stranger and losing. the garage self-fight scene at the end was so crazy, dark and creepy.possibly the best twist in any film ever. Maybe 30 or so references or hints at the twist. one of the best lines in the movie which references the twist is when he is hitting himself in his boss's office and thinks ""for some reason this reminded me of my first fight with Tyler"" back when he was fighting himself rather than others.one of the deepest and best psychological aspects in a film. from the start of the film to the end, the main character goes through a psychological downward spiral, culminating in one final battle between his original self and alter ego to determine who wins controls of his life. one part I couldn't believe was that ed Norton became completely jealous when he saw Tyler (himself) complementing Jared Letto and becoming close with him. he then beat Letto's face in because he wanted to ""destroy something beautiful."" while he was beating him, he says ""I felt like putting a bullet between the eyes of every Panda that wouldn't screw to save its species.

46,ElMaruecan82,Loved and hated ... for the wrong reasons ...,10,14 July 2011,"Let me tell you something about the 'Fight Club' Paradox, it's the uncommon characteristic of a movie victim of its own contradictions. Basically, if you love it, you hate it. If you hate it, you have enough intelligence to get the genius of the film and love it, but if you love it  see? The movie is stuck in the middle of its own vicious circle.And that's my personal dilemma, I was thrilled by the exhilarating prologue and its sardonic social commentary, then the constitution of the underground 'Fight Club' movement intrigued me, but when the concept became a movement that mobilized more masses, and indoctrinated them through an anti-social movement, and a physical self-improvement that flirted with eugenics, I didn't get it, is fascism the answer to liberalism? Or maybe the movie challenged my intelligence and invited me to question my personal approach to both alienating tendencies, highlighting the danger of one through the consequences of the other, with one hell of a prophetic ending. Maybe  I'll try to put myself in the average viewer's shoes :*** I'm David's witty commentary ***""Your life's a joke, you thank whatever God you believe in every Friday for the opportunity to drown in alcohol all the crappiness that defines your life, you, average generation X office worker, trying to bang the generation Y student. The past is over, and there's no future, so the best you can do is seize the day, the night, and empty your bank account to fill your precious living room with some Swedish nonsensical-trema-named furniture. ""I buy therefore I am"" this is today's Cogito. Marx defined you through your productive value: either you belonged to the working masses, or the exploiting bourgeoisie. Now, the Dow Jones defines you as a member of the spending masses. You're defined by what you consume, what you own, and what you own ends up owing you. You're owned, man!"" *** I'm David's male fantasy ***""You become yourself when you deviate from the model that society dictates to you. The best option is to always take the opposite way. Possession is alienation: stop buying. Self-improvement is masturbation: destroy yourself. Society teaches that fighting and hurting are bad, how can you know yourself if you've never been in a fight? Don't be afraid of blood, scars, pain, these natural scares will cement your spirit. Fear is the lesson about courage, overcome your fear so you can be a man. In a fight, we're all equal, no shirts, no ties, no blue or white collars, no hierarchy; we're all men, united in the same spirit, as a generation lost in no-space, raised by executive women and executed in the altar of liberalism.

It doesn't matter, whatever you own  yeah, I know but is everything really so bad? Yes it is, what do you want to be, a prototype? Like these perfect guys in the Gucci underwear advertisement, is that what men look alike? Well Tyler sure does.

All you have to do is to fight, to endure the punches in your face, the blood, the pain, in the modern arena when you'll be either the bull or the toreador. In both cases, you'll win self-respect. Because taking hits is how you learn about resistance. You see, the point is not to help your neighbor, to fight poverty, to help people, but to denounce the dysfunctional aspect of this society, to fight it, to pee on the soup of the guy with the chick, the Rolex and the Ferrari, to shock the innocence with a subliminal phallic image during a fairy tale cartoon, to destroy all the multiple corporate buildings, to exterminate the liberal degeneration of the pointless civilization, to ...""

Now, I come to my point, the movie works because of its unfortunate prophetic value, I'm sure the movie denounced more than supported, but history proved the premonition to be right. But the average viewer doesn't love the movie for these reasons, because if he would, he would hate it.I love ""Fight Club"" because I hate it, call it schizophrenia, I call it the 'Fight Club' paradox.

47,paul2001sw-1,ker-pow!,9,23 December 2002,"Starting to watch Fight Club, my first thought's that basically it's a re-run of The Game, Fincher's previous (and arguably under-rated) film.  The two have a lot in common, which is no bad thing.  Skillful direction, an original but preposterous plot played with a straight face (but without undue pomposity or preachiness) and given time to build to climax, and an idea (that we have to lose what we have in order to appreciate it) that is not, in all honesty, seriously explored in either film, but which sustains entertainment that pitches in well above the brain-dead level in both cases. Of the pair, Fight Club is funnier, but more or less, the formula's the same.Then, three quarters of the way through, Fight Club pulls a trick.  It's cleverly done (once the shock hits you, you suddenly spot the clues) but unfortunately it sweeps the ground from beneath this movie's feet.  After the coup, all you are left with are boring sub-Matrix style special effect violence and bogus existential meditations.  The film was never really heading to a classical straight ending, but, you might think, surely they could do something better than this.And then, at the every end,  the wreckage is raised.  Two great gags in the last thirty seconds (though how one passed the censor I do not know) turn the joke firmly back on us.  The timing and execution of both are perfect; though the whole film is not, you'll see few others as well-directed, fun and fresh.",Fight Club

It's the taut pacing and screw-tightening screenplay that ratchets up both the tension and confusion, the perfect performances that sell the sometimes silly seeming goings-on and the perfectionist grimy direction that points the viewer in one direction while doing something vastly important in the other that all add up to make the experience a lasting and memorable one that feels as though it has something to say, gets under your skin and works on multiple viewings to equally successful effect. 8/10",Fight Club
49,bowmanblue,"Often parodied, seldom bettered",10,19 January 2017,"Chances are, if you've watched any popular movie over the last fifteen years or so, you've probably heard the line, 'The first rule of *whatever* is do not talk about *whatever.*' This is of course the most famous line from the Brad Pitt/Edward Norton 1999 classic, 'Fight Club.' In a nutshell, Fight Club is so good it's spawned many parodies and rip-offs, none of which have even come close to emulating just how good it is.I'll give you a brief plot synopsis, but leave it there, as if I go into too much detail, I start running the risk of letting slip some major spoilers. Edward Norton plays a bored and run-down salesman who spends his days flying across America selling his wares. However, his dull life takes a turn for the interesting when he happens to bump into Tyler Durden (or rather Brad Pitt) on a plane. The two of them form an unlikely bond and come up with a novel way of dealing with male stress in the modern age – they beat the hell out of each other for fun. And, believe it or not, this idea soon spreads across the nation and 'Fight Clubs' start springing up everywhere.It's about now in the review where I list the good and bad points of the film. However, I can't actually think of anything negative to say about Fight Club and, if I listed all its plus points then I'd probably be here all day. There's very little wrong with this film in general – it has everything from great central performances from Pitt, Norton and Helena Bonham Carter (and even a sterling performance from Meat Loaf – who'd have thought!) to wry social commentary, snappy dialogue and those plot points I refuse to mention for fear of being hounded off the internet for spoiling movies.As I've already eluded to, there's definitely more to it than the synopsis, but anything more may ruin the surprises in store. Whether you like dark, intelligent thrillers or just want to see Brad Pitt topless, you really should check this film out at some stage. It's already a classic and, even after all these years, holds up very well with its themes of fragile male ego, bonding and the establishment in general.When I watched it last I felt it had an almost 'Hitchcock-vibe' to it all, which would explain why it all feels so dark and timeless. If you haven't seen it, don't ask people about it, as they may well give away bits of it that will stay with you forever. Just watch it. Then re-watch it again with a completely different view of it all when you know what it's really about.",Fight Club

If you want logic or sunshine, forget about it. If you don't mind diving down, getting lost, gasping, and shaking your head in appreciative amazement, this is your movie. Any number of things could go wrong when you have so much depending on the two main male characters each presenting a psychology meant to be a yin and yang pairing, but nothing goes wrong here. Brad Pitt is confident, virile, beautiful in every way that Edward Norton is not. When they meet, so to speak, Norton is transformed, and the wild events that follow seem vaguely possible, even if patently impossible. It's a crazy ride and a beautiful one, dark and funny, and even a little romantic (the woman sidekick is played to perfection by Helena Bonham Carter). Chuck Palahniuk's novel is the basis for all this inventive insanity, and you give director David Fincher credit for even thinking it was filmable. It was a huge effort in every way--assembling the cast, arranging all the special effects, creating the dark and drained color palette, working in the spasmodic soundtrack (effects and music both), on and on. Not to mention just editing it so that it made sense. Which it does. Fincher is a music video director at heart, and that feel is not lost here, to his benefit (the two other films of his I've seen are also visually athletic, the archetypally atmospheric Se7en and the more straight up Panic Room).Fight Club has to be seen for what it is. When I first saw it a year ago, finally, it struck me as trying too hard, and a little outlandish, I mean, it's all so improbable, life on steroids and with sunglasses on in the dark. But this time all this craziness was exactly right, and within the film, within the rules of this special universe inside the film itself, it isn't crazy at all, but convincing and gut level perfect.

54,CuriosityKilledShawn,"Bloated, irresponsible, self-indulgent trash!",1,31 October 2000,"Typically over-directed David Fincher nonsense.Is he actually able to direct a movie that isn't dank, grimy and depressing? There are way to many people out there who hold this claptrap in too high regard. Perhaps they confuse the muddled and self-congratulatory rubbish that is the plot for something deep and meaningful.I found that this film scrapes the bottom of the barrel for reasons to be cynical and faithless. It became increasingly obnoxious and irritating. Edward Norton's character had the most annoying voice and the constant ugly imagery turned me off totally. If this film wanted to poke fun at our society then why did it only show all the ugly parts. Granted, there is a lot of fake, unnatural beauty out there but a helluva lot of this world is still free and nice to look at. Not everywhere is a dull, grey office or a miserable, rainy alleyway.It is also very, very slow. 139 minutes have never seemed so long.A lot of this film could have been cut out and still there would be no MAJOR difference to the story I like the idea that everyone is part of the same gang and by sticking together they can easily bring down modern society. This should have been exploited more. But we only get about 4 or 5 scenes of their antics. But, the whole thing of the gang becoming fascists in their attempt to stop fascism is lost on me. I didn't find it ironic, subtle or meaningful. Sorry.The sub-text about man becoming primal again, and releasing all the rage created from jobs that insult their intelligence and ruin their lives, is lost on me too. It's practically non-existent. I have never been let down so much by a movie that was hyped as being exciting. It was really rather boring.The DVD has a loads of features, annoying and headache inducing. Why did Fox insist on a dozen little featurettes instead of one healthy hour-long documentary? The menus are confusing as is the multi-angle function on the 5-minute ""scene deconstructions"". Who on earth is going to watch all of these 2 or 3 times just to see the different angles and bad camcorder shots of someone working on a computer?

Brad Pitt and Edward Norton nailed the lead character, but from them, I didn't expect anything less. Meat Loaf additionally spiced winning combination. But my biggest surprise was that movie was based on Chuck Palahniuk novel. Although I saw it many times, that ""detail"" never caught my eye. Chuck is completely nutz, but the movie did not indicate his style to me. Now I definitely have to read the book. The movie itself is fast, entertaining and with good twists, although the main twist is somewhat predictable if you are watching the movie carefully enough. If there is anyone who didn't see it so far, you should correct that mistake urgently, and for others, it won't harm you to refresh your memory, there are always new details you missed before.8,5/10",Fight Club

When that becomes old, they engage in terrorist activities. There is a lame plot twist, which should not surprise most viewers, that blows the story full of holes and turns the movie from merely bad to abominably bad, culminating in a laughably ludicrous finale. The message of this paean to sado-masochism is that a man has to suffer and inflict pain on others in order to...sell tickets.

58,The-Sarkologist,We are not the car that we drive,10,5 February 2012,"There is really little to criticise about this film because it flows so well, it is brilliantly executed, and strikes at society at a fundamental level. All I am going to say before I continue is that you should go and see it because it is brilliant. DO NOT READ ANY FURTHER BEFORE SEEING IT! I will be giving away so much of this movie, that by reading any further will seriously spoil it for you.The movie is about a guy who at first does not seem to have a name. It is not something we really notice, but it is important to note that we are never formally introduced to him. The name is purposefully kept hidden from us because of his basic nature. He suffers from insomnia and narcolepsy (sudden fits of sleep) and starts to go to support groups. There is the thing of seeing people who are more pathetic than you that gives you the strength to continue, and in fact he begins to feel good about himself. This happens until he finds another leech, a woman who is doing exactly the same thing as he is. As such he becomes stressed again, and the final thing occurs when his apartment explodes leaving him without all his possessions and a place to stay.So what he does is he calls Tyler Durden, a man whom he met on the plane, and asks if he can stay with him. Durden lives in an abandoned and rotting house where there is very little in the way of luxury. Beforehand, they have a fight, and end up fighting everyday and through this create a fight club where all those who are stressed and angry with society come to let off their steam. Soon Durden uses this to create a secret revolutionary army to overthrow the current order.We learn that Tyler Durden is the narrator, though it is the name of his alter ego. So then who is this guy that Durden keeps on seeing that claims to be him if he is him. Well, Durden is not only his alternate personality, but more so his dark side. What this movie has is two conflicts: the conflict against the material world, and the conflict within Durden himself. Durden does not realise that he is speaking to his alternate self, and we do not even realise it (though there are clues, such as Marla Singer and Durden never being in the same room together), but there are numerous clues thrown throughout the movie to suggest that this is the case. When we look back through the movie we understand how this is so.On the other hand, the dark Durden is not all that bad. Okay, he does want to destroy the fabric of material society, but he does a lot to help the narrator out. In fact he drags him out of his endless material society and gives him something to focus on. We see at the beginning how he lusts over the new gadgets and stuff but as Durden works through him he slowly begins to shun the material world and the capitalist pursuit of more money and stuff. In the end, even though he objects to his dark side's plan to wipe out all credit companies, he passively watches the buildings explode.This is the second conflict in the movie, namely between the workers and the managers. The narrator himself is in a managerial position but really comes to shun this existence because his pursuit of wealth is really doing him no good. It is very interesting to see that how he accumulates all of this wealth, but no amount of money can help him sleep. In fact it is quite possibly the cause of his lack of sleep, and the dark side is just a reaction against the materialistic society that drove him to this point.The members of the fight club are interesting as they are comprised of the workers. The slave that must go to work as they are enslaved to the credit that gives them their luxuries. Along with them are those that are cut out of society because they look strange or are simply social outcasts. Now that I consider it, I guess the big problem with Durden is that he did not have any friends. Through out the first part of the movie, he had all of this stuff, but he did not have any friends. He goes to the support groups and they help him because there are people there that generally want to care.This now leads me to discuss the whole thing about relationships and materialism. It is not surprising that the narrator is frustrated and stressed, even though he has all of these goodies. The most important thing humans need is a relationship. We see this with the girl because she is crying out simply for somebody to notice her. Durden literally shoves her off, thinking her a freak yet knowing full well that she is actually quite like him. It is only at the end that he simply holds her.That is what we need as humans: we need to be held. We are very relational beings and by shunning the relationship of others we literally deprive ourselves of what we need to most to survive. You see, we were created to have a relationship with God and the relationships we have with each other mimic that relationship we have with God. The relationship with God is the most important relationship we need because without it we are doomed. It should be so fundamental that it forms the core of our existence.",Fight Club
59,slightlymad22,Don't talk about Fight Club,8,18 August 2014,"The first rule of Fight Club is ""Don't talk about Fight Club."" But we're going to break the first rule of Fight Club and talk about Fight Club.Fight Club is possibly one of the last original movies made, before Hollywood started ripping off, reimagining and remaking everything that ever made Tinseltown money. So if for some reason, if you haven't seen Fight Club yet, when you get done reading this, go out and rent Fight Club.A good movie for me is one that does not end with the credits. And Fight Club is a good movie. And one that stays with you long after the credits begin rolling.I can't praise the cast enough of this movie enough here. Brad Pitt (Who I'm not a fan of by the way) is perfectly cast as Tyler Durden (and he seems to be having a very good time here) Helena Bonham Carter can always be relied upon for a good performance, here once again, she is superb. As for Edward Norton, it became apparent the year before this movie, with 'American History X' that he was one talented actor destined for great performances in great roles. His first movie was opposite Richard Gere in Primal Fear in 1996. He was nominated for an Oscar for Best Supporting actor which he lost to Cuba Gooding Jr. for 'Jerry Maguire' He also won a Golden Globe. Not bad for his first time out. He the. Worked with Woody Allen before his second Oscar Nomination for 'American History X' he lost this time to Roberto Benigni for 'Life is Beautiful'. Benigni also beat out Tom Hanks for 'Saving Private Ryan'. Boy did the Academy get that one wrong!But this was to be his last great movie. (As of 2014 at least) He has had had a few minor hits since then but there has been something missing in most of his work between then and now. So, what the hell happened?Bottom line, Norton got a reputation for being difficult. Lots of people think of Norton as an absolute control freak. That Norton is not someone you want to work with.Also, Norton isn't shy about airing his opinions to anyone who will listen. If Norton feels like he hasn't gotten the credit he is due, he will shout it from the rooftops. If he isn't happy with the final cut of a movie, he simply promote it. That is frowned on in Hollywood where stars are expected to support their movies no matter what.Brad Pitt (as I've said I'm not a fan) settled for being a famous A List superstar than making good movies I often said outside the Oceans Franchise ensemble, and with the exception of 'Inglorious Basterds' and 'The Assassination of Jessie James By The Coward Robert Ford' Pitt has not made a good movie since Seven. But I love his performance here. I don't believe another actor could have played the role of Tyler Durden as well as Pitt.But back to the movie.Given the talent involved, I'm not surprised this found an audience despite the premise of the movie. The studio wanted to market Fight Club to women because of Pitt. But they knew the film's violence would appeal more to men. It was a tricky one. In the end they hired an ad agency. They did a great job of promoting a tricky movie. Go watch Fight Club.",Fight Club
60,UniqueParticle,I'm proud of this my 100th review & it's favorite movie!,10,27 April 2019,"A genius masterpiece about a man that struggles with sleep among other mental dwindling disorders! I originally saw this on VHS at least 15 years ago it instantly became my all time favorite purely because of how it makes you think & the excellent lines about society; I've now seen it at around 20 times including special features.I remember having to see it a few times to understand the story better, not realizing several key elements that most don't realize. Most don't understand why it's my favorite movie, they say, ""Oh there's too much fighting"" no it's more about the sheer the depth of every conversation, quotes, and society aspects.The vocabulary is outstanding & every philosophical notion involved. Similar to The Matrix being about alternate universes with society, mashed with philosophical conversations & how we are slaves like batteries which is true depending on what you believe.Anyway ""Fight club"" is best in my opinion cause it doesn't have the sci-fi bits, it's psychologically disturbing in a twisted good drama way, the ending too woo boy that's the bee's knees of hit me right in the feels to the point where I wish banks would disintegrate in other words ground zero that might be too deep though so don't mind me regardless I love this movie so much!",Fight Club
61,briancham1994,2edgy4me,6,2 November 2020,"Sure, this film is supposed to satirise the likes of Tyler Durden, but the amount of edgy white boy teenagers who take him too seriously just put me off. This film starts off with a critique of modern American capitalist consumerist culture which probably resonated better in 1999 (c.f. American Beauty). The protagonist, an unnamed narrator, is suffering from a lack of human contact and acceptance in his life. So far, so interesting. Then we are introduced to the nihilistic Tyler Durden who represents repressed masculinity and Nietzschean Will, offering the protagonist an alternate way to a fulfilling life. Unfortunately, what follows afterwards is absurd and implausible. The insights here revolve around Tyler's insufferable monologues (reminds me of some people I've met) or rejections thereof, a rather shallow interplay that ultimately says little about the social system that necessitated his creation.",Fight Club

63,Dr_Coulardeau,"Can we, the alienated, liberate the world from finance and consumerism?",10,17 January 2007,"How can we make explicit, visible, the dark side in each one of us that is only aiming at creating mayhem, havoc around us ? How can we use this dark side in the mass of us to make our massive us conquer power over the very few them who already have done it and who control society and the world through finance and consumerism ? How can we use this dark side to help the proletariat, the lowest layers of workers in this society seize power and establish not a new dictatorship, be it even that of the proletariat, but a new beginning, and we are back in Genesis. The solution is simple. Destroy the whole financial institutions and corporations that control everything, first of all credit card companies, then banks, then telephone companies, etc. We are speaking here of flattening them down into pure ashes, dust to dust, Babylon burnt at the stake of our desire of freedom. Nothing left of them and their records. Then the world will start anew again and it will be a good old heterosexual couple with some kind of a floating penis in-between the frames, that will go out to take possession of this freed world, of this liberated world, of this resuscitated, rejuvenated, recreated world. That's the solution, and, mind you, before the Twin Towers. Of course, now we know it would take a little bit more than just flattening a dozen of skyscrapers to bring capitalism down, to stop consumerism, to whatever. There are back-ups everywhere and in places that cannot be reached. And that all will start if men liberate their own fighting instinct, their own fighting pleasure, their own suffering ecstasy. I must admit Brad Pitt fits in this fictional and virtual character and we regret slightly that he has to disappear when the new Genesis arrives. The slurpy slug from which he had emerged, the vacuous non-entity he had managed to regenerate is really not worth surviving, even in this genetically new world. If humanity is supposed to spring back up from such a soft brain and a spongy masculinity, it will not be glorious at all. But the film is a rather entertaining vision of what has become central in our world : violence, Thanatos, the desire to kill and destroy, in this world where we have reached the time when it could be possible to curb this survival instinct forever.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University of Paris Dauphine & University of Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne",Fight Club
64,zkonedog,Succeeds In Many Different--And Quirky--Arenas,10,9 March 2017,"Generally speaking, I am not a fan of overly weird or bizarre movies. I'm also not enamored with movies that toss about sociological themes without deep examinations of them. ""Fight Club"" definitively checks both of those boxes--yet I consider it one of my favorite films of all-time. Simply put, the explanation is that this movie succeeds in so many areas that it uniquely camouflages its non-commitment to any single one.For a very basic overview, ""Fight Club"" focuses on The Narrator (Edward Norton) who is completely burnt out on life from an emotional perspective. This is a guy who goes to support groups for diseases/afflictions he doesn't have just so he can feel something. One day, however, he meets Tyler Durden (Brad Pitt) a rather enigmatic figures who takes charge of life in a way the lead never could, completely transforming his personality from utterly passive to overly aggressive. This is largely accomplished through highly violent underground ""fight clubs"". When things get out of hand, however, the pair are at odds over which way their future is headed.Every time I watch ""Fight Club"", I have roughly the same experience: After the first half hour, I think ""why is this weird flick one of my all-time favorites?"". By the end credits, however, I'm completely enraptured in director David Fincher's unique vision. There are so many things done magnificently...-It's a ""twist ending"" movie of the highest order, right up their with ""Sixth Sense"" or ""The Usual Suspects"".
-It features some of the best acting you'll ever witness. Maybe Pitt's best performance of all-time, while Norton and Helena Bonham Carter are excellent in their own ways.
-The overall atmosphere (from the music, cinematography, and just quirky nature) is so one-of-a-kind that I can't really think of a similar film comp for it.
-There are many deep themes present contemplating the nature of a consumerist society and how individuals--especially men--deal with existing in such an environment. Perhaps a little ""mumbo-jumbo""-y...but also perhaps not.What never fails to amaze me about ""Fight Club"" is how all of the above areas are able to mesh with each other to create something anywhere near coherent. It all just ""works"" even when it doesn't seem like it should have a chance.The first time I saw ""Fight Club"", I was blown away by the ending. Each subsequent watch, however, has not been diminished by its knowledge. Whenever the next viewing happens, I'm sure I'll catch yet other things I hadn't considered. ""Fight Club"" is just one of those types of movies--as quirky as cinema gets, yet able to hold up time after time.No matter how weird you think this movie is in the early goings, do not bail out early. Everything does come together when an understanding of Fincher's universe begins to congeal and the themes/plot/acting make more sense.",Fight Club
65,Floated2,Unique and quite captivating,9,10 May 2020,"Having always heard and being familiar about Fight Club and somewhat hearing little by little its twist ending (but not completely knowing the full details), and only now watching the film for the first time 21+ years later its release. Understood its high praise from fans, and as to why many consider it one of the favorite films among one of the greatest films of all time.Fight Club most definitely seems to be a film which caters towards the teens to 20/early 30's crowd of people. From the directing to the acting, to the dialogue and scenery, everything is done in a very stylish and ""cool"" sort of way. The entire film has that factor which is appealing and engaging to many people (including oneself).Everything which has been said and praised about the film has already been said. From the twist (which is somewhat confusing but also in a way predictable), but its keeps it engaging throughout. The film does start off really well, then comes a little downhill in its second half (around the time the ""Project Mayhem"" is introduced) but it's still enjoyable, and the twist is enjoyable to see it unfold.The performances of both Edward Norton and Brad Pitt alone are what make this movie worth the watch. Both of them on screen (especially Pitt) are highly captivating. Helena Bonham Carter also does a solid job, and Meat Loaf also stands out.From the surface level, this film may seem like it's only about fighting and a group of men gathering in groups to fight one another in underground settings. But given that it is based on a novel (not many people are aware), the little subtle intangibles are quite clever and keeps people guessing. It is more complex than most may initially suspect. Also the fact there are many different theories about certain parts/things of the film, tells us that this is more than a film simply about fighting.For a film to be over 20 years old, and still people are commenting/reviewing and discussing it, tells us that it is a classic and one of the most well known and popular films. This is a film which stays with you after watching it and may still be one your mind a day or so later. As more time passes, we assume the next generation will watch the film for the first time, and have similar opinions and thoughts. Perhaps Fight Club was ahead of it's time released in 1999.",Fight Club
66,eddie_baggins,A film in a world of its own,10,28 April 2015,"It's a curious thing to judge or analyse David Fincher's revered anti-establishment classic Fight Club in today's age, for in the 15 or so years since its initial tepid response upon an unsuspecting movie loving public, the film has become something more than a phenomenon, it's become an institution much like Edward Norton's narrator so desperately wants to see crumble. From the endlessly quotable dialogue, the oft discussed classic ending and the wonderfully engaging performances from the films leads Edward Norton and Brad Pitt, Fight Club truly is a cinematic classic. Not bad for a film we shouldn't even talk about if we were following the rules.In adapting cult author Chuck Palahniuk book of the same name, it's clear directing star David Fincher shared an affiliation with this thoroughly bleak yet irresistibly engaging commentary on everything from pent up male rage, modern day social standards and Krispy Krème donuts. Fincher creates a world in which everything plays out in heightened sense of reality, an almost bizarro world that feels eerily similar to our own version of life yet also distinctively different. From the aroma of every freshly brewed Starbucks Coffee, every droplet of hard fought blood and every chemical burn, Fincher's imagination and visual flair as director comes to the forefront. While his work on memorable thriller The Game and genre classic Se7en proved what a talent he was a filmmaker, Fight Club is his undeniable genius come to fruition, a gut punch and unsuspecting left hook of original vision that comes racing out of the blocks only to conclude in the most explosive way imaginable.While Fincher's genius is on full display from Fight Club's first shot through to its last, there is also little denying the power its actors and narrative drive had on creating such a unanimously loved film. In a role that perhaps even betters his incredible turns in both American History X and Primal Fear, Edward Norton displays an incredible ability to inhabit a man who may just be crumbling from the inside out and Brad Pitt as Tyler Durden went to all new levels of ""cool"" as a soap making, robe wearing maniac of epic proportions. These two A-listers created a pairing for the ages in a story driven by a sense of bemusement at modern day living, a cry of outrage in our Ikea loving, self-important driven lives. It's within this story core that lays Fight Club's most endearing facet and why it continues to be discovered and talked about today, it was perhaps a movie ahead of its time as now more than ever it seems ever so strangely, relevant.A brutal, uncompromising and utterly brilliant work of movie making, Fight Club may be a film that cares not that it offends or even repulses but in this the true power of its strengths come forth, to showcase just what a work of art it is. It's an artwork that is surrounded by the grime and dirt and all the dirty little secrets of modern day society and it's perhaps most importantly a piece of entertainment that continues to keep on giving thanks to Fincher's once in a lifetime moulding of craft, production and performances into something so outstandingly memorable.5 bars of soap out of 5 For more movie reviews and opinions check into - www.jordanandeddie.wordpress.com",Fight Club
67,johnnyboyz,"Stupefying beyond belief; Fight Club is a messy spectacle of ugliness, exposition and crass ideologies playing out under a broad banner of mainstream entertainment.",4,7 May 2010,"I read that Fight Club is a ""man's film"", whatever that means. Truth be told, it's a little boy's film, a messy; scrappy; clawing; pseudo-philosophical piece of turgid nonsense lapped up by people who see a music video aesthetic crossed with their favourite actors churned out of this contemporary Hollywood star system we have that just happens to dabble in some meek philosophy: bums and nobodies like the ones in the film will find its gimmicky pretences enthralling, appealing and quite interesting. For the rest of us, this is lecturing nonsense from a writer whom ought to have all his pens, pencils and word processors taken away from him. The film's entire thesis is captured in a sequence in which, at the fight club of the title, the store owner comes down into his own shop's basement to question what everyone's doing. After some grief from Durden, he beats him before eventually being subdued himself by a blood soaked Durden slobbering all over him. The owner runs off; suddenly attuned to allowing the club to remain and all he needed to arrive at this point is a good fight of some description. That's it; that's all you need to know right there – the rest is nonsense of the highest order.The film plays out under this facade of post-modern trickery and modern movie making gimmicks, thus rendering it ""accessible""; but the fact we're expected to swallow this infantile babble about how difficult it is to be a blank, bummed out nobody; a thug, a vandal, whose lives are in the dank state they are because they never found any particular field in which they could excel, is pathetic. The film was David Fincher's fourth, but he will not churn out a worser piece of cinematic drek in his life than the adolescent, preening nonsense that is Fight Club. The piece is essentially one long flashback and is narrated by Edward Norton's nameless character. When we first see him, he has a gun in his mouth and finds himself in an area chock full of explosives courtesy of Brad Pitt's Tyler Durden. Norton initially I.D's himself as a slave to consumerism; an unexciting office worker who comes to find solace in fighting and violence with other men in an organised fight ring from whence the title derives. But in Durden, a frightening character is created: a thug, a vandal, a terrorist but a role model; an individual whose manic hair style; cool looking shades; extravagant dress sense; sexual habits and natural charisma paints positive characteristics in an individual that ought to be anything but. Durden sees himself as a saviour; a liberator; an army general whom leads his troops and encourages them to break the shackles of life; someone whom frees and liberates via terror, as exemplified in a scene set in a convenience store car park in which he threatens to execute a young store worker if he doesn't return to education. All this leads to a sickening finale, an end that carries a highly romanticised, emotionally heavy sensibility about it as bombs go off and two people embrace.The film is from the pen of Jim Uhls by way of Chuck Palahniuk's novel, the film is Palahniuk's inane babbling against the machine; his banal, inane ranting and raving of which the arguments in the film are put across by way of nothing more than childish expositional tidbits on behalf of Pitt's character: ""The things you own end up owning you"" is a sample. In stark comparison to Norton's grey suit; blank shirt-clad and office booth based character, the one he shares most screen time with, Durden is a dangerously vibrant explosion of colour and energy. Later, there's a reason for all this hopping about in characteristics and mannerism as well as the restrictions in the Norton-Pitt interaction; but in itself, opens up a number of problems as to how they can be in separate places at once and how on Earth one person can know about one item (such as the whereabouts of the human fat) with the other seemingly oblivious to all links to it.Make no mistake, the film is the clawing ramblings of someone with some serious issues. In attempting to wage a war on consumerism, we get plenty in the way of product placement for companies such as Pepsi and Apple Macintosh; its approach sees a world initially filtered through the psyche of an insomniac in Norton's character, before support groups and false emotion helps cure that and a character named Marla (Carter) push it back to the forefront again. Is there a need for her character? Marla's presence opens up a sub-plot to do with her own problems of suicidal ideation and a fling she has with Durden which is entirely pointless. After a while, the film realises her presence is futile; that the piece is meant to be about the relationship of its two lead men, their masculinity and their relationship with other men, scrapping her for more inane tangents that run off on separate strands.The whole thing is as empty headed and crass as it sounds, this underground fight ring escalating from a celebration of pain, violence and all things grimy and nasty into a tale of a terrorist group full of 'misunderstood' philistine-infused males. In creating an ugly film about ugly people with ugly views, but filtering it by way of sporadic philosophy and sociology with an accessible aesthetic in its MTV-style appearance, Fincher has crafted a text he's most certainly above. It's nonsense of the worst kind; the sort of nonsense that has an eye on being labelled as something higher than first appears, addressing people in society doing what's deemed menial jobs before actually becoming someone in the ring during which battering and bruising someone else is the answer to life's problems. It's babble; babble of the most patronising and disorganised, sporadic order; a maddening and dulling faux-intellectual piece of nonsense.",Fight Club
68,filipemanuelneto,"David Fincher's masterpiece (so far): Not being perfect and having credibility issues, it entertains and surprises the audience.",9,17 August 2019,"This is one of those movies that promises a lot less than it offers, making it a pleasant surprise. Personally, I had low expectations when I saw this movie, but in fact I had read virtually nothing about it before I saw it.The ingenious script is based on the strange and somewhat masochistic friendship between two very different men. One is very shy and the other very rebellious and iconoclastic. Both create a discreet, strict-rule fight club that evolves into a sort of secret society of anarchist contours. The story has a lot of twists and turns, surprising us, catching our attention. However, its not a perfect movie and there are really logical gaps and credibility issues in the story, not to mention that, at some point, the audience no longer really knows what is true in everything they saw. I believe this is intentional, and I recognize that its a feature that has its charm, but it may disappoint some people (personally I dealt with it reasonably well).A decidedly good point in this movie is the gigantic performances of Brad Pitt and Edward Norton. Both are great actors, when they have space and material to evolve, and that's what happened here. Both actors were brilliant and developed throughout the film a bizarrely perfect partnership, with a touch of sadism, repressed homosexuality and predatory instinct. David Fincher, the director, also deserves congratulations, as he's the hand that guides everything and manages, with this film, to present to the world what (so far) is the masterpiece of his career as a film director.Technically, the movie is quite good. The shadowy cinematography and the use of high contrast between light and dark were well used features, and the shooting and framing angles are very clever. The soundtrack, discreetly, also helped to accentuate the film's surrealism at the right times. Of course, its an action movie about an underground fighting club, so there are plenty of scenes of gratuitous violence, some of them quite brutal, as well as nudity and dialogues loaded with insults and profanity. So, I leave my warning to parents: its not a children's movie at all, and even teenagers should only watch it with great caution as its really a violent movie.",Fight Club

I couldn't understand it and I didn't want to be considered a poser so I skipped it. Big mistake! In my opinion, ""Fight Club"" is one of the most important movies of the 90's, Word. Why? Because it has a really intriguing, original, and extremely interesting plot. I just couldn't believe how great it was.Edward Norton and Brad Pitt display one of the most likable on-screen duos ever. Even though well we know the plot twist.The action sequences are extremely well done and also make you feel powerful. But it's the whole ""mind complexity"" that makes this movie great; it deals with plenty of issues that are very difficult to confront when you are in Norton's situation and the movie solves them with ....fighting. But this is not your typical action/fighting feature, no, no, it's way more than that... It's that important that I consider it to be one of the key movies of the post-Gen X.Also, the extremely interesting dialogs are stuff for legend. Memorable dialogs.Please watch it and enjoy one of the best pop culture moments in cinematography.",Fight Club

73,funkyfry,Engaging and perplexing,7,12 April 2010,"I don't know how much of a full ""review"" of this movie I can actually write based on one viewing, most especially as I was rather extremely hung over at least at the beginning of the movie. But actually I think that's not a bad way to watch it. This is quite an ambitious film, a lot of themes and ideas are being tossed around in the film that aren't directly anchored to the characters. Or the character as the case may be. I did really like the movie, but I thought that at times it got too slick with its presentation. It suffers from the same faults as all action films despite being a satire of action films on a certain level -- the action simply can't be intense enough to hold the hardcore audience's attention in the beginning and still ratchet up to something even more grotesque without becoming completely unreal and potentially laughable in and of itself. But you could say the same thing about some of Paul Verhoeven's best action satires like ""Starship Troopers"" that weren't even as clear as ""Fight Club"" about actually throwing the macho ethic into question. It seems to just go with the territory.So in some respects this film belongs to the same school as films like Aldrich's ""Kiss Me Deadly"" or Tarantino's ""Reservoir Dogs"" in that it's a kind of theater of excess, basically throwing macho types out there and not so much deconstructing them as just pushing them so far over the edge that they already appear hyper-real. But I think the film sort of betrays that in some of its last sequences. That's the kind of thing that I think I'll be able to say later after I've seen it again. I do want to watch it again because certain scenes, especially the ones with Helena Bonham Carter (who I always WANT to like more than I usually do), are really appealing for some reason.The thing that holds me back from embracing the movie is that it just seemed a bit too proud of itself, and the story was a bit too ridiculous even in the end when all was explained to actually take it as seriously as it seemed to want to be taken. I'm going to see what I think ultimately though at some later point. This is the type of movie that might either go up or down in my estimation when I have a better handle on it.",Fight Club
74,Anonymous_Maxine,One of the best films of 1999.,10,2 August 2001,"Edward Norton returns after his earth quaking performance in American History X to play the part of Jack (who has no last name for a reason), a typical white-collar guy who works in an office, makes a good salary, and spends his time trying to find that perfect furniture set or that set of the ideal matching dishes. He lives in an empty world defined by possessions and income  a world that is empty beyond his paycheck and his high rent apartment. He realizes this on a subconscious level and begins to have trouble sleeping, so eventually he goes out and joins support groups for afflictions that he doesn't have, just for the emotional release and the feeling of belonging and of meaning. He almost immediately finds relief to his sleeping problems (`Babies don't sleep this good.'), and makes the support groups a regular activity.  Unfortunately, one day he runs into someone else who is doing the same thing, Marla, and it ruins everything for him. This woman disgusts him (for obvious reasons), but he ultimately tries to reason with her so that they can both do the support group thing and not run into each other. The movie really starts moving when Jack runs into Tyler Durden while on a business trip. They meet on an airplane, and Jack is immediately impressed at what an interesting `single-serving' friend Tyler is. Tyler gives Jack his card, and Jack later calls him after his apartment explodes. Jack goes to stay with Tyler out of necessity, and Tyler introduces Jack to his world. Jack is fascinated. Tyler lives in a world devoid of personal possessions and responsibilities. He lives in a disgusting house, has no job (no steady one, anyway), pays no bills, and would more than likely be in trouble with the IRS if he were to be audited. He lives below the poverty line, obviously, but he is free, and Jack admires his ability to reject all forms of authority. Out of the blue one day, Tyler asks Jack to hit him, and after some convincing, they get into the fist fight that sets off the chain reaction which results in the formation of the tremendously popular Fight Club, Jack's most violent but most successful support group, a club that grows exponentially despite it's own first two rules. The goal of Fight Club is to get it's members to analyze their own lives and eliminate unnecessary garbage (`The advertising world has us working jobs we hate, so we can buy sh*t we don't need.') and to obtain psychological freedom through mutually agreed violence between members. Sure, this sounds a little weird, but there really is something to be said about the psychological states obtained from pain. To put it in the immortal words of Beavis & Butt-Head (just after Butt-Head has `smacked Beavis upside the head')  Butt-Head: `That was cool!' Beavis: `No it wasn't, that sucked!' Butt-Head: `Yeah but like, after it's over, doesn't it like, feel pretty cool?' Beavis: `Oh yeah, do that again!' This is not something that is likely to be practiced by everyday society, but a club like Fight Club would probably be successful on many levels (one of which, of course, would not be the legal level). There are a few things in the film that could have done with a little bit more explaining, like why Jack is so interested in fighting William Shatner, but it doesn't matter that this is not explained. Fight Club is one of those movies that not only invites, but also REQUIRES a second viewing, and for countless reasons.Fight Club asks audiences to re-evaluate their lives, noticing the superfluous quality of the material obsessions of modern society. It is one of the most cinematically unique films to be released in years, and easily earns it's place among the greatest films of 1999 (and possibly of the entire decade), alongside such other classics as The Matrix, The Sixth Sense, and American Beauty, although it has much more in common with the first two. There is an obvious correlation between Fight Club and director David Fincher's previous classic, Seven, which is another spectacular dark film from the same director. Fight Club is definitely aimed at a male audience, and it should actually be commended, in my opinion, for not sacrificing any quality just to attract a larger female audience, which is something that is almost universally seen in Jerry Bruckheimer productions like The Rock and Armageddon and Pearl Harbor. Fight Club does not pretend to be something it's not, and it comes off with tremendous success. I have heard professional film critics give Fight Club the lowest rating possible, foolishly focusing on the violent aspect of the film and entirely missing the point of the film as a whole while at the same time proving without a doubt that some critics simply cannot be trusted. Be advised that this is an almost stomach-turningly violent film at some points, but instead of condemning the film for that, it should be recognized for fitting that much violence into what is ultimately such a skilled and memorable film. It's too bad that films of this quality are so rarely seen in modern cinema.",Fight Club
75,Vartiainen,Film that you hate to love,10,24 April 2013,"I still think that I shouldn't like this film. That I shouldn't allow myself to like this film. Its worldview is so ugly, so nihilistic and corrupted, that you actually fear that your own morals darken just by looking at it. Sure you justify it to yourself by telling that it's actually telling us not to give into hate, not to believe that our lives have no meaning, not to realize that we're just corporate puppets. And yes, the film actually carries a warning undertone, showing why people like Tyler Durden cannot be correct.It's hard to tell yourself that when you're watching the actual film though. Because in all honesty Brad Pitt is so good in this film, so magnificently charismatic, that it's no wonder that some people actually went and started their own fight clubs. No wonder that Tyler Durden has been voted the best movie character of all time numerous times. The man is that good in his role. And it is a distinct possibility that our society would be better off if he weren't, because in all honesty Tyler Durden is everything that we shouldn't be.And that's what makes this film so damn good. It is the ugly underbelly of human condition, of modern society. It's not nice to look at, it won't make you feel any better, but damn if isn't one heck of a trip to experience. This movie is so convinced that what it's saying is the God's truth that you have no choice but to be pulled in, even momentarily.But it's not just the message. It's a great movie even without the story and the character of Tyler Durden. The style, the art direction, the camera work, the rest of the cast, the music, the dirty jokes, the plot twists, the sheer ugly charisma. You might never like this film, no matter how often you can force yourself to watch it, but you can never deny that it's not a brilliant piece of film making. And that is why I think everyone should see it at least once. Because it's the end of the spectrum, as of now. You'll appreciate life more after you've realized that this is a work of fiction and that you're not living in it yourself.",Fight Club
76,elshikh4,I'm Jack's Amazed Viewer and Lonely Heart !,8,7 June 2010,"Did I love it? Yes.What's the most beautiful thing in it? The way it makes its conflict. I mean hey, this is a movie about getting sick of the modern time, how the urban lifestyle and values can make you a psycho, and fighting the materialistic civilization in a savage way. However in breathless motion picture where action, dark comedy, psychoanalysis, let alone a big twist, are mixed in one entertaining package. Here is where counterculture meets the video clip style meets fascinating movie-making. At one point, I found myself saying: ""This is how philosophy can be bankable"". This is mainly the effort of one really great writing.The thing is we all love to have a stronger alter ego. We all hate the fantasy we live and can't reach. And we just board of building what we can't complete. So how about being stronger, reaching the fantasy of destroying anything complete instead?. It said a lot about a very hot psychological problem that the human of today lives. The too many rich corporations became an evil empire. Hence there must be a resistance. Angry, bloody, and lunatic herd of resistance. Connecting this idea, as a brainchild of today's twisted world, with a fast-paced totally unpredictable movie that touches all the victims-is the exclusive greatness of this script.The details are so insightful and indicative (loved the soap one; as this society washes by its dirt!). The speech of (Tyler Durden) is made to touch every condo's sleepless soul out there, and it did. The narration is one of the best narrations I ever experienced, if not the best. The atmosphere is utterly different and smart. The image is artistically dim yet attractive; it makes the sense of exile intimate for any city's human. The scene in the car, running without holding the wheel, summarizes the mad and profound nature of the whole thing. The acting is flawless; the way how the cast loved the movie is incredibly felt on-screen. (Fight Club) is what (Edward Norton) will be remembered by, for years and years. All of that makes watching this movie again a must.What did you hate in it? Firstly, the obscenity of some parts. Then, the heroine's face and aspect. While being a part of dark, sick and wild world, she's supposed to be a sort of another face for the kind hero. And she was somehow a symbol of love that the lead needs and refuses in the same time. But (Helena Bonham Carter)'s features and looks were scary, creepy, and unbearable. Plus, a bit of illogicality. For instance: the scene in the police station, in which the good lead is about to be castrated, wasn't acceptable; so his army will do it blindly? He's their beloved leader! How all the screams and blood are going to be hidden?!, etc. And something ruined the finale for me; how to shoot yourself in the mouth, then be alive and capable of speaking?!On a deeper level, something was deficient in the start. The introduction of the main character somewhat missed something. (Chuck Palahniuk), the author of the novel which this movie is based on, said that the motive to write it came up with an incident he lived: ""After being beaten up on a camping trip and returning to work he found that nobody mentioned, acknowledged, or asked about his injuries, because if they did, a degree of personal interaction would be necessary."" This ""societal blocking"" wasn't so well-portrayed on-screen, seeming theoretical and - at best - borrowed from other movies. In another word, the important meaning; concerning how this lifestyle can generate violence, since this kind of life is emotionally violent hence psychologically destructive-wasn't shown at first in an original way. I wanted that very incident to be included, and it's in a way, but not effectively.Furthermore, I think that the movie just focused too much on the subject of the schizophrenia at the end more than anything, which mirrored itself badly on the ending. Yes, it's a journey to complete chaos, a war that the crazy side in it must win, but I felt something cut off, as if there was another more expressing ending thrown away somewhere by the hands of the studio, or the movie makers themselves. But anyway, who said that there is 100% perfect thing?!(David Fincher) is maybe one of the ill victims, or just a brilliant film / moviemaker. He understood the material, while not losing it along the way (Why some classics must be sleepy?!!). The man talked about frantic life frantically, yet with sharp mind also. The fact that the maker of (Se7en) and (Fight Club) is the one who did (Alien³) and (Zodiac) annoys me on one hand, and gives me the undeniable fact on the other: Kudos to the script.This is a top-notch movie. Aside from being the next step after (Taxi Driver), concerning the birth of the urban lunatic from the urban womb, it's extremely better than it on many levels. It succeeds in being a ""changing over"" itself among all the movies we watch. For me, what will live long the most from it is the way it made its cranky conflict and world too special.So, what do we learn from it? Love can make you sleep tight sometimes.. if you find it. Otherwise, be aware, you would end up being a (Tyler Durden) yourself.",Fight Club
77,freemantle_uk,Rule number one about Fight Club; you do not talk about Fight Club. Rule number two about Fight Club: you do not talk about Fight Club!,9,13 May 2010,"1999 was a great year for film, with many great films releases that year: The Matrix, American Beauty, Being John Malkovich, Toy Story 2, The Sixth Sense are just a few examples. To join them was Fight Club, a controversial film based on a popular novel and directed by David Fincher, a man whom career was on the up.Edward Norton play an insurance clerk who was suffering from insomnia and struggles to deal with it. He starts by attending support groups for people suffering from long term illnesses to cope with his issues. Yet that disappears when Marla Singer (Helena Bonham Carter) starts to attend these meeting and takes away their edge. Whilst on a business trip the man meets Travis Durden (Brad Pitt), a soap maker and salesman. They quickly becomes friends and move in together into a dilapidated house. They also start to take joy when having fights and the popularity of these fights quickly expand into Fight Club. But under Travis' leadership Fight Club soon takes an even darker turn and it's up to the man to stop him and his plot.Fincher is a very skilled director and with Fight Club he gives audiences his most stylist film. He uses a lot of visual trick and starts to play around a lot more with the camera. He shows confidence with CGI and the nature of how it was used was fitting for the film. There is a dark style and tone throughout, Fincher does not hold back the violence or some of the more grim aspects of the film. There is a lot of dark humour in the film, particularly during the early part of the film. Fincher with a screenplay by Jim Uhls which is based on a novel by Chuck Palahniuk tell a very complex story and there is a lot of themes throughout. There are themes about people trying to find their identity, how the human mind works, criticisms of modern advertising and consumerism and how people could use it or become hypocrites, how a cult would function and of course, man's desire for violence and destruction. Despite it's title this film does not focus to much on the underground fighting. This is an intelligent film which will allow the audience to think.There is some excellent acting in this film with a great cast. Pitt and Norton were brilliant in the lead roles, with Pitt having a potent charisma throughout whilst Norton is effective as an everyman character of the piece. Bonham Carter was also great in this film and these 3 actors were a dream team together.An excellent film.",Fight Club
78,dfranzen70,Soap Floats,8,26 April 2000,"Ah, those six-pack abs! For those of you who have been begging to see Brad Pitt at his toughest and grungiest, here's your movie! The film centers on a semi-secret group whose members pummel each other senseless (and senselessly) nightly in seedy basements. The club's leader, Tyler Durden, is a charismatic, Zen-conscious, manipulative misanthrope - and those are just some of his finer points. The film's protagonist, played by the talented Edward Norton, is a hopeless office-boy schlep stuck in a depressing, dead-end job, existing joylessly in a vanilla life that is supposed to signify the everyday lives of us regular folk. The stark contrast in the two main characters is no accident, and we quickly come to realize that the narrator lives through Tyler vicariously, even as they both create Fight Club. What better way to learn about yourself and your fellow man than by engaging in a bare-knuckled bout of fisticuffs? Didn't these people ever hear of more conventional, less-painful methods such as primal scream or aspirin? So what's the theme of this movie? Well, behind all the blood and guts, it's about finding oneself. It's about deciding whether to live your life as an ant performing the tasks of other ants or to live your life in ways that only your imagination can show you. I think it's also something about becoming a better person through violence, a theme we saw in A Clockwork Orange, way back when.This is more than a mere fight movie, as its presumptuous theme indicates. Amazingly, with as much attention paid to the violence, there's actually room for a taut, creative script that's absolutely full of little nuggets of intelligence. This is a movie that beats you over the head with one theme (violence is good when used for self-improvement) while simultaneously sneaking in another, more clever theme. It's also got a fantastic twist right near the end, and if you see it coming - please shut up! The twist is reminiscent of another, even more popular movie (if I tell you which movie, then you'll more easily guess the secret), and if you're not looking for it - that is, if you're one of those who lets things happen in a movie, who doesn't try to guess each scene before it happens - you'll be shocked right out of your recliner. I finished watching this movie about half an hour ago, and I still feel a little uneasy - it can make that kind of impact on you.",Fight Club
79,ackstasis,A Great Film,9,5 November 2006,"If there was ever an award for the ""coolest"" film ever made, it is fairly certain that 'Fight Club' would emerge with the honours. With its slick production design, its rebellious attitudes towards consumerism and authority, and an evident parallel with classic Nietzschian philosophy, the film received the admiration of a large proportion of its younger audience. Additionally, a cast of talented and instantly likable actors, and an excellent electronic score from The Dust Brothers, excels this film above others of its kind.Edward Norton ('Red Dragon,' 2002) plays the unnamed Narrator, an emotionally-unsatisfied car-company employee, who is suffering from debilitating insomnia and feels as if his life is going to waste. He discovers momentary relief from his troubles through attending regular medical support groups for diseases that he doesn't have. However, his dissatisfaction returns with the arrival of another ""faker"" named Marla Singer (Helena Bonham Carter, 'Big Fish,' 2003).It is then that Tyler Durden (Brad Pitt, 'Ocean's 11,' 2001) enters his life. After introducing themselves on a plane, the Narrator finds his high-rise apartment engulfed in an explosion of unknown cause and, having nobody else to call, he seeks temporary lodging at Durden's crumbling and isolated residence.'Fight Club' is a superb film, and it's almost impossible not to like it. Edward Norton delivers a stand-out performance as the vulnerable and very confused Narrator, as he struggles to explore the notion of his own identity. This is a must-see film, and a second viewing to uncover the finer points of the story is highly recommended.",Fight Club
80,dee.reid,"A movie about fighting, cool!",10,18 May 2001,"That's what I thought at when I first saw the previews of this film back in 1999.  At first, I didn't pay much attention to these previews and and completely ignored it when came out on tape.  I didn't really get a chance to watch it until my cousin bought the tape and I watched it then.
It's about a guy who from what we know is simply referred to as The Narrator (played by Edward Norton.)  He's an insomniac(for those of you who don't what an insomniac is, it's someone who has trouble sleeping.)  So he come up with a cure, which is to attend group meetings.  Which almost immediately cures his insomnia.  That is however, until he meets Marla Singer (Helena Bonham Carter) another ""faker"" whose just there for unexplained reasons.  So his insomnia starts up again.  While attending one of his usual business trips, The Narrator meets up with a rather unusual fellow named Tyler Durden(Brad Pitt) who is also a very bad dresser.  The two quickly become friends and set up ""Fight Club.""  It's where men pummel each other to bloody pulps.  Soon however, it gets a little out hand and the it quickly becomes ""Project Mayhem"" which is basically a terrorist organization that quickly begins popping up cities across the country.  I really liked Fight Club.  It's dark, violent, and very funny.  It also contains some of the funniest moments I've ever seen in a movie that isn't really a comedy.  I should also say that some people may get the wrong idea about this movie and might set up their own fight clubs.Anyway, Fight Club is a great movie full of violence, darkness, and some very funny moments.10/10",Fight Club
81,meeza,Split Decision,7,6 June 2000,"""Fight Club"" is a type of film that will not totally knock you out with excitement, but it does go the distance thanks to some of its complex twists and turns. The movie is billed as Brad Pitt as its star. However, it is really the Edward Norton character which this film revolves around. To bill Pitt as the main actor, was a bit displeasing and just plain pitiful. This experimental story is about an underground fight club started by the Norton and Pitt characters. What I thought was worth fighting for was to have more of Norton and co-star Helena Bonham Carter dual scenes. Their chemistry was a unanimous winning duo! We just did not get enough of it. Also, I felt like throwing the towel a few times when I saw a bit too many long scenes that were not instrumental to the film's following striking developments. Finally, if you do go see ""Fight Club"" make sure you follow these two rules- 1) You do not tell anyone the ending of ""Fight Club"" 2) You do not tell anyone the ending of ""Fight Club."" *** Average",Fight Club
82,mjneu59,a dark comic male fantasia for the new millennium,8,17 November 2010,"As we approached that totally arbitrary year 2000 it seemed Hollywood movies were becoming darker and more pessimistic, or at least (to be more accurate) were being marketed to give that impression. A perfect case in point was this violent, cynical fantasy about disenfranchised men getting even with an unsympathetic world by bonding together to beat the living pulp out of each other.It's called 'Fight Club', and Brad Pitt is the charismatic psychopath who kicks it (sometimes literally) into gear, enlisting insomniac everyman Ed Norton into a netherworld of black eyes and broken noses. Pitt only wants his otherwise mild-mannered new protégé to embrace his own dormant masculinity at its lowest and most honest level, and in a sense the eponymous club is presented like the ultimate touchy-feely support group, offering members the epiphany of uncomplicated pain as an antidote to the numbing monotony of modern life.But what begins as a strictly masochistic form of macho catharsis soon devolves into an underground skinhead cult promoting worldwide anarchy and destruction. And if, after reading that, you suspect this is where the plot gets derailed, give yourself a pat on the back and a blue ribbon for eagle-eyed film analysis.'Fight Club' is a disturbing movie, not least because it can, at times, be a lot of fun to watch, in an admittedly twisted sort of way. Viewers are invited to chuckle in sympathy at thoughtless acts of petty rebellion such as waiters urinating in the soup at pretentious uptown restaurants, or (my favorite) the 'homework' assignment asking club members to pick a fight at random with a total stranger, and lose – not an easy task, as it turns out. And let's face it: who among us hasn't entertained daydreams of demolishing a tacky piece of corporate public art or destroying a generic coffee franchise (or, better yet, accomplishing both at the same time)? Boys will be boys, but a lot of that guilty juvenile pleasure gets pushed aside when the anti-establishment vandalism turns to wholesale sabotage and terrorism. It's too bad, because elsewhere the film presents a canny dissection of the American male psyche: not an altogether pleasant topic, but certainly ripe for exactly this shade of black comic satire. Few other movies have dared to approach the same subject with such unblinking candor (the closest recent equivalent was probably Neil LaBute's 1997 feature 'In the Company of Men', a minor classic of y-chromosome misanthropy), and none with this degree of microscopic scrutiny.It even begins, pointedly, at a subatomic level, tracing the feverish sparking of nerve impulses across poor Ed Norton's sleep deprived synapses. From there the focus expands upwards and outwards, targeting all the usual suspects of our late 20th century social stalemate: the credit card economy, the empty consumer culture, the slow brain-death of a television habit (of course), the empty paycheck at the end of another dull day's meaningless labor. ""This is your life, and it's ending one minute at a time"", says the desensitized Norton, a white collar wage slave unable to find any emotional release outside of other people's support networks: terminal cancer patients, adult survivors of childhood incest, alcoholics anonymous, and so forth.Until the fateful moment when he first crosses the path of kindred spirit/alter ego Tyler Durden, one of the more compelling anti-heroes (for better or worse) in recent screen memory, brought vividly to life in a typically extroverted performance by Brad Pitt. Durden is Norton's dark companion: a post-modern messiah preaching a gospel of enlightened self-destruction. ""Forget redemption"", he tells his disciples (although he doesn't actually use the word forget), ""we are God's unwanted children."" That's a lot of philosophy to swallow in one sitting, but over most of its (considerable) length the film successfully negotiates a precarious narrative tightrope between brilliance and pretension. Unfortunately the chosen method of discourse in the adapted screenplay by Jim Uhls is non-stop voice-over narration, the laziest tool in the arsenal any hack (and a pet peeve, to be sure). Movies work best when used as a model of visual, not verbal, expression, showing (or better yet, merely suggesting) the meaning of things, instead of artlessly spelling out the intended lesson in exactly so many words.To be fair, director David Fincher does his best to open up the format and have some fun with it, for example asking Norton to address the camera directly (spoiling Pitt's aim while he's peeing in the lobster bisque), and employing a typically hyperactive visual scheme stocked with every up-to-the-minute gimmick imaginable, all set to an effective electro-shock soundtrack by a team calling themselves The Dust Brothers. The sets are likewise dressed to the acme of stylish decay (an apparent specialty of Fincher), and attentive viewers will even catch some ultra-cool subliminal foreshadowing: strategic single frame inserts of Tyler Durden popping up at random, anticipating his first appearance by several scenes.But after setting up such a novel premise the script quickly runs out of first-person prose, having exhausted itself on hackneyed pearls of Occidental wisdom such as: ""the things you own end up owning you"", perfectly true, but hardly the most original observation. With nowhere else to go and nothing left to say, the story collapses quickly to a desperately over-plotted climax, losing the thread of its already subversive sexual aggression sub-text to foreground the 'Project Mayhem' conspiracy agenda, and finally introducing a ludicrous doppelganger dénouement too far-fetched for even an old Twilight Zone episode.Bottom line: it's a provocative movie at odds with its own ambition, leaning hard on a necessary crutch on black (bordering on tasteless) humor. Ignoring all the stylistic window dressing, the film is also more cynical, and in many ways more original, than anything since the pre-Lucas/Spielberg '70s: think of William Friedkin's 'Sorcerer', written for laughs. That, by itself, is enough reason to recommend it, but is this where one hundred years of screen art have brought us?",Fight Club
83,drqshadow-reviews,"Infinitely Quotable, Ruthlessly Unpredictable, Genuinely Unforgettable",10,11 September 2011,"What started out as one of my four or five favorite films has only grown better over time. Terribly marketed in its theatrical run as a knuckle-dragging modern rendition of Bloodsport, it's sharper, wittier and ballsier than almost any major studio film of the last two decades. It's a rapidly escalating thrill ride that never hesitates to crank the dial a bit further, and the progression from droll normalcy to vulgar aggression to unsettling calm in the face of a genuine revolution is stunning. On top of all that, the film's wit is off the charts, still intelligent and amusing after almost two dozen viewings. Its cast of characters is wildly varied, and its smirk- smeared musings on the nature of modern masculinity remain timely even today. I actually get shivers every time I revisit particular scenes, with the biggest one coming - reliably - just moments before the credits roll when that Pixies tune kicks in and the city skyline takes a new shape. That's what I call an impressive parting shot. A smart, funny, thrilling, unpredictable modern classic that never takes the easy road. I can't imagine I'll ever grow tired of it.",Fight Club
84,alindsay-al,A fantastic film that is more then just fighting,9,11 November 2014,"This film is considered a cult classic and it is clearly with great reason as this film looks at real life issues and it executes it fantastically. This film sees Edward Norton's character who is just an average person who meets Tyler Durden who is a completely crazy person and they start Fight Club which turns about to be much more. Edward Norton is great in the role as he truly conveys the idea that he is like us and a situation like his could end up to anybody like him and it helps make the character relatable. Then there is Brad Pitt's performance as Tyler Durden which is awesome as he is what every person wishes they were carefree and awesome, this is probably Pitt's wackiest performance and he is fantastic. Helena Bonham Carter plays the love interest and she does a really good job and her chemistry with Norton was really good also the guy who plays Norton's boss does a good job as he is the guy we are meant to dislike as he is the one who is holding back Norton's life. But I wish some other characters were more fleshed out and had provided more which is really the only reason it doesn't get a 10. The story is quite controversial but I love it because it focuses on social themes and situations that most directors wouldn't even bother looking at, also there is a twist in the film and it is a great twist that totally changes the film. The script is great with the dialogue between Pitt and Norton being great and some very memorable dialogue that is great. The style is quite violent but it is supposed to be as the story has fighting in it and it is also great because of the social implications. Overall it is a superb film that is fantastic and definitely worth a watch.",Fight Club
85,MaxBorg89,"Ladies and gentlemen,welcome to Fight Club...",10,14 September 2005,"There is a huge misconception regarding this movie: a superficial plot summary will dismiss it as a hyper-violent thriller with fascist undertones (in fact, Roger Ebert called it ""the most frankly and cheerfully fascist big-star movie since Death Wish""). Some even refer to it as a '90s version of Kubrick's masterpiece A Clockwork Orange, with added blood. Such descriptions are very reductive and misleading.It may be very violent at times (the most gruesome bits make Scorsese's movies look rather tame), that's undeniable, but Fight Club is much more than that. Its complex, non-linear and fascinating script (based on the eponymous cult novel) deals with revolution, madness, and yes, fascism on a certain level, and the film's greatness lies in how David Fincher, who had already shown his edgy talent on Se7en and is at the top of his game here, combines those themes to comment on our society. That's right, beneath the gore and anarchic atmosphere lies a carefully constructed, though not very subtle, satire on consumerism (as Brad Pitt's character puts it: ""Advertising has us chasing sports cars and clothes, working jobs we hate, so we can buy sh*t we don't need"").The film stars Edward Norton as a nameless, bored, insomniac office geek who's trying to find a meaning for his life. In order to do this he starts attending various support groups, even though he has none of the diseases (testicular cancer among them) dealt with in those groups.This is when he meets Marla Singer (an almost unrecognizable Helena Bonham Carter), a woman who fakes as much as he does, and accuses her of messing up his life. The real mess, however, starts when the Narrator runs into Tyler Durden (Brad Pitt): this guy claims to be a simple soap producer and salesman, but in reality he's a rebel, a psychopath who thinks people truly know themselves only after they have been in a fight. Together, the two create Fight Club, an illegal association where frustrated men in their thirties can unleash all their suppressed rage, as long as they follow some simple rules (as a matter of fact, writing this review constitutes a violation of the first two). But as everyone knows, violence creates more violence, and soon enough what started as an unusual way to deal with boredom becomes an increasingly dangerous game of manipulation and destruction.Said manipulation suits Fincher well, the dark, bizarrely funny universe he has created serving as a tool to reflect not only on the changing society, but also on film itself as an art-form. While the characters break the rules on screen, the director breaks them on his own work, frequently exposing the fictional nature of what is being shown (the characters address the audience directly, a pornographic frame Tyler inserts in a family movie pops up in the actual film). In the middle of this controlled chaos, Fincher can rely on a marvelous cast: Norton is mesmerizing, seamlessly moving from total apathy to fearful awareness; Bonham Carter still has to find a role as demanding, compelling and rewarding as Marla; as for Brad Pitt, he shamelessly steals the show from start to finish, perfecting the edge he had started to develop in Se7en and giving us his best performance ever. Incendiary and effortlessly cool, his only real turn as a villain is a mix of style, darkness and charisma that has been missing in every character he has played since..An absolute masterpiece, albeit one that demands at least a second viewing before it can be completely understood and embraced, Fight Club is one of the greatest movies of the '90s, perhaps even THE best of the entire decade.Totally unmissable",Fight Club
86,estebangonzalez10,Fincher's best film along with Se7en,10,29 June 2012,"""The first rule of Fight Club is you do not talk about Fight Club""I will go ahead and break the rule and simply talk about Fight Club; the 1999 film that I recently added to my favorite movie list. In my opinion this is one of Fincher's masterpieces along with Se7en. David Fincher has made some great films, but none have ever rivaled his work in the 90's with these two films. Both Se7en and Fight Club are among my favorite films and consider them superior to Fincher's other great recent films like Zodiac, The Curious Case of Benjamin Button, The Social Network, and The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo. Fight Club is an extremely violent film, but I don't think it's gratuitous because the movie really works as a satire and raises several philosophical questions about how enslaved we've become under the capitalist and advertising system, but it also points out the danger of anarchy as well. We've become materialist beings finding our purpose in our possessions and have left out the spiritual part. Sometimes we need to feel pain to remind ourselves that we are alive, and in a way this film works as a highly crafted metaphor. I loved the way the story was presented and how this surrealistic film worked. Based on Chuck Palahniuk's novel of the same name, and adapted for the screen by Jim Uhls, Fight Club is a masterpiece thanks to Fincher's direction and the performance from the excellent cast which includes Edward Norton, Brad Pitt, and Helen Bonham Carter. I really loved this movie from beginning to end, including the twist in the final act. 1999 was the year of great twists considering this is when The Sixth Sense was released as well (my all time favorite film). Fight Club is a must see film for all.The movie begins with a scene where the narrator (Edward Norton) has a gun forced down his throat by Tyler Durden (Brad Pitt), to which the narrator begins to tell the viewer what has led him to this point through voice over narration, and so the film is told in flashback. He takes us back to the days when he was an office worker who experienced severe insomniac problems. The doctor recommended that he visit a support group with men who have suffered from testicular cancer in order for him to really see the pain other people have gone through. Despite not suffering from this condition, the narrator decides to do so and discovers that going to these therapies allows him to finally being able to sleep for the first time in months. After this, he decides to attend a different support group every night and everything seems to go well, until he discovers a manic depressive woman named Marla Singer (Helena Bonham Carter) who is doing the same thing he's been doing: jumping from one support group to another. Seeing her as an intruder and a liar, the narrator can no longer find peace in the support groups and so his insomniac problems begin again. His life will change dramatically when he meets Tyler Durden, a soap maker, in an airplane and has an interesting conversation with him. They exchange numbers and when the narrator arrives home from the airport he discovers his condo has been blown up. He then decides to call Tyler and ends up moving in with him at an old abandoned complex. The two start a very different support group which they call Fight Club since they have to fight one another. The movement becomes popular and little by little they begin to form a revolutionary movement known as Project Mayhem, but things begin to escalate too fast and dangerously. Edward Norton appeared in the big movie screen during the 90's and this was when he made his best films (American History X, Primal Fear, The People vs. Larry Flynt, Rounders, and Fight Club), although I would have to argue that his best performances were in American History X and The 25th Hour. However he is still excellent in this film as well. Brad Pitt is at his best playing the sort of chaotic and anarchic character who in some ways is similar to the narrator, but in others very different and more dangerous. He has a strong pull on Norton's character and influences him deeply. Helena Bonham Carter also plays one of her best roles as this sort of manic-depressive character who stands her own ground in this mostly male dominated film. The performance from the cast is one of the best things about Fight Club which works in every level. The visuals and special effects are also fantastic. It is a dark film with a lot of violence mixed with satire that had me laughing quite a bit. I absolutely loved this movie and the ending was just brilliant.http://estebueno10.blogspot.com",Fight Club
87,sauravjoshi85,"If you understand this movie, you'll also believe the great talent of Fincher",10,21 May 2020,"Fight Club is a psychological mystery movie directed by David Fincher And starts Brad Pitt, Edward Nortan, Helena Bonham Carter, Meat Loaf, Jared Leto and Zach Grenier in the leads.The mistake that we all do while watching a psychological mystery movie is not understanding the movie properly and end up giving negative reviews. I myself had done this terrible mistake few times but now I try to understand what director is trying to project. I will also agree that some directors just delivers crap in the name of psychological mystery movie, but believe me this is one of the best mystery movies I've ever seen.Acting has to be strong in psychological mystery movies and all the three leads had done a great job and out of three Nortan was the best. Screenplay is gripping and keep you guessing about the mystery till the very end. The viewers who had seen the movie carefully would've guessed the mystery it in the middle of the movie as Fincher had given enough hints to guess the mystery.Background music is superb and supports the screenplay. Visuals are stunning. Another strong point of the movie is twisting and thought provoking climax as mentioned earlier that whosoever was watching the movie carefully would've guessed the climax.A humble request to all the viewers, please understand the movie and then express your opinion. If you still didn't like the movie you are free to express negative reviews, but in my opinion ""A great and thought provoking movie to watch""",Fight Club
88,r96sk,It's a weird one for me,7,13 January 2021,"I didn't enjoy this, pretty much at all, but still kinda appreciate how it all comes together. It's a weird one for me.Overall, 'Fight Club' underwhelmed me. I actually knew very little before viewing it, despite hearing about it on a surface level for years and years; well, one 'regulatory' part of it anyway. It's much deeper than I had expected. Unfortunately, I didn't find entertainment with any of it - it was, to be honest, a slog to sit through.The only scene I can remember enjoying is the very last one, and I don't mean that negatively because the end shot is terrific. It's just everything that comes before didn't do anything for me. Yet, I still rate its intentions. It did keep me guessing amidst my, near, boredom and the 'event' is a good one on paper. It just failed to connect on me in actuality.Brad Pitt is good as Tyler, though the likes of Edward Norton and Helena Bonham Carter give meh performances in my opinion. Meat Loaf is interesting, I guess, as Bob.I'm evidently in the extreme minority with my thoughts, each to their own, but I honestly didn't get into it sadly. As noted, though, I still partially rate it weirdly. 6* feels harsh, so I give it 7*.",Fight Club
89,dwpollar,Off-the-wall strange production...,8,16 February 2003,"1st watched 2/16/2003 - 8 out of 10(Dir-David Fincher): Off-the-wall strange production that is basically about a middle-of-the-road man trying to change things in his life and the world around him by becoming his ultra-ego.  Yes, it is about a fight club and it does have Brad Pitt in it and this is basically all we're told about this movie by the sales people.  This movie is so much more than that!  It is definetly one that needs to be seen again to get a full understanding of what's going on. It seems simple enough in the beginning, kind of.  The middle-of-the-road guy meets an off-the-wall free spirit in Brad Pitt and then becomes further and further involved in his life.  They start a club together to basically get out our frustrations from daily life by pummeling our fellow man and then living to go another round.  The association becomes more and more complex and increasingly more specifically focused on corporate america until a wild finale with the two men, who are really one man, duking it out on each other to the very end until one side wins over the other.  The romantic interest, played by Helena Bonham Carter is kind of just thrown into the middle of this whole mess but sticks with the one man until the very end.  If I've confused you, I'm sorry.  See the movie and you'll know why I'm confused!! But it's a good kind of confusion that I like to see in films of unique quality like this one and the more publicized Memento.  It's amazing that this was distributed by one of the big boys(20th Century Fox) despite it's uniqueness.  I guess, Brad P. threw some of his money in on this one.",Fight Club
90,noralee,Scary Imagining of What A World Without Women Would Be Like,9,21 December 2005,"The ads for ""Fight Club"" are completely misleading. While ""Variety"" is probably right to call it ""the anti-date movie,"" the promos I saw gave absolutely no indication that in fact it's a social satire in a similar vein to ""American Beauty,"" and likewise turns into a psychological thriller.It's Robert Bly's ""Iron Johns"" taken to the extreme, only they're in the basement and then out in the cities instead of in the woods, which seems inevitably to result in ""Lord of the Flies."" If you only see the trailer you'll think it's a gratuitous violence-fest. Brad Pitt uses his bronzed and buffed movie-star image for specific effect, and the script even has him referring to the irony of celebrity-worship (though I wouldn't be enthralled if very young hunk-seekers would throng to see it). Helena Bonham Carter is in it only to try and convince us that the guys are straight, despite all the gleaming homo-eroticism splashed all over the screen.Edward Norton, of course as usual, is spectacular, with reminders of his ""Primal Fear"" role.While the novel probably worked better in leaving more to the imagination, the cinematography does very well at making the dark side visual in a world that could be today, could be sometime in the near future in some city. The next urban step would be as portrayed in ""Blade Runner.""Certainly it's not a very hopeful view of what a world of only men, without women, would be like, so it plays into the hands of feminists, rather than rebelling against them. It could scarily be an argument for frequent wars to serve as a release valve, if today's video wars don't even do that. Or maybe just ""Rollerball"" as a solution.(originally written 10/18/1999)",Fight Club

This one is very popular and many friends from different countries are quite often talking about this movie so you should watch it to be able to discuss about it. I'm one of the rare people who don't give 9 or 10 points because I know weirder non mainstream movies with better twist, but from the popular ones of the genres, this one may be the most interesting movie and become somehow a kind of drug you get addicted to which may introduce you to other movies of the genre, for example the movies of David Lynch or Shyamalan or the real underground stuff.",Fight Club

95,TOMNEL,"Stylish and fun throughout, but emotionally uninvolving.",8,28 September 2008,"Fight Club has gained a huge fan base, now making it in the Top 30 films of all time according to Internet Movie Database users. I disagree with that, but this was still one of the best looking movies I've ever seen. Never has violence been so elaborately shot and planned out.The Narrator (Edward Norton) is a soap salesman who also happens to be an insomniac. He never gets sleep and because of this, he's always in a dream like state. He begins going to meetings for various problems, including testicular cancer and tuberculosis which gives him a gratified feeling which makes him feel better and in turn get more sleep. His sleeping stops when Marla (Helena Bonham Carter) starts going to the meetings despite that she has no problems and no reason to be there. He grows a crush on her. The Narrator later meets Tyler (Brad Pitt) who tells him about a way to get anger out, Fight Club, where men come and fight, not to hurt each other, but to get their rage out. Things get out of control as Tyler does.The direction here is really great. Extremely stylized fighting scenes that are both painful and real, and a mixture of computer animated effects that fit in perfectly. Brad Pitt and Edward Norton are excellent leads and play off each other. Neither really shines over the other, the both give memorable performances. The music, though nothing too great to listen to separately, works fine here. It mostly consists of techno dance style music.I didn't find this movie very emotional at all. It wasn't style over substance, because their was a lot of substance to go along with the unique style, but the characters, who were likable, were not particularly emotionally involving. If something happened to them, I'd miss the actors presence over the character themselves.This is a very stylish film with as much gruesome violence as it has brains. A lack of a large heart brings it down a notch, but even with that, this isn't completely heartless, and it's great to watch.My rating: *** out of ****. 140 mins.

Whether its putting down the fascist ideals of conservative America, its speaking volumes about the pointless intricacies of wealth and status. Fight Club isn't about violence, its about the expunging of shallow capitalist maxims and rebirth, an epiphany of real life.Granted, the film's own preaching can be twisted and used against it, but the inherent messages one can derive from such a film will be deeper and more meaningful than your trite romance or teen-sex comedy.

So deep and so intricate is the craftsmanship and the message that even on repeat viewings there's something new to take away from it. The commentary it makes on society and our place in it is exceptional. It's ability to capture the state of ennui of the late '90s and somehow make that perpetually relevant even 20+ years later astounds me.Pitt and Norton booth give tremendous performances that to the charts of films I've seen them in. This is the movie that first made me develop a solid admiration for their respective talents. The style and artistry are most definitely Fincher and they fit perfectly here. I love the way he makes the city a character without ever needing to identify it. He fully trusts his audience in every respect and doesn't feel the need to spell things out or spoon feed us at any time.Yup, hard love on this one. Definitely an all time favorite for me.

99,triple8,"Love it or Hate it, it is different!",8,11 March 2005,"I just watched Fight Club this week, I'd been avoiding it, mostly because I just had convinced myself I wouldn't like it. In fact, I was sure I'd hate it. OK-here goes-BOY WAS I WRONG! This movie is really really different, obviously very well made and now that I've seen it I can understand why it's ranked so high on the IMDb top movies of all time.Not to say I thought it was perfect. I did, as expected, have a problem with all the violence but that I expected and doesn't take away from the well written intelligent script, much in the same way as the Kill Bill movies which I felt the same way about. In fact, Fight Club reminded me of Kill Bill, not because the stories had any similarity whatsoever but because of the fact that their both violent, both (for lack of a better term) completely out there!, yet both very gritty and extremely intelligent. So yeah I liked Fight Club. I've read dozens of reviews on here and many mention plot and how it's one of the best movies ever made etc-so I wont even go there. What I will say is that Norton and Pitt are wonderfully matched on screen and I cannot imagine these two roles being played by anyone else. Were there ANY Oscar nominations for this movie? I don't seem to remember any which is a shame. Pitt's best role to date and maybe Norton's as well. I will say I can see where this maybe liked more by men then women. Most females I know have not and do not want to see this while most of the guys I know have seen it or plan to at some point. This movie should have been promoted in a different way because to many people think it's about nothing more then boxing and men beating each other up and that turns a lot of people off. Anyway:I admired Fight Club, I thought it was bizarre and frightening in a way and can see similarities to many movies from Clockwork Orange to Lord of the Flies. My one complaint is something that I haven't seen brought up a lot.SPOILER ALERT: I had a bit of a problem with the ending. I mean, as odd as this movie was, it wasn't over the top to the point where you roll your eyes or anything. But at the end when Norton shoots Tyler and it seems he has gotten rid of him and everything is gonna be OK... I was a bit baffled because if there was anything this movie wasn't, till that point, it was ""feel good"", and that was my thought about the ending. I mean Norton's character had multiple personality disorder and all of a sudden he was over it like that? When Tyler had been such a big part of him for so long. Now it is possible I misinterpreted the ending(I've been on the message boards and everyone seems to have a different theory about what the ending really meant.) But that really did bother me since that is a pretty serious thing and it seemed a little unrealistic the way it was done but hey this is a movie.Anyway, I still don't know if I'd rank this in the top 35 movies of all time but I have no problem understanding how this could be someone's favorite movie, it was very well done and is probably the type of movie any film school student should study(though I could also see how this wouldn't be for everyone). I'd give it an 8.5 out of 10. And I'll say it again, Pitt and Norton-both should have been nominated, great performances.",Fight Club
100,Spleen,Hang in there,7,21 February 2000,"I find it incredible how many times I've heard the following comment - and from professional reviewers! -: it begins well, but loses its way in the second half in a welter of violence ...Is it possible to be more wrong?  It's a very good film, but you'd never know it from the beginning.  Opening credits (and first shot): pointlessly hip computer-aided graphics that contribute nothing to story, mood, etc. Music: rock schlock drivel that makes you wonder why they bothered to commission a score at all.  Worst of all, the opening is stuffed to the gills with tacky first-person narration; and after waiting half an hour for the narration to end and the movie to begin, we find that it won't.  The narration won't end, that is.  The movie DOES get underway, but we must first suffer music, editing, the pretentious rubbish spouted by the narrator, and ... well, I suspect that Fincher has defeated his purpose by overloading the screen with gore, because most of us will look away and not see it.Take heart.  The story is a good one, after all, and the film's second half justifies most (but not quite all) of what we had to endure at the beginning.  Reviewers are wrong: there's LESS gratuitous violence towards the end; that is to say, less GRATUITOUS violence, - I wasn't actually counting blows.  How can I put this ...?  The film takes off and soars despite its flaws, and I should know, because I'm well aware of the flaws. It's a pity I can't say any more without spoiling things.Oh, and in case you were worried ... this is no glorification of Tyler Durden, or of any aspect of his character, or of Fight Club.

There's so much depth in the dialogues such as 'This is your life and it's ending one minute at a time' or 'We're the middle children of history man' or 'You're the all-singing, all-dancing crap of the world' and my favourite 'How much can you know about yourself if you've never been in a fight?'I would go as far as to say that this is an important film.

Also the actors are very professional and here we see a better Brad Pitt than what he was in ""Se7en"". The philosophical thoughts concerning capitalism, communism and society in general are very useful.The ending of this movie is clever, unexpected and original, but I feel like it was overlong. After we discover that Brad Pitt is his own conscience, the writer could just have showed some past scenes of the movie and finished it that way.

106,brando647,David Fincher's Best and One of My Favorites,10,8 July 2012,"I'm just going to cut to the chase: FIGHT CLUB is awesome. I wish the marketing for the film had been a tad more honest because I put off seeing this movie until almost a decade after it was released. And, even then, I only watched it because I was at a buddy's place and needed something to watch. I was totally caught off guard because I'd always assumed it was just some testosterone-fueled beat-down with some bare bones semblance of a plot. This was before I knew of the awesome that is director David Fincher or author Chuck Palahniuk. This movie is much more than I expected, it's masterfully done, and it's developed a bizarre following on the Web. I just think it's an awesome movie. It's become one of my favorites. The movie follows a nameless protagonist (Edward Norton) who narrates the film. He's an insomniac wallowing in his empty life when he crosses paths with a charismatic soap salesman named Tyler Durden (Brad Pitt). When the Narrator's apartment goes up in a mysterious explosion, he turns to Durden and together they form an underground fight club where men can let loose and beat the tar out of each other. The fight club is only the beginning, as the clubs gain popularity and spread across the nation. The members eventually devolve into a near cult status with Tyler Durden as their leader and the next phase of his grand schemes comes forth: Project Mayhem. Have I mentioned that FIGHT CLUB is awesome?The movie's got everything I could ask for: slick humor, brutal fights, a complex plot, and great characters. I really enjoyed SE7EN but FIGHT CLUB would be the movie that solidified David Fincher as one of my favorite directors. It's become a modern classic that I've seen on countless top-ten lists. The movie touches on a variety of subjects that brought controversy and mixed reactions from critics and audiences. The movie (or more specifically, the character of Tyler Durden) has become an icon for his anarchistic views and anti-establishment terrorism. His anger towards consumerism and our culture's obsession with its possessions is a powerful message, but his acts of domestic terrorism don't seem to hurt his cause much. There is a lot going on in this movie and, with its perfectly built reveal at the end, there is a lot to love here. Even knowing the ""surprise"" from the end before settling in to watch this movie, I was blown away. I love the dark humor in the movie, with some of the best moments occurring when characters break the fourth wall. The style of the film works perfect with the dark content and would become the first of many collaborations between Fincher and cinematographer Jeff Cronenweth with a visual signature that's easy to recognize. All of the elements of this movie come together to make one of the best modern films and a favorite to many (most of them apparently on the Internet). Really, I'm not surprised.I figure it's a given that Edward Norton is a talented actor. I've loved his performances in pretty much every movie I've seen him in. So there's nothing to worry about here as he plays the nameless Narrator, a corporate drone whose life has been much been sapped from him. Norton makes a perfect straight-man to the insanity he invites into his life. His introduction to Tyler Durden is both the best and worst thing that has ever happened to him. Durden is, of course, Brad Pitt. The best part about Pitt in the role is that it made me respect him. I'd always seen Pitt as your average Hollywood pretty-boy but his turn as a total lunatic in FIGHT CLUB proved that he had some skills. He's insane and totally charismatic. It's not hard to see how people could buy into his crazy anti-establishment preachings. He's equal parts hilarious and threatening with absolute confidence in his practices. And then there's Helena Bonham- Carter as Marla Singer, a walking corpse fresh out of a Tim Burton movie. She somehow manages to be attractive while slinking through the film looking like a meth addict. She's the ""not love interest"" to Edward Norton. A bizarre parallel to the Narrator's skewed views of reality. Finally, I have to mention Meat Loaf. Yes, for those of you who somehow haven't seen the film yet, Meat Loaf is in the movie as Bob. He's a minor character, but there's no forgetting Bob and hisuhdeformity. Good stuff. There's a hundred reasons to give this movie a chance so I recommend it. If nothing else, it's a great movie to provoke some interesting post-viewing conversation.",Fight Club

Their concept catches on, with underground ""fight clubs"" forming in every town, until an eccentric gets in the way and ignites an out-of-control spiral toward oblivion.For once, I wouldn't know what rating to give a movie. I could give it anywhere between 5/10 to 10/10. I'm very surprised to see that this movie is a special effects-filled movie and that it was a 1999 movie. I thought it was made way before that.The first act is wonderful and it's one of the best first acts I've ever seen. What goes down is its second act, where it turns very violent and forms an aggression on you (or at least, to me). It makes me scared if this film makes others want to fight.The third act begins to turn into a mystery and goes up to be a good movie again. With all the fighting, you are blinded from the truth: Is there a plot really going around? I mean, the whole first hour and some so minutes are pretty much a waste of time (which is why the movie is way too long than it needs to be). It makes me reluctant to give it a perfect rating.I wouldn't be surprised I got the twist ending while watching it because it has been done so many times before (well, at least three movies had already done it) but I still love the creativity put in it. There are so many funny and grueling scenes to see here! I love the acting by Edward Norton, who did a fantastic job. Brad Pitt wasn't as fantastic but was good. Helena Bonham Carter looks almost unrecognizable from her role so it was fantastic.Well, judging from the weak points to the strong point, I'll give this movie a 7/10. This film is really well made and I thought it might be one of the best films ever but nothing was really happening until the third act.",Fight Club

The Fight Club flick is a real decent screening of his terribly writing on to a silver screen. This is The worst film of all time in all instances, in all possible scenarios. Point. No arguing here. Nothing, simply nothing in this unimaginable horrific piece of manure gives any redeeming feature or any clue. Dirt, mud, muck, slime, blood, vapid acting, hollowness, emptiness, nihilism and a total waste of 120 minutes. Just. Terrible. It is so. Edward Norton gives a weak delivery, Brad Pitt does not help, too, and Helena Bonham Carter is simply awful. This is the key-word - awful. The whole Fincher's flick is just awful mess. Rating - must be minus 1000, but here 1- The Worst",Fight Club
109,Sergeant_Tibbs,"Wow, what a fun ride!",10,15 February 2007,"From the moment the credits were on screen I instantly fell in love with it.Fight Club has changed our lives and the way we look at it. You will see this near the top of peoples lists. That is because people think that this film is correct. Its up to you to decide. Or it could be because it is insanely cool, which it certainly is.Though it is not right to call it Fincher's. As the film is adapted from Chuck Palahniuk's book which I must add is just as great. This is Chuck's masterpiece. The main difference is the endings, Chuck's is a book ending and David's is a film ending. Making both perfect.The film has 3 parts to it, studying the character in which called the Narrator played by Edward Norton. The first part follows him trying to cure himself from insomnia. He finally finds a way to sleep. Crying in self help clubs. To completely lose yourself. He became addicted. And joined all of them. We lose track of time. And all of this becomes a routine. His boring job. Non-stop buying from Ikea, as it makes him feel complete. Going to self help clubs. Cancer. Parasites. All kinds of diseases he said he has. Although he doesn't have to say anything at all. But then, at the very moment, just when he had become comfortable, she ruined everything. She is Marla Singer (Helena Bonham Carter). She is also a faker. With her in the picture our narrator couldn't sleep. He then escapes it all by travelling in his job and spends most of his time on planes flying around America.Then he finds a man called Tyler Durden (Brad Pitt), a soap salesman he met on a plane. This then leads the second part. Then Narrator comes to his condo to find it on the ground. Everywhere. Smashed to smithereens. He then calls Tyler to talk about this to. This leads to him staying at Tyler's place but first he must do him a favour; one of the greatest lines in film history. 'I want you to hit me as hard as you can'. Fight Club is born. 8 simple rules for men to fight. To be born again. Soon a lot of men join. Tyler's place is a complete mess. The house looks like its about to fall down at any moment. The Narrator still goes to his job, face full of bruises. He no longer needs the self help clubs. Fight Club grows and Tyler decides to expand it. Just when Marla comes back into his life. Fight Club in itself becomes a cult, a new religion. Then homework comes into action. In which the men of Fight Club go out onto the streets and cause mischief. Which leads the mayhem. Project Mayhem. The third part. The adrenalin starts pumping. But I'm going to let you find that out for yourself.The Narrator guides us through the film telling us his theories and his feelings in metaphors. He is one of the greatest characters of all-time for his one-liners. Not because they are funny. But because they are influential. I guarantee a fan of Fight Club will have those words running through their mind. Tyler Durden also has theories. Yet he does not tell us. He tells the Narrator. We hear. And we believe. Somehow the viewers believe Tyler. He speaks in such a mature way with evidence. His theories are on humanity and manhood. He believes that we are loosing the plot, the original plan for the human race. And the way to get better, is to start again. Marla invades The Narrators life as she feels incomplete too.The depth of the film is incredible and occasionally unrecognized. It's about becoming a man. A real man. The hunter man. The man who will kill. Fighting is just practice. When they take a swing to another man in fight club they are going back to their roots. Not personal roots exactly, but general roots of the gender. It's not pointless violence. It's meaningful. This is why teenage boys love the film so much, not because its cool, but because they can relate to it as they go through puberty. If I were to explain another depth to the film it would be a spoiler so I am going to let you find out for yourself...The cinematography is amazing. The screenplay makes it enjoyable every time and never get old; this means you will soon know all the lines. I love the score, it fits so well. The gritty atmosphere and dark humour make this re-watchable and keeps you watching. The acting is brilliant, and I must say cool. I couldn't imagine anyone else playing these parts. Pitt plays the performance of a life-time, he will always be remembered for Tyler Durden.This has already become a cult classic and a favourite by many. I recommend you join the club if you haven't seen it already, as you will probably not be able to resist.It doesn't get any better than this.10/10",Fight Club

One night, he visits a support group for testicular cancer victims, where they assume that he, too, is a victim, and he spontaneously weeps into the nurturing arms of another man, finding a ""freedom"" that euphorically relieves his insomnia. He becomes addicted to participating in support groups of various kinds, always allowing the groups to assume that he suffers what they do. However, he begins to notice another impostor, Marla Singer (Helena Bonham Carter), whose presence disturbs his bliss. The two negotiate to avoid their attending the same groups, but, before going their separate ways, Marla gives the narrator her phone number. On a flight home from a business trip, the narrator meets Tyler Durden (Brad Pitt), a soap salesman with whom he begins to converse after noticing the two share the same kind of briefcase. After the flight, the narrator returns home to find that his apartment has been demolished by an explosion. He calls Tyler and they meet at a bar. A conversation about consumerism leads to the narrator moving into Tyler's dilapidated mansion. Outside the bar, Tyler requests that the narrator hit him, which leads the two to engage in a fistfight. They have further fights outside the bar on subsequent nights, and these fights attract growing crowds of men.

112,m-47826,It used to be pertinent...,1,11 August 2020,"Twenty years ago. Back when directors made « weird » movies, to appeal to teenagers, who needed more of everything. Even things they didn't know they needed. Today, Fight Club got stale. And the rest of the « trend » look like master pieces of subtle writing, compared to it. I tried rewatching it the other night, and what a chore it was. I already knew the twist ending, plus I forgot how chatty and drawn out the script was. Everything that used to be « cool » about the movie, is now outdated and ridiculous. For example, the scene where the « hero » blackmails his boss. It wouldn't work today, too much technology. But did it ever? If I remember correctly, surveillance cameras existed back then. So how was it even possible to pull that off? That's why I rated it this low. It wasn't a bad movie back then. It just isn't working outside of its scope. Call me naive, but isn't a good movie supposed to pass the test of time, and leave a mark? Well this one clearly failed at both. Also, the acting is a bit off at times. Especially Brad Pitt's. And none of the characters are remotely likeable, let alone redeemable.",Fight Club

114,DeeNine-2,Shocking the burghers; energizing the proles,8,28 August 2003,"(Note: Over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book ""Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote!"" Get it at Amazon.)Director David Fincher, who brought us into the extraordinarily depraved serial-killer world of Se7en (1995), fires up the shock cauldron again with this high testosterone examination of our primal need to seek adrenaline highs through physical violence. Indeed, the message is we are not really alive unless we are involved in something extreme.Ed Norton plays the Narrator, a corporate structure clog with insomnia who gets off (and finds the arms of Morpheus) by going to therapy groups for people with cancer, disfigurement, drug addiction, etc. The idea is that seeing the acute and terrible misery of others affords him a catharsis that clears the neuro-emotional blockage and allows him to relax enough to get some sleep.But after a while he begins to notice Marla Singer (Helena Bonham Carter--no relation to Hillary Rodham Clinton) hanging out at some of the meetings. Her hair and eyes are black widow black, all the better to set off her pasty white skin, giving her a witchy/sexy allure that really in itself ought to excite Norton's deadened neurons. (I know she excited mine.) But instead what her presence at the talk-therapy sessions does is remind him that he isn't really suffering like the others, and once again he has insomnia.Meanwhile he meets Tyler Durden (Brad Pitt) a handsome and virile beauty soap salesman who is quick with the banter and has the confidence of a demi-god, something Norton's character lacks. They become best buds (and a bit more) after Durden introduces him to the full-out adrenaline rush of getting your face pounded in. As the fight club scenes unfold, getting more and more ridiculous with each bone-crunching punch and each darkening pool of blood, more and more young men join the club allowing Tyler Durden to become an underground hero and charismatic leader of human sheep dressed in black. By the way, the real truth of the postmodern cowboy fisticuffs is that the participants couldn't even stand the injury to their hands from one punch, let alone the repeated blows to face, head and body.But never mind. There's a lot more to this movie than phony fight scenes. The strange thing is a lot of the scenes are funny! Somehow an aura of humor adheres to Fincher's street mayhem, rock-the-house sex, and body-slamming/bone-cracking absurdities. Not only that but the acting by the principals and Meat Loaf's massively-breasted Bob Paulson is excellent. Norton's confused and determined whimsy is nicely off-set by Pitt's brazen pathology. The story plays out well with some nice surprises and some good tension. You will not be bored.Philosophically speaking too there is more than a grain of truth in the thesis: we really are divorced to some extent from our primal nature. We are animals who have domesticated ourselves. A return to the jungle (for example, by watching this film) energizes us and reminds us that part of our nature is largely incompatible with civilization.Be forewarned however that this is a grossly violent movie that is difficult to watch at times. Fincher's primary intent is to shock, and he works hard at that. The scene at the back alley of a liposuction clinic as our boys are dumpster-diving for soap ingredients is particularly grossitating. When one of the bags holding human fat gets snagged on a barbed wire fence, it bursts, dripping it contents onto the Narrator.If you can stand this sort of thing, watch and be beguiled or revolted, but first, please send the kiddies to bed.",Fight Club
115,SusieSalmonLikeTheFish,"It's not the concept, it's the way the film presents it",1,17 January 2017,"Fight Club is that one film you always hear about in colleges and universities, hailed as some sort of 'stick it to the man rebellion' story with all these pretentious meanings that apparently need to be analyzed in great depth to the point where I can't start a conversation about films without hearing Fight Club come up at least once. Pseudo-intellectuals, perverts, frat boys and emos all get obsessed with this one like moths to a flame. Of course, it would be the most spoiled, coddled and secure of society's demographic that enjoy Fight Club because they say it speaks so much to the hurt and anger they apparently experience on a day-to-day basis. I'm sure they'd change their tune and perhaps value humanity over themselves more if they'd grown up in earlier eras, but that's getting rather off-topic.Fight Club is not a terrible film. It has interesting characters, a decent plot and it follows the original book very well. The soundtrack is dated, the themes are dated, the dialogue is vulgar simply for the sake of being vulgar, and the entire thing as a whole is just trying way too hard to appeal to a certain type of entitled, self-absorbed and immature Generation X/ Millennial crowd (although really I think films are subjective and can be enjoyed by anyone). Fight Club is offensive in every sense of the word, disgustingly crass at times, weird, overly long, and yet I still liked it - but I think it's incredibly overrated for what it is, and I don't think the viewers of it really seem to grasp the full idea it was trying to put out there.The film is more or less a very nihilistic portrayal of a young man rebelling against modern corporate capitalism and society in general by forming an underground fight club with his SPOILER ALERT!!! imaginary friend and alter-ego Tyler Durden. Durden is a character, but at the same time an embodiment of everything bad, wasteful, annoying, volatile, cruel, narcissist and utterly pointless albeit intellectual that the main character himself is putting out into the world by his own attitude. Anarchy and rebellion, and the aftermath of them, remains one of the biggest themes in Fight Club alongside being an entertaining comedy. However, many viewers of the film just pick up on the vulgar one-liners about women and masturbation and sex, the heavy violence and Tyler's selfish view that humans exist to please themselves, not to care about others, and that the world, everything and everyone in it is just a game to be played. Viewers of Fight Club I've noticed retain the idea that if you show emotion, compassion, pity, sadness or kindness, you're an overly sensitive baby. ""Real men"" cause chaos, have sex constantly, swear their mouths off, go out of their way to offend others and don't give a damn about anyone else but #1. And naturally, when the main character grows up and matures slightly in the end, people find this confusing. Basically, the main character thought he knew how cruel and ugly the world was, but he was just a bored kid and a hypocrite. In fact, the majority of young adults are hypocrites who think the world revolves around them and their views. I was that way when I was that age, too. I went through a ""pro-pollution"" phase where I littered on purpose and refused to recycle. Why? Just to stir up trouble. I went through a goth phase where I wore black lipstick and thick black eye makeup to make a panda bear green with envy. Why? Just for shock value and to tick off my teachers. I went through an emo phase, cutting my arms with plastic cutlery and dying my hair black with pink streaks, listening to depressing music and whining about being depressed, while the popular blonde cheerleader sitting in the desk next to mine really WAS suicidal and it went totally unnoticed. Why? Because I was too wrapped up in my own teenage angst garbage to bother helping anyone or anything else. I wanted attention, I wanted to be noticed, but looking back on it a few years later, I realize how insignificant it all is. All teenagers are dumb. I have never come across an intelligent teenager. I've come across many intellectual teenagers, but not intelligent ones. Durden is exactly the figure most teenagers, teenage guys and college guys especially, emulate....Okay, that's really getting repetitive now. Like the films 'Donnie Darko' and 'A Clockwork Orange', I think the themes of chaos, nihilism and anarchy are important, but Fight Club is so overrated for what it is. How it has such a high rating over films like 'The Killing Fields' and 'Threads', I'll never understand. Reviewers keep raving about its aesthetics and its depth, but it's no more deep than many other films. ANY film with a social commentary is considered ""deep"". Fight Club I think just hit the world at the right time, plus it's making a comeback for many nostalgic hipsters, so it will definitely continue to be highly regarded for many years to come, which is not necessarily a bad thing, yet Fight Club shares what, exactly, with the world? Young adults are jerks? Have I missed some vital bit of info to make Fight Club so popular and beloved, or what?",Fight Club
116,sme_no_densetsu,Possibly Fincher's finest,8,2 September 2013,"David Fincher's ""Fight Club"" is based on the novel of the same name by literary provocateur Chuck Palahniuk. It tells the story of an insomniac office worker (Edward Norton) who befriends a rebellious soap manufacturer (Brad Pitt). Together they form the titular 'fight club', an outlet for male aggression that evolves into a network of men with an anarchic agenda.One of the film's strong points is the adapted screenplay by Jim Uhls, which unfortunately went unnoticed at Oscar time. The script isn't exactly what you'd call conventional but Uhls managed to make it comprehensible without robbing the story of its depth. The ending might be a bit questionable but, overall, the plot is continually engrossing and unpredictable.David Fincher's direction is expertly handled, as always. The movie looks attractive from beginning to end and the concealment of the big twist holds up pretty well even in retrospect. In the music department, the soundtrack by the Dust Brothers is sometimes striking but is ultimately overshadowed by the use of the Pixies' ""Where Is My Mind"" over the closing credits.The film's two stars, Edward Norton & Brad Pitt, both delivered fine performances but I think I'd give the edge to Norton if only because his role was the more challenging of the two. Helena Bonham Carter made a pretty good pair with Norton, though she's an actress whom I'm not particularly fond of. In support, the only real standout is Meat Loaf, of all people.Ultimately, ""Fight Club"" isn't quite perfect but I still think that it's one of the most interesting films of the 90's. The fact that it currently occupies the #10 spot in the IMDb top 250 is a bit of a surprise since I'd expect this to be exactly the type of movie that divides audiences. In any case, it's definitely worth watching, though it should be noted that the film's appeal is probably greatest for young males.",Fight Club
117,Howlin Wolf,Mindblowing.,10,9 April 2001,"I've already had one (admittedly even shorter) comment for this rejected by the IMDB, so I'll be brief.  This is without a doubt the most incendiary product to hit the cinema's in well over a decade, possibly even two. 
   Brad Pitt's performance in this film makes me reassert my claim that he is one of the most under-rated actors working in Hollywood today, primarily because of his looks.  Ed Norton is also often overlooked (although not by many on this site)  It's nice to see Helena Bonham-Carter in a drastic change of pace from her usual merchant ivory stuff.   (ASTONISHINGLY MINOR SPOILER AHEAD!)   David Fincher continues his astonishing track record (the abysmal ""The Game"" aside) to create a film that will burn itself into your psyche.  As one of the characters says in the film: ""It's like that cut on the roof of your mouth that would heal if only you could stop tongueing it, but you can't"".   On a side note, I personally think the people who argue about whether the film glorifies violence or condemns it are wasting their time.  It is possible for a film to do neither.  Some films even let you do your own thinking! This is one of them.  If you're looking for propaganda or preaching, there are better examples elsewhere...

119,Screen_Blitz,An incredible thrill ride,9,25 May 2016,"There is a lot to be handed in this dark, atmospheric adaption of Chuck Palahniuk's novel. Ranging from the visceral storytelling, rollicking screenplay, and the mind-stunning flair of David Fincher's directing flair, this brooding tale stars Edward Norton and Brad Pitt in a psychological thriller that packs load of thrills and engrossing narrative substance while generating a powerful social message about violence in society. The film initially faced polarizing reception by critics for what was originally interpreted as an a glorification of brutal violence and moral ambiguity but was later redeemed by a wide acclaimed cult status, soon becoming one of the most talked-about (and controversial) films of 1999. Edward Norton plays an unnamed protagonist, a disillusioned white-collar worker who suffers from insomniac and finds nowhere to turn from his bored life. This is until he seeks therapy from not a sleep therapist but a support group of unfortunate men with testicular cancer, despite not having such. His time there helps him deal with his mental and emotional health, and it is all ruined when he is visited by mysterious woman Marla Singer (played by Helena Bonham Carter) and unintentionally exposes him. Soon, the protagonist befriends with an anarchistic soap salesman Tyler Durden (played by Brad Pitt) who he partners with open up an underground fight club where two competitors engage in a no- holds-barred hand-to-combat in front of the large crowd as a mean of therapy. However, as the club grows popular, it ignites to a widespread anarchy that leads to the protagonist discovering Tyler's more sinister plot.This David Fincher thriller packs a serious punch and leaves quite an impact from its excess of not only its gripping story but thrills that go beyond what anyone can label conventional. It all begins with the atmospheric visuals punctuated throughout each scene to symbolize a society on the brink of collapse. But there is much more to offer. The story bogs down into a gritty, hyperkinetic crime-thriller sparked by bold machismo elements delivered by scenes of brutal, cringe-inducing fist fights resulting in bloodshed, and a gripping message about the effects of violence in our society. The film takes on a mission to show violence not as a grueling recreational activity but a means of letting out the characters' inner demons. From there on, the plot builds up through a dark, visceral journey, leading up to a shocking revelation that is bound leave viewers stunned, though not as haunting as the finale to David Fincher's 'Seven'. And what comes of this masterful experience, deserves a strong memorable cast, an element the film greatly achieves. Edward Norton stands strong in his role as the central character, conceiving pure likability in his largely naive character battling against the moral ambiguity that threatens to tear him apart. Helena Bonham Carter is also quite resourceful in arguably one of her most memorable roles. But the biggest appeal arrives of course, from Brad Pitt as the anarchistic Tyler Durden. Though his character may give off a disconcerting vibe, Pitt delivers a performance that can be described as darkly funny and oddly charismatic, leading to what is by far one of the powerful performances of his career. Fight Club is an incredible experience put together by the astounding mind of director David Fincher. Full of thrills, visceral themes, and overall surprising social commentary; this film puts on a stunning cinematic thrill ride that's not easily forgotten. Though the violent material and gritty anti-social theme are enough to push sensitive viewers away, it's not easy to deny this packs a punch.",Fight Club
120,Pumpkin_Man,Highly Overrated!!!,4,10 June 2015,"Last night was the very first time I have ever watched this movie. One of my Facebook friends bought me a copy because I had never seen it. I knew this movie had a cult following and after finally watching, I'm trying to understand why. Maybe if I watched it several more times, it'll grow on me, but I have a feeling I won't for quite a while. It wasn't all bad. It did have some decent and funny moments. I liked Helena Bonham Carter's character. The middle half of the movie was probably the best, but it went down-hill for me when the 'fight club' basically turned into a cult and the weird twist involving Brad Pitt's character. Edward Norton stars as a traveling automobile company employee who suffers from insomnia. He's known as The Narrator because he visits support groups to see how other people suffer. He eventually meets a woman a lot more miserable than him named Marla Singer. After his apartment explodes, he calls up Tyler Durden, a man who he befriended on a plane.

Fight Club is so lame that it's not funny.*spoilers*So, the Brad Pitt character doesn't exist. He's just what the Ed Norton character wishes he could be. This means that all them scenes with Norton fighting with Brad Pitt was actually just Norton physically fighting with himself! Huh? And they want us to believe that the fight club began with other guys interested in joining one guy who keeps fighting with himself? If I see a guy fighting with himself, I won't try to join in but run. Run away as fast as possible.The whole basis of the ""story"" is so lame, it's not to be believed. It's equivalent to an entire episode of Star Trek taking place in the freaking Holodeck. It's like an entire season of Dallas brushed off because Bobby's death was all but a dream.There's no emotional pay-off to all the insanity going on screen. And because of this, the whole idea of Norton's dementia, something that could have been emotionally overwhelming, simply becomes tired and cheap. David Fincher's direction is to blame here. He uses layers and layers of cinematic techniques which belie the whole resolution of the story: Norton talking directly to the screen; Norton's annoying voice-over (oh, please stop talking!); the movie begins when the story ends and by the end of the film we are then guided back by Norton to where exactly the ""real"" story began (which is bunk because at the end, Norton is acutely aware that the Tyler is a figment of his imagination and yet throughout the film his voice-over gives no hint that Tyler is not real); tons o' red herrings in the storyline that are there just to hide the fact that there's no story here, folks. Loads of techniques usually reserved for more whimsical stuff simply don't belong here. And add to this pot-pourri of directors' tricks a gazillion gratuitously flashy scenes just to distract the (MTV) jaded audience long enough here and there for nanoseconds and you basically have what Fight Club is: lame.Fincher's direction is set on overkill. Fight Club is an extremely overdirected movie. For instance, the opening credits. Now why the use of crappy, flashy CGI effects when a standard opening credit would have been sufficient? No reason but to be (very) showy. Fight Club is overdirected, overwritten, overacted, overly clever for its own good, over EVERYTHING, with a lame, nonexistent story at its center!",Fight Club
122,gianmarcoronconi,Wonderful,10,15 October 2021,Wonderful film that at first glance looks like a very banal action film but then turns out to be a great psychological drama that deals with very heavy and deep themes and does so in a raw and violent way.,Fight Club
123,RNMorton,I don't think so,4,23 May 2003,"*Spoiler I guess*  Violent film about manly therapy through secret fight club has good start, intriguing premise and sharp actors but founders about Round 6 and ultimately is out on a TKO.  The wrap up is about as plain stupid as it gets and essentially invalidates everything before it.  I don't mean to be harsh, but who the heck is voting on these movies on Imdb?

124,bobsgrock,"Disturbing and brutal, yet has a distinct message.",10,3 June 2008,"After viewing Fight Club, a lot of ideas will run through your mind. This is the sign of a great film. It doesn't just entertain and hold you in suspense; any simple, ordinary film can do that. David Fincher's extraordinary tale about male aggression and the oppression we face from everyday marketing and materialism takes all this to another level, pushing us to the very maximum that we are able to handle. It all starts out so simple and dark: a nameless, obsolete insurance worker sleepwalks through his life all the while working a job he hates to buy crap he doesn't need. He needs a change and the audience knows this as well. For the first 30-40 minutes of the movie, we get a dark tone of political and social satire that really makes you think of what kind of film this is. Then, it all changes. Just like Edward Norton's character, our entire experience is jolted when Brad Pitt's Tyler Durden steps into the frame. For the rest of the running time, we are thrown and tossed about back and forth, helplessly watching this confusion and chaos bring itself to light. At times, we have to scratch our heads as it can get carried out of hand, but never does this film get off track and fall into obscurity. There is a clear message here, although it may have multiple explanations. Cinematically, this is one of the most brilliantly-shot movies in recent memory. Fincher's directing style is so clever and slick that it perfectly complements the settings and the acting. That being said, the acting is some of the best you will see in any movie. Brad Pitt is mesmerizing and easy to hate at the same time, and Helena Bonham Carter gives a strong supporting role. However, it is the work of Edward Norton that makes this movie memorable and stays with you long after it is over. In every scene he is in, and there are a lot of them, Norton perfectly captures the attitude and feelings of the Narrator. At first, he is depressed and out of touch with reality. As the story moves on, he becomes more aware and self-destructive. The audience also becomes more involved as we wonder where this could lead. Perhaps the most striking thing about Fight Club is that the premise is entirely plausible. It is not ridiculous at all to think that such an idea could spring up and alter the course of many peoples' lives. Still, this film provides more warning than suggestions. Simply put, this film is not just for entertainment value. There is much more here than meets the eye. Of course, not everyone will take it for anything other than face value. But, if you look closer and really try to understand this fascinating story, you will see a message; just don't be able to decipher it anytime soon.",Fight Club

126,Jeremy_Urquhart,You've never seen anything like this before...,8,21 May 2011,"Fight Club is certainly a one of a kind movie. It received decent reviews when first released in 1999, but seems to have risen largely in popularity over the years, and now sits comfortably in the IMDb top 20. I felt obliged to give this movie a shot after hearing the massive amounts of praise given to it by internet users all over the place.And I was pleased with what I saw.Fight Club follows an insecure insomniac who is mysteriously known only as ""the Narrator"" (played very well by Edward Norton.) During the first ten minutes of the film, we find out that the Narrator lives an uninspiring and empty life, with other people's suffering being his joy. We get the impression that the Narrator's life has no purpose, that is until he meets Tyler Durton (played by Brad Pitt in an unforgettable performance), who is essentially the man the Narrator wants to be. Tyler is loud, violent, and while his methods for solving problems are questionable, they often seem to work. The way that the Narrator and Tyler are almost complete opposites makes the film very interesting to watch.After the Narrator's apartment is mysteriously burnt down, he goes and stays with Tyler, who soon gets the idea to start illegal, underground ""fight clubs,"" places men can go to literally beat out all their inner aggression and woe on other men who are feeling similar emotional pain. From that point on, things start to get a little crazy and out of control, but to go into too much more detail would spoil many of Fight Club's crazier and more unexpected moments.Fight Club has some very good performances in it. Edward Norton and Brad Pitt, are great, and Helena Bonham Carter as the mysterious Marla Singer is also a lot of fun to watch. The soundtrack and writing are solid, and David Fincher does a great job directing this movie, injecting it with bundles of style thanks to some inventive camera angles and surreal imagery. Fight Club is a movie that can be enjoyed as simply a piece of entertainment, yet there is also a lot of themes and messages that may not be completely obvious to some one who isn't deliberately looking out for them. This helps Fight Club to be a movie that you can certainly watch numerous times (and trust me, you will want to watch it more than once).Despite my praise, I do have to say that Fight Club is not quite perfect. My one major complaint is that none of the characters are all that likable. Half seem to come across as whiny snobs, while the other half come across as extremely violent and brutal individuals. There are certainly no role models in Fight Club, and no clear cut black vs white either, just many, many shades of grey. The film feels very existentialist as well, as it left me with a slightly empty feeling upon finishing it. But then again, that may have been the film's intention...So while I don't feel like Fight Club is exceptional, I'd still be fine with saying it's a damn great movie, and one that I'd definitely recommend to any fan of movies over the age of sixteen. I also suggest buying it as well, as it's one you'll want to watch multiple times.One rule though: Don't talk about it.",Fight Club
127,baumer,A sign of the times,8,11 November 1999,"Warning: May contain some spoliers.I don't know if it is my generation that is more cynical or if it is just that I notice it more because I am part of my generation.  Were 20-somethings in the 1930's or the 1950's just as upset and had the same at-the-end-of-their-rope kind of attitude towards life and all that makes it go round?  I can't answer those questions because I am both too young to know and I also don't know enough about sociological histories of us as people to make an educated guess.  But I can guesstimate rather intelligently that there is a good chance that people weren't quite as cynical as my generation is because there wasn't as much to be bitter and cynical about.  I am not saying that people from past generations didn't have stresses and pressures but they certainly didn't have the same things to worry about that we do heading into the new millenium.  Credit card abuse and subsequent debt is out of control, banks are bigger and more powerful than they ever have been, the job market is paradoxically increasing and decreasing at a rapid rate, capitalism is still a great thought and concept for those that capitalize on it but it is cumbersome and burdensome for most others, computers are again paradoxically a blessing and then again they may be the anti-Christ.  The point is that there are so many new things to worry about now than there were when my parents were growing up.  And a movie like Fight Club in some subliminal and metaphoric ways address these issues quietly and then in other ways it is not quiet metaphors that grace the screen but loud in-your-face opinions and facts that bombard you and forces you to ask yourself some tough questions.  Movies like Fight Club don't come around too often and that is because not every movie or the people behind it have the intelligence and the audacity to ask such tough questions nor do they the smarts to make an entertaining movie to please the masses that may not want to see a deep film and nothing more.  Fight Club is one of the best films to come so far this year and even if it is perhaps 15 minutes too long, I would rather see a film that has too much to say than a film that has nothing to say at all.  Fight Club has a lot to say.Edward Norton and Brad Pitt play two completely opposite characters that are some how attracted to each other, not in the sexual sense of course, but perhaps because they are such opposites, one lives vicariously through the other.  For those of you that have see this movie, you will know how true that statement really is, for those of you that haven't seen it, you have to view it for yourself to really comprehend how true that statement really is. Norton is a bit of a repressed, yet seemingly average society guy that just exists.  His world and his life don't really go any further than his office and his apartment and his only form of social engagement is through the television and through self help groups that he begins to attend.  He doesn't suffer through any of the symptoms that the groups suffer with but this is his way of expressing himself, his only way of letting go.  Pitt plays Tyler Durden, a recluse who prides himself on living hard and living fast and having fun with what he has and laughing at what he doesn't.  He is also incredibly charming, ridiculously smart and clever and he is in the best shape that I have seen a guy in that has been in the movies, think of Stallone in Rocky IV but slim him up some and you have Tyler Durden.  He also has sex for what seems to be hours at a time and always pleasures the lady that he is with.  Norton seems in awe of him and they form some sort of friendship, and that is how Fight Club starts.  One night after a few beers they begin to fight after Durden tells Norton to hit him.  So he does and they begin this nightly ritual and soon other people come to their underground hush-hush fisticuff display and they too are there to get their anger and frustrations out.  The rules of Fight Club are very strict, and I'm sure by now we have all heard that the first and second rule of Fight Club is to not talk about it. I, as a reviewer, and film lover, like that rule so I will not tell you anymore what the film is really about or what it encompasses and what direction that it goes in.  Just know that if you pay attention to what the film is saying, you will get a lot more out of it than a bunch of guys pounding each other to a pulp.  This film is very entertaining but moreso it is intelligence personified.  It has opinions about our life, our lifestyle, our obsessions, our vices and almost everything that defines the times that we live in.  I don't think I have really seen a film like this before and I applaud it for having the guts and the intelligence to challenge it's viewers to think.  Sure, there are a lot of bloody and gory scenes in here but they are not really any more shocking than some of the other films that are out there these days.  Too much has been made of that small part of the film when what should be told is how this film will make you feel as you leave the theater and how it will stay with you in the days and weeks to come.  American Beauty did that to me and even though these are two different films, they have similar things to say but they just took different roads to get to a similar point.  And both are two of my favourite films to come out this year.  I hope this film does get some recognition at Oscar time, it is that good.  Oh yeah, and it has a really neat secret, you thought Sixth Sense was clever in that way, wait until you see this one. It's even better, I think anyway.In a year that has given us a lot of great films ( Blair Witch, Arlington Road, Instinct, Sixth Sense, American Beauty, Three Kings, American Pie and The Matrix just to name a few ) this is one of the best and it will probably make a lot of critics top ten lists.  It has made mine so far and if the race for Oscar goes as it usually does then this film will get lost in the shuffle as most films that want to be remembered at Oscar time get released later in the year.  But no matter, this is still one of the best this year and if you have avoided this film because of what you have heard about the violence, then my advice is simple.  Ignore all that and go see it for what it has to say.  You will walk out of the theater with a new look on what you see around you.  But then again, do you want to do that or do you enjoy living in the bubble of naivete that this film claims we do?  Think about it.",Fight Club

It's fresh, cool and perfectly captures the male angst as we enter a new millennium.

132,mentalcritic,This film should be compulsory for all psychology students...,10,5 November 2000,"It is not often that a film captures Christian America's need to define itself through arbitrary means so well, but Fight Club succeeds admirably. As anyone with a basic understanding of human psychology knows, there are a few basic drives that all humans feel a biological and psychological need to satisfy: food, sleep, and sex. None of these drives can be denied, and Army experiments to see the results of depriving the first two turned up some interesting results. Soldiers placed on low sustenance diets became obsessed with food to the point where they began hanging pictures of food items in their lockers. Soldiers deprived of sleep became obsessed with resting to the point where some attempts to deny them rest resulted in violence.Similarly, it is no coincidence that America is both the most sexually repressed and most overweight nation in the First World. Many young adults in America who are denied an outlet for their sex drive due to religious or societal considerations try to satiate this drive by the arbitrary method of stuffing oneself (no pun intended) with junk food. Fight Club simply took these three observations about how screwed up our society really is and translated them into real-world terms.This, in a nutshell, is the basis of Fight Club. A man who has become the definition of modern homo sapien's need to define itself by arbitrary means meets a man who has found a way to shed those things and bring his life back to a point where it satisfies only the three basic drives of all sentient animals. I experienced this in some form last year during a holiday. I could live without my DVD player and all my toys that I don't really need. What I can't live without is a sense that I am a free man with direct control over the direction of my life.It's amazing that this film works so well, because it is only a series of interactions between three principal characters: Jack, Tyler, and Marla. Everyone else is pretty much inconsequential to the plot, even Bob or Angel Face, in spite of how well they are played. The novel might as well have only had those three characters, in fact, so it is a real credit to the director and screenwriter that the latter two characters make any impression at all. Edward Norton is mesmerising as Jack, playing a role that would tie a lesser actor up in knots, all without skipping so much as a beat. Brad Pitt is excellent, and it looks as if Tyler Durden is a role designed to make us feel that we've finally found something he does well.The real surprise here, however, is Helena Bonham Carter as Marla Singer. This is a character that could have easily dissolved into an insult to all those in our arbitrary society for whom television and digital audio are simply not enough. Instead, Helena brings a depth and sympathy to the character that is completely absent from the story in its written form. Angelina Jolie be damned, Helena was really the most deserving recipient of a best supporting actress award here.If I had to pick any flaws with the film, it's that the story is a major contradiction of real cases of Dissociative Identity Disorder. It is rare for sufferers of DID to have only one alternate who is so similar to them, and don't blast me about that because I know real sufferers of the disorder. Compared to some real alternates I've seen and heard, Tyler and Jack might as well be twin brothers. Another contradiction is that those with DID cannot simply switch into an alternate personality and do what they wouldn't normally do as themselves. Hence, if Jack has moral objections to stealing fat from a liposuction clinic, so too will Tyler.However, these minor plot problems, which are necessary to plot movement anyway, are carried over from the book and are quickly overshadowed by the virtues of the film. All in all, I believe Fight Club is worthy of ten out of ten. One of the best films it has been my pleasure to review on DVD (and I pity anyone who tries to watch it on VHS). A definite ten out of ten film.",Fight Club
133,Stampsfightclub,How much do you know about a fight if you've never seen this film?,9,16 March 2008,"""How much do you know about yourself if you've never been in a fight?"" This tagline from Brad Pitt's (Thelma and Louise) character Tyler Durden is both intriguing and controversial, a great set up for one of the best psychological dramas of the 90s.Pitt stars alongside Edward Norton (American History X) who plays the narrator, a guy who is struggling with life and seeks solitude from self help classes. And one night, he meets Tyler Durden, a strong and powerful man who shows him what he can do with a little enthusiasm and force.As the narrator, Norton excels as he dives deep within his soul to reveal how depressing his life has become. Pitt's strong and forceful portrayal of Tyler Durden is excellent and shows the difference between the two characters. The opposites include the positive and the negative thinking between the two, the strong and weak and more so, the over thinking and the getting on with it mind set, a true portrayal of what goes on inside a person's head.From the director of seven, David Fincher brings a succinct portrayal of a person's mind to the audience with a fast flowing and consistent use of excellent shots. Fast flowing montages are used to create a representation of how life can go by quickly and the use of flashbacks is also a powerful motive to represent life and time.The brutality behind the fight club is strong and again shows an incentive that the mind can create.Helena Bonham Carter (Sweeney Todd) is also excellent in her supporting role as the depressed Marla Singer and the juxtaposition of her and The Narrator shows a dark side of attraction and togetherness.The plot is consistent and very succinct on its issues of violence and Pyscological. The setting s are superb, being especially dark creates the mood and tension which were definitely needed. Though I was personally slightly confused by the ending, it was a remarkable film and again, one of the best dramas that have ever been filmed.",Fight Club

136,gbheron,A Real Downer,8,20 January 2001,"David Fincher's ""Fight Club"" is a disturbing film, but being a David Fincher film, you expect it be. In a nutshell, Edward Norton plays a twenty-something white-collar guy drowning in the humdrum shallowness of yuppie life. Enter free spirit Tyler Durden (Brad Pitt), who is the opposite of the Edward Norton character, and knows how to turn his life around. Together they create a club of like-minded males who meet in fetid barroom basements and conduct savage bare-knuckle fights just for the fun of it.  It addicts them to violence; soon their lives revolve around the club. It's not just them, there are young men everywhere locked into low-pay dead-end jobs for whom smashing faces is just the antidote.  The club spreads like wildfire and begins to take on fascistic military overtones. And then there's a plot twist that will blow your mind. Sadly, two major flaws seriously drag down what should have been an excellent film. First, the amazing plot twist at the end of the movie (on par with that in ""The Sixth Sense"") doesn't seem to have the serious adherence to it's rules that the plot twist in ""The Sixth Sense"" had. (I must admit I've only watched the movie once). The other is that the fascistic, nihilistic, and misogyny of the film is actually celebrated, not ridiculed as many advocates of this movie assert. This disturbs me a lot, especially when you remember that IMDb reviewers rank it #40 on the all time favorites list. That's a bummer.",Fight Club
137,fwomp,Don't Read Those Reviews With Spoilers. Please Don't!,9,28 March 2010,"I have to admit from the beginning that I had never seen FIGHT CLUB before 2010. Yes (hangs head in shame), I'd heard all the hype and thought it to be just that: hype. Although I did notice that most of the kudos came from guys, not gals, even though the well-built Brad Pitt (INGLORIOUS BASTERDS) was liberally smeared on cover displays along with witty (and not unhandsome) Edward Norton (THE PAINTED VEIL). Hmm. So I finally took the plunge and picked up a Blu-Ray copy.Although brutal along the lines of GOODFELLAS, Fight Club is smart, funny, and exceptionally dark. It also has at its heart a (very) surprisingly good love story starring Helena Bonham Carter (SWEENEY TODD). I also think this is one of Carter's strongest roles. She is so beyond anything I'd ever seen from her that I originally had trouble believing it WAS her in the film.If you can get past some of the more gory scenes, I dare say that all viewers will be well-rewarded in the end. That's not to say you should dismiss the violence. Indeed, it is part-and-parcel to the entire components of the film and its incredibly awesome story structure.And this isn't the first time Brad Pitt and director David Fincher have worked together. In 1995 they did the excellent film SE7EN. If you enjoyed that film, you'll absolutely fall in love with this one. Fincher loves to play mind-twists but he doesn't do it in a heavy-handed way or even in a directly misguiding one (unlike M. Night Shyamalan with his groundbreaking THE SIXTH SENSE).Although the twist towards the end was enjoyable, I was an astute enough viewer to realize what was going on long before its reveal. Which didn't make the movie any less enjoyable. It was HOW the reveal was pulled off that made the film so amazing.Some of those who haven't seen the film might want a kind of blow-by-blow description ...and many reviews like that can easily be found. DON'T READ THEM! They will absolutely ruin the film for you. I have, in the past (and probably will in the future), given descriptions of films, but not here.

141,The_Movie_Cat,"""This is your roving reporter at the ringside...""",8,31 December 1999,"""You join us tonight for a title bout that I've really been looking forward to. Two grand fighters, The Narrator (who looks similarly like Edward Norton) and Tyler Durden (who bears an uncanny resemblance to Brad Pitt). I must confess to missing the first two minutes of the match as I stopped off to get popcorn, so I as enter the ringside I find the fight is already well underway.ROUND ONE: Norton leads the show as a man addicted to self-help groups. This puts his initial sparring on a shaky, slightly unbelievable footing, where his overstated jabs of ironic juxtaposition never really seem to hit the target. He runs round the ring stealing dream sequence and overlaid narrative tactics from recent championship matches, particularly the recent Trainspotting vs. Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels title fight. It's a shock that he would borrow heavily from some English fighters, but we must remember that the backer behind this clash is David Fincher. Fincher has worked well with English fighters before, most notably when they had their guts eaten out in Alien3.ROUND TWO: Norton continues to lead, and from the horrified looks on the judge's faces his pseudo-literary, semi-pretentious dialogue is a little too strong for so early on in a fight. Yet Norton is giving his all as the morose, nerdy, slightly monotone clerk and all the effort is there to see - in fact I've never seen such savage hitting.ROUND THREE: Pitt has begun to put up a bit of a fight, his boxing style an odd clash of macho thuggery and streetwise intelligence. However, his slightly effeminate tone of voice means he's not really pulling this particular style off, and it could cost him the match. Doubters at the edge of the auditorium, though, should be reminded that he pulled off such a style in Kalifornia, and he stole that bout clear away from David Duchovny. Yet it must be said that to win this fight he has to give it a lot more edge.ROUND FOUR: The style of the match has changed, as Norton and Pitt have decided to set up their own underground ""fight club"", where the reality of living is confirmed by the feel of pain and physical violence. Here Pitt really starts to rule the ring, knocking Norton back into a rope-a-dope by introducing to the match a subtle homoerotic subtext that Norton did not see coming. I really believe this could be the end of the match, especially as Pitt follows up this vicious assault by showing off his six-pack and sleeping with Helena Bonham-Carter.ROUND FIVE: The fight seems to be flailing in all directions now, the spectators being forced to pay attention by the displays of violent bloodletting with an art-house style, yet wondering how long Pitt can keep up his new ruse - overstated moralising and plot justification. It's anyone's fight now and we just hope they can stay the distance.ROUND SIX: Pitt has started to lose his edge here, and tries a ""surprise twist"" uppercut, yet Norton, like the rest of the audience, has seen it coming a mile off and effortlessly ducked from the swing. But wait - what's this? Pitt has delivered a second ""surprise twist"" uppercut, and this time NO-ONE saw it coming! Norton is down for the count! Never have I seen such a format-changing conceit in a mainstream bout - this has completely changed the whole face of the fight, and Norton is spending all his time trying to stay awake, reeling from one situation to another and bouncing off the ropes. Suddenly this has turned into a fight to remember.ROUND SEVEN: There's really nothing left of this match now, though Pitt does well with neat little jabs like showing off a billboard sign for Seven Years in Tibet, the bout that saw him flop both in the ring and at the titlematch box-office. There's also mention of the horror of sitcoms, and as we all now Pitt's girlfriend stars in one of those, leaving Norton no room to manoeuvre amongst Pitt's self-referentiality. Norton flails around with trying to overstate the ""ironic"" humour once more in the match, but Pitt has justified the entire bout with this final display. As Norton hits the canvas, this is not up to the standards of classic matches, such as the Rumble in the Jungle between Rashomon and The Maltese Falcon, but is still a fight that I think a lot of people are going to be interested in seeing and are going to be talking about for a long time to come. I thought this match was going to be won on points (8/10), but in the end, I have to declare it very much a knockout"".",Fight Club

143,rzajac,"After all these years, finally piling on",10,7 March 2015,"Just watched it again. Checked my IMDb ""Reviews"" list... surprised to see that I never got around to commenting on it!In a nutshell; one of those flicks that has a shimmering, gemlike mythology at its heart, and a Heisenbergian event cloud wildly thrashing about, to and fro, around that myth. The actual depicted events of the story often conflict, presenting sometimes rather smudged plot lines and character studies. Somehow, one finds occasional lapses in the storytelling. You can easily see how and why Fight Club was a popular punching bag for the cream of the cinema criticism corps. It is, plainly, a self-indulgent mess.But it has these saving graces: As stated above, it has a seductive myth at its core; the myth of the birth of an anarchist package deal, with praxis and theory seamlessly integrated. Beside that, you've got decent production values, a ""labor-of-love"" feel, some great ensemble work, and direction that strangely errs on the side of _Sound of Music_- style cornball(!).But I still remember the feeling I had when I first saw this. I talked about it, with friends, for months. Was I just an impressionable youth? Sure. At least, it flatters me (sort of) to think of myself as having been a ""youth"" at the age of 45!And watching it again, in 2015, I still sagely nod at key moments in the exposition. The mythology shines through like a nuclear blast through opaque film stock.Check it out.",Fight Club
144,bankofmarquis,Subversively Funny,9,7 May 2020,"The first rule of this review is that I cannot talk about this movie.The second rule of this review is that I CANNOT TALK ABOUT THIS MOVIE!So...I'm going to talk about this movie.David Fincher's 1999 mind-tripping epic about 2 friends who join forces to create chaos is not the movie that you think it is. Not even if you've seen it.Directed by one of the my favorite Directors of all time, FIGHT CLUB tells the story of Edward Norton's character (who's name is never mentioned in the film) who is suffering from insomnia and an all around lack of enthusiasm for life - that is until he runs into 2 people that will profoundly change his life - Marla Singer (Helena Bonham Carter) and, especially, Tyler Durden (Brad Pitt).This film was poorly marketed by the studio at the time of it's release - focusing on the ""FIGHT CLUB"" aspect of this film - and if that is turning you away from this film, then you are missing out, for the ""Fight Club"" aspect is only one sliver of what this film is about. This film is an incredibly funny parody of society and ""fitting in"" with over-the-top scenarios and characters masquerading as people and events in ""the real world"".David Fincher is perfectly suited for this work. He handled the pacing, style and subject matter with aplomb balancing seriousness and absurdity perfectly to create a subtle parody. It is a masterwork in that you don't notice his Direction - always a mark of a good Director.Edward Norton, of course, is wonderfully cynical as the Narrator. When this film came out, I went to see it because of him - he was (is?) an actor that (more often than not) picks quality material and delivers a quality performance. Brad Pitt, of course, has the ""showier"" role and he nails it. This film marked the ""coming out"" of Pitt as an actor for me - and he hasn't stopped (right up until his deserved Oscar this year for ONCE UPON A TIME...IN HOLLYWOOD). But, it is the performance of Helena Bonham Carter that caught my eye on this re-watch. Fight Club is one of those films that becomes a different film upon a 2nd (and 3rd and 4th and 5th...) watch - mostly because of the change in perspective of the Marla character. I've now seen this film multiple times and in this viewing it was Marla's journey that captured my attention. It is a terrific performance that is an optical illusion.This film is not for everyone - so be warned - but if you give it a shot, I think you'll find a richly rewarding - and subversively funny - movie going experience.Letter Grade: A9 stars (out of 10) and you can take that to the Bank(ofMarquis)",Fight Club
145,Angry_Arguer,Sudsy Existence,10,10 April 2004,"The Concept: 'Ferris Bueller' meets 'Apocalypse Now' meets AliceI have a profound respect for David Fincher.  I even found 'Alien3' interesting despite the hate club following.  'Se7en', 'Game', and 'Panic' are likewise interesting on different levels, but this is, hands-down, his best work.This is your only spoiler warning...This is such a detail rich experience that I don't know where to begin.  I shudder to think what Bruckheimer would've done with this material, especially if he'd given it to Michael Bay.  'Fight Club' has the sons of two of our best photographers (Cronenworth & Hall), the producer of some of DePalma's interesting material (Linson), and some of the most effectively layered writing I've ever seen.  Almost everything that could be covered IS covered with more skill than 'Beautiful Mind', 'Sixth Sense', or 'Matrix' had.I haven't seen this energetic of an opener since 'Catch-22' and, unlike 'Catch', that enthusiasm is sustained throughout.  Of course there are predictable elements like the ""circle of life"", ""illusion of safety"", and hyperbole sex--but that's not what held my interest.  Here we have a self-referential editing style: a method that is quick and skittish, (obviously interfered with) in a film that lambastes the technique.  I should mention the original sound design and visuals--'Blade Runner' and 'Beelejuice' with the skewed color scheme trademark of Fincher's work.  Must be Fox's way of making up for the disastrous 'Episode 1' that year.  Again, Bottin knows what Fincher wants and creates more beautiful deformities.This movie is about reality, abstractions of reality, memories, and surreality.  I hope Fincher will give us another glimpse of it, but--in the meantime--this will have to do.Final Analysis = = Learn from this...",Fight Club
146,Ruskington,The first rule of Fight Club: You never talk about how over-hyped Fight Club is,7,26 August 2020,"I'm not sure if it's just the fact that Ed Norton really grates on me in this film, but I never really bought into the idea of Fight Club being some kind of cultural phenomenon. Yes it's an innovative story, told via a strong script, engaging characters and intense cinematography. But is it really worthy of such high praise? Personally, I find it starts to fall apart halfway through and actually becomes quite tedious towards the end. Everything just becomes a little bit childish and contrived as the story loses touch with its base elements and the rage against the machine vibe takes over. I have huge respect for the way this film was made but, much like The Matrix, I feel like people attach way more importance to this movie than it deserves.",Fight Club

Also Starred Helena Bonham-Carter(Sweet Revenge) as Marla Singer and Starring Brad Pitt (Legends Of The Fall ) as Tyler Durden. There has been some controversy about the violence in this film but it is not gratuitous violence, it is part of the story and serves it well. It is much less than what you would see in your average Hollywood blockbuster. This is actually an insightful film although this film is much more in your face about it's message. If you are squeamish, you may not want to see it. There are some very painful bloody scenes, but if you can stomach it, then check it out. There is also a huge twist in this film that almost rivals the twist at the end of The Sixth Sense. And I must admit, it is the twist in this film that made me really love it. The best audience for this film is men in their 20's or 30's, but anyone that can appreciate film as a modern art should like it. One of the best films of 1999.

Jack is living a humdrum life until he meets Tyler Durden who changes it in the most dramatic fashion. I'll not spoil the twist, but the film does lose it's way a little towards the end.

149,mermatt,"Like wow, man -- deep soap dish!",5,15 October 1999,"This film is a nightmarish mix of PI, THE ADDAMS FAMILY, PSYCHO, and MATRIX with the old TV show ""The Prisoner"" thrown in for good measure. The theme seems to be that macho anarchy is the way to counteract society, social mores, and the social mask we all wear to cover who we really are.One of the weird symbols in the story is soap -- it cleanses, but not in a true sense. It cleanses only out of our vanity and self-destructive need to erase who we are. Heavy, huh?We get a pseudo-Thoreau blended with a psycho-Socrates rejecting phoniness by creating new phoniness and turning the Socratic motto of ""Know Thyself"" on its head. The film makes fun of support groups where people play ""who's the biggest victim"" by depicting characters who are tourists in their own life. Heavy again, huh?There's an in-joke if you look carefully -- Brad Pitt's pretentious self-discovery epic 7 YEARS IN TIBET is playing at a theater in the background of one shot in the film. This seems to be a bit of self-mocking that this movie makes of its own self-discovery journey.To sum it up, I can think only of a line from the wonderful actress Tallulah Bankhead: ""Dahling, there's less here than meets the eye.""",Fight Club
150,TheNorthernMonkee,What a brilliant concept,9,28 July 2003,"CONTAINS SPOILERSWhat a brilliant idea this film was. It's taken me many years to see this film & I'm glad I waited until now. A few years ago, if I'd seen it then (released originally 1999) then I know I'd have not enjoyed it as much as I did today. This film is pure genius.The original idea of Edward Norton as a miserable man in a miserable world who discovers a form of escapism is ingenius.Both Norton & Pitt deliver amazing performances (why is it that Pitt is best as nutters?) and produce brilliant opposites.This film does drift off a bit when Tyler's insane army idea begins to take shape, but the ultimate twist is a piece of genius which scarily fits into the film perfect.The thing I loved most about this film however is the way that Tyler has his one key Philosophy & looking back over the entire film, that Philosophy is apparent in the vast majority of it. Whilst I'm sure the vast majority of people here would agree with the idea that we need to loose the materialistic ideals of the world, Tyler doesn't comprehend just how much those of us who aren't material dependent need those who ARE material dependent. Society is built of different groups of people & those groups need each other to work. Anyway, I'm going off on one here & that's not relevant really to the film.The point I guess is that in general, this film is quality. Despite the occasional slow bit, this film not only makes people think, but it teaches us a thing or two about ourselves. Well worth viewing. It makes me wonder what other beautiful films there are for me to watch.",Fight Club
151,BroadswordCallinDannyBoy,The value of ideas,9,22 October 2007,"The opening shot of this film is a back tracking shot that first appears to be traveling through some surreal landscape. However, rather quickly you see that it going over someone's skin, meaning it must have been in their body, and not just any part of the body, but the head. The shot starts in someones brain and then moves out of it, which I suppose is analogous to an idea being born and released into the world. That's precisely where the main plot of ""Fight Club"" starts. Two guys, fed up with the consumer culture just decide to ""let go"" and release all the stress, by what seems to be, beating the crap out of one another. However, their idea goes quite far beyond an excuse for violence and macho showing off. It is easy to understand it that way, but, many violent movies are misunderstood. Mainly because people tend to look at the violence and recklessness portrayed and not at the fact that all that is incidental to what the film is trying to say.In fact, the film doesn't serve as an excuse to show violence, it warns us against it, much like ""A Clockwork Orange."" Violence is shown, in what can only be described as, uncomfortable detail. Men's faces are literally beaten to a pulp, others are thrown down stairs, and one especially discomforting scene has chemicals burning away someone's skin. If that wasn't enough, there are numerous acts of vandalism committed in every form you can imagine. Now the question is, how can such chaos be justified or condoned? The answer is that it can't. The Narrator and Tyler aren't good people, per se, but they aren't evil. A little mad yes, but certainly not evil. They also aren't just criminals, they are victims. Their bizarre course of action is the result that they feel they need to get back at society, not anyone person, hence all the anarchy they cause. Their terms and conditions for doing all this are highly questionable and difficult to condone, but that's the point. ""Fight Club"" isn't a movie that shows problems and brings answers to the table. It's a movie that shows problems and presents ideas. Once again, this is similar to ""A Clockwork Orange"" in which the hero (or anti-hero) is given questionable treatment for his out right wrong actions and behavior. ""Fight Club"" blurs that line of what is condonable and what is not a step further. Here nothing is out right wrong or obviously right. Everything makes enough sense that you accept it as the film progresses, yet it all seems like just a bit too much and the exaggeration is hard to pinpoint. It is just as hard to pinpoint as the ""right"" and ""wrong.""David Fincher previously demonstrated his ability to blur lines of reality and illusion with the masterful ""The Game"" and here his skills are in full display once again. Like ""The Game, ""Fight Club"" is hard to believe as real or that that something like it could actually happen, but the ideas it presents are important and more than worth examining multiple times. It is an often hilarious, often bizarre, but always thought provoking satire with a great direction from Fincher. The fact that the film was made with a big budget in Hollywood, is all the more interesting. --- 9/10Rated R for strong violent content. Ages 16+",Fight Club
152,FilmOtaku,Visually Stunning,9,21 July 2004,"Being a certain kind of film geek, I don't follow actors and actresses' films as much as I am a Director Groupie, and David Fincher is one of those directors whose films I will always watch, sight unseen.  One of the reasons for this (from me) high form of esteem is the film `Fight Club'.  There has been so much written about this extraordinary film, that I'm not going to go into anything specific about it, certainly not the `message', or the great acting by Brad Pitt and Ed Norton, or the brilliant screenplay.  What I am going to vehemently aver is that `Fight Club' is one of the most visually stunning films produced in the last two decades.  Fincher displays top visual form in this film and creates such brilliant and disturbing eye candy that it is almost impossible to absorb in one sitting.  There are many individual scenes (for one, the entire first 15 minutes) that are so great that I will just grab the DVD and pop it in to the player to sit and watch for a bit, trying to see what I've possibly missed the last twenty times I've seen the film in the last five years.  Like the time I saw `Gladiator' and got quite upset over some of the in your face, non-cartoonish violence and a friend of mine chided me with, `Um the name of the film is Gladiator', what did you expect?', `Fight Club' is a violent, disturbing film  the title, after all, is `Fight Club'.  However, disturbing and violent never looked so cool. Until Quentin gave us `Kill Bill'.  Fincher's slick video direction past is glaringly resplendent in `Fight Club', and while I don't recommend it to all, I recommend it to those who don't look for a structured film.  However, above all recommendations, I recommend that you read the book by Chuck Palahniuk first  it is a definite enhancement to the film viewing experience.--Shelly",Fight Club

I found Mr. Fincher's shot selection unique and creative in practically every scene and I found the story impossible to draw myself away from. Although I think Brad Pitt is excellent in his role, I believe Edward Norton should have got top billing for Fight Club.

Fight club's twist almost blew my mind. But not quite there.Edward Norton plays an office worker with insomnia. His life goes down when he meets Tyler(played excellently by Brad Pitt),a soap salesman who is kind of insane. Him and Tyler start up fight club and this becomes global. There is more to the plot. But I can't quite go into it because it will spoil the fun. Fight club is very funny, very interesting, and though it doesn't sound appealing it is. There is a lot to admire about this movie.Helena Bonham Carter, who I love, is in it also. She is excellent. Fight club is awesome and a unique film experience.

When watching it, my sister told me not to think about the twist otherwise it will spoil the movie. Well, she was kind of right. I thought of something extraordinary, something that Fincher might use. And unfortunately I was right.1999 was a great year for film. We have Magnolia, my favorite movie of all time, Being John Malkovich,which is somewhere in my top 5, Amercian Beauty, The Green mile, and Fight club.

162,skepticskeptical,Dick Flick with a Twist,8,16 December 2019,"The first hour of Fight Club is really a treat to behold. Very intelligent, funny and timely. Despite being twenty years old, it captures the post-modern moment very well and was perhaps one of the first films of this kind. Now they are all over the place (see Black Mirror, et al.).After the first hour, the film gets mired in this weird Dick Flick celebration of violence for the sake of violence--or, rather, for masculinity´s sake? Nonetheless, the film as a whole ends up working because of the surprise ending, which leaves viewers pondering until the end of time what actually transpired within the story world.My best guess (= most plausible interpretation) is that the Edward Norton character has slipped into a full-on psychotic state, whether as a result of sleep deprivation or drugs (such as LSD), or a combination of the two. One way to understand the film is as the extended hallucination of a madman attempting to make sense of his life and creating a fantasy to fulfill his frustrated desires.Very creative effort, despite my personal dislike of the overuse of violence.",Fight Club
163,Movie-12,"Brutal, aggressive, inquisitive, and insightful. *** out of ****.",8,14 June 2000,"FIGHT CLUB / (1999) ***Viewing ""Fight Club,"" the new drama by assertive director David Fincher, is like walking through graffiti-laden streets of a crime-ridden suburban city; it is dark, brutal, gritty, troublesome, and hostile. This film is all of those things, but in this circumstance I use such adjectives to the production's credit. ""Fight Club"" is a coarse, unpleasing journey into the lives of its narcotic characters, but it is for those exact same reasons why I find myself recommending the movie to audiences with strong stomachs. If this film was anything but what I have already described, we would be appalled at such deserving controversy and violent content contained. The hostility of  ""Fight Club"" is the main factor of which why it succeeds; the raucous style contributes in making a convincing, entertaining, and recklessly original story.Edward Norton stars as the movie's narrator, an insomniac spending his petty days working in an office and sleepless nights seeking out clinics in which he provides comfort to those less fortunate than he. One of the people he meets is an overweight but gentle pedestrian named Robert Paulson (Meat Loaf), a victim of testicular cancer. He also meets a sleazy, foul-mouthed drifter like himself named Marla Singer (Helena Bonham Carter).Norton's character development is quite unusual; although effective and versatile, the introduction, as is with the rest of the movie, is extremely bleak. It is as if the characters are creating an anti-society story through some perverse behaviors. We witness the movie through the Narrator's point of view, who ends up explaining more of the plot than necessary.During a plane flight, our undervalued narrator encounters a cocky and well-dressed soap sales representative named Tyler Durden (Brat Pit), whose sarcastic and outspoken notions create a charisma between both individuals. Shortly afterwards, the Narrator's apartment blows apart, leaving him nowhere to seek shelter but with Tyler. This enigmatic man then organizes an underground sensation called Fight Club, in which young men inquire pleasure out of beating each other into bloody carnage. This secret society, located in the basement of a local bar, allows its members to find self-discovery and freedom through brawls and scuffles.""Fight Club"" is crafted stirringly from structured innovation to production designs. Art director Chris Gorak, production designer Alex McDowell, and cinematographer Jeff Cornenweth capture the film's subversive atmosphere with vivid detail and descriptive style and dazzling lighting techniques. Costume designs by Michael Kaplan contribute to the development of Tyler Durden with distinctive, creative outfits.David Fincher is currently one of my favorite directors. His striking and suspenseful thrillers ""The Game"" and ""Seven"" captured my attention thoroughly with sharp characters and focused narratives. ""The Game"" detailed a wealthy executive immersed in confederacy who must overcome a variety of challenges to survive. ""Fight Club"" is more or less the same topic, in which a rebellious benefactor assists in taking charge of his lack of freedom through violent encounters. This production contains plot twists and a climatic resolution that may require more reasoning and thought than the majority of an audience will be willing to submit.""Fight Club"" contains enough extreme graphic violent content for several movies, yet few characters end up with severe injuries. When a tough young man beats someone's face into the ground, resulting in so much gore he is hardly recognizable, you would expect that person to end up in critical condition at the hospital. However, many characters in this movie engage in uncultivated attacks but appear in modest condition the following day. I guess this movie centers more on its theme than the character's actual course of action, which is obligatory for success.Brad Pitt captures Tyler Durden with a macho, politically incorrect attitude; he is the right choice for his character, with a hunky physical appearance and appropriate style, this is one of the actor's career peak performances. Edward Norton proves he is more qualified in productions like this and ""American History X"" rather than light-hearted romantic comedies like ""Keeping The Faith."" He apprehends the difficult character with proficiency and sophisticated detail.""Fight Club"" is one of the more difficult movies I have reviewed in quite a while. With its contentious messages, studio hype, audience anticipation, and the actual film itself, you are reading a strenuously written critique. My reaction to this movie was a mixture between startling amazement and baffling perplexity, furthermore, ""Fight Club"" is a production containing ideas audiences will be discussing long after its finale; it is the kind of movie that may require seconds helpings for some inquiring viewers.",Fight Club
164,msbreviews,Preparation for Mank: Fight Club is culturally significant but also extremely controversial.,8,22 November 2020,"If you enjoy reading my Spoiler-Free reviews, please follow my blog :)David Fincher's new film, Mank, is coming soon on Netflix, released six years after his latest installment, Gone Girl. Therefore, this week I'm reviewing five of Fincher's movies. Se7en was the first one, and now it's time for one of the most culturally impactful films of the 90s, Fight Club. This is another rewatch of another filmmaking classic, one that I was never able to absolutely adore like most people. When this movie came out in 1999, critics were extremely divided, and the film failed at the box office. With time, it gained a cult following through home media, but it's still considered a very controversial piece of cinema. So, nothing new, having in mind Fincher is at the helm.Despite this being my third or fourth time experiencing this story, I never really changed my opinion about it, which is a bit uncommon in my viewing history. Usually, after multiple rewatches, my overall thoughts about a movie slightly vary, but Fight Club is one of the few exceptions. I believe my opinion remains intact from the very first watch. I really enjoy this film, but I can't state that I absolutely love it. Since this is a special case, I'm going to start with what still bothers me after so many viewings, something I also rarely do in my reviews since I always leave the bad stuff to the end of the article.Without spoiling anything, of course, there's a vital plot twist that comes later in the movie that I could only appreciate by its execution, but never by its impact on the narrative. Jim Uhls' screenplay relies on the main characters' friendship to carry the story forward, and throughout the first two acts, Fincher leaves not-that-subtle hints to a massive revelation, which eventually triggers the beginning of the third act. This major plot point is brilliantly executed, and I still feel incredibly fascinated by its delivery, both in terms of the dialogue and the performances. However, its impact on any lightly focused, observant viewer is close to zero due to the clear evidence that pointed towards this development.Now, I don't want to sound like that stereotypical moviegoer that says, ""I guessed the twist before its revelation, hence it all sucks"". Like I insinuate above, I was still wholly captivated during the entirety of the third act. Nevertheless, Fight Club's runtime is far from being short, and Fincher spends a lot of time building up an idea that loses its surprise factor even before the film's midpoint. It changes the protagonist's perspective, it takes the viewer through a predictable yet entertaining path, setting up a powerful, meaningful ending. However, personally, I don't feel like the time spent in the first two acts was satisfyingly compensated in the end... at least, not in its entirety.The second act also has a short period where it loses a bit of steam due to some repetitive sequences and an unnecessary amount of flashbacks. Again, I feel like Fincher didn't completely trust the audience back then, contrary to his procedure in Se7en. In the latter flick, Fincher left the biggest responsibility to the viewer's imagination, leaving the murder scenes for the audience to picture in their minds. In Fight Club, that ambiguity and implicit dialogue are still present, sure, but even before the third act, there's already an attempt to explain too much certain portions of the narrative that I wish would stay vaguer.Without spoiling anything, of course, there's a vital plot twist that comes later in the movie that I could only appreciate by its execution, but never by its impact on the narrative.

In Fight Club, that ambiguity and implicit dialogue are still present, sure, but even before the third act, there's already an attempt to explain too much certain portions of the narrative that I wish would stay vaguer.Don't worry, I'm done with the negatives, and don't forget: I really, really like this movie. Obviously, Fincher and Uhls created a story packed with underlying themes and social commentary. From the whole consumerism theory to the more psychological component regarding Edward Norton's mental state, every message is seamlessly communicated to the audience. I've also been through a point in my life where I wish I'd be someone else, someone who had already achieved every dream of mine successfully with an overwhelming feeling of fulfillment. Coping with the inability to become that perfect someone can become an excruciating, sad, depressing process, and it varies drastically from person to person.Fight Club approaches mental health and people's acceptance of who they truly are in a groundbreaking manner, capturing Edward Norton's emotions perfectly and broadcasting his thoughts through some of the best narration in the history of cinema. Its take on the world of consumerism is undoubtedly interesting and plays a big part in the climax of the film. Despite the issues described above, Uhls' screenplay is very well-written, elevating the conversations between Norton and Brad Pitt (Ad Astra, Once Upon a Time in Hollywood), which are indeed remarkably entertaining. Predictable or not, the main story is wonderfully executed by Fincher, who continues to demonstrate his impressive technical attributes.Once again, the pre-production phase is proved here to be as important as any other stage in the filmmaking process. Fincher's dedication to his features is palpable and visible on-screen through every single technical aspect. This time, Fincher brought in Jeff Cronenweth as the director of photography, and both worked together to not only create that desaturated, realistic atmosphere that Fincher loves so much but also to deliver the brutal, violent, bloody fight scenes that keep the entertainment levels at their highest. With clean, consistent, coherent editing from James Haygood, the movie flows beautifully despite its lengthy runtime. The Dust Brothers' score is quite alternative, which suits the also unconventional storytelling.Last but not least, Edward Norton and Brad Pitt. I know it's incredibly cliche to write that two actors share impeccable chemistry, but Norton and Pitt take it to a whole other level. In two physically-demanding displays, both actors deliver award-worthy performances that marked their careers. Pitt offers one of his most underrated portrayals, being extremely funny throughout the entire film, but also astonishingly badass, carrying his fight sequences as amazing as he does with his dialogues. On the other hand, seeing Norton go all-out is a terrific experience. I lack words to describe such an emotionally compelling interpretation, filled with powerful character moments. A final word of praise to Helena Bonham Carter (Enola Holmes), who also delivers an exceptional performance.In the end, Fight Club is and will probably remain David Fincher's most controversial movie for a long, long time. With an absolutely brilliant direction and execution, Fincher uses Jim Uhls' captivating, layered, unconventional screenplay to tackle themes such as consumerism, society's behavior, and mental health, seamlessly transmitting meaningful yet contentious messages. Once again, the filmmaking in display is technically flawless, going from the trademark authentic cinematography and production design to the unique score, all flowing superbly through excellent editing. Unfortunately, I don't belong to the group of people who utterly love this film. The excessive (sometimes unnecessary) use of flashbacks doesn't help, but it's the enormous build-up packed with overly explicit clues to a significant (yet unsurprising) plot twist that ends up partially ruining the viewing for me. I also wish that the script developed a few plot points more ambiguously, but Brad Pitt and Edward Norton elevate the whole movie so much with their ridiculously outstanding performances that these small issues don't keep me away from highly recommending one of the most memorable, iconic films of all-time.Rating: A-",Fight Club
165,alice liddell,"A film that might talk the talk, but stumbles when it tries to walk.",6,8 December 1999,"Cowering under the shadow of Kubrick, this film is terrified of its own implications, and so emasculates them by a ludicrous twist; an act of creative vandalism as serious as the framing device in THE CABINET OF CALIGARI.  Investigation of social malaise reduced to whinging male angst - like we need more of THAT.  Brave initial incoherence and fragmentation jettisoned for plot and convention.  Fear of women the real problem - anti-capitalism a childish, major-studio-sponsored joke.  Brilliantly funny, though - works best as harmless black comedy.",Fight Club
166,gigan-92,"""I'd fight Ghandi""",10,19 September 2011,"A+ A very unusual movie coming from David Fincher, who recovered quickly from the massive failure that was ""Alien 3"". One would hardly assume that the two films had the same director. This film is based on the novel by Chuck Palahniuk, which I haven't read. However, there are some very relevant themes here, namely freedom from the rampant materialism that has consumed this country. Secondly, it begs the question to the audience if their life has any meaning to it all. It's showcased in one scene where our characters practically kill themselves, and Brad Pitt says, ""We've just had a near life experience."" This leads me to the cast which was pretty good. Brad Pitt was the anarchist Tyler and the character is awesome. Edward Norton is our unnamed narrator as well as supposed protagonist, and he also does nicely. Helena Bonham Carter didn't play all that pivotal a character if you ask me, but regardless she plays the role quite well. The whole movie is filled with this beautiful dark humor and truly stomach-churning violence. Blend those with the intriguing storyline and you have a film that in itself is hard to even categorize. There are also some bizarre, big-budget, shots in the movie, odd for film that technically wasn't in need of too big a budget. They don't distract though, and the photography by Jeff Cronenworth is awesome. The ""Dust Brothers"" (Michael Simpson and John King) provide a unique and certainly unusual score, but rightfully so for an unusual film.I highly recommend ""Fight Club"" for a unique and hard-hitting film experience.",Fight Club
167,FlickJunkie-2,Brutal and raw,9,10 June 2000,"Fight Club' is a superb filmmaking achievement.  It is brutal, innovative, raw, realistic, and extremely powerful.  You could not ask more from the actors.  Edward Norton once again portrays a psyche in delicate imbalance with potent and believable intensity.  Brad Pitt moves to the far side of diabolical and excels in making his character both warped and charismatic. Helena Bonham Carter also shines as the Tyler's pathetic and parasitic girl friend.  Fight Club' takes some of the most pernicious elements of societal dysfunction and wraps them up into a single imaginative well crafted and entertaining film.  We have elements of gang behavior, cultism, anarchy, terrorism and debauchery all glorified in the name of iconoclasm.  Exciting, seductive and subversive.  How utterly cool and hip!So now comes the twist.  I hated this film.  It is a monument to everything that is wrong with filmmaking today.  It is clever and technically superb but philosophically and socially bereft.  Its attempt at social satire, while effective and visceral, was destructive and noxious.  I also can't help but notice the extreme irony of using satire against consumerism as the theme for inducing the masses to buy tickets to consume your film.At what point does a film cross the line between art and depravity?  Fight Club' is a brilliant but dangerous film that begs the question.  If art is a reflection of a society's culture and values, then when I look at this film I have to be frightened at what is staring back at me.  When I reflect on some of the most popular films of the last five years, I can't help but notice the accelerating celebration of random and impulsive violence, depravity, decadence, and pure bad taste.  Fight Club' has pushed the envelope once again to find a new pinnacle (or should I say nadir) in the portrayal of these corrosive elements of societal dissolution.It's comical how many people think it is avant-guard to attack the establishment, as if this is a concept only recently conceived.  Fight Club' is just the latest rallying cry to anarchy in a long line of such cries that have plagued society throughout human history.  It always seems to be a romantic notion for everyone to be totally free and just live `naturally' (like animals) until one of those animals decides that it is you whom it might be fun to kill today.  It doesn't seem to occur to those who extol the sardonic message of such films, that they simultaneously promote and lionize societal destabilization, and that anarchy and mayhem are much less fun in real life than when you are watching them in the air conditioned comfort of your local movie house.  Just ask the kids at Columbine High School.I like dark movies as much or more than the next guy, but this film simply goes too far.  There is nothing wrong with criticizing the establishment. Constructive criticism is the only way to bring about progressive change. But this film is merely vulgar cynicism that suggests that mayhem is preferable to imperfect culture.  That is grossly irresponsible. 
So I am placed in the paradoxical position of admiring this film while I must condemn it.  As a flickjunkie I must stand in awe of it as a filmmaking accomplishment.  But as a human being concerned with the greater good of the species, I must cry out against it.  How far are we willing to go in the name of entertainment?  Are we so myopic as to demand entertainment at any cost?  I guess we will see when someone raises the ante and the next shock treatment comes to a theater near you.",Fight Club
168,redkiwi,Whoa! Here's a film and a half,9,27 November 1999,"Now _this_ is definitely a film and a half.  It features a great script, excellent acting (yes, even from Brad Pitt), some great action scenes and choreography and some world class directing from Se7en director David Fincher.Edward Norton stars again with a performance in the same league as his last film, American History X, and if this man doesn't get an Oscar for one or the other, there is something very, very wrong with the academy.Without revealing the twist in this film, the only thing stopping it getting a 10/10 from my vote was a truly lame last half hour that lead to a completely implausible and corny ending, but that can't take away from what is a must see film.There are some obvious references to comic books, the holocaust and several other events that are very well done, and the interplay between the two main characters has shown just how good the casting was as the on screen chemistry is there for all to see.Don't just watch this film.  Buy the video and watch it several times.",Fight Club
169,Bogmeister,"Club for Film Freaks, not men",9,23 July 2005,"What most people who have not yet seen this flic do know ...it has to do with a men's club started by the 2 main characters whose members beat each other up. Obviously, there is an inherently violent structure to the film. The theme, on the surface, is that modern men have none of the outlets of the past (war, survival, the hunt, etc.) on which to test themselves, i.e. to vent their natural aggression. The result is a nation full of frustrated human time-bombs, many ready to blindly follow a charismatic leader (Pitt) into anarchy & terrorism. Anarchy, to be sure, is a troublesome subtext, but Director Fincher expands on the groundwork laid out to pose a more complex dilemma: namely, that our modern world of advertising and corporate suffusion may produce a new breed of man - one who is halfway drawn into a surrealistic dreamworld to escape the rigors of reality and who will eventually strike back at the world which has affronted him - with apocalyptic vigor. Fincher employs a few seldom-seen cinematic tricks to convey this surrealistic vision, including brazen attempts at subliminal imagery as a parody form - though most of the film turns out to be a dark comedy, anyway, at odds with the serious nature of the story. Somehow, it works. I'm also drawn to the film for repeat viewings due to the unusual stylistics but am resistant, as well; this could be because the subject matter is at odds with the style, producing a confusing reaction in the viewer. There is also a surprise twist near the end, which has been apparently a well-kept secret, since it took me off-guard - and I'm the one who figured out ""The Sixth Sense""(99) halfway through.I'd like to veer off on a tangent I normally don't in my comments and mention the video version of this film on the DVD. First of all, the DVD of the film itself has 4 alternate audio commentary tracks - a record - including by the Director, all the main actors, the screenwriter & novelist. There's a 2nd disc in the package which details the evolution of the film with everything from promos to behind-the-scenes FX tests. This is the DVD format used to its full potential; by the time you're finished with it, you'll feel as if you were part of the film's crew.",Fight Club

171,movieguy1021,Fight Club: 8/10,7,26 November 2002,"In David Fincher's controversial and outstanding Fight Club, Edward Norton plays a person whose name we never find out. He has no life: he has a dead-end job, he orders IKEA furniture mail-order, and he becomes addicted to self-help groups. But Marla Singer (Helena Bohnam Carter) also goes to his groups, and the Narrator's condo gets burned down. And then he meets Tyler Durden (Brad Pitt).Tyler sells soap. And so the Narrator moves in with Tyler, and they soon find out that they have masochistic pleasures and start a ""Fight Club"". Every Saturday night people can pummel each other for fun. And the Narrator's life turns topsy-turvey.Lotsa fights, action scenes, dark humor, and awesome acting. Norton was exceptional as the Narrator. He really brought out the dullness of the character he was trying to show. Great job. Pitt was good but nothing to write home about. He did manage to tell us that he does have some acting talent, but wouldn't be half as famous if he was ugly. Carter really displayed some strong acting here. The supporting cast, including Meat Loaf and Jared Leto, has strong potential (yes, even Meat Loaf!).There was, in the superbly written script, a lot of dark humor. The early scenes, such as the Narrator and Marla arguing over which groups to attend, had a lot of the humor. The script, which enjoys to have great speeches by Pitt, was so well written. The over narration (which dominates most of the film) was excellent. I can't really describe it, there are no words.The movie works best when it's at its trippiest. The ending twist (which I unfourtanatly read about before) went out in more directions that I had thought. If there is one major flaw, it is that Fight Club doesn't really have a real plot. The opening part of the film is about the Narrator's life. The second part is the Fight Club. The third part is the scheme that Tyler has to branch off from Fight Club. And the final part is the ending. The excessive violence, in my opinion, was necessary to the movie and I wouldn't have cut anything out.Fight Club is an extremly entertaining movie with great acting and stunning visuals.My rating: 8/10Rated R for strong violence, language, terrorist acts, and some sexuality.",Fight Club
172,khatcher-2,Hard viewing - strong message,4,20 June 2004,"Though this film does not work for me. A film based on violence does not appease me. Edward Norton excellent, Brad Pitt more or less suffrable, and Helena Bonham-Carter totally miscast. I wish she would come back to real films made in the UK. She seems to have been stuck into this one rather as a decorative piece, a bit of girl in an overstretched `macho' display, which, ultimately, does not convince. It is that embedded American tendency to go over the top in exaggerated play-offs, whether action or dialogue, that is so off-putting. If you like seeing people go off the rails, if you like to see naked debauchery, here you have it.",Fight Club
173,rajdoctor,Fight Club,8,14 April 2007,"Fight Club I was recommended about this 1999 movie by my office colleague Bill Piccolo. It sounded like a typical boxing ring movie to me  but due to the eagerness of suggestion, I thought of viewing it right away on the borrowed DVD.This is a shocker of a movie! You could hate it or love it. My thoughts were shifting on the scales from one extreme to the other  what is going on? What is the purpose of the movie? What is the message of the movie? What does it want to convey? I had to sleep over the movie before I sat down to write this review.The movie is about the main protagonist guy  Edward Norton playing an insomniac, who comes in touch with first with Marla Singer  played by Helena Carter  and later on with the dynamo of a guy - Tyler Durden  played brilliantly by Brad Pitt in his bigger than screen performance. From that time  the movie takes a roller coaster ride to unbelievable incidences, situations and thought processes that churn the mind out of the viewers. Brad Pitt and Edward Norton set up a ""fight club"" that grows into many cities around US and becomes an underground mayhem causing outfit. There is a final twist  like all the classic movies have; that builds up the scope for me to view it again and again! I think that this is a fantastic movie. Not by the sense of acceptance of what is going on in the movie  but the narration of a concept that is so weird. I like movies because it takes one to those areas of human beings that are not dwelled in before. Many attempts are made to showcase a dark side of human nature  not many are successful in doing that. But the director David Fincher  (Alien 3, Se7en, Game and Panic Room) has created a dynamo of this movie. Hats off to this brilliant young director! A lot of effort must have gone in preparing for this cult movie. Small details that are obviously missed during the first viewing would be revealed after 2-3 viewing  once you know the ending.Edward Norton has played his role to perfection (I had seen him recently in The Illusionist and found him stone faced), Brad Pitt takes the guts out of you and his larger than life persona would be remembered for many years and accomplished actress Helena Carter plays her role with mysterious oomph and style  great trio on work.The best part of the movie  if you miss it during the first viewing is its background sound track. Please pay special attention to it  it carries several messages of the final twists embedded into the sound track.It is a male dominated movie but the other sex who love different and new cinema would also love it. I would surely highly recommend to all movie-buffs friends.Jut a trivia  this movie is rated number 31 in all time classic lists of 250. Does not that say a lot about the movie?

176,WriterDave,Eerily Prophetic,9,4 March 2003,"This is one of those in your face controversial movies that has a lot of high minded and loud things to say about the state of society and gender roles and violence in the media and escapism and capitalism, starred hot to trot actors of the moment (Brad Pitt and the wonderfully droll Edward Norton), featured a change of pace role for the exquisite Helene Bonham Carter, was directed by a man almost too stylish and too smart for his own good (David Fincher), and was adapted from an equally warped book. Darkly funny, ultra-violent, and sometimes scary, this is for people with strong stomachs and hungry minds.(POTENTIAL SPOILER) If you don't think this movie is as relevant in the post 9/11 era as it was when it first bombarded movie theaters, just take take a look at the closing scene before the credits where skyscrapers come tumbling down thanks to some terrorist bombs.

177,dr_foreman,a fatal miscommunication,5,23 January 2004,"Here's a movie that pretends to condemn violence (by the end, Tyler Durden is unmistakeably a villain), but it makes fighting look so cool that thousands of people have misinterpreted its message.  Maybe I'm being too harsh here; I've met two people who were inspired to start random fights because of this movie, and that really irritates me (especially since they took pokes at me!).  However, I do think that a fatally flawed message is enough to sink a film, even a great film, and this is not quite a great film.Oh yeah, there's social commentary in this movie...commentary for angry 15 year olds.  Okay, commercial society stinks, so we should rebel, we should reform popular culture by...by...going to the basement and punching each other out?  No, that doesn't strike me as a viable solution.  Even the movie knows this, and it does some quick back-pedaling at the end and tells us not to trust Durden...but he's been the hero all along!   
So, in the end, the film points out problems but offers no solutions.  It generates anger, but channels it in the wrong direction.  It's clever, but it's not actually smart.  It's satirical, but it doesn't have a point. Violence is good, until it kills Meatloaf, and then violence is bad.  Sorry, it doesn't work.As for the film's actual style...gross, innit?  So, I ask myself - why watch a gross movie with a flawed message?  Good question.  The answer is, don't watch it, and go find an actually good, actually wise movie instead.",Fight Club

I rented this film along with a couple others last night hoping that this movie was going to entertain and please me. It sure did! The actors were all great especially Brad Pitt as Tyler Durden. This is one of Brad Pitt's best roles to date. The script and the directing was excellent adding also great dialogue expressing the characters. David Fincher does excellent in my opinion and this is the first film I have encountered in his films and I will sure to be paying more attention to all of them. The twist at the end was awesome and you'll never know when it comes. Very unpredictable. The film can get fairly confusing at times so I advise to pay extreme attention to it. Overall, Fight Club is a wonderful and total kick ass film that will never bore you. For a 139 minute film, this went by fast for how good it was. I highly recommend it.Hedeen's Outlook: 10/10 **** A+",Fight Club

Brad Pitt also plays Tyler Durden, or at least certain aspects of Tyler Durden.Norton starts out as an ordinary businessman who descends into madness and creates chaos with nothing but a figment of his imagination.This chaos all starts with Fight Club. Obviously I can't talk about that because of it's rules. Likewise Operation Mayhem.The film is really weird, incredibly difficult to follow. At times you won't know if Pitt is real. Meatloaf plays a man with testicular cancer and breasts due to hormone excess.Helena Bonhom Carter plays a woman who constantly cries for attention and thrives on that attention.The film is difficult to follow, for both Nortons life and Pitts life.It will leave you with more questions than answers.But well worth not only watching but re-watching.",Fight Club

I'm an action movie buff, so I thought it might be fun and cartoony. I like Jackie Chan, Arnold Schwarzenegger, etc. But I hated this film.The violence is very real and awful. There is a lot of pretentious art crap (such as Brad Pitt appearing for brief flickers of time), and the film is similar to war films whose sole purpose is to show you the horror of war. I've got enough problems without psychological trauma, thank you very much.Plus, the characters are incredibly unbelievable. When you fight someone in real life and do real damage, the human reaction is you go to a hospital, you think ow ow ow ow, and you think I'd better stop fighting. No. These guys eat it up and turn it into a hobby. That's psychopathic.Who should see this film:-- film school types: go crazy, have a blast watching the blood-- action movie types with a strong lack of empathy for suffering.

181,SquigglyCrunch,Everything About This Movie is Excellent,10,9 September 2016,"The first rule of Fight Club is that we don't talk about Fight Club. That's all you need to know. Honestly, your better off going into this movie not knowing what it's about, especially because there's a lot going on and saying anything about the plot means spoilers. Besides, being surprised is more fun. To start, the performances are fantastic. Brad Pitt once again proves why he's such a famous actor, and that's because he's extremely talented. His character is very likable, and yet there's still a level of depth to him and his acting that brings humanity and realism to his character. Edward Norton is fantastic, and again, his character is very real and filled with depth thanks to said performance. The writing is pretty great. The dialogue is realistic, engaging, and often funny. In fact, this movie is very funny. I found myself laughing much harder than I expected throughout the entirety of this movie. The way this story is told is very interesting. There's just enough of one idea or concept before it moves on to the next part of the story, yet every previous part is still a very evident part of the movie, and it still plays a major role. It's not just shrugged off and forgotten about until the end, it's still important. The overall presentation of this movie is fantastic. David Fincher made some very good choices throughout the entire movie, especially towards the end. This is just further proof that Fincher is one of the greatest directors we have right now. The concept is fantastic. How many movies have we actually gotten like this? Not many, if not none. And yet, it's not so out there that it doesn't make sense, it makes complete sense, yet it's unique and original. It's amazing to see the whole plot progress from beginning to end too, to see how everything changes. I went into this movie knowing almost nothing. One thing I did know was the twist ending, unfortunately. And still, it pulled it off fantastically and still managed to surprise me. Once again, Fincher does a great job with this. Even the soundtrack is great, heck, the opening credits are probably the best I've ever seen. It's got this weird animation going on in the background with fun, upbeat music playing as the names of those involved display across the screen. It kept me awake and interested, and it's rare that I get interested simply by watching the opening credits. I don't think that's ever happened, actually. Overall Fight Club is amazing. Everything about it is excellent, the acting, the characters, the writing, the presentation, the concept, the twist, the soundtrack. Everything. For a 139 minute movie it surprises me with it's severe lacking of a single dull moment. In the end I would highly recommend this movie. It's one of the best I've seen all year.",Fight Club
182,ronakkotian,I have to break the first two rules!,10,3 May 2020,"It's been a while since I've seen this film but I cannot keep quiet any longer. I have to talk about Fight Club!Fight Club is about an insomniac office worker and a soapmaker who create an underground fight club which slowly evolves into something bigger and catastrophic.This was on my watchlist for the longest time and I cannot believe how long it took me to finally see this insane film. I expected Fight Club to be an extremely violent venture but what I got was something deeper and psychological and loved every second of it. Having a director like David Fincher work on a film like this is a massive blessing. His way of directing is something else. The film looks absolutely stunning with its murky and dark colour palette which sets the tone and style perfectly. The screenplay by Jim Uhls is fantastic. It's filled with some of the most memorable and witty dialogue I've heard as well as one of the best twists ever put into a film. It's one I felt I shoud've seen coming but it really took me by surprise. Then thinking back to everything that happened before makes the twist so obvious and believableYes, this film is really violent but that's not what it focuses on. Fight Club presents us with many underlying themes and commentary such as hypermasculinity, death, isolation, he consumer-driven society we live in and more. It's ideas thicken and get complex as the film goes on which is why it's been on my mind for a long time. It's a film I would love to watch again and again to analyse its meanings further.Aside from Fincher's direction and Uhls's screenplay, the performances are what make this film special. Brad Pitt gives an outstanding performance. One that'll be remembered for a really long time. He brings the character of Tyler Durden to life and owns every scene he's in. Edward Norton gives his breakthrough performance here and it's the best I've ever seen of him. I did not expect Helena Bonham Carter to do a role like this but she pulled it off really well.Fight Club is a very unique film. The film gave us some of the most memorable characters, Oscarworthy performances, an engaging and unpredictable plot as well as one of the best twists in film history. David Fincher can mark this as another success in his book and let's hope Tyler Durden doesn't come after me for breaking his rules.",Fight Club

Nihilistic middle class misery porn and cod philosophising from the navel-gazing wonder children of Gen X with a ludicrously high budget - that it was due to have a Radiohead soundtrack is all the proof you could possibly need that this genuinely has nothing really to say beyond ""I'm so numb I can barely feel. BUT MAYBE THAT'S THE POINT AND HEY DON'T I LOOK COOL DOING IT?!""That being said - its entropic descent still feels convincingly gut-wrenching, there are some good performances and the glimmers of sharp meta wit make you wish it was a great deal more vibrant and fun like the big gay extravaganza it's longing to be.",Fight Club

185,saadanathan,It is so good I can't talk about it 8/10,8,28 September 2021,"""Fight Club"" must be David Fincher's finest movie. Well, if you want to debate on it rather its this one or ""The Social Network"", that's your decision. Anyway, Fight Club is definitely a masterpiece and a must watch for all cinephiles out there. Kind of makes me wonder if there is a real Fight Club lurking out there in the world.The main focus to me is the chemistry between ""The Narrator"" (Edward Norton) and Tyler Durden (Brad Pitt). How both characters have a good connection between one another up until the shocking reveal. At first it may seem like both characters are completely different, will I won't tell any further you're just gonna have to watch for yourself. Another main focus of the movie was the cinematography, I didn't quite catch the decision to use green variants on screen, multiple use of the color green has been made that I didn't understand, maybe there some explanation to it.Norton and Pitt's portrayals were amazing and deserved an Oscar nomination. Helena Bonham Carter was really good. The movie overall was inspired by the novel by Chuck Palahniuk which was later adapted into the screenplay by Jim Uhls, which many should applaud to him for the major contribution to the film.Many have wondered what Fight Club is all about, maybe it's about a group of men who just love fighting for fun, maybe it's about society and how it's full of crap, or maybe it's just something you should not talk about it.",Fight Club
186,andrewroy-04316,"A complex, stylish film overrated in its uniqueness",7,30 July 2018,"Fight Club definitely has style and is exciting to watch, with complex characters driven by their actions and a great plot twist at the end. The actors were all good, and Fincher does a good job of maintaining consistency in what's really happening and showing the narrator's perspective. As always with adaptations, some interesting exposition in details is lost, such as how exactly Tyler did his work at night and how Project Mayhem worked. The ending, which is so beloved, works and makes sense but isn't exceptional. Why does Tyler die when the narrator shoots his cheek - because he finally takes control of his life, because he's no longer afraid? It's plausible and there's nothing wrong with it, but it certainly didn't blow me away. There are plenty of good themes, and the contrasts of Tyler and the narrator as opposing extremes in problems with society were enjoyable to consider. I don't think there was anything wrong with Fight Club, but I also don't think it's anything more than a decent movie with a good twist.",Fight Club
187,ridi-arahan,We sometimes become someone else to skip the reality of life,9,29 March 2021,"What worked:
We cannot not appreciate the amazing screenplay that the movie provides us, it's humorous, engaging and interesting, making it a very enjoyable movie viewing experience. Also, no need to mention the amazing direction. The movie is as good as it gets. It's stylish, fun and thrilling. As a mental health professional, I vouch for the intend of the movie and the areas that it tried to breakthrough. The leads are amazing in their respective roles. We must understand that the movie had something that we as viewers wanted to see in a movie, something cathartic about the characters and something dangerous and adventurous that we somehow wanted to see as a projection rather than seeing ourselves being in the situation. It's done a good job expressing the duality of human psyche, exploring the suppressed and unexpressed self in the characters in the movie. Overall a fine movieWhat did not work:
Some minor flaws are evident in the movie, which are not serious to mar the narrative. Also, the place that they live is awful, not as a set but as a place which means the makers have done their job fine. It's filthy and very nasty which was the intend afterall. I would have appreciated if I as a viewer knew more about this main character, this person, his complication in life and his psychological experience before getting into the ride into the fight club. Besides his insomnia we do not know much to tell us he has some major life stressors or something bothering him in his reality to vent into someone else. That would have been great. Or maybe as a mental health professional, I would have appreciated if the makers wrote a little bit different dialogues to convey his hallucinations and how to deal it other than the steps he take. It's just some thoughts but this movie still hails higher for many viewers for a reason
Final verdict: highly recommended.",Fight Club

Like it or not this movie had a big impact on a lot of people, not mentioning those who actually started less philosophically concerned fight clubs of their own(i can think of a few sadly). It's not the greatest movie ever made, though it will be for a while for some(blush). It's another in a line of effective points of zeitgeist for modern counter-culture (The Matrix, Donnie Darko, etc.) and all that jazz, but it is effective. And the actors Pitt, Norton, Cater, and even Meat Loaf, all turn out iconic performances. As a great movie moment in transgressive literature it works, but not the best movie ever. Good for what it is, if you can sift through the hype and the violence.",Fight Club
190,CinematicInceptions,"Everything a movie should be: entertaining, thought provoking, and inspiring.",9,16 March 2016,"What is important in life? I could probably right my entire review solely about how this movie addresses that question. And that would leave about ten vital themes unexamined. There seems to be a lot of controversy over what sort of points the story tries to make, but I don't think it's trying to make you believe anything. All it's saying is that your life is most likely not what it could be and that you need to slap yourself in the face and do something about it. They don't care what you do, all they care is that you do *something*.After all, this is where the Narrator starts his journey. Even though visiting the support groups doesn't get him where he wants to be, it is a vital first step in his chaotic spiral into finding himself. Eventually, he realizes that combating consumerism and corporate lifestyle has gone too far and he feels responsible. The pendulum of his lifestyle has swung from one extreme to the other instead of resting in the middle, and now he has led thousands of other men to the same unhealthy level of change. But I think it would be more consistent with the theme to say that the members of Fight Club brought themselves into their current state. Tyler and the Narrator just started it; they could not have brought it to Project Mayhem level if not for the passion of each member. All of them need the same thing the Narrator does.Another central theme is chaos. We are, even seventeen years later, a society that is obsessed with feeling in control. You need look no further than our culture-defining superheroes that battle the ""agents of chaos"". Tyler introduces the Narrator to the positive outcomes of chaos and shows him that being in control of your life is only possible if you aren't in control at all. In trying to reject all suffering through the contents of his apartment, the Narrator has made himself incapable of dealing with suffering. This leads to what was the most striking scene of the film for me: the hand burning, and Tyler's speech about the beauty of accepting pain ""like a living person"". Tyler seems pretty disgusted with how the Narrator initially handles the loss of his apartment and how he fails to see it as a chance to start over.Of course, we can't forget Marla Singer, who is probably as important to the Narrator's life behavior as Tyler is. The Narrator claims to hate her because of how much she reminds him of himself. In that sense, maybe his mind created Tyler as a way to fight off Marla, since Tyler is who he wishes he were. Then again, the Narrator never fully commits to either side of this internal battle. But neither of them seem to fully respect him, which I guess says a lot about the Narrator's self-esteem.In an execution sense, it was amazing. The story is paced so fast that ten minutes feels like fifteen because of how much is packed into them. The dialogue is spot on the entire time, not wasting one line on information about the ""world of the story"" because we all live in the world of the story: it's our lives. Even the voice-over, an element that can often be problematic, was applied perfectly. And to top that off, it was the screenwriter's first feature script. The actors finish the job by bringing the characters wonderfully to life. The camera-work and directing were both incredible as well, drawing you fully into the emotion of the scene, and the dingy color scheme set a constant mood of dissatisfaction and the garbage-like nature of the Narrator's life.I can understand if people are put off by some of the themes discussed in the movie or its portrayal of violence, but including those things does not mean that they are promoting them. To say that this film promotes violence or asocial behavior is to look at it with a limited scope and miss the true message. I know it may seem like I gave too much of a fanboy's perspective, which is understandable since I consider this movie as second only to Inception. But my opinion aside, I think that this is a movie that pretty much everybody should see at some point between the ages of 16 and 50 because, like it or not, it is a film about your life to some extent.

192,baileycrawly,Revisiting Fight Club,6,11 August 2020,"Fight Club isn't a bad movie, but it's not nearly as good as people make it out to be.It really comes off as a pretentious piece of work for film students to study to the point of exhaustion, but I don't think it was ever intended to be that. The movie plays out, with a few key alterations, as a scene-by-scene retelling of the book, sometimes going so far as to lift paragraphs of inner monologue directly from the novel and plopping them into the script.It's a movie that requires at least two viewings but, beyond that, it gets boring in a pretty big hurry. Particularly toward the end of the second act/beginning of the third, it's so painfully bland and boring that it's difficult to care about anything that's happening at all (around the whole Project Mayhem stuff). It's difficult to maintain any kind of focus throughout.There's a lot of stuff hidden in this movie for people to go back and revisit, too, but most of it is inessential. Honestly, having looked back at some of the Easter eggs, it leaves the question: who cares? And of course this is an unpopular opinion to have, but I held off on reviewing this title in the honest hopes that multiple viewings would raise the rating. I even read Palahniuk's novel to try to derive some additional meaning out of it.Without giving away the ending, it makes you think, and it creates a nice gimmick to get people to watch it again but, as I said, beyond that I'm perfectly happy to close the chapter on this one and leave it in the past.The first rule of fight club is that you don't talk about fight club.

For the most part, I wasn't disappointed, until the end.  Not the plot twist(when I read the novel, I thought it was a rip-off of a famous thriller, which I won't name, since it'll give away this one, but it plays much better in the movie.  Also, you have to admit Fincher et al played fair with the audience before pulling the twist), but Project Mayhem and so forth; that seemed out of control and unnecessary.  Still, this is almost nothing like you've seen before, and unlike many visually-oriented directors, Fincher puts his talents in service of telling an interesting story, so you're carried along.  And all three leads are terrific, as is the supporting cast(including an almost unrecognizable Jared Leto, formerly of MY SO-CALLED LIFE, going blond here).",Fight Club
194,Al_The_Strange,"""This is your life.""",10,13 April 2014,"I am Jack's review of the movie Fight Club. If you don't know what that means, it's just a small taste of how sardonic this whole film is.At first, I assumed Fight Club was just a movie about a bunch of guys beating each other up. From the moment it starts, however, it proves to be much more than that. It's actually a very strangely neurotic and mesmerizing descent into a testosterone-fueled madness. Actual fighting is limited; what you get instead is a storytelling experience that's so warped, it will challenge your perception of what is and isn't real in the film. The film itself even gets warped, with such bizarre effects as having single frames of images mixed into random spots, and one frenetic scene where the negative appears to come undone. Throw in some wild computer-generated modelling effects and some brisk editing, and the film becomes a highly stylized and entrancing experience.The story is a real doozy. It kicks off strong and hard, showcasing the insomniac protagonist and chronicling how he went from being an average office worker with everything into a deviant with nothing (and nothing to lose). Things get thrilling when the actual fight club takes off and anarchy starts to spread, but the main focus is always on exploring the characters, and it all builds up to an unpredictable climax. There is a massive plot twist in the mix, but it's one of those that holds up extremely well on repeat viewings (even though it can be a little hard to believe). Characters shine really well, thanks to their nuanced performances, their sharp dialogue, their convoluted relationships, and the nature of the plot, which really makes us stop and think about what's going on in their heads.There are a number of themes that can be extrapolated from this crazy story. The most blatant messages concern anarchy, as the characters constantly criticize the modern consumerist culture and emphasize ""letting go."" Much of the story is really about them abandoning the common goals of wealth, success, or material things, and just being yourself. There are moments where the film also seems to dig up deeper metaphysical questions and meaning, especially regarding morality and the perception of reality.As noted above, the film has one heck of a style. The camera work is very solid and good, while the editing tends to be very inventive and wild. Acting is great; Edward Norton, Brad Pitt, and Helena Bonham Carter are effectively perfect in their roles. Writing is awesome, and there are tons of great lines. This production uses some very great and detailed-looking sets, props, costumes, and special effects. Music by the Dust Brothers can be a bit nutty, but is mostly pretty awesome.Fight Club is a movie with some serious attitude and style. The experience of watching it is like going through that feeling of wooziness after being punched in the face, for it is that trippy. I could say more, but the first and second rules of Fight Club forbid me...5/5 (Experience: Perfect | Story: Perfect | Film: Perfect)",Fight Club
195,AKS-6,Brilliant in many ways,9,6 January 2000,"""Fight Club"" is a great film. It's the first film by David Fincher where I have left the cinema feeling rather uplifted and happy, and it's the first film by Fincher that I think is really, really good. It starts right at the opening credits: it's probably the best opening credits I have ever seen (yes, better than Se7en's).I had read Chuck Palahniuk's novel a couple of times before I saw the film and I like it (the novel) even if it's far from a masterpiece. Even though I like the book, the film is absolutely brilliant in its own right. Jim Uhls's script is fantastic. The comedy is also great, it's been a long time since I've laughed this much during a film. The cinematography is great, the music is perfect for the film, the dialogue is brilliant.The acting is, of course, top notch. Brad Pitt is often overlooked as an actor because of the famous face and the famous body. This is a shame, because I think he's a really good actor although this is the first time I think he's great. Helena Bonham Carter is, surprisingly, perfectly cast. I could see no other actress portraying Marla Singer. Meat Loaf is good as well. I could go on and on about Edward Norton, but that will probably bore you so let's just say that, even though this isn't another Aaron Stampler- or Derek Vinyard mind-blowing performance, he is an acting genius and that his performance in ""Fight Club"" is brilliant.The production design is another thing that is worth mentioning as something really good. As everybody will probably realise there is a ""but"" here and it's coming now: there is sadly a rather boring part in the film right before the brilliant last 10-15 minutes. It lasts for about 20 minutes and it slows down the film and makes it rather unbelievable (to those who have seen the film; I'm not referring to the most apparent thing when I say that some of it is unbelievable). Well, it's such a shame because if those twenty minutes had been more concentrated or something I would without a doubt have given this film a 10 here at IMDb. As it is now, I gave it an 9 after much consideration. Very close to being *incredibly* brilliant, as it is now ""Fight Club"" is ""only"" brilliant.",Fight Club

Well shot with very good acting and solid plot. Don't be fooled to think of it as a social satire or as if there is a strong social message underneath. There might be something remotely resembling such a thing, but if you simply start to examine it a bit more seriously, there are more logical holes than a strainer. I was also a bit annoyed with the female-friendly close shots of muscles and Brad Pitt, but we'll have to live with this. So thumbs up, but know what to expect.",Fight Club

He suffers from insomnia, from an overdose of Starbucks and IKEA, and from overall apathy. Desensitized by a super-structured life, Jack seeks change by joining a series of support groups for victims of alcohol or cancer, and surrenders himself to the notion of physical pain, emotional release and consolation. His newfound peace, however, is disrupted when the eccentric Marla (Helena Bonham Carter) enters the groups but remains detached; a distraction which threatens to break Jack's secure sense of belonging. Jack's identity crisis is intensified by the introduction of Tyler (Brad Pitt), a soap maker and leader of the ""Fight Club"", the most violent support group he is tempted to join.A film about the urge to ""reorganize the world"" through violence, Fight Club recalls the young ""droogs"" in Stanley Kubrick's A Clockwork Orange, yet it exchanges the previous film's theatrics for an internalized --or rather, visceral-- aesthetic. Fight Club benefits from a versatile camera, whose extreme close-ups, extreme long shots, worm's-eye view shots, bird's-eye view shots, freeze frames, slow motion and special effects explore the destabilization and the de-structuring of the protagonist's reality.Fight Club includes one of the greatest, if not the greatest (The Sixth Sense?), twists in cinema history.

It's hard to talk about Fight Club without giving away its surprises.  All I can say is see, it for yourself.  The movie is complex and you'll be thinking about it after you've left the theater.  Brad Pitt is at his best when he plays unhinged characters.  Here, he gets to be unhinged and I think he's perfect in this role.  He gets to be a bad boy and we revel in all of his guerilla tactics.  I liked the trick he does while working at a movie theater.  For all of the violence in Fight Club, there is only one death.  None of the brawlers fight to the death.

Usually if a film has one of these qualities it is a good accomplishment. But David Fincher' acclaimed Fight Club (1999) has all of them, thereby cementing its status as upcoming cult in cinema. This is an important film that bravely plunges into the exploration of human issues like violence and depression, and that does so with flair and fury. It also sprinkles good doses of humour onto its final product, making Fight Club an enjoyable ride.Edward Norton is a thirty year old office worker, lazily frozen in a comatose state of ordering IKEA furniture and getting hounded by his boss. What takes him and shakes him is the arrival of Tyler Duren (Brad Pitt) who introduces him to a subculture of anarchy and a club called 'Fight Club'.Fight Club is an extremely graphic, violent and blunt portrayal of society and it looks into human nature. While Edward Norton's character as 'The Narrator' is an extreme case study, we all recognise aspects of his life and the thoughts in his head. The only problem as far as I'm concerned are the actors. You can never get away from the 'Pitt factor' in Brad Pitt's performance and it is often distracting. Edward Norton's narration often feels flat and emotionless. This would have been very appropriate in the beginning of the film, but as it progresses and he begins to feel more alive, his lifeless tone drags down the quality.This wouldn't make my top 20, but it'd probably make my top 30 list.8/10",Fight Club

It takes a while to get into loving Fight Club, but the moment you are hooked, it will be one movie you will like to own. The movie showcased a good cinematography, as most of the events in the movie took place at night, the director and the cinematographer had to make the best of extra florescent lights, and using locations that had well lighted street lights.Fight Club is based on the 1996 novel of the same name by Chuck Palahniuk. The film was directed by David Fincher (Seven (1995) and The Curious Case of Benjamin Franklin (2008) both also stared Brad Pitt) the movie has an unnamed narrator which is played by Edward Norton. The narrator (Norton) tells us about his life, we learn about his white collar job and how he lived an everyday routine life which he got tired of, took break off the routine he started something that became so big that he himself could not control.The Unnamed narrator started a club with his new friend from a bar Tyler Durden (Brad Pitt), the club featured men taking it out on each other, fighting bare fist just for the thrill.The club grew and became a cross country thing, with Tyler and the unnamed narrator seen as the club presidents and they take turns going around to see that the club is well run, in the various locations.Prepping up for their roles both Pitt and Norton took lessons in boxing, taekwondo, grappling and soap making. Pitt further went ahead to Chip some of his tooth so as not to look too perfect. Filming lasted over 138 days with over 300 scenes, the fight scenes were heavily choreographed with the actors going all out, so as to make it look more realistic.Here is a movie that I highly recommend you get the DVD, but I do have to warn you that it does posses extreme violence, as we see men go bear fist fight with one another, but the movie twist ending is far more captivating than the violence that at the end you are more glad with the way the movie is taking form than you are worried with the intense fight scenes.www.lagsreviews.com",Fight Club
202,PyrolyticCarbon,Fantastic fantasy with real messages for real people,9,24 November 1999,"I don't think this film will work on DVD, that media is only dual layered, this film is multi layered! How I didn't get lost during this I don't know, but I was shot along with the storyline, not only understanding it, but also identifying with it. It's brilliant.I found the first half of the film almost meandered along, stretching things out to meet the latter half where the story spins around and doubles up on the speed. The ending is superb and very bizarre, in fact the whole second half is bizarre, and yet believeable.That's something that amazed me, how we were shown to understand and identify with these characters, even though they are leading and participating in some of the strangest acts. Very often we watch characters who we don't, and can't, believe in. It doesn't ruin the film, but it can't drag it down as we loose storyline and interest. That never happens here.The acting is superb, Norton and Carter steal the entire film with a surprise performance from Meat Loaf. Brad Pitt is there, and he was good, but powerfully overshadowed by Norton. The film was visually stunning and in no way was the fighting glamourised or made to look appealing, in fact those scenes were sometimes quite disturbing, the way violence really is.I've seen reviews and heard people say that it looses itself in the second half, I'd say it doesn't find itself until the second half. I think that's when we find ourselves too. You can identify, understand and sympathise with almost all that's going on, and these are keys that all film makers try and get hold of.

Brad Pott and Edward Norton deliver knockout peforlances in this classic movie from David Fischer-Dieskau (the director of Seven).I really enjoyed this movie and you should definately check it out, I hadn't seen it until now, what aexperience, so intrigued by every aspect of it, this is a film that has aged well and will always go down as one of the best twists and turns of a masterpiece.Highly recommend!",Fight Club
205,emekmax,ne of the most attractive movie.,10,10 March 2021,"Whilst it lacks the allegorical potency of Ellis' 'American Psycho', this Palahniuk adaptation captures the jaded ennui of 'the postmodern condition' with hyper-real simulations of dysfunctional masculine identity. Fincher's depiction of Tyler Durden; the idealised alter-ego and schizophrenic actualisation of the Narrator's inferiority complex (a ripped, 'rebel without a cause' Brad Pitt), still deserves acclaim.",Fight Club

Very simple yet complicated. A man meets the man of his dreams and together they put together a way for men to relieve stress, its called Fight Club and the name of it says it all, they just fight. However that is only the crust of this very thick plot. I would dive more into it but you'll have to watch to find out.The acting was first class. Edward Norton was flawless as The Narrator, the man who goes through his unsatisfying life wishing he could do something exceptional. Brad Pitt was perfect as Tyler Durden, the man of the Narrator's dreams who helps the Narrator pull himself and his ideas/dreams together. Helena Bonham Carter was exceptional as Marla Singer, the crazy/gritty/disgusting woman who seems to be a burden on The Narrator. Meat Loaf delivered an otherwise award-winning performance as Bob, the physically and mentally deformed man who is so disgusting yet lovable.The plot had more twists and knots than an old rope. However, they all worked in the end, giving us one of the best films in recent cinematic history.10/10.",Fight Club
207,avik-basu1889,I am Jack's feeling of delight after watching Fight Club !!!!!,10,24 November 2014,"Fight Club is one of those films that will not leave your thoughts hours and maybe even days after you've watched it. The feeling that you get after watching this movie is similar to being punched repeatedly and relentlessly for its entire 140 minutes length. David Fincher masterfully managed to create a perfect balance which makes this film an immensely visceral as well as a deeply intellectual watch.The main theme of Fight Club is freedom, or the lack of it. The script which is based on the novel by Chuck Palahniuk leaves no stone unturned and adopts an unapologetic approach to convey its message about how people in society are living trapped, compromised and unfulfilling lives and following the customs and norms which are generally considered ""normal"". The common human being is just a pathetic consumer with no identity and no personality. He is just satisfied with his material possessions and has no hesitations in allowing himself to be judged and trapped by society. The unnamed main character played by Edward Norton is one such character. He is a very average citizen with nothing to look forward to in his life. He has a boring job, no prospects and he is an insomniac. His strategy to temporarily escape the mundane nature of his life is attending self help groups in the evening. But suddenly one day, he meets a suave, sharp and stylish man named Tyler Durden(Brad Pitt) and his life changes completely. I think keeping Norton's character unnamed was brilliant as it shows that he is so average, his name becomes irrelevant and he can be any one of us.The script and the original novel have to be credited immensely, but not as much as David Fincher. This film is a masterpiece because of Fincher's direction and storytelling style. He has put his stamp on this film from start to end and it is impossible to not feel the presence of the director. It is extremely fast paced. If a 140 minutes long film never makes you feel bored for even a single second, then the director deserves a bow. The film is very stylish with its visuals and Fincher uses a lot of creativity with the cinematography. The whole movie looks intentionally dirty and dark. The film is also an example of tour de force editing.Now let's come to the acting. Norton is fantastic. He expertly portrays a man who is an insomniac and who is slowly collapsing mentally due to what he considers society's pressure. Helena Bonham Carter as the infamous Marla Singer is also breathtakingly good. She is wacky,funny and just plain weird. But if there is any actor that this film belongs to,it is certainly Brad Pitt. Charisma just oozes out of every inch of Tyler Durden's body. I can't think of Tyler Durden without visualising Brad Pitt wearing that red jacket with sunglasses. Durden's philosophy,though controversial, is undeniably thought provoking.When Fight Club first came out, it was negatively accepted by some critics who opined that a film as bloody and as violent as this, might attract copycat behaviour as the film also shows how people can be manipulated and influenced. While I completely understand that opinion, but I believe that cannot reduce the quality of the film itself.Fight Club is a must watch for every film lover and it is certainly one of David Fincher's best films as well as one of the very best films of the 90s.",Fight Club

Plain and simple; Would Recommend,10,17 April 2017,"​Plot Overview: After his apartment blows up, The Narrator(Edward Norton) seeks the help of a friend he met on an Airline, Tyler Durden(Brad Pitt). Together, the two men form an underground boxing ring called 'Fight Club' but soon things begin spiralling out of control.Directed by David FincherStarring Edward Norton, Brad Pitt and Helena Bonham Carter# NO SPOILERS!Overall: This movie is, simply put, a masterpiece. I cannot name a meaningful flaw with the film. Acting, story, cinematography - everything; it was perfect. Masterful direction and Oscar worthy performances intertwine together to create a pretty much flawless movie and stands as one of the greatest movies of all time!The type of people who will like this movie will be fans of interesting and intricate stories.Would Highly Recommend.# POSSIBLE SPOILERS!Edwards Norton was amazing as The Narrator. Brad Pitt delivers an Oscar calibre performance as Tyler Durden as this may be one of my favourite performances from him. The way both characters are written is so perfect because they are so different yet so alike. Helena Bonham Carter was great as the troubled Marla Singer. Despite having more minor roles, both Jared Leto and Meatloaf do good as Angel Face and Bob respectivelyThe story was brilliant and genius. The revelation at the end of this movie was pure genius and will 100% go down in cinema history as one of the greatest of all time. Such smart and brilliant storytelling leading to a perfect end. This movie's story is its best strength and is masterfully crafted.The cinematography was great in this movie.The effects were nice. The set design was great and the costume design was amazing, especially for Tyler Durden. The one thing this movie needed to do was provide a decent story. It does that and also provides brilliant characters, a brilliant ending and puts you on a non-stop ride from beginning to end.The grand revelation at the end, while brilliant, does make some previous events feel a little weird and can be a bit dodgy.Personally, I loved every single second of this movie and just from one watch it has breached at least my top 20 films of all time.10/10",Fight Club

The two become friends, and end up starting a ""fight club"". A place where men can vent their anger by beating the crap out of each other. As the movie moves on, the fight club gets larger until it evolves into a terrorist organization, and a shocking twist ending reveals that Tyler Durden is more than he appears. Fight Club is a very interesting film. It's a film I recommend seeing more than once to take it all in. I recall not liking it at first, but when I saw it again, I took it for what it was. A brutally violent and in your face drama/comedy that deals with many of life's problems.The always amazing Edward Norton plays the nameless lead role in the film with Brad Pitt as Tyler Durden. They both play their vastly different roles well, and the relationship between them is more believable than most movies about two friends. The writing and the build up to the ending are crafted so well that you almost get drawn right into the film. Fight Club is a dark and disturbing film that requires a thinker to view it properly.

A Fight Club evolves whose premise is ""do not ask questions"" and that meaning will follow your actions, a foundation of virtually every self help group, a comedic twist from where we first find the narrator and his neurotic faker Marla (Helena Bonham Carter).

212,kdnor2011,Is there some deep meaning I'm not getting?,7,19 June 2011,"Before we start, I should tell you all that I have actually only seen this movie one, and that was around a year and a half ago, so I am mostly going on memory. Also there will be spoilers.Is Fight Club a good film? Yeah...there's really nothing bad about it's plot or anything. Is Fight Club and Overrated film? In my opinion...yes. Sorry, I know there are a lot of people who absolutely love this film, but it is currently number 14 on the IMDb top 250.OK, first off, this movie does look really good, it has a gritty look to it that matches the tone of the film perfectly. And yes, I did really like the twist ending, I never saw that coming. However there are two really big pet peeves about this movie that get to me, and really brought this movie down hill.One problem is this: What is this movie trying to say? Don't tell me this is just supposed to be a popcorn movie, this movie is trying to say something, but I'm still not sure what. Is fighting good? Is fighting Bad? Can severe depression lead you to do a lot of crazy stuff? Are children films becoming to sexual (insert Mr. Poppers Penguin joke here.)? I guess the big question it tries to raise is what will happen if the US economy started over, but I'm still not sure that was even the question it brought up.My second big problem was the ending, and this is where the spoilers will be in full force. Now this movie tries really hard to be realistic, which for most of the movie it does really well. But after Tyler is revealed to be in the main character's mind, the movie sort of gives up.How does shooting yourself in the mouth get rid of Tyler? And how do you survive a shot to the mouth, you don't, and even if you did, you be in way too much pain to talk. Also I'm not an expert on the economy, I know very little on how the nations' economy works, but I'm pretty sure that destroying half of New York City, the city that controls the nations economy wouldn't start everyone over, it would screw us more. Isn't that what the terrorist were trying to do on 9/11. So basically, the characters in this film caused an event that was even worse than 9/11. Think how many people must of died, even if the bulding were empty the smoke, the debris, it must have made one hell of a mess. Basically, the Fight Club is worse than Al Queda.I'm still gonna dwell on this. Where did they get that many bombs. They would literally need thousands of bombs per building. They came down in seconds.OK, maybe I'm being too hard, maybe the writer thought that bombs would work. But wait didn't a terrorist group try to bring down a the twin towers with bombs in 1993? And they failed.OK, I think that's about it, there are some small nitpicks I have, but the questionable moral and the ending just completely made me forget. Fight Club is good, if you love the movie, good for you, but I will not be buying it any time soon.",Fight Club
213,Rammstein-2,What great movies are all about,10,12 January 2000,"This is the 3rd best film I've ever seen. Fast-moving, energetic beyond belief and with a rock-solid attitude that just isn't found elsewhere, this flick is just too great to miss. Unsettling, graphic, violent like no else, made in typical Fincher-style: dark, gritty, dirty and a bucketful of sweat. Excellent performances by Pitt and Norton (the IKEA touch is a bonus for us Swedes), great lines (""Run, Forrest, run!"" is my favorite) and some really, REALLY wicked jokes. I recommend this film to anyone, except that you have to bear watching people slug it out some - and even beating each others' faces to bloody pulp. But the violence is not the point of this film, and if you can stand it, there are quite a few interesting issues that are brought to attention. And what more can one ask for?",Fight Club

From the witty dialogue to the Tarantino-esque editing style and the character evolution, the part-time drama, part-time dark comedy is a portrait of a man who experiences an existential crisis and incidentally creates a movement. The duo of Edward Norton and Brad Pitt are iconic, as they couldn't be any more of an odd couple. Their ""oil and water"" dynamic is a major reason for why 'Fight Club' works - they are able to find function in a dysfunctional world.But it's not just the Norton and Pitt show. The ""third wheel"" that is Marla Singer (Helena Bonham Carter) is perfectly cast as a kooky free spirit whose temper is as short as her hair. Together, the three A-list actors deliver a trifecta of dramatic performances that still to this day are career highlights.Sure, 'Fight Club' feels a bit dated at times. But the story, execution and cast have ensured the film has and will continue to stand the test of time.",Fight Club
216,LivingDog,The Last Warrior,10,1 April 2006,"This is beyond my ability to articulate since it is beyond my experience, but not beyond my ability to appreciate.Men are alienated. They need a purpose. In our growing technological society man's role is being diminished. He no longer is central to survival. ATM's, Computers, and even the internet has co-opted their sense of place. All is meaningless in this age convenience. Men have grown soft living off the fat of the land (pun intended).I usually comment separately about the different elements of the movie. But this time I won't because I would have to mention everything and I don't have the energy to list all the features of a movie. Indeed this movie is perfect in every aspect. 10+/10-ZafoidPS: now for the truth. Why is it, according to this movie, that men have to feel a sense of place and purpose? I choose to turn it around and say that the men who feel this way are those who only get a sense of purpose from working with their hands or tools or ... weapons. In this movie their hands are their weapons and thus their purpose - indeed *Fight Club*.So it is clear then that these men are dinosaurs and they are dying out. In reality this movie (and the book as well), is their death knell. Their last ""hurrah"" to say ""we won the day"" ""we conquered the enemy"" (the enemy in this case is the technology which has displaced them - has co-opted their sense of purpose. Albeit their sense of purpose - that of conquest - is indeed misplaced outdated and no longer meaningful in a fully civilized and technological society. Indeed, we can thank God that we don't have to fear every breathing moment. Is this what they want? Yes. And so they are lost. But lost because of their misplaced projection of what life is about. It is not about conquest - it is about progress. Contributing with your mind and your heart your science and your art your time and your understanding. But these men can have none of that because they are trapped in their veltanschaung of ""survival of the fittest"". So be it, but progress has been going on since the dawn of man and it will not reverse. We have come from the age of sticks to the age of jets and we ain't going' back!) So let's give them a last ""hurrah"" for they were once important they were once the center of the world they were once the makers of history - the makers of wars ... and nations. Bid them ""farewell"" (""Fare thee well, good knight."") and once and for all recognize their last outcry - the last outcry of the last warrior.-Z",Fight Club

After they bash each other senseless one night, everyday people want to join in the fight; fight club is made.This is the modern day classic. With the dark, provocative subject matter to the engulfing visuals, its just pure brilliance. The social commentary here is like no other. Complexities of individuals, consumerism; not having the answers, masculinity and freedom. Just to f**k it all and cut the strings and be free. All the people who join fight club have a very hubris attitude, using fight club as a way of escaping their problems. This shows how its hard to change who we are, we do sometimes need to become sheep to then break away.Daivd Fincher is our modern day Stanley Kubrick, one of the most detailed directors around. In his bio, he did roughly 100 takes for one scene in the movie panic room.

It's their own way to let go of their lives, and feel free just to fight. Fighting allows them to let go of their lives, I think! Then, we have our movie, and it is awesome. This is one of the most exciting and exhilarating movies I have seen in my life! Let me just say that this movie literally messed with my brain, which was awesome.

""""Fight Club"" is a suspense film, which is different from the brain-rearing reasoning suspense film. All the details of the film are laying the groundwork for ""Jack is schizophrenia"". As Jack himself gradually realizes that Taylor is himself, the audience naturally understand That was a somewhat unexpected but reasonable answer-it turned out that it was all his schizophrenia.
Before the movie finally reveals that the male lead Jack is schizophrenic, there have been many hints:
For example, Jack 's shaking eyes always flash
As another example, Taylor appeared without warning on the plane. Then when he first appeared, Jack 's apartment was blown up. When he was homeless, he called Taylor somehow. Taylor's number paper for Jack is the same as Jack's number paper for the hostess. And during the conversation, without any prompts, Taylor knew that Jack's purpose was to live in his house.
And Taylor and the heroine will not appear in the same scene at the same time.
When Jack was negotiating with his superior, the part of beating himself and kneeling down to seek superiors was presented through the perspective of superiors (third parties), (Jack is playing against himself in the boss 's eyes), implying that Jack Behaving beyond ordinary people. This and the later revealed that Taylor was just a clever connection that Jack had imagined.From the beginning of watching a movie to the process of telling a movie, I was thinking, what is it trying to tell? Judging from the intuitive feelings of a movie viewer, the tones of the film are rotten and cold, the protagonist's behavior is beyond ordinary people, and some of the plots are funny and absurd. It gives people a not-so-beautiful viewing experience, it brings more soul and sensory impact
This movie is not presenting you with a suspenseful brainstorming suspense. It not only creates a suspenseful atmosphere and organizes stories for the audience, but also elaborates the philosophical proposition of ""the meaning of man"".
Jack has a job and an apartment. All his furniture is exquisite IKEA furniture. He is also a patient with insomnia and suffers from depression. He was bored and bored in the work of constantly reviewing and recalling car accidents. What a typical repressed young man in contemporary society. What does Jack often think? He felt the materialization of society when he was insomnia. When he was flying, he thought about how the aircraft would be destroyed when he was flying. It thought of suicide, and thought of things that escaped from the lives of normal people and the minds of normal people.If only pretending to be a patient can be valued and listened to, if it is only the achievement of Taylor in the split personality that allows him to be followed by many believers, what is the meaning of his own identity, the one of the general public?

It's not that we look alike, or anything-- it's just that the very idea behind the existence of Mr. Durden is one of angst, of loss, of mass confusion of what exactly Males are supposed to be as we enter the 21st century.  For thousands, or tens of thousands of years, we were hunters, fierce warriors who stalked and killed our prey to feed our families and tribes; we fought for and defended our families, our communities, our ways of life.  These days, we stay up late watching infomercials, and spend time abusing the copy machine at work. Ain't progress grand?Hollywood makes movies that appeal to the largest common denominator, and clearly this movie is not for everyone.  (Though in 40 years, it might be-- Hitchcock movies bombed in their own decades, too.  Figure that one out). But ideally, it appeals to those of us who are lost, those of us who didn't even know how bad things had gotten-- how good it can be for the soul to just punch someone in the face every now and then.HOWEVER-- that doesn't mean punching someone is right.  This User Comment, and this film, do not advocate violence.  But the idea behind it, we are told, is something worth just thinking about... so we may factor it into our lives, and our future, to know ourselves and form a conclusion based on the whole, not by denying Who We Are.

Well, I thought that opinions are not to be discussed, but I got to say this one: SHAME ON YOU!!! This movie is one of the best in movie history, I have no doubt, and I can start figuring a why to explain its overlooking by the academy awards and others: it is a violent slap in the face of all the people who think they are safe in their monochordic lives, their credit cards, their stable jobs and their month paychecks, which are used for owning things ""which end up owning ourselves"". The philosophy of the movie is brutal, and never before seen in a movie made in USA grounds. Edward Norton and Brad Pitt turn out establishing themselves as two of the best actors to ever grace the silver screen, and David Fincher leaves us drooling for his next feature. This movie will stagger even the most coldly hearted, as it depicts the life of a character whose name we don't know (not until the end, that is), who we know just by the name of ""Jack"", and who lives a more than normal live: shirts, kakis, ties, a desk job, a nice paycheck and his nights spent decorating his house and seeing the tv-shopping. Jack has a problem: he can't sleep. He will find the cure for this problem, but he will also find lots of other things. I can guarantee it, you have never seen anything like this movie, and never miss out the first 30 minutes, which have a frenetic rhythm to go with Jack's first-person point of view of his life before his problems. I thought that ""Se7en"" was one of my favorite movies. It still is, but it isn't alone. The fact that both movies come from the same director, it means a lot - it means that David Fincher is a powerhouse director who has a lot to give, and from who we may expect great and landmark-ish things from the future. I take my hats off to the whole team: Pitt and Norton are stand-outs, the script is the whole asset of the movie (Chuck Palahniuk's novel (from which the movie is inspired) is a smacking good piece of literature), the Dust Brothers' electronic score is a record to own, Helena Bonham Carter's Marla is as perfect as she could possibly be, the photography, the sound and the editing just make your jaw drop. Never miss out this one, and if you have a DVD player, enjoy even more the experience in a finely-crafted package - at least it won awards for that! One of those movies I would have given an 11. No less.",Fight Club
228,flingebunt,The first rule of this movie is you don't write reviews about this movie,8,5 March 2005,"The Renaissance sculptor Rodin said, a great work of art can still be seen as a great work of art, even if it is broken or incomplete.Nothing more typifies this than Fight Club. I could list all the problems, plot holes, human psychology errors etc with this movie (and I haves watched this movie many times so I know what they are). However that would give away most of the plot and the plot twists.However balancing this is an incredibly challenging, exciting, funny and interesting film that works on so many different levels.Edward Norton plays the every man character. Single, with a successful job that he hates and he knows is reinforcing corporate evil. He has a condo and all the IKEA furniture that a space monkey would want.But he suffers from insomnia and he finds the perfect cure, attending support groups for things like testicular cancer. There he meets another ""tourist"" Marla, a crazy girl who has accepted that she could die at any time, but is angry that she doesn't.From this he is rescued by Tyler. Tyler is everything he wants to be. Handsome (played by Brad Pitt), dresses the way he wants to dress, does the things he wants to do and (how to say this politely) performs the act of coitus in the way he wants to.Tyler drags him into Planet Tyler. Starting fight club creates a phenomenon. Men fight, men are bonded by fighting, not by shopping. Tyler has a plan and before you know it a revolution has started.Any good revolutionary knows that revolutions require the ordinary people of the world. They are the people who drive you ambulances, serve you food, watch your house when you sleep at night.This movies manages to disturb, excite, educate and entertain all at the same time. People have even started their own ""fight clubs"". But remember, in this movie Tyler is a extreme of the everyman dream. He sees the total destruction of the world, both in terms of destroying the institutions of society and in destroying the future by rejecting women. All so he can be ""a man"".Tyler is not the voice of reason, merely a clever argument in the search for yourself.Your project Mayhem assignment for this week is to start a fight with a complete stranger and lose. Space monkeys, keep watching this space for more project Mayhem assignment.s",Fight Club
229,barberoux,Lack of integrity,8,5 June 2000,"I thought a lot about this movie.  I enjoyed it.  Plot twists were done well and the acting was good.  Helena Bonham Carter has succeeded in debasing her smoldering good looks sufficiently enough to become unappealing.  Maybe she believes depth to be gleaned from heroin chic.  Brad Pitt's ego was cleverly used as a plot device.  The premise of the movie of men finding some meaning to life in fighting has some appeal.  Here I sit, screwing off at work, because of the debasement I feel from the layers of management above me. The feeling of being controlled by people I have little respect for and like less for the paycheck so I can pay the mortgage and the credit card bills. I want to punch some faces in but I'm restrained by social mores.  I want to rebel against the suits but need the money.  So I passively resist convention.  I'm contrary.  The men in the movie found their outlet in fighting then by allowing themselves to be debased into obeying automatons. How ironic.  The answer to our self hatred at being social parasites is not debasement.  That seems to be self hatred.  Taking punishment as penance for our weakness.  Maybe the answer lies in having integrity.  That is what the movie lacked.  That is what is so hard to maintain in our society.   That I feel is the answer more than blowing up things because someone told you to. But it doesn't sell tickets.  A movie that sparks introspection is worth watching.  This movie, though it finally sold out, is worth watching.",Fight Club
230,Emerenciano,Intelligent film!,8,13 April 2003,"When I first sae this movie (at the cinema four years ago) I understood why it caused so much discussions worldwide. There is a little of everything in ""Fight Club"": violence, love, humour, adventure, action and fantasy. It also has a little of art in here, once the actors talk directly to us while the movies goes on. The first minutes are a bit of confusing and they are not so attractive. However, after we get in the mood of this masterpiece, we enjoy what we see, but not the way great director David Fincher wanted us to. I conclude this due to the great surprise we discover in the end... and what a surprise!Edward Norton and Brad Pitt, two of everybody's favourite actors are very well in this film. They make us believe in their roles and their characters are powerful and real. Highly recommended film!my rate 9/10",Fight Club

233,Jacques98,"Sorry, it bored me to tears. And then made me mad with bad storytelling.",5,16 September 2008,"Beyond anything I'm about to say, I just don't understand how people can call Fight Club entertaining. I was so bored I had to give myself excuses to turn it off and do something else. It just kept going and going, and 90% of the screen time has nothing to do with anything. The humor was so juvenile and cliché, I can't say I laughed onceI heard the entire script back in 3rd grade at recess. So, really, as far as entertainment value goes, I can't see anything redeeming. Every 10 minutes I kept asking myself why I was even watching it, because nothing was happening, and in the end nothing did happen. There was no story, just some pretentious social commentary that was nothing new.Being a man, I've heard the cliché ""We're men raised by women!"" so many times I can't even take it seriously anymore. That cliché has existed since then 60's, as far as my knowledge, if not earlier than that. Now this takes that cliché and forms a movie around it. For one, everyone who is calling this ""daring"" or ""original"" needs to understand something: it takes no more balls the take a cliché and build a movie around it than it does to remake something.The intellectuals on there had argued both ways about the validity of ""We're men raised by women!"", so I'm not going to. Go read their reviews and find your open opinion on the matter. However, something no one here has said is that Fight Club is exactly that: an opinion. I could make a movie about a group of men who realize that they prefer being like women, then backlash and say EVERY man HAS to feel this way. Why? Because . . . well, because the fictional characters in the movie said so. That's because! Fight Club is an opinion, not an absolute truth. If you were to take real men and put them in a fight club such as this one, I can guarantee a lot of them would NOT feel alivebut the film is too immature to admit that it a possibility. Likewise, if you were to start a fight club for women, I can guarantee that a lot of them would feel just as alive as menonce again, the film doesn't admit that is a possibility. Fight Club is so self-absorbed in a shallow cliché that it denies all flaws it could have, and that is the main flaw with the social commentary. If Fight Club was truly ballsy and original itself, which it's not, the story would at least admit that it is an opinion and not absolute truth, as it claims. And, really, the fact alone that people would base their full opinions on something fictional is ridicules and shallow in itself. Fiction is fiction. Yes, fiction can be a tool to understanding reality, but it still can be manipulated to understand whatever reality it wants to understandincluding false reality. Basing an entire view on something based on something fictional, as this movie is, is just pathetic.Okay, now with that out of the way, I want to talk about the horrid storytelling this movie had. If Fight Club actually knew how to tell a story, I might have given it a much higher score. The entire movie is insanely boring, but the first hour and a half is pretty well-done, if you ignore the fact you've heard every bit of humor on the playground and that David Fincher has laughably poor arguing skills. After the car crash scene, however, the entire movie descends into poorly directed chaos. There are so many bloated, pointless scenes from this point until the end I was literally counting down the minutes until it was over. All the quirks that made the characters interesting fall away and leave them cardboard-thin. If the storytelling was done effectively, the chaos would have led into an intense, direct climax/finale. Instead, the ending is bloated with sub-plot after sub-plot that amount to nothing in the end, getting rid of any and all intensity that could have been created, and just leaving me bored and laughing at things that weren't supposed to be funny. The decent fight club plot twists into a cheesy wannabe Die Hard plot and at that point I lost all ability to take the movie seriously. I can understand it was trying to add another layer to the overdone social commentary, but it didn't work. The ending should have been cut by at least 40 minutes to be even close to effective. Poor, cheesy storytelling.In the end, I can understand why people would think this movie is brilliant. On the other hand, I can't understand anyone out of junior high who shouldn't see the gaping flaws in the social commentary. But maybe I'm looking at this entire review the wrong way. Maybe I'm trying to find flaws with the story, when it had no story to start with. This just a poor excuse to preach clichés you've heard all your life, not to entertain. It's an English opinion paper, nothing more, nothing less. If so, it gets an F for being pretensions, close-minded, and just downright boring.5/10",Fight Club

236,williampsamuel,One of the most brilliant and bizarre movies of the 90s,10,7 December 2014,"Despite its name, Fight Club is no dumb, goofy martial arts flick. It's the twisted, deeply psychological tale of a corporate desk jockey whose world is turned upside down by a chance encounter. It's a movie about breaking free from your boring, conformist existence. And it's an eye opening examination of modern consumerist society- wrapped in layers of shocking violence, oddball humor, and dream scenes and hallucinations reminiscent of Dali. It's weird. It's not for children or the faint of heart. And it will blow your mind.Edward Norton's unnamed protagonist is an insomniac. For months the only way he's been able to get a good night's sleep is by going to support groups for problems he doesn't have. The emotional release he experiences with people worse off than himself allows him to loosen up, forget his troubles, and overlook the fact that he's a shameless faker. But things become even weirder when he meets Tyler Durden (Brad Pitt) an anti-conformist rebel and self styled 'urban guerrilla.' Thrown together by literally explosive circumstances, the pair discovers a release from the pressures and monotony of modern life in the form of no-holds-barred, one-on-one combat.Their idea catches on, and despite the number one rule of fight club being that you don't talk about fight club; their hobby rapidly grows into a secret society of like-minded nobodies. But as Tyler's nihilism and revolutionary fervor take hold, what was once a way to blow off steam becomes something much more sinister. And reality becomes blurred with fantasy as our unnamed hero finds himself in the center of a labyrinthine conspiracy of crime and destruction- one that everyone else seems to think he's behind.An important thing to understand about this movie is that none of the major characters are entirely sane. Not Tyler Durden, who splices individual frames of porn into family movies down at the local theater and makes soap using stolen by-products from the local liposuction clinic. Not the Norton character, who freely chooses to live in a decrepit, horrifyingly unsafe old house with the man I've just described and increasingly comes to confuse hostility and not giving a damn with enlightenment. And certainly not Marla (Helena Bonham Carter) the chain-smoking, habitually lying nympho who attends all the same support groups as the protagonist for equally fraudulent reasons, regularly threatens or attempts suicide, and begins having a passionate if somewhat confusing relationship with Durden.Another important thing to understand about Fight Club is that the movie itself is insane, in the best way possible. I'm talking Reservoir Dogs or Pulp Fiction insane. Like a Tarantino film, Fight Club is unbelievably over the top, earning its R rating in every way possible. Again and again there are parts so shocking, so wrong, that you can't help but burst out laughing, and then wonder if you're as screwed up as the people on the screen. There are parts so bizarre that for a moment you're not sure that this is still the same movie. There are numerous seeming plot holes and bits that won't make sense until the end.And then there are the inherent contradictions within the whole premise of the movie. At its core, Fight Club is about internal development and self-discovery- which are achieved by beating other people senseless in the basement of a rundown liquor joint and blowing stuff up. Our guide on this journey of enlightenment is an antisocial, borderline psychotic narcissist who takes a view of mankind similar to Thomas Hobbes and whose main concern is sticking it to the man. Plus, as previous critics and websites like Cracked.com have pointed out, his plan to take down the man and stand up for the little guy would likely result in the deaths of dozens if not hundreds of blue collar night shift workers. And don't even get me started on the dynamics of a movie that attacks consumerism and obsession with material wealth raking in hundreds of millions of dollars.But none of this is a problem in the least. Fight Club isn't meant to be realistic or make perfect sense. The sheer absurdity of the situation is half the selling point, and any inconsistencies only add to its rich texture. This is pure escapism taken to –and beyond- its logical limits. When you get right down to it, Fight Club is the ultimate 'take this job and shove it fantasy. Tyler's brand of populist anarchy is sure to have a certain appeal to anyone who's ever felt bored with their life, been dissatisfied with their job, or run up way too many credit card bills. I suppose it's a good thing that this message comes from a criminal psychopath, or else someone might take it seriously.Bottom line, there are really no words to describe how ludicrous, hilarious, action packed, and truly awesome this movie is. It may be the greatest 'guy movie' ever made. It's certainly deeper and more complex than most movies with its levels of sex, violence, and language. This is the kind of movie that will still be regularly quoted and shown at midnight screenings decades from now. Assuming that you have a high tolerance for mature content, do yourself a favor and pick up a copy. Oh, and even if you already know the ending, go ahead and see it anyway. It will still be one of the most entertaining things you've seen in a long time.",Fight Club

David Fincher's camera work is beautiful, he really captures some great sequences - and the editing is superb, scenes roll together in their raw, punchy nature, the film is good.As much as I can praise the style and nature of 'Fight Club', its modern 'Clockwork Orange' approach, I cannot see this film as a masterpiece. Why not? Well it doesn't have much. It's visually stimulating, it has good acting and technical aspects, but not much else.Cutting to the chase , 'Fight Club' is about an urban loner (Edward Norton) who is fed up with his boring life. On a trip he meets a soap salesman played by Brad Pitt (this man does not actually exist, it's his alter ego). After Norton's apartment is burned down, he contacts Durden (Pitt) and he moves in with him into a disgusting, run down estate. Slowly, they start the FIGHT CLUB. More and more members join across the USA and more and more attacks are carried on Blue Chip companies.As Norton spirals into paranoia, he runs away from this business of anti-social leadership, when things get strange. He realises he is Tyler Durden and finally shoots himself through the brain to kill his second personality, just in time to observe the beautifully crafted explosions of the city skyscrapers.It's engaging, but not great.

I couldn't continue the movie and keep hearing Edward narrate so often, but it grew on me once I turned it back on.The Narrator (Edward Norton)'s apartment is mysteriously blown up, so he opts to stay with Tyler (Brad Pitt). This causes Tyler to meet Marla Singer (Helena Bonham Carter), a ""big tourist"" who annoys The Narrator by existing. Tyler and Marla's relationship puts a strain on Edward's character. Tyler and The Narrator, who starts to refer to himself as Jack, begin a Fight Club, called ""Fight Club.""

Like all of his movies, Fight Club is a very dark and atmospheric movie, containing lots and lots of black humour and quite explicit violence. The plot, involving people setting up clubs were they can fight just to counter boredom is original enough by itself, but it also contains several really unexpected and shocking plot twists, much like in ""The Game"", or ""the Sixth Sense"". What's even better, these twists are actually quite believable compared to many other thrillers (for example, ""Along came a spider"" contains some of the poorest plot twists ever).

248,dpolwatte,David Fincher and his masterpiece,9,5 December 2018,"David Fincher's (DF) masterpiece is Fight Club (FC) (1999).DF who's one of the most innovative and considered a great filmmaker himself worked really hard on producing FC.FC is an american film from 1999 based on the 1996 novel by Chuck Palahniuk.The plot of the film is basically in summary is.......Edward Norton plays the unnamed protagonist, referred to as the narrator, who is discontented with his white-collar job. He forms a ""Fight Club"" with soap maker Tyler Durden, played by Brad Pitt, and they are joined by men who also want to fight recreationally. The narrator becomes embroiled in a relationship with Durden and a dissolute woman, Marla Singer, played by Bonham Carter.The director and the cast compared the film to Rebel without a cause (1955) and The Graduate (1967). They said its theme was the conflict between a generation of young people and the value system of advertising.This film is a cinematic feast. As a Sri Lankan film fanatic that troubled rebellious men is a talked about factor and loved by filmmakers and fans alike.Fight Club's got some hard hitting quotes for the audiences.Tyler Durden : The things you own end up owning you.Narrator : I found freedom. Losing all hope was freedom.Tyler Durden : It's only after we've lost everything that we're free to do anything.Tyler Durden : Listen up, maggots. You are not special. You are not a beautiful or unique snowflake. You're the same decaying organic matter as everything else.Narrator : This is your life and it's ending one minute at a time.Tyler Durden : You're not your job. You're not how much money you have in the bank. You're not the car you drive. You're not the contents of your wallet. You're not your fu*king Khakis. You're the all singing, all-dancing crap of the world.Tyler is like an annihilistic priest. His words are true but dangerous and if you blindly follow them it's chaos. And that is what you see in the film.DF's approach and style in films are basically follows.Fincher likes to map out camera movement with computer-generated imagery, commission intricate sets, gets heavily involved in post-production, and re-shoot footage after the principal photography has wrapped. He does not normally use hand-held cameras when he shoots a film, preferring cameras on a tripod, this most frequent use of a hand-held camera was for Se7en, in which five scenes were shot that way. Fincher likes to confuse audiences with his camerawork. Sometimes, it is difficult to determine whether a shot is human-controlled, motion-controlled or computer-generated imagery. Close ups are as little as possible. The interior of a refrigerator can be seen in a number of Fincher's films; this can be seen as part of character and story development.All of these are in FC.As a Sri Lankan many films like Machan (2008), Mille Soya Buongiorno Italia (2004) and Motorcycle (2016) depicts the internal and external struggles of the youth and middle aged men of Sri Lanka.And FC will be the one and only depiction of the American man's perspective in 1990's on consumerism.",Fight Club
249,theinaniloquent,"""How much can you know about yourself if you've never been in a fight?""",10,10 May 2012,"You know, it's hard sometimes when you see this extremely thought- provoking movie that thought-provokes you SO much, that you have no idea how to start your review. Other movies have hit me in some emotional way, but Fight Club did it in a secretive way. A way that I don't know what exactly hit me, but I know something hit me.. So instead of blabbering on about how much it 'hit' me, how about getting into actual stuff?The acting was surprising from both leads. Brad Pitt surprises me left & right, but this was the first time where I saw Edward Norton, and thought: ""wow, he CAN act!"" And he rightfully can. The plot, at first glance, may seem like your typical boxing movie that adds in one new thing and stamps itself ""the best movie ever."" Well that's not the case. In the first ten minutes, I thought I was watching an entire different movie. Edward Norton narrates every little thing he does, sees, or thinks. It was a really strange set-up, but the strangeness was intriguing.. Then there's the people who bash this film because they find out the twist, finding it silly. I'm sure none of these people ever heard of multiple personality disorder? I thought it was a surprising twist. And for a film like this? A fantastic twist...But plot, characters, acting, directing, sound design, cinematography, and screenplay do even qualify to compete with this film's brilliance. Strangely enough, you don't even know what was so brilliant about it. You just know that something was there that made you go ""wow"" and think and think. That's film-making.. But the whole atmosphere of the movie, the whole directorial style Fincher creates, is mystifying. He has created this genre that I can't even get a grasp on. And it contains philosophical elements as well, which further enhance the underlying brilliance of it all... And Fight Club also works as a comedy. A dark, dark comedy. Some parts are so devilish evil that you can't help but smile. Need more? Fight Club works as a counterpart. Let me rephrase. It works as a study. It works as a masterpiece. Everything and anything the movie contains was surely not what you'd expect. ""Fight Club."" You hear those words and think another attempt at creating yet another boxing movie. No depth, no substance. But when you see it, you'll understand. You'll understand a lot more of everything...Fight Club is much more an audience film than it is a critic's film. Critics rate the film itself, not even attempting to appreciate it's social commentary or it's brilliant message to the world. But I did. You will too. Fight Club competes with cinematic classics. It works as everything it's not. It's a favorite of mine. A brilliant, clever film. A film that will engage you with it's warm embrace. To have you reconciling every bit and piece. So what are you doing reading this review on the internet? Get off your lazy ass, and get out there. Do something with your life. While your sitting here doing nothing but reading this film, people are appreciating this film, while you are just reading the synopsis, trying to understand something you can't. Signed, Tyler Durden.10/10.",Fight Club
250,casey_choas66,Pass,1,10 July 2002,If director David Fincher wanted us to honestly believe that we have not evolved one bit from the scum that at one point inhabited this earth than he has brillantly done it. The first problem I have with this film is that it drags on about a half an hour to long and trust me that half an hour at the end could possibly be the stuipidest ending ever. What starts off as a promising look at a bunch of low lives letting off some stream by beating the hell out of each other (mainly due to the always great Edward Norton) slowing take a nose dive into pure stupidity. This movie becomes so trashy I had to take a shower directly after watching it to feel clean again. The main problem with this film is that there is only about 15 minutes of fighting the rest is a bunch of losers running around the city destroying things and then turns into a comptly unbeliveable ghost story. The film is not a complete watse though due to several amusing scene in Which Ed Norton punches Brad Pitt in the ear and when Pitt edits images of male genitalia into childrens movies. But besides that this could very well be the worst movie I've ever seen. So unless there is absolutly no other options steer clear of this trashy mess.,Fight Club
251,dumsumdumfai,Cooler than it needs to be..,7,31 August 2011,"With a twist ending, this seems a touch much on the cute side than it needs to be. So not dark enough.It's kind of like Usual Suspect in a sense. It is clever enough but lacks the security and confidence so it shows off a bit more than it needs to be.And the voice over is kind of disorienting, it didn't really keep me in the film. Maybe that was the distraction needed.But no detracting that it is good movie. That it is focus, the violence not excessive but has a point. True to the nature of the characters. Gets it right on the tone, settings, intensity ..etc.Brad is brad like he was in Thelma and Louise; and Norton is norton like he was in Illusionist (not Amerian history X). Really. But yet different. I think Helena is miscast in some way.But other than that, I can't get more specific.So is it really a 9 for me? I might have to reconsider.",Fight Club

Fight Club is also one of the few movies that can change your life, or at least how you look at it. The story is extremely good, and as a warning it's very, very disturbing, and very hard to explain much about it without giving the hole movie away. The screenplay should have won an Oscar, the dialogue is amazing, the characters amazing, and just how they put everything together is amazing. The acting is amazing, some of the best ever filmed, Edward Norton, Brad Pitt, and Helena Bonham Carter are all completely amazing. The direction is a little weaker, but not by any means bad. Fincher has a way of putting his characters, and audience through hell, and making the audience love it. The visual effects are also amazing, and always look very real, and very disturbing. I love this movie, I love every little thing about it.",Fight Club

However, going into this film I had already had had some of the major twists spoiled for me, and this is a movie that relies so heavily on those twists that knowing them will detract from the experience significantly. Because of that, the film is really only worth seeing of you have no prior knowledge of it whatsoever.",Fight Club
255,Aidan McGuinness,Absolutely brilliant - Fincher's work is incredible,10,7 January 2002,"Let me say straight away: See this movie. It's absolutely fantastic. It's one of only a handful (and by that I mean under five) movies where, after seeing it, I just sat in my seat in the cinema for a few moments because I was so stunned: It's that good. First of all the story-line. It's obviously counter-culture but it's doing it with it's tongue firmly lodged in it's cheek (after all it's commenting on consumerism through a Hollywood movie). It's a well paced storyline. The only detraction is that the ""twist"" is sometimes unbelievable in retrospect and can make the movie seem somewhat silly at times but I can let that slide.The acting... It's got Edward Norton. He's my favourite actor. I'm left in awe of him. He's incredibly good. He is the ultimate cynic in this movie. Brad Pitt perfectly counter-points him and once again shows he is far from being a pretty boy actor. And Mrs. Carter is just great as Marla - I'll forever see her as some bizarre Bohemian freak...And now the directing. Wow. A film like ""Lord of the Rings"" is beautiful in an epic kind of way. ""Fight Club"" is creative. There's so many creative touches that add to this movie. I knew David Fincher was one to watch after the fantastic ""Se7en"". His ability to direct also showed through on ""The Game"". Here however he surpasses himself. It's a visual treat. He keeps the story moving brilliantly. A scene that could have been rendered somewhat tiresome by another director has my jaw open here. Whether it's a bizarre montage of images, an extremely quick cinematic cut or a misaligned frame Fincher employs an array of skills to make this movie one of the most memorable looking movies that I have ever seen.In conclusion I say that I can't say enough nice things about ""Fight Club"". It's one of the best movies I've ever seen (and I've seen a fair few). I recommend that if you haven't seen it that you watch it immediately. And watch it multiple times. One of the very very few movies I'd give 10/10.",Fight Club

The movie is dark and unorthodox. The brutality helps drive the movie and it shows how a simple fighting group can go out of control and take a dramatic turn. It has a surprising twist ending which will knock you out cold. It was very surprising and I liked the choice it made. The movie gives clues throughout the movie that most if not all people would miss the first viewings which leaves room for re-watching it. Every time I give it another viewing, there is always something new to be found. Many people might turn away when they see the brutality but it didn't bother me. What makes this movie so special is that it dared to go where no film has ever attempted to go before and that's what makes it so special. I think that this is one of the best movies of the 90's. Its creativity can inspire hours of discussing and it will be a film which will probably age well.",Fight Club
257,Mr_Censored,The Greatest Cult Film of All-Time?,10,26 January 2010,"""That old saying, how you always hurt the one you love? Well, it works both ways."" – NarratorWhile it flopped upon its initial release and received Luke-warm reviews at best, ""Fight Club"" has worked its way over the years to becoming perhaps the biggest and best cult film of all time. Directed by David Fincher (""The Curious Case of Benjamin Button"") the film is as famous for its unique visual style as it is for its nihilistic and dark comedic tone. Its tale of anarchy was, in a way, a refreshing slap to the face of the mainstream, which is what makes it such a beautiful and unique film, and it still holds up just as well today, over ten years later.Starring Edward Norton as the Narrator, ""Fight Club"" tells the story of a man living in a sterilized environment, suffering from insomnia and yearning to unleash his pent-up angst. He doesn't know why he can't sleep and perhaps he is going crazy, but things only get more interesting when he stumbles upon an interesting character in Tyler Durden (Brad Pitt) who essentially resembles everything he himself is not. United, they take to the underground and form a fight club where grown men can come and pummel the snot out of one another in good fun. Things take a turn for the worse, though, when Tyler's plans get out of hand and a troubled woman (Helena Bonham-Carter) comes between the two conflicted personalities.The film is drawn from a bold novel by Chuck Palahniuk and is about as anti-Hollywood as a major studio film can be. Edward Norton breaks through in perhaps his finest role to date, capturing all the humor and melodramatic baggage that comes with the character exquisitely, while Brad Pitt gets a chance to go over the top in a way that few actors can handle. The film is over two-hours long, but is paced just right so that you lose track of time and feel immersed in the narrative each and every time. No doubt, it's one of Fincher's finest films and one of the best examples of film in the 1990's. Even after the twist has revealed itself, ""Fight Club"" is a movie worth coming back to time and time again.",Fight Club
258,Ziya90,The world's greatest movie?,6,28 January 2010,"Fight Club is a phenomenon of popular culture, maybe a cult classic, a miracle for some, but is it really that great or a mind blowing cinematic journey? or a real piece of cinema? No, it isn't. Maybe, Fight Club is little thought provoking including some ""cool"" aphorism or lines, but it is Fincher's most mainstream work and designed to be understood by everyone because it is a ""product"" of popular culture. I know that why is Fight Club appreciated and loved in that grand scale by population, because it is so called a ""cool"" movie. Brad Pitt plays a tough alpha male, Helena Bonham Carter plays a reckless femme fatale, there is rebellion, disobedience, ""fight clubs"", cool lines, etc. with a fast and dynamic editing. Fight Club is considered as a criticism of consumer society, capitalism and modern community, but there are movies which do that criticism better: A Clockwork Orange, Sidney Lumet's Network, Charlie Chaplin movies, even Watchmen! By the way, there is a twist about a character in the movie, but if you think about it, it just doesn't make any sense and that makes the movie illogical. The ending which is considered one of the best endings ever is lame and controversial in many ways. Fight Club underlines and explains its will and subjects in a loud way. This is not a subtle film, so it is little didactic and there is not any unforgettable scene to watch over and over again like some other great movies. I prefer even the director's Zodiac over this, a masterfully told, great piece of cinema.",Fight Club

260,Christopher_Reid,Thought provoking and riveting.,7,14 April 2007,"Fight Club is one of the most exciting and thought provoking movies I have ever seen. It stands out from most movies I've ever seen in that it seems to follow no rules, to have no limits. It doesn't follow some standard over used formula as the majority of movies do (not that that can't work well, for example the Spider-man movies).I don't think it's about finding some simple solution or philosophy for life - it's about asking questions that people don't normally ask and pushing these ideas to their extremes. The answers and overall meaning of the movie are left to the audience. Is it about an insomniac that gradually turns insane and takes some pretty stupid ideas way too far? Or is it suggesting that we are prisoners of our society the way it is and need to free ourselves and find out who we really are (by fighting each other and blowing things up 'n' stuff)?Either way, I found the movie very thought provoking and refreshingly original. The violence in Fight Club didn't bother me the least bit. I'm sure there are plenty of people that enjoy this movie primarily for the violence but I don't that should mean the movie is criticised for it's violence (as many critics have). After all, it is integral to the story and it's a superficial point to dismiss a movie on.Controversial philosophical ideas aside, Fight Club is also pretty funny (in a dark way), satirising the nature of modern consumerism and repetitive office work. Viewed as more of a dreamt philosophical exploration than a series of real events I think the humour really comes out. The book seems to have this kind of tone, I don't think it's all meant to be taken literally or too seriously.I thought the directing, acting, writing (dialogue in particular) and editing were all top notch and the music by the Dust Brothers was pretty cool too (and fitted well with the movie). I highly recommend Fight Club to anyone who hasn't yet seen it, I doubt it will be quite like anything else you've ever seen.",Fight Club

Anyways the movie is great. The direction was superb. All the actors were very suitable for their roles. Brad Pitt was great as always and I'm pretty sure that this is the best his movie. Same goes to Edward Norton (who is one of my favorite actors). Helena Bonham Carter did also a great job as Marla Singer. Just today by watching this film maybe 10th time in my life, I noticed that Bob is played by Meat Loaf, that was a very good choice in my opinion.

This to me is Brad Pitt's greatest performance to date along with the Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford. Edward Norton was also supremely superb all throughout. The direction is simply mind-bobbling from David Fincher, who has also directed some other critically acclaimed masterpieces such as Sev7n and Zodiac.

It made so little an impression on me that I cannot remember one solitary scene or player in it, although I read here that Brad Pitt participated with someone called Ed Norton (Honeymooners?).

In this 140 minute film, after the big plot twist occurs, there is not nearly enough remaining time to explore the resulting situation (but that would be a different movie).  The problem is that the film is unremittingly gruesome and at times, physically unpleasant.

Run Time: 139 mins
Genre: Drama, Thriller
Format: Widescreen, Color
Director: David Fincher
Starring: Edward Norton, Brad Pitt, Helena Bonham Carter and Meat LoafA round of nice, action, comic-book-type, opening credits gives way to a story with a lot of twists and turns. A blending between unbelievable silliness and an interesting affair. It does get to be a little long and silly. By the way, the opening credits did surprise me. What keeps you paying attention throughout the film are actually the dream sequences and flashbacks. Not the fighting action part. A nice mix, however, of social Armageddon and showing us how much extremism is a mental-thing.The characters are unlikeable and you do not care about them at all. Bad blemish for a film. In fact, the macho, nonsensical angle is quite annoying. One glaring mistake: I love seeing Meatloaf, lying dead on a table, pretending to be dead and you can clearly see him breathing, badly. Ed Norton is the shining star. A very good vehicle for him.

Edward an insomniac office worker looking for a way to change his life crosses paths with a devil-may-care soap maker Brad and they form an underground fight club that evolves into something much, much more. It's not an easy movie, it's dangerous, brutal, confrontational, a satire on modern life, brilliantly acted, packs hell lot of clap worthy one liners and above all has a distinctive tone to himself that you can't take your eyes off even for a second. Director David Fincher quite clearly understands when to go fast, when to pause so that you can enjoy the delicious scenes. He takes you through a thrilling roller coaster ride with an array of crazy characters in crazy places and in crazy circumstances. I personally did not like the way it ended but that's just a nitpicking. Don't Miss It!!",Fight Club
270,JaydoDre,"""We just had a near-life experience""",9,14 December 2014,"Edward Norton plays an emotionally troubled guy with insomnia, who is also the narrator of the film telling his own story. It is difficult to talk about the story because everything is so good that talking about anything feels like a spoiler. One thing for sure, the story is intelligent, entertaining and connects with the audience on both intellectual and animalistic levels. The believability of the plot does go down a little towards the end of the film, but who cares? The message of this movie is most interesting. It is not a new message but it is given a while new life in this movie. The first half of the film seems to show one point of view, a fairly popular point of view in the modern world, but it is later contradicted by the results of the main character's action.Even little bits in this movie can be brilliant, in fact, especially the little bits. You blink too long and you miss them, though the movie does a real good job at keeping your attention so you should not miss things too easily. Prepare to have your eyes glued to the screen in a semi-voluntary manner.The film looks amazing. It has a gritty and wonderfully disturbing look to it. There is a texture to everything. Even the people's clothes, it seems, were picked to invoke a specific feeling of texture.A lot of the film was shot at night in the city or in locations that are dimly lit and the film uses all those night lights to great atmospheric effect. So the movie, despite being gritty and textury, also ends up being really colorful. There are also some computer generated effects but they are used sparingly and to great effect, bending the viewer's mind.The dialogue is edible. If for nothing else, this what you come for. Every line is sharp and sober and hangs on to your brain with a steel hook. It really pays to see this movie somewhere where you can stop and rewind it because, like with its cinematography, the lines do not stay for long and you may miss something tasty.This is probably also Brad Pit's best role. The guy has never disappointed, but this looks like his masterpiece, like he is working his hardest and having the greatest fun doing it. Edward Norton has always had a docile delivery so he complements the insane Brad Pit very well.Perhaps my one problem is Helena Bonham Carter. It is not even her acting, which is quite good. It is the look. It is a mystery why that actress has to have the same appearance in every movie and in real life: The kooky Tim Burtonesque black-clad emo chick with wavy messy hairJust...paint the hair redor blueanything! The things is, it must be admitted that her look fits her role in this movie very well, so there is that.Also, it may be useful to point out, as the title of the movie very explicitly suggests, this movie is largely male oriented. Its bluntness, its grossness, its violence, most of its actors and even its themes are catered to guys.Fight Club is a movie for the history books. It is quite hardcore and definitely male oriented, which may limit its audience, but it is also brilliant in so many ways. Fight Club is quite possibly the most entertaining movie of all time.",Fight Club

We all at some time want to rebel against the world. We all want to knock someone off their block. However, most of us don't and we learn to accept the world and rules of the world.

After watching it several more times on DVD, I have now discovered how good it really is. The opening trip through the brain is amazing. The film quickly gathers pace and never lets up, as we listen to Jack the narrator, played by Edward Norton. He describes his life has having all the material things, a nice condo, nice furniture, he doesn't have any monetary worries. But Jack needs something different to enliven his life.After going to many health help groups to seek solace for his insomnia, he meets a bold character in Tyler Durden (played with relish by Brad Pitt), a soap salesman who becomes friendly with Jack. One night outside a bar, the two guys decide to have a fight, what the heck it's different they say. After this initial scrap, the two guys start their own underground fight club, and the membership expands rapidly. It seems there are many young men out there who want to fight. After some brutal fight scenes, Tyler starts Project Mayhem, whose purpose is to disrupt corporate buildings, and to generally cause mayhem.The other pawn in the film is Marla Singer, played by Helena Bonham Carter, who sleeps with Tyler and annoys Jack. The distrust between Jack and Tyler finally erupts into a frenzied finale, as the the surprising outcome is revealed. The film throbs with energy, style and an enigmatic spirit.

It was so bad that from time to time I had to fast forward it.This movie's biggest problem: unbelievably contrived. Its sole purpose is desperately try to be different, shocking, revolutionary, subversive. It tries so hard that it fails miserably.

In the weeks after its release, either the critics just plain DIDN'T GET IT...Or shrewdly pretended not to! Considering Fight Club's tauntingly in-your-face Political INcorrectness, it's easy to see why most critics opted to play it safe!Here is a film that almost cries out, ""HATE ME! DESPISE ME!""

275,David_Frames,Essential Viewing,10,11 June 2005,"There's a certain poetic nobility in Fight Club's disappointing box-office performance. After all, here's a movie that attacks product, profit and the capitalist doctrine and fails to be consumed - not what anyone intended but would it really do for the people involved to make an enormous windfall on the back of its release? It hardly matters anyway because anyone involved in Fight Club must have known that they'd made something so good that it would be adequate reward just to be associated with it. It's a seminal piece of work - a perfect conflation of visual and conceptual imagination that's as deceptive as one of Tyler's bars of soap. You may have thought you were going to see a movie about men beating each other up and the delicious truth is that that's just what many Americans DID think only to be confronted by a film that challenged the most basic assumptions upon which the western world functions - namely that unrestrained, free market commercial enterprise increases wealth and subsequently the quality of life. But Planet Starbucks isn't a paradise, it's nothingness and here's a film that says so more directly than most. Ed Norton's narrator is the emptiness at the heart of the system, emasculated by modernism, numbed by consumption - his life is a corporate by-product and the need to feel some kind of quantifiable human emotion creates Tyler Durden, an unrestrained force for personal liberation. Tyler's destructive counter-cultural revolution is an unflinching satirical knife to the throat of the thinking that blunts so many of us and it's astonishing to see this level of angry denunciation in a mainstream Hollywood movie. Fincher's movie is punk rock film-making, indifferent to the generic considerations that shape most American cinema and one which forces you to think about yourself and the forces that control your life. Freedom is an illusion Tyler shows us and Fincher reinforces this notion by drawing attention to the medium's illusionary potential in a series of virtuoso sequences which shatter that so-called forth wall just as the characters try and break free from the all-consuming commercial blandification of the modern world. A great film the first time you see it, a different film the second time and even better - Fight Club is a perfectly composed reaction to the modern age and its false promises. This movie really does have something important to say, whether you're ready to hear it or not is a different matter. Liberation starts here kids.",Fight Club

It was beautifully written and filmed. At first, I was a bit bored, but after we get introduced to Tyler, things start to kick off. The twist, was as I said unforeseen, this movie surprised me on many different levels. IT IS A MUST WATCH, it is enlightening and educational as well. It explores the infamous themes of how we are products of our own society and the underlying slavery within it. AGAIN, A MUST WATCH, definitely going in my top 10 list.",Fight Club
278,datorsiers2,One of the greatest movies of the 90's.,10,2 January 2015,"The 90's had a bunch of excellent movies, such as, ''The Shawshank redemption'', ''Se7en'', ''Forrest Gump'' and, of course, many other movies, Fight Club being the greatest masterpiece of 1999 to top it all.Fight Club was a unique movie, which in my opinion is the father of the excellent movie ''The Machinist'', because the idea is quite similar, both movies turning out great, of course.Many people know the movie by it's original, at the time, plot twist, where Edward Norton's and Brad Pitt's characters were really one person, Brad Pitt's character being the imaginary friend or the person who Tyler Durdan really wanted to be. The plot twist was interesting and quite shocking, but the greatest aspect of this movie, at least in my opinion, is really finding and doing whatever you really love to do in life. Tyler was a casual office worker, had a great condo, with everything he wanted, but that was a very sad life, he was always depressed, had insomnia, which lead him to join several support groups just to feel better about himself.Tyler Durdan's Fight Club was really a place for him to escape reality, even though not even knowing, that he was the head behind it all, he finally felt good about himself, despite the bad conditions he was living in. The people who joined his Fight Club were just like him, they had many problems and wanted to have some sort of redemption via that.An excellent movie, about one man and his broken mind. Everyone should have seen this movie, though only made in 1999, it has clearly went down in history as a classic. 10/10.",Fight Club

Don't get me wrong this film was good but I just can't see why it is rated so highly. If there's only 9 films supposedly better than this then I have lost all faith in the IMDb rating system.After all I had heard about this I was expecting an absolute classic, which is what it is being classed as. With that expectation it fell horribly short. For me this is just worth a one time watch and is a decent 7/10 movie at best.I thought this was supposed to be FIGHT Club, well there was very little fighting or action. The drama was good and did keep me gripped for quite a long time but then when the twist came it was just stupid. Maybe it's just not for me.7/10.",Fight Club
281,lotus_chief,Look through the 'violence' and you'll find a true gem....,8,30 August 2004,"This film could very easily be frowned upon if one doesn't really look at what's being presented.  From the blunt title to the underlying theme of fist-fight clubs, on face value 'Fight Club' would be seen as just a macho man-movie with nothing behind it.  The actual violence isn't really that much if you think about it....only one person actually dies in the movie. As someone pointed out in the DVD booklet, you see more violence in the first 10 minutes of 'Saving Private Ryan' than you see in all 139 minutes of Fight Club.  The highlight of the film is the great acting and even better dialogue. This is one of those films that can stand on its piercing dialogue alone, you don't feel that its 2 hours and 20 minutes.  This is Edward Norton's finest performance along with Primal Fear and probably American History X. This is also one of Brad Pitt's best moments, he played the alter ego perfectly.  David Fincher has a knack for the disjointed, dark feel, and he uses it to perfection here.Fight Club is a much deeper film than one would think, seeing how it was marketed and advertised.  As far as it being on the Top 250 list, that's probably attributed more to male teens just infatuated with the macho male pride fist-fighting and blood rather than the message buried inside.  Still, 'Fight Club' is one of the best films to come out in the past few years.***1/2 out of **** stars.",Fight Club
282,honorhorror,"Had to be ignored by Oscar, but was never forgotten by youngsters.",10,8 August 2009,"When I saw a movie like Fight Club, it came to me that maybe the society and its critics, consensus and medias are too superficial. And, maybe it's the underground things that ruled.Don't call me crazy, cause that's the situation Fight Club met in the 10 years of its releasing. A lot of people blamed the Oscar for ignoring it, but I don't think that's necessary. Because, that's the way this movie worked. It's transmitting negative, anti-social and extreme ideologies to people, so by any means you shouldn't give it an Oscar. That's how the whole society and movie industry keep their agreement. But, don't worry. Fight Club found its own way to our minds. The movie is a trousers-striper who striped the trousers of the consumerism society and everyone who enjoyed themselves in it silently. So, if you feel offended by Fight Club, congratulations! It meant you are in the mainstream and doesn't need a change. If, more fortunately, you are encouraged and enlightened by Fight Club, congratulations again. It means you are exactly the targeted audiences of this crazy movie, and you 've just found your therapy group. It looked like there are hardly a middle-way, if you talk it in front of the public, that you have to either disapprove it or approve it. That's why I liked it.Nowadays people laugh at you if you try to reason with them by biblical teachings. So maybe sometimes they need something more ""explosive"" and ""dynamic"" to challenge their life-time values. Shake it baby! Shake your head or your heart!

285,lagriff05,An experience like no other,10,16 June 2007,"It's so hard to review a classic like this. There's nothing you can find to say besides ""this rules, go buy it immediately."" But here's my stab at reviewing this masterpiece, and to date one of my favorite movies.This is a great movie. It's entertaining and very charming, and all the actors do a wonderful job. It's 2 and a half hours long, yet manages to keep you wanting more and more. It doesn't hold back either; there are a few pretty violent parts in here. The directing is top-notch, out of this world. Dark and surreal with a touch of silliness and satire in there, David Fincher's directing is genius and untouchable. Every scene here is extremely memorable; some touching, some humorous, and some riveting.The acting is through the roof, and Brad Pitt delivers one of his best performances yet. In every movie I've seen from the man, he manages to take on a completely new persona, disappearing into the role like a man into camouflage. There are no traces of his own personality here that we can detect, and he delivers a realistically insane performance, convincing us that he's not PLAYING Tyler Durden, but that he IS Tyler Durden. Ed Norton plays a hesitant and mousy little man being brought---forced---out of his safe shell and into the hard world, and he does it in a way that nobody else really could. I can't picture anyone else delivering the lines that Norton does here. Of course, the other actors are great as well, but I'm only going to mention our main two due to time constraints.The story isn't told in a traditional sense, but rather ""read"" like a narrator's commentary in a novel, and I've never quite seen anything like it. I suppose this can be attributed to the fact that it was originally a novel by Chuck Palahniuk, and David Fincher tied it all together, giving us a very memorable narration that we view like we read a novel. One of my favorite attributes of the film.Now, that plot may sound odd when you read it without seeing the film, but this is a very deep movie. It's telling us to let loose a bit, showing us that we worry too much over materialistic possessions. And we do, that's the problem. The Narrator had so many material possessions in his home, bought everything the finest, but was he happy? Do materialistic things ever make us happy? Does having a white-collar job and a nice home guarantee happiness and security? No, and that's what Fight Club wants to tell us.The fight club itself...it's an escape from reality of sorts. Men who were trapped in a vicious, dull cycle of life found their escape by coming down to the fight club and letting their aggression out, having fun. The Narrator's view on life is a pessimistic one, and he sees our consumer-obsessed culture, although he is not able to escape it. Tyler Durden is somewhat of a polar opposite for the Narrator, with his carefree attitude and explosive ideals. This movie's overall theme is to stop conforming, to just say ""screw it"" and destroy everything in your way. Destruction leads to salvation. Chaos leads to order, as is stated in the film.In conclusion, this is essential for anyone who likes good movies and can stand a bit of violence. My highest recommendation.",Fight Club
286,hemant_balz,Rampant chaos.,10,2 April 2010,"Fight club ,a brilliant concept and a brilliant ending.This movie twists your mind and bends it in various dimensions.The plot itself makes you feel strange and the narration by Edward Norton here is very much captivating.Faced paced mystery,fight club stands out in the league of movies like Memento and The Usual Suspects.Edward Norton's best surely after American History X.His greatest performance and a fantastic narration.Brad Pitt role of Tyler Durden is one of the very unique roles you will ever see.Brad Pitt dialogs and just his presence on the screen speaks for itself.Acting of everyone is mind blowing and i cannot forget Helena Bonham Carter as Marla.She is a kind of drug addict in the movie and her depiction by the director is superb.David Fincher's another masterpiece.This is a superb thriller,showing how people can take out their frustration by turning to aggression.The ending is very unique.And you just cannot imagine the ending.Cinematography is brilliant.Surely after watching this once,you would have to see it again.International cinema has such gem of a thinking that i cannot even imagine.Mind blowing cinema.Fight club fascinates and creates chaos in the mind.But thats the need for our generation now.And if you are afraid of fighting go for fight club,then you will feel a rampant chaos that will surely change your attitude towards films.",Fight Club
287,jay4stein79-1,An overrated film by an overrated director based on an overrated book by an awful writer,3,16 April 2006,"I can't go on. No, I will go on. Fight Club represents one of the worst films I've ever encountered inasmuch it aims for intelligence and subversion but winds up wide of the mark. It's gimmicky and trite and all together pointless. I didn't enjoy it when I first saw it, and now I despise it because some people have elevated it to the level of a masterpiece. Those people are wrong. In trying to address violence in American culture (at least I hope that was the film's intention), the movie fails entirely. It does nothing to subvert the brutal violence on screen or address it in any meaningful manner. Look at Sergio Leone or Sam Peckinpah; they made often violent films that pique the audience's bloodlust only to ultimately undermine that desire for violence. Leone built up the tension and then refused to show you the gore you wanted; Peckinpah slowed it down to the point that the violence became unbearable. Fincher may have wanted to have the same effect on his audience, but he doesn't; the violence in Fight Club is enjoyed by the audience and they keep wanting more. It explores the lure of violence to a degree but then backs off this more thoughtful approach in favor of simply showing the violence. There isn't an attempt made by the filmmakers to question the characters' actions and that seems to me a grave mistake. As for the philosophical elements of this film? They're adolescent beliefs in breaking free of monotony and ennui; the anti-materialist screed, though justified by our culture, is ultimately shallow. It's angry at consumerism and our love of objects (doesn't this movie love gadgetry and gimmickry though?), but it doesn't really show us any alternative, unless the alternative is violence. And, frankly, I'm not willing to accept that. Or maybe the movie's just saying that the dehumanization present in contemporary society could lead to violence. That's okay, but what's the solution. When you have a film that doesn't really look at quasi- fascist ideas in horror, you need to offer us something. This adolescent nihilism is just, well, silly teenage claptrap. It's like this: when I was 15, I love A Clockwork Orange; I'm older now and find the nihilism of its characters as well as its attempts at formulating ideas about society superficial. That's probably what will happen with the majority of this film's supporters. They'll grow up and realize its an adolescent fantasy made by older men who have yet to mature.",Fight Club

289,Jonathon_Natsis,What is Fight Club about?,10,6 April 2011,"You might as well be asking the meaning of life. Because for all the interpretations that have surfaced about what exactly this film is telling us, not one can be confirmedor ruled out. Maybe it's a criticism of consumerism; a world of advertising that bombards us with images of who 'they' want us to be with such ferocity that we start to believe it. Maybe it's urging us to break free of the constraints of society, a society we're supposed to fear, admire, respect, serve, and live life free. Or maybe it's just so satiric that the preacher himself, Tyler Durden, with his too-cool hairstyle and nightclub-junkie sunglasses, exists only to parody the very nature of anarchy, a lying hypocrite constantly firing useless one-liners and incoherent 'philosophy.'Whatever Fight Club is about, it is a masterpiece of modern cinema. Based on the novel by Chuck Palahniuk, director David Fincher has created a dangerous film that exposes the intense power of the will to change one's life. The unnamed narrator (Edward Norton) is stuck in a dead-end job and attends support groups for the terminally ill just to feel some emotion in his life. There he meets the mysterious and twisted Marla Singer (Helena Bonham Carter) who has the same problem. Desperate to make something of his existence before he dies, an encounter with eccentric soap salesman Tyler Durden (Brad Pitt) gives the narrator exactly the chance he needs.The characterisation of all three main characters is extraordinary. One could argue each actor gives a career-best performance, adding immeasurable weight to the film's message, whatever it may be. Norton's deadpan narration of every painstaking moment of his life doesn't so much justify his actions as it emphasises them. Pitt's character is the one that benefits most from a brilliantly unique script that never fails to impress, full of refreshing dialogue and devoid of any clichés. Meanwhile, the consistently underrated Carter brings the vampiric Marla to life (no pun intended), giving a marvellous turn as the narrator's morbid love interest who envies the dead and preys on those close to joining them.I regard this movie as highly as I do because, just like the characters themselves, it relishes in breaking all the rules. Where other movies follow a set system of guidelines that eventually result in a film falling into one or two genres, Fight Club dosen't try to classify itself, but instead tells its story without letting convention get in the way. The film is driven solely by the narrator's recollection of what he and Tyler built, and if he wants to backtrack, stop time or ignore something he'd rather not pay attention to, then the audience is forced to do the same.Fincher makes it very clear that we shouldn't forget that what is on-screen is fiction, and that allows him to play with all sorts of fourth-wall-breaking techniques. This gives the film a unique touch rarely seen in movies past and present, but more importantly, it gives the viewer perfect reason to suspend their disbelief, especially when things get more sinister towards the Third Act. For better or for worse, the vast majority of people will remember Fight Club for its blindsiding twist ending, a moment recognised in pop culture so frequently it is almost impossible not to know it even without watching the film. Regardless, I urge anyone who has yet to see it to give Fight Club their full attention. And even if you can't decide upon exactly what it means after the first screening (like me), you can at least marvel at the surreal cinematography, threatening performances from all involved, and the efforts it took to create a film so steeped in fan-dividing social commentary, psychology and satire all at the same time. *There's nothing I love more than a bit of feedback, good or bad.

291,quinimdb,Fight Club,10,21 June 2016,"""Fight Club"" is a film that went from unknown to a cult film realized for its smart satire to a film with a large following, but loved by many of the people that it satirizes. In a way, this progression reflects the progression of the fight club in the film itself.The film begins as seemingly a satire of consumer culture and our mundane lives. The main character has insomnia and is a slave to consumer culture and his boring 9 to 5 job where he hates his boss. The one frame inserts of Tyler Durden into the narrators boring life show his desperation to escape his routine. He is so desperate in fact that he starts going to support groups after his doctor recommends going to one to understand ""true pain"". He realizes that when people are dying they are so raw and truthful and just don't care about the trivial things that he does, and it makes him feel better. He begins to start sleeping well but a woman that does the same thing as him shows up, except she does it simply because it costs less than a movie and has free coffee, but she reminds him of his own lie. The narrator explains that she knows that she could die at any moment, therefore she does what she wants. His insomnia starts up again. He confronts her and they exchange numbers. From here, it starts to show the narrator wake up on planes in places that he doesn't recognize and he doesn't remember how he got there. He meets various normal people on planes that he calls ""single serving friends"". The most interesting one, however is Tyler Durden. He is cool, different, anti- establishment, and completely aware of all of the trivial things in our daily lives. He points out that there are many safety devices on planes that only exist to make us feel safer. When all of the narrators belongings go up in flames in an apartment fire, he calls Tyler. He doesn't know why, but we know it's because Tyler is subconsciously what the narrator wants to be. While the narrator is sulking about his lost belongings, Tyler shows his distaste for consumer culture. He knows ""what we own can end up owning us"". When they walk outside, Tyler tells the narrator to hit him. Tylers logic is that if he's never gotten in a fight before then how would he know if it was a good thing or not. They fight, and the narrator begins to feel liberated from his boring routine. He moves into a broken down home, and begins to fight more with Tyler. More people see them fighting one night and join. Eventually there is a whole club. Tyler establishes rules (rule number one, you do not talk about fight club), and so far, all this seems logical enough. For one I've never been in a fight, so I wouldn't know how it could feel, and two, I'm sure all of us have thought of breaking from the usual routine. Also, most importantly, Tyler seems cool and smart. But one night when Tyler holds a gun to a man's head, but spares him, and tells him to become a veterinarian (what he is currently in school for) in the next six weeks or he will be dead. We are shocked at first, but Tyler not only gave this man motivation to do what he wants to do with his life, and as he explains ""that mans breakfast will taste better than any other meal we have ever had"". It sounds logical, he made that man appreciate life, but as the next scene shows, he is manipulating us as well as the people in the film. He looks directly into the camera and tells us what he later tells his army as we see the edges of the film roll. We then realize how hypocritical and insane this all is. It is an anarchist and anti- establishment group whose followers are even more brainwashed than the consumers that they were originally mocking. They have a large list of rules and do mindless work and terrorist attacks for a leader that controls them completely. It is both a satire of consumerism and daily life as we're told to live it and the anarchists that it inspires. What it suggests is a balance in which you are not made numb by the mundanes of everyday life, and you don't buy brand name furniture and appliances to make you feel like you have meaning, but you also shouldn't become anarchistic to escape your lifestyle to the point of inciting meaningless violence and having cult like activities. This balance is suggested by the narrator and Marla holding hands at the end.What elevates the film to a 10/10 however, is the commentary on the emasculation of men (specifically through testicular cancer), and what that does to them, and how they come to grips with that. I won't go in depth, as this is already going long, but the very end is great, where the narrator holds Marla's hand as the buildings in front of them collapse, while their pose and clothes mirror each other, with narrator seemingly wearing a dress, showing that he has accepted his feminine side. But, back with the other satire of the film, Tyler seems to have the last word as he corrupts the film, which is ultimately a commercial product (there is even a Pepsi ad in the film as well as noticeable product placement), by inserting a few frames of a penis.",Fight Club
292,perica-43151,This movie is overrated,7,21 July 2018,"The Fight Club movie, like its more successful but equally troubled cousin The Matrix, has some philosophical themes, originality in presentation, and is also strong on satire. Another movie that it is similar in some ways is vastly superior and more intelligent and fun American Psycho. The plot is adapted from the eponymous book, which ""borrows"" ideas from Dostoevsky's ""The Double"" and puts some ""Thus spoke Zarathustra"" along a way. It is derivative and not very good, certainly not as good as its cult followers would suggest. In any case, given the hype, I was expecting more. There are some good points along the way - especially its anticipation of terrorism, and some good transformational scenes, like when confronting a boss, but overall, it comes across as much more shallow than its reputation would suggest. It is high on style and influence, has lot of ideas crammed in and it might have been even revolutionary in some respects for its time (like the Matrix, which I also find a bit missing), so perhaps its worth a watch, but it is not a perfect masterpiece some assume it is. It may seem so to perhaps teens, incels and millenials, but this is not the most successful nor sophisticated rendering of such ideas.

295,film_riot,Fight Club,9,16 October 2007,"An excellent film. A lot of the credit for ""Fight Club"" I think should go to the writer of the novel Chuck Palahniuk. What a great way to talk about our modern day society. The film looks like your typical Hollywood popcorn blockbuster flick and has therefore a real mass appeal. But below the surface of a very well made thriller there is a not too hard to find subtext (at least the headlines of the subtext are not too hard to find) about our capitalistic society that everyone should be able to catch. I'm not sure if Fincher's stylization made the best possible movie out of this novel, but it definitely found the best possible middle course between mass appeal and message. Edward Norton is to be watched in the role that turned him into a massive star. And as he is one of the finest actors of his generation, to watch him is just a joy. David Fincher favourite Brad Pitt plays Tyler Durden and is as iconic as the amazing Helena Bonham Carter in her part as Marla Singer.",Fight Club
296,renaldo and clara,Let's get it straight,10,10 September 2001,"Let's get it straight people: Fight Club was about one man's mid-life crisis; the way he got past feeling helpless with his work and love life. That's it; that's the summary. Now I can go on....SPOILER    SPOILER    SPOILER    SPOILER    !!!!!!
I've commented on this film before but since then , like  A BILLION (no offense, but) mind-numbingly *STUPID* comments have been entered about why the film's ending ""didn't make sense"" or ""brought the movie down"", or  ""to be anti- Corporate America is too easy""....whatever, shut up already; you've missed the whole point! About THE ENDING:Guys, Tyler is NOT REAL. We all realized that he is a fictional character in the Narrator's head. Now, that being said, the narrator's also got a horseshoe up his ass, because he's been pretty damn lucky up until that point; being beaten up every day and starting Project Mayhem w/out getting killed or arrested. Not even getting fired! Getting eveybody on his side! For a split-personality disorder sufferer, this guy has got some positive force on his side. Could it be within himself? Where Tyler has become unrelentingly powerful and threatening to the Narrator by the film's end, could it be that there is another character opposite of what the narrator was; a strong person, willing to survive and care and live life to it's fullest? This is the narrator's new outlook on life, Marla changed him and forced him to grow up.When he shot Tyler, he believed he was shooting himself, tbus killing his mind, thus killing Tyler. What people don't realize is that this other force, the one that began seeing that Tyler was too over-the-edge, the one that started to like Marla, TOOK OVER when he shot himself with that gun. So he shot himself in the ear/mouth instead of the head, because there was the will to live. When Tyler is present, you can't take what you see at face value, bc there are no other witnesses. When Tyler breathes out smoke b4 dying, that is the Narrator's mind thinking he has killed that demented, egotistical side of him to get past this mid-life crisis and to be able to understand women and to fall in love with one.Another thing : the entire movie is always hinting that today, men go through mid-life crises at a younger age. The narrator just went through his, and we got to see it!",Fight Club
297,renaldo and clara,Best movie of '99,10,5 September 2000,"Having much less violence than I thought- hey, no intentions to KILL, no impalement- I found that there is a reason why younger audiences can relate better to this movie than older ones. And it's not because of the soundtrack, or the actors.    It's the curiosity young people still have for something, whether positive or negative, scratching just below the surface of American culture.    Yeah, older people find it bad that they have to live in a society where they are forced to 'work jobs they hate so they can buy  s@!t they don't need', but they just want to live the rest of their lives as simply as possible. Young people haven't been yet traumatised by what is ugly, filthy, and honest; so they are kind of intrigued by it. They can see through the dirt and blood of the movie and see the real story behind <Fight Club>.     About a 20-something man who feels out of touch with reality. We can all relate to this, but if you're young enough, you'll really enjoy this thrilling ride into the post-modern American psyche.     
     It will be hard for Fincher to top this masterpiece, but if he's as consistent as he has been, we're in for a lot more...I can't wait!    ----------Of all movies, I could have written a more extensive review on THIS one, but I'll let the more experienced reviewers below spell it out. Just know that, though I never rate  movies, I gave this one a 10!(And I'm into romantic comedies!)=)

298,thedarkhorizon,"Detail-loving Fincher creates the story with perfection: brilliant, deep, philosophical - I will rewatch countless times!",8,2 December 2019,"Finally I saw the movie and I must say - I was IMPRESSED. I expected nothing more than an action flick (clearly I do not know Fincher 's style for real... it was my second Fincher film, and I will watch all after them! ) and it was so, so much more.Honestly, how many times have you seen a movie that, with every viewing, gets even more complicated yet so simple that you can't help but laugh. There's the tiny issue of the story of Fight Club, penned by Chuck Palahniuk the story is nothing short of incredible, a pure shock-value social commentary on the state of the world at the end of the century. You'll cry, you'll laugh, you'll do all the clichés but most importantly you'll identify with every single thing on the screen.FINCHER has an incredible skill of locking the viewer into the actor (by following EXACTLY the actor's movements, making the motion interlock with the acted-out emotions of the actors). He is a genius on using music, drama and humor each time it is needed... there is so many deep and light, humorous scenes, it is like a roller coaster.Each shot is well laid out and designed, always struck with detail, texture, color, composition to fit the actual message. Fincher is an EXPERT (as I read after) in blending in the FX / CGI into the real material, creating the best illusions that are better / deeper than reality - and it shows in the film. Each scene is detailed, but in a subtle way that does not give away it's secrets straight away.I love the set design as well, the choice of worn out buildings, glas high rise apartments, boredom-dripping office spaces - a believable world of US cities that still tells a nearly unreal suburbia vibe.This is perfection and I will rewatch this COUNTLESS times!",Fight Club
299,ajit2106,A cinematic Tour de force- Metamorphosis,9,31 August 2011,"I think this is one of the best mystery-thriller movie ever made in the world. It is strange dark and subtle, has every component of a great cinema.A person challenges to his sanity and insanity concurrently, one can reveal one's abnormal sensitivity to stimulation himself. ""There is a fine line between reality and fiction"" this movie elaborates the sentence. A person can go to any length in order to achieve his goals. You will be forced to maintain the complete attention because you are simply fascinated.Edward Norton gives an outstanding performance as an insomniac and perplexed protagonist. Brad Pitt is charismatic as he possesses an extraordinary ability to attract. Helena Bonham Carter has done a fabulous job (""Dr Jekyll and Mr Jack Ass""). Rest of the gang of the fight club is just fantastic.David Fincher has crafted this movie so finely which is spellbinding until the mystery open after ""Seven"", ""The game"" and ""Insomnia"".Tyler Durden: ""People do it everyday, they talk to themselves... they see themselves as they'd like to be, they don't have the courage you have, to just run with it"".It is one of my all time favorite movie, loved watching this every now and then.",Fight Club
300,dhaufrect-1,Difficult to Watch,3,1 March 2005,"""Fight Club"" is difficult to watch. It is filled with violence for violence sake without any redeeming qualities. Norton is a youth looking for a change of life style at an early age. Pitt plays a vulgar young man with pure violence on his mind. He infects his contacts with the same concept of life. Scene after scene is filled with blood and gore. Most of the violent behavior is purely hand to hand combat as in real boxing. If the author meant for us to be turned off by the physicality, then he has succeeded. The pace is frenetic, and the acting is just as fast. I could not give this cinema a high score simply because of the dark, depressing mood it exudes without projecting some sort of uplifting characteristic's.",Fight Club

302,nashw82,David Fincher at his best,10,7 September 2020,"David Fincher and co do an amazing job of bringing a complicated and existential novel to life on the big screen. Pitt and Norton do a fantastic job of capturing the themes and the essence of the novel and really pushing the audience to consider their life choices. Throw in a great supporting cast including Helena Bonham Carter as the suicidal waif and Meatloaf as the over the hill bodybuilder to round things out. The twist is handled so well that repeat viewings are essential. Definitely worth having in your collection, and if you enjoy the film then I recommend the book.",Fight Club
303,Jakemcclake,Pretty Good - But Not Great,7,21 February 2013,"This movie has been hailed by many (mostly men) as the greatest movie of all time. It has been continually rising up the ""Top 250"" and now ranks as the 10th best on IMDb.I'm sorry, after 4 viewings, I still do not get to that level. I don't think I ever will.I have read many of the reviews and I agree with most of the positive comments and do not agree at all with most of the negative reviews. The movie is not dumb by any means. It is not an experience in testosterone driven world of violence. It is anything but a mess.It is a very well written, extremely well directed, view into a dark anti-consumerism world.The movie's message is recognize consumerism and reject consumerism. As such, it presents the conflict between two characters Tyler Durden played by Brad Pitt and someone who is called Jack, Rupert or Cornelius and who is played by Edward Norton.Jack is quite a consumer, or at least at the start of the movie he is. There is also Marla Singer played by (Helena Bonham Carter), who is both like Tyler in most ways and like Jack in other ways.Tyler is basically against everything society values, and virtually anything positive. He argues with, and eventually begins to win Jack over to his thinking. At one point, he fights Jack and the two of them create fight club. Tyler also has a sexual relationship with Marla, despite the fact that his friend Jack can't stand to be around her.The movie has a good and memorable twist. The movie is loaded with numerous unique and memorable quotes. Most of the quotes are very negative. The movie is extremely intelligent and every frame of the movie is meant to be in the movie for some reason. The Director, David Fincher is Fantastic.If we desperately needed a movie against consumerism: this is it! Here is one of the quotes: ""You're not your job. You're not how much money you have in the bank. You're not the car you drive. You're not the contents of your wallet.""If we needed a positive movie or a positive message or to learn something positive, or something that at least makes us feel good or feel uplifted in some way, This is not it, and This is anything but it.Here is another one of the movies' unique quotes that gets shouted more than once:""You're the all-singing, all-dancing crap of the world."" Here is another line that someone shouts: ""You are not special. You are not a beautiful or unique snowflake. You're the same decaying organic matter as everything else.""If you like dark negative movies, this is a good one. If you want to be uplifted, this is not your movie, it's Jack Movie as the DVD tells you.",Fight Club
304,Sankari_Suomi,Existentialism and eroticism in a stylish package,8,2 April 2014,"A brilliant existential thriller, in which Edward Norton's brutally masculine character dominates an effeminate Brad Pitt.Despite its heavy-handed homoeroticism the movie is a powerful celebration of contemporary heterosexual manhood.Trapped within his corporate prison, the protagonist slowly undergoes a shocking transformation into the ultimate Nietzschean Übermensch and destroys society in a final act of triumphant nihilism.Meat Loaf makes a brief appearance as the bisexual Mormon who has lost his testicles to cancer (some extrapolation is required here).Helena Bonham Carter is also present in certain scenes.I rate 'Fight Club' at 26.64 on the Haglee Scale, which works out as a solid 8/10 on IMDb.",Fight Club
305,shaun98,Well...,9,2 March 2000,"It's been over two months since I went to see it, and my feelings towards the film are still somewhat mixed. Part of me feels repelled by the graphic violence (I winced several times), but another part wishes I'd directed it myself.The film has been compared to ""A Clockwork Orange"". Granted, it's not quite as good, but it sure sticks in your mind, I'll give it that. Certainly one of the most daring movies ever made, FC never backs down or pulls any punches, but constantly pushes the envelope. It's a love-it-or-hate-it affair, but whatever your feelings, you can't deny the dazzling technical skill displayed by David Fincher. The camerawork and editing is first rate, although perhaps a bit too flashy at times.The acting is pretty damn good. Brad Pitt delivers his most memorable performance (his best since ""12 Monkeys""), and Edward Norton is simply superb. He is one of the great actors of our time. Helena Bonham Carter also comes off brilliantly. I found her both attractive and repulsive-a VERY difficult balance to pull off.Once, I took a mass media class, and they showed this awful video showing two crabby old men whining about how much violence there is in the media. I can only imagine what they would say about FC, they would certainly seperate content and context and miss the point entirely. It's very violent, yes, but it's not there for it's own sake. It's a statement on alienation and miscontent in today's society.",Fight Club
306,Starbuck-13,Civilization sucks? Not in my book...,3,25 May 2001,"Okay, so here it is, the ultimate ""Anarchy rules"" movie of the late 90s. I had heard a lot about the film and was very eager to finally see it. Unfortunately, I was disappointed in nearly every bit - I thought the movie was sometimes boring, sometimes way to violent and sometimes plain silly.But first for the good parts: Great cinematography and a really surprising point at the end when Edward Norton learn something about himself... it was this final change of pace that kept me from giving this movie a ""1 out of 10"" rating...But now for the worst parts:Incredibly idiotic monologue sequences. Edward Norton keeps on babbling about whatever you do not want to hear. Meaningless chatter which really starts getting on your nerves after a short while.Gratuitous violence. Excessive portrayals of men beating on other men already lying helpless on the floor. Now, this might have been one important point the film wanted to show, that people tend to be cruel to each other once the barriers in the mind have fallen down - but well, I found out that I just was appalled by this and could see no point in repeatedly seeing bloody people being delivered to a hospital...Unbelievable story developments. Suddenly, practically everybody seems to be a member of the Fight Club. They are not only everywhere, they are getting more and more aggressive in their attempts of destroying society. Things are getting out of hand - I had a hard time swallowing what the director wanted us to believe here...All in all, as I said in the beginning, a very disappointing movie with a splendid basic idea - the point I was talking about that changed the whole perception of what happened before. This point somehow reminded me of the ""Sixth Sense"", but it was not administered in such a brilliant fashion, though some scenes of the film made more sense in the aftermath. Still, as a whole I did not like it, the good parts came to late to save it.",Fight Club

308,Lucabrasisleeps,One of the modern classics,10,27 November 2008,"When I saw this classic movie 7 years ago, I was pleasantly surprised and saw it every time it came in TV. That was one of the most special things about this movie - the replay value which many other movies didn't have. Every time I watched the movie, I noticed something new - a small joke or a subtle hint that I might have missed the first time. It is not an action movie as the title suggests, but a somewhat dark comedy which can ""realign your perceptions""(as Tyler puts it).The main character is a nameless narrator who is having problems of insomnia. He goes to doctors about his problem and asks for medication. One of the doctors tells him to visit a testicular cancer support group when the narrator tells him that he is in pain.He starts going to many such groups in which he talks about his ""problem"" (even though he doesn't have it) and so he is able to sleep well. In the midst of all this, he meets Marla who also visits support groups for the same reasons as the narrator.He meets Tyler Durden on a plane. They become friends when the narrator's house is damaged in an accident. He then lives with Tyler. Tyler asks the narrator to punch him and that's how Fight club was started.The first thing that viewers may notice about the movie is the colour. The whole movie has a dark blue/green tinge which gives the movie the classic David Fincher look.The characters are mostly unlikeable. They are raw and as close to reality as possible. Almost all the characters have troubled lives and troubled relationships with parents. They are mostly aimless people with nothing to live for.The humor in this movie may be unpalatable to some viewers because of the jokes regarding testicular cancer and so on.The camera-work in this movie is brilliant. The scene where Tyler Durden crashes his car is an example of the exquisite camera-work in this movie. There are also subtle hints to the way the movie is going in the earlier frames. These hints most probably would be noticed only on the second viewing. Fincher doesn't insult the intelligence of the viewer and instead gives him enough hints to figure out the plot.As far as the performances are concerned, Edward Norton gives a great performance as the narrator who is aimless and dissatisfied with his life. Brad Pitt, as Tyler Durden, is my personal favourite as the sexual magnetism glows from the screen whenever he arrives. He was definitely the right choice for the role. Helena Bonham Carter is perfect as Marla, the confused woman who is as unhinged as the narrator himself. Meatloaf also gives a memorable performance as Robert Paulson (I didn't know he could act).It might not be a movie for all tastes but if you have a taste for dark stylish movies with unusual story lines and great performances, then this movie is perfect for you. It has become one of my favourite films of all time and I have also become a big fan of David Fincher.",Fight Club
309,zenmateisshite,Should read the book,8,29 June 2017,"I have not read the book, but probably should.Fight Club is very good at diagnosing the problems: consumerism, capitalism, warmongering, corruption, purposelessness, emptiness, greed etc... parts of the dialogue are pure poetry as they describe how many have been feeling for a long time, since before it was written and still to this day, and beyond.However, it does not offer a good solution. Anarchy and erasing credit does not solve the issues, they most likely will lead to compounding them and more of the same. There should be a radical shift, and Fight Club does not offer that. I don't think it intends to provide a good solution, just an entertaining one.As a movie it is a very good one; great acting, editing, music, camera work, script and plot twists, all of that. Its a classical cult movie.",Fight Club

I'm sorry, maybe, I didn't express myself well enough. I watched and enjoyed many movies with violence, but my  point is I don't like  (I'm sorry again) movies depicting very much misery. I believe that Fight Club couldn't have been shown otherwise. Anyway, I told you already that I didn't enjoy many with this odd picture, but as your mind and costumes may be somehow different, you may enjoy it and since this is made out of opinions you may rate this almost piece of crap however you want, but I can't give anymore than 4/10.",Fight Club

316,timmy_501,A Marxist Review of Fight Club,10,23 March 2008,"This is my humble Marxist review of Fight Club.Fight Club is about the conformist and materialist attitudes an individual must possess to be considered a productive member of society. In order to reject the narrow confines of his society, the Narrator, who begins the film as a typical drone, decides to do things that are anti-materialist. He destroys his fashionable home, refuses the insurance money he is due, and moves into a dilapidated house in a slum. Still, it is not enough for him to merely passively reject his society; he must lash out and show his contempt for it. He begins by fighting strangers, an action that is anathema to normal bourgeois people of the type he mostly interacts with. He eventually joins with working class people in an attempt to overthrow the oppressive upper class. Finally, he sees that his methods are likely to prove ineffective; yes, the society to which he belongs should be rejected but his followers follow him blindly; they are just as guilty of being conformists as the people he worked with before. If they are put in power, they will rebuild society with all of the same problems-the only difference is that it will be even more brutal than it was before.If you are a student of history ( especially a Marxist) you will see how the Narrator's situation is a good metaphor for pretty much every revolution that has occurred over the last one hundred years; particularly the Bolshevik revolution in Russia.Fight Club lends itself to other interpretations; this is just one simple take on it.",Fight Club

318,Dodger-9,The best movie of 99,10,15 December 1999,"'Contains Spoilers' What can you say about a movie which has become one of the most notorious of the last few years?Well, it's shocking, funny, dynamic, unforgettable, queasy and original. As with Trainspotting three years ago, David Fincher's latest film burrows deep into your subconscious and stays there.Long after most of the year's releases are collecting dust on the video shelves of the world, Fight Club will still be there, lying dormant in your brain, just waiting for someone to trigger off the collective memory of this grimy, hyper-stunning tale.Edward Norton is Jack, the narrator who, as the story opens, is an insomniac suffering from life in the late 20th century. He exists to collect more must have items from the IKEA catalogue and achieve a nirvana-like completeness.In an attempt to find some sort of feeling in his vaccuum of a life, he starts attending support groups for men with testicular cancer, tuberculosis and the like. Finding comfort in the ""bitch tits"" of Robert Paulson (Meat Loaf), our hero cries his heart out and realises he is still alive after all.Until Marla Singer (Helena Bonham Carter) arrives that is.Like our narrator, Marla is a tourist. A strung-out harpy of a woman who seeks some meaning to her own meaningless existence.Jack cannot feel happiness while he is aware that there is another imposter in the room so they reach a deal and a bizarre relationship constructed of mutual respect for one another's bizarre interest.When Jack meets Tyler Durden (Brad Pitt) on a flight, his life is turned upside down by the soap salesman with a bizarre dress sense.The besuited hero goes back to his apartment to find the place has been gutted by a gas explosion and so in a fit of desperation, Jack rings Durden.They meet up at a local bar, have a few beers and eventually our numb yuppie gets to stay with Tyler.Before long the two men are living together in one of the most decrepit houses ever seen in a major motion picture. This makes The Bradbury in Blade Runner look like Mimi Rogers' apartment in Someone To Watch Over Me.One night they start clashing in a bar forecourt - no malice in these fisticuffs though. Just the affirmation that both men are alive in a world where consumerism has taken precedence over feeling.The scuffle leads to the eponymous organisation, an underground arena for businessmen, blue collar workers and the like to beat the crap out of each other and feel good about it.Jack starts turning up at work with bruises and the sort of manner that marks him out as a man to be avoided. He starts dressing down, bleeding onto his collar and sporting gashes that make his colleagues back away in fear.And so it goes. Fight Club spreads...The first hour of the movie leads you down one straight, dimly lit path, brilliantly executed with living catalogues creating themselves from thin air, close-ups of gas cookers releasing their invisible cargo to a doom-laden room and just the sort of eye-catching visuals that has made Fincher one of the best directors of his generation.What did it mean to me? Well, like one of the disillusioned masses that seeks solace in the comfort of pre-packaged food, franchise furniture stores and mind numbing TV, this is an epiphany of a film. A jet black comedy that left me feeling sick and in a state of altered consciousness - if you're driving home from the movies afterwards, you may need time to collect your thoughts as this is not one of the movies where you just go and get a burger afterwards, having forgotten the plot by the time you get to the counter.Ironically, Fincher's visuals will be lifted by the very companies he is taking the mickey out of over the next few years and this thorn in the side of the moral majority will achieve cult status on video - after all, everyone will want to freeze frame the subliminal moments when both Tyler and Marla appear.However, if you get the chance, catch this on the big screen with a decent sound system and an open mind.Although the actual bone-splintering fight scenes will leave you felling sick, this is not a movie about fighting. It's a film in which the disillusioned masses, born in a generation of TV and video games without soul, try to make sense of a plastic culture.Even if it means losing their minds in order to do so.",Fight Club
319,jacksisjax,Bellatrix Lastrange? What are you doing with Hulk?,7,17 August 2020,"Had to think about this movie before I reviewed it because this movie was just wack and I kinda needed to process it.The first 30 or 40 minutes or so were probably the best 30 or 40 minutes of a movie I've ever seen. Perfect performances, perfect story, perfect direction, perfect editing, wildly creative.
It's not that the movies quality went downhill. It was steadily really great. I just don't love the direction the story went in, it got kinda dark, nasty and trashy. Which I get is all a necessary part of the story but I didn't love it, I think they took it a wee to far, and that's just not my thing.
But I do understand why this movie has such a huge following. It is very cool and different, it's got some stellar quotes in there. It's mind bending and mind bending movies are great, especially when they're done well. So I understand the hype, and kind of agree on some level with it.Ironic- it's a movie about cult followings, and the movie is a cult classic that's got one of the biggest followings.I am not a fan of the ending as well.

I always like Edward Norton a lot, for a change Brad Pitt gives a decent performance, and the plot is nicely twisted, but ultimately the movie is just dumb. I think that a movie like this can be more than an exercise in style only when the plot makes some sense. The plot in this movie makes no more sense than something like ""Atlas Shrugged"", so the movie is just high class junk. It's pretty hard to discuss the plot without putting in a spoiler, and since the key plot point wasn't obvious to me until shortly before it was exposed (and I had fun figuring out what was going on), I don't want to ruin it for other people.

323,jonnyfendi,No.1 Rule Is Awesome!,9,17 April 2010,"I expect that Tyler Durden will be one of the most memorable characters in cult movies. ""Fight Club"" is directed by David Fincher who always made a gloomy and mysterious effect in each of his movies. His famous works so far are ""Alien³"" (1992), ""Se7en"" (1995) and ""The Game (1997). The most important roles in thiz movie are held by Edward Norton and Brad Pitt. Norton is the main character, who its name is not mentioned until the end of the movie. Pitt is Tyler Durden, the bad boy character. The other Cast members are Helena Bonham Carter and Meatloaf who is known better as a Musician. The plot is arranged well. We could see what actually happens from the beginning until the end from the innocent eyes of the narrator. The movie begins with a slow intro. In the beginning of the story, the main character is told as insomniac. But after a few incidents, he finds himself that he has some hallucination visions, in that time Tyler Durden appears. Afterward, both characters are roller-coasting all over the movie. Ever since, the story is getting excited. One of Durden's quotes is so powerful, ""The number one rule about Fight Club is you do not talk about Fight Club... The number two rule about Fight Club isYou do not talk about Fight Club!"". Thiz character is simply one of the best Pitt's performances since ""Twelve Monkeys"" in 1995. The ending of thiz film could become the best twist ending of the decade. The movie made an amazing description about how people could really change, and even they would not realize it.Visit My Blog on JONNY'S MOVEE: http://jonnyfendi.blogspot.com",Fight Club
324,Blade_Le_Flambeur,Fight Club is defintely one of the best movies ever made,6,19 February 2003,"After hearing that this film was very good I decided to rent it. I was stunned. This movie combines great visuals with an excellent screenplay and is nicely topped with superb acting. The movie has a tendency to get weird, but not too weird. Norton is superb here, he gives great atmosphere with his narration and gives an excellent performance as a confused individual. Helena Bolham Carter is fine here, she acts like a suicidial, crazy person with good percsion. The real star here is Brad Pit whose performance in this movie is only equalled by his performance in 12 Monkeys. He adds such a great presence to Tyler Durden, its amazing. The only problem I had with this film is one Norton learns the ""deal"" with Tyler Durden, the movie loses its impact and becomes more of a hollywood type of movie. Concerning the rating, there are one or two heavy sex scenes, the occasional swearing, but I was surprised by the amount of violence. There isn't really that much, but when there is, it gets bloody. Really bloody. Unfortunately I knew the ending before hand, so not much of a surprise there. Fight Club combines ingenius storytelling to amazing visuals. Quite simply one of the best films ever made. 9.75/10",Fight Club
325,sakram,"Drama at its finest, no minute wasted.",10,30 September 2017,"Fight Club is the movie that rules the Drama, it represents the perfection of a movie, for its story-line, storyboard, acting, concept, and most importantly intensity and entertainment. The movie seemed mediocre at first, but as the movie advances, you realize it is no ordinary movie, and there is something big, well, I strongly recommend this excellence of a movie.10/10 Would watch again",Fight Club
326,Lupercali,"Well, you can tell THIS one was made before 9/11...",9,10 June 2004,"That was my overwhelming feeling on re-watching 'Fight Club' last night. Could you imagine this movie being released after 9/11? And I think that  if I can take that a little further it might speak to the generally unadventerous, uncontroversial, scared to put a foot wrong film making which has been coming out of Hollywood in the past three years. But we don't have room for that here.I watched Fight Club when it was first released and I didn't like it. In fact I disliked it so much that I turned it off 3/4 of the way through. Watching it four years later I can't imagine why I didn't stay riveted to the set. Maybe back in 1999/2000 it had a bit more meaty competition.Yet another film which you really can't talk about in too much detail without spoiling, but let's allow this much: the main character is a yuppie who, through a chance encounter with a charismatic stranger on a plane, discovers the hollowness of his life, and uses physical violence and self-injury as a means of liberating himself from it. Or so it all seems...This is an audacious and confronting movie, artfully put together, with lots of lovely scenes where the whole illusion of film-making is highlighted. Characters suddenly speak to the audience or walk through a scene which morphs into a furniture brochure. And there are more, and more pivotal shocks of this kind to come.  It's funny, smart, unexpected, brutal, and takes no prisoners.  The only thing which lets it down and keeps it from being an almost perfect movie, IMO, is that the ending (an albeit marvelously unexpected ending) just starts to push credibility to its breaking point, even for a film which doesn't take itself entirely seriously.Still, this film is currently averaging a score of 8.5, and I'd say that's about right.",Fight Club
327,fubared1,One of the dumbest movies ever!,1,28 August 2001,"Yes, these days it's hard to single out a movie as exceedingly dumb, when people rave about crap like 'Pulp Fiction' and 'The Matrix', but this must take a special prize.  At least in this case, this qualifies as a 'so bad it's good' exercise, whereas the others were just mindless bores.  Of course, it's largely thanks to the incredibly bad acting of Ed Norton and Brad Pitt, who should form a triumvirate with Keanu Reeves as the most overpaid, talentless bunch of numbnuts ever to grace the screen with their lack of talent.  In fact, the only good performance here is by Meatloaf, which is saying a lot.  If you think the plot is original, it's not.  The same idea was presented in a half hour episode of 'Alfred Hitchcock Presents' over 30 years ago, that was directed by the master himself. Still, even if it was faked, I did greatly enjoy seeing Pitt and Norton beating each other to a bloody pulp.  They both certainly deserve it for their past (and future) 'work'.",Fight Club

Are we sure Ed Wood is dead, because I swear he must have written, cast, and directed this major turkey. If people claim not to understand this film, it's merely because they have an IQ of 3.  I even read one critique by someone who watches this bomb every week!  Talk about not having a life!  There was a half hour episode of Alfred Hitchcock's series that had the same plot and was 100 times better than this.  As to the acting, well I couldn't find anyone doing that here, but then Ed Norton is one of the worst actors alive today (as is Pitt), so you shouldn't be surprised there.  Meatloaf was the only person even trying, but then he was saddled with an incredibly moronic script written by a 2 year old.",Fight Club
329,dirtychild,Ultimate trip,10,14 February 2003,Fight Club tells the story of an insomniac insurance investigator (Ed Norton) who initially attends help/support groups to try to help his insomnia.  Annoyed at the presence of another `faker' (Marla  Helena Bonham Carter) at these groups  he turns to Tyler Durdan (Brad Pitt)  an eccentric soap salesman.  They soon develop underground `fight clubs'  a highly aggressive male `support' group.  Fight Club starts to get out of hand when Tyler gears `Project Mayhem' up a notch.The plot of Fight Club is based on a Chuck Palahnuk novel of the same name (brilliant author  check him out!).  The narrator (Norton) provides classic nihilistic / disinfected / insomniac views of the mundane of life (so many classic lines).The performances are just so good  Brad Pitt is always a winner in these `sorts' of crazy roles (see 12 Monkeys).  Ed Norton plays a terrific `straight' worker type who is enticed by Tyler's ways and `free' lifestyle  but as he works out Tyler's world  Ed Norton is great as the seemingly insane narrator.The soundtrack (by the Dust Brothers) complements the mind-blowing visuals from David Fincher and crew.This is one movie that is a bit of a mind-fudge the first time around  and a bit of a must for repeat viewing!10 out of 10!!!,Fight Club
330,stefankrs,Pure entertainment,10,23 September 2021,"This movie is truly great and one of the most entertaining movies I have seen. First off,it has a great casting with Bradd Pitt playing a perfect part. The two main characters meet and start coming up with an idea of a fight club that came from a fight they had outside a bar. They weekly go to the club and have fights with other members while more and more join and more clubs sprout up. It gets violent, psychological, comical, and the whole time its pure entertainment.

331,ihrtfilms,Fincher's best,10,20 July 2010,"I saw this some 10 years ago when it first came out and I may have seen it in between then and now, but I couldn't remember. Having just watched Seven recently I thought it was time to revisit Fight Club. For it's day Fight Club stood out as a hugely original piece of film making. Utilizing brilliant techniques and special effects, it was quite something to witness. 10 years later, the film still holds it's own. It truly is a great film and stands out among a Hollywood filled with mediocre. Knowing the outcome, that Tyler is not real, makes a second viewing a altogether new experience, as the viewer finds themselves aware of scenes with the key characters in and figuring out how or where it is possible to have the characters and their actions work. The cast is fine in this, I especially liked Helena Bonham Carter in this. The visual elements make for a great film experience as well: The explanation of the explosion in the apartment: the appearance of Ikea furniture: the decrepit house and the airplane ripping apart are many of the stand out moments. There is some graphic violence, but it never seems to get too violent, despite it's nature.There are also some great film making in jokes: love the subliminal images of Tyler and as Tyler describes it 'flashback humour' when at the end the film continues on from it's opening scene.For today's world of 'Avatar' film making Fight Club remains a stand out piece of film making which is at times brutal, at others funny as hell. Combine this with some brilliant techniques and you have a terrific film and probably Fincher's best.More reviews at my site iheartfilms.weebly.com.au",Fight Club
332,chthon2,Overrated and trite.,6,30 July 2003,"I do not understand why people seem to like this film.  To me, it really just looks like a shallow whupass movie made for trendy fruits.  Most of it focuses in illogical sex and violence which really don't seem to have much of a purpose.  I'm glad this didn't sell too well here in the states; it's good to know that most of America isn't like people in Hollywood.  Brad Pitt, as usual, seems to just be reading off his lines and Ed Norton has lost all the flame he had in American History X.  Just a pointless, brainless mess of a movie.

334,heyimmyx,"Immy's review : Beautiful, kinetic spectacle",10,1 January 2021,"Fight club was probably one of the best movies I have ever watched. The energy was intangible throughout, helped by the fiery and fast paced cinematography. Edward Norton and Brad Pitt gave incaptivating performances and helped display an intriguingly complex relationship between their two characters. The plot twist at the end was completely unfathomable and left me completely star struck, changing the entire narrative and meaning behind the movie. Every character was unique and given an interesting context in their part of the story. I loved the gradual increase in intensity of Tyler's ego and criminal behaviour, slowly unveiling the cult of personality around him and how easily his initial ideas manifested. There were so many layers and little details hidden within the movie, making it very intelligent and always one step ahead of the audience. The ending was breathtaking and generated a near perfect cinematic scene between two main characters. Highly recommend.",Fight Club
335,kyle_c,** 1/2 out of ****,7,1 October 2002,"As much as I admired the ambition and uniqueness of ""Fight Club"", I couldn't force myself to like it.  It's dark and gritty atmosphere felt like it was borrowing a little to heavily from ""Taxi Driver"" and films of that like. The plot twist at the end was interesting, as was the story in general. What bothered me was the direction.  There were some brilliantly made scenes, but a lot of them felt a little silly - almost like Fincher was trying too hard to be fast-paced ""MTV generation"" style.  On top of that, some of the dialogue, especially Tyler Durdan's was poorly written - especially in cases where he was meant to throw in little witty remarks. Pitt's performance was weak, especially put up against Ed Norton, who was impressive, as usual.  Thematically, the bottom line is that, when all was said and done, this movie had no idea what it was about, and suffered because of it.  Fincher is a superb talent, but this is not his best showcase - ""Se7en"" was a much better application of his style.",Fight Club
336,raphaklopper,A Testosterone Masterpiece,10,28 May 2013,"The male world just got with this film its ultimate masterpiece, it will even make guys laugh, think, and even cry. Yeah, ""Fight Club"" can do that to any man to watch these unforgettable 2:19 hours of pure excitement! ""Fight Club"" is a testosteronic classic to be remembered, the title just sounds like a fight film, but who thinks that are wrong, the movie goes much deeper than that.The story begins with this guy (Edward Norton), who during the movie never says or mentions his name. He works at a car agency and spends its life in the office. He suffers from insomnia and doesn't know what to make of his life felling an immense and deep hole. Then he begins attending therapy groups to be able to express himself and put everything out and always have company. In one of these groups he meets and ""falls in love"" to the weird smoking Marla Singer (Helena Bonham Carter) who happens to have the same trend he attending several therapy groups. One day, during a business trip he meets Tyler Durden (Brad Pitt). The guy and Tyler have the same thoughts about life and what to do with it, then both start a strong friendship and arrange a new form of therapy, a male therapy which consists in beat the crap out of each other (in other words, fighting). Then they create ""Fight Club"", which attracts many followers to this male therapy where men in the middle of a fight can unleash all his anger and anguish that he carries, it doesn't matter of his going to win or not. But the club is just a much bigger plan that Tyler plans by every passing minute.The film, as the title says is about a Fight Club, but the film not only focuses attention on fighting scenes (which are many). But through this club, Tyler tries to convey his major criticism of society. The film raises a number of criticisms and questions about the society we live in and how dirty it is, these criticisms come to us through the constant black humor and male philosophy leaving us thinking for days.The writing of Jim Uhls (screenplay) is superb, explores our society through dialogs and breathtaking scenes, and the direction of David Fincher makes it all fantastic.""Fight Club"" is the testosteronic masterpiece to be remembered forever, thanks to a fantastic writing and direction and superb performances from both Brad and Edward leaves the film just MAGNIFICENT.",Fight Club

340,Captain Ed,Thought-provoking and inventive (possible spoilers),9,13 January 2001,"It's not often that a major motion picture can be described as above -- and Fight Club is all that and more.  It's a highly stylized look at the difficulty people have in connecting to the world around them.  The Narrator suffers from insomnia, but in reality he's been asleep his entire life, lullabied by consumerism and low expectations.  All that changes when he meets Tyler Durden and a borderline psychotic named Marla.While the violence is graphic, it is not the end-all and be-all of this movie, and to that extent the title does the movie a bit of a disservice. There are a lot of punches thrown and the screen violence is realistic, but there's very little of any other kind of violence until you get to the last twenty minutes or so.  What I find refreshing about it is that the consequences of the violence are shown realistically as well.*** SPOILERS AHEAD -- BE WARNED! ***The film is ultimately nihilistic, anti-materialistic, and anti-social; did anyone else note that the initials for Fight Club (FC) were the same used by Ted Kaczynski as the Unabomber in his manifestos?  Think of the Unabomber's philosophies and you'll get an idea where Durden is going with his plans.I will note that the twist at the end (and since ""The Usual Suspects"", all films have to have an identity twist, don't they?) was telegraphed by the flash appearances of Durden in several early scenes.  This may be more apparent when viewing the DVD, as I did.  I noticed what I thought was a film flaw, backed up, and ran the scene one frame at a time.  This is used in several places in the film, and there's a notable one in the last few seconds, if you're into that kind of thing.  It's also set up well in the movie.An excellent film, somewhat undone by the clumsy handling of the twist, but the performances are first-rate.  A dark, funny, and nihilistic adventure for the brave.  9 out of 10.",Fight Club
341,CurtMan@LVCM.com,"Dark, Twisted, Brilliant!",10,23 October 2004,"***POSSIBLE SPOILERS*** ""Fight Club"" is quite simply the paramount masculine, intelligent thriller that succeeds in heavy suspense, engaging perplexity, and stylish, unconventional sequencing, all in dark, murky, and really hideous territory. Here is a film with a theme unashamed to embrace individuality, defiance, and conquest, which actually entertains destruction, mayhem, and madness, and works brilliantly as a study of the extreme effects of insomnia and isolation upon individuals who seek to combat their demons in coming together in an underground battle of hard-knocking, body-blowing punches to relinquish their frustrations on each other. Sounds sordid and demented enough? This doesn't even scratch the surface of this maniacal genius of an unconventional thriller which is as dark and murky as it is insane and prolific. We are never really introduced to narrator and key player Edward Norton's identity, only that he is constantly comparing himself to a figure named ""Jack"", perhaps an allusion to the common, labored, frustrated man straining to survive the chaos of American society. Along his quest of ""self-discovery"" (as one might put it), he is acquainted with Tyler Durden, a knowledgeable, quick-witted soap salesman practically representing the collectedness, confidence, and admiration Edward Norton so desperately desires in his seemingly pathetic existence (as his ""alter-ego""), who proposes that he and Norton form a society of fellow frustrated men seeking to relinquish their demons in an underground ""Fight Club"" (which later becomes the basis for an international group plotting destruction and mayhem). Another notable shadowy and rather belligerent character (and the only female character in the entire film) is Darla, a confused, seemingly ill broad with a grudge against the world and serious suicidal tendencies, who comes in play as the ""love desire aid"" to Pitt and Norton frequently, and perplexingly, throughout the film. This is a film whose primary purpose is to perhaps address the effects of frustration, aggravation, and disillusion with the world, and the extent of the extreme, as is characterized by man from society. Norton and Pitt team together to make soap, hang out, run an underground ""Fight Club"", create domestic terrorist cells, and eventually become mortal nemeses within themselves. What a thought-provoking, brutally honest, and maniacally subtle masterpiece of film-making this ""Fight Club"" experience is: it's entertaining, suspenseful, inquisitive, and mind-blowingly ingenious, and it's one of the most economic and effective thrillers you'll ever have the privilege to experience. **** out of ****",Fight Club

344,Embley,A dissenting opinion....,3,17 October 1999,"S**t - I had a whole review written and then I accidentally hit escape and erased the whole thing.Basically Fight Club was bad.  Which is really unfortunate because I was looking forward to another great film from David Fincher.I read over some of the other comments made by users here, and I was really surprised that every single one I read was a positive review.  It really makes me wonder about the film-going public...I actually thought the premise itself was quite interesting - lonely guy seeks way to connect with other individuals in the modern world.  Going to the support groups was interesting, forming fight club with ""Tyler Durden"" was interesting.  Somehow though I just wish that guys could vent their frustrations or anger or unhappiness without resorting to violence - though I am starting to see that is an impossibility.  It must be coded into their genes (which is a REALLY good excuse - I love that one...)Now don't misunderstand me - I am not squeamish about violence - some of the fight sequences were well done and I enjoyed them - it is a rare thing that I will turn my eyes away in horror because of violence - there is a perverse fascination with it in my psychological make-up and I am certainly not the only one.  But when I was sitting watching the film (and I honestly wasn't too thrilled about it already because it was just a bit boring) during the scene where Edward Norton beats the blond kid to a shadow of his former self, I became offended.  And not specifically because of the beating.  That was horrifying and I think (hope?) most people would find it horrifying. What offended me was the handful of young men who were whooping and cheering the beating on from the audience.  That was frightening.I don't think it is arguable that this film does glorify violence in a very bad way.  It makes it cool to beat people up and to get beaten up. Other reviews I read argued that it doesn't glorify violence because it makes the drones in Durden's terrorist army look stupid or something.  Well yes they do look stupid - I don't think that people go out looking to be a stupid ""drone"" but they do look for leadership (ie Nazi Germany).  Furthermore it seems to me that more people would be interested in being Tyler Durden. That is how it glorifies violence with respect to terrorist organizations - it wouldn't necessarily make you want to follow in one, it makes it look cool to lead one.  I would like to think that people are not stupid enough to fall for that kind of thing, but I know I am wrong and I think Fincher gives the general public to much credit for intelligence and being able to think on their own.Moving on - I hated the ""twist"" [details deleted].  How lame, what a predictable cop out.  And I thought it was poorly done - implausible if you look back at the rest of the film.  That really put the nails in the coffin of this film.I actually thought Brad Pitt, Edward Norton and Helena Bonham-Carter were pretty good.  I wonder how different the original screenplay looked from the finished product.One other thing - I read a review from an LA critic that stated that the worst thing about this film is that it THINKS it conveys a message.  Close - I think it TRIES to convey a message but whatever that message was, it is not effectively conveyed.  Sure it says consumerism ans capitalism are bad, it then goes on to say fight the system with whatever (violent) means necessary...  And does not really contradict that message ever.  Is this the message Fincher intended?  I do not think that Norton's character running around trying to make things right at the end (when it was clear that that was impossible) turns around the core message of the film...  What a disaster.",Fight Club
345,Keyser Soze-12,A Misunderstood Classic,9,8 August 2000,"I think Fight Club is the most misunderstood movie of all time.  Many people think it teaches anarchy.  While, I admit the movie is violent, it is realistic.  That is what fights look like.  In movies, fights seem like easy, bloodless things where punches make loud noises which in real life don't happen.  On the anarchy thing, this movie reminds me of George Orwell's 1984.  The movie is not, repeat, is NOT to be taken literally.  The theme of the movie is not to do any of the things done in the movie.  It teaches not to be a follower, or in Tyler's terms, a space monkey.  Also, the movie, as far as the twist ending, is highly possible. It does take some understanding of human psychology, but just think of Psycho if you can't figure it out. While the critics hated this movie, I'm sure this will make a comeback and those same critics will add it to their top 10 lists.",Fight Club
346,The-Social-Introvert,Quickie Review: Fight Club,8,21 January 2016,"Fight Club is like Shrek. And Shrek is like onions. And onions have layers. Therefore; Fight Club has layers. Many of them. Because of this I do feel it's a movie that needs repeat viewing in order to appreciate it more. Fight Club makes interesting and very relatable statements against the current consumer-driven materialistic society (which has only gotten worse since the film's release.) Very stylish and sophisticated, the film features some hilarious and inventive ways of breaking the fourth wall and hitting you with subliminal messages. The famous twist ending remains one of the wackiest in recent memory and performances across the part are perfect. It's one of those movies where you notice something new about it each time you see it, whether it be a split second shot of a dong or a single line of dialogue that makes you ponder on the emptiness of your existence. The cinematography is outstanding and really adds to the nihilistic tone of the movie. Overall, the film is about a great many things: manliness, materialism, generation X and Y's place in the world, life's little ironies, the oddity of western civilisation and, of course, fighting. But we can't talk about that.Best Scene: Hmmm, picking one is difficult because I felt that the film flowed in such a way that it didn't feel like a movie where one scene follows another and instead worked as a whole. I'll pick the part where Edward Norton beats the crap out of himself and blames his boss.",Fight Club
347,smashattack,Nice twist.,2,19 December 2001,"Major spoilers. This movie will only get a two on my scale of one-to-ten because of the twist in the ending, and even the twist isn't all that great. People say this movie is great. Insightful. Exhilarating. I say it's complete trash and almost a waste of time. The characters aren't bad, except for that really ugly lady (change your hair and clean yourself up). She plays some psycho nymphomaniac who falls for Tyler Durden's (Brad Pitt) body. Eventually those two get together and have constant sex, which gets really old because the house is shaking all the time and the narrator explains how annoying it is. Soon the story gets boring and we find that the Fight Club is really a group of losers who are deviant maniacs bent on disrupting society. Let's face it, the only reason anyone should ever watch this movie all the way through is to find out that Tyler Durden is actually the narrator, and the narrator is Tyler Durden. Tyler Durden doesn't even exist. That twist really fell below the status of ""bad"". This movie really falls below the status of ""annoying, stupid, boring, disgusting, monotonous, and ridiculous"".

348,smashattack,SLEEPER.,2,17 August 2002,"I am back for my second review of Fight Club. Why, you ask? Because I  was told I had an ""inadequate"" amount of evidence to prove my point! So  here I go.  Fight Club is a very strange, erratic movie that, quite honestly,  nearly put me to sleep within the first ten minutes. It seemed that the  whole movie revolved around an insomniac! And that's true--this movie  is about nothing but a guy who can't sleep. For over half of it seems  to be the very first movie that has no plot, no decent characters (what  kind of main character is known only as ""The Narrator""?), and a crummy  soundtrack. I was SO disappointed.  ""Plot Outline: A man disillusioned by what his life has become  encounters an exciting stranger who introduces him to a new way of  life.""  Well, yeah, that's all fine and dandy, but this new way of life doesn't  come in until WAY later. And once Fight Club is finally introduced, it  is hardly shown. Then it turns into a macho group of terrorists... I'm  sorry, but how utterly boring! From the commercials and video cover, I  was expecting there to be a plot that revolved around the Fight Club.  Instead, I was slapped in the face with this stupid terrorist group  that doesn't serve a purpose.  I now have to go to Helena Bonham Carter. Hey, lady, you did excellent  in Planet of the Apes!

I know that is probably the greatest compliment a movie can receive, but it is absolutely true. I first saw the movie about 3 weeks ago, and I thought it was awesome, but nothing spectacular. Then, as time went on, I found myself thinking about it more and more...and now, today, I realize is just a masterpiece. There is something about the flow of the story, the amazing editing and cinematography, the shocking twist, and the deep message that makes you realize this movie is so well done and so entertaining that it really is just one of those amazing movies.I don't mean to sound harsh with my review but Fight Club is just moving.

The plot is unbelievably dumb, there are a few plot holes and the story fails to make sense at some points.

353,Internet-Police,My review of Fight club as a non-medical professional,8,20 June 2016,"I am not a doctor nor do I play one on TV, I do however play it at home with my wife. In my years of practice I have noticed a trend in movies and on television making a joke out of mental illness. In my non- expert yet vocal opinion, Schizophrenia can be a very serious, if not properly treated, disease. If combined with other disorders, such as Psychosis and Intermittent Explosive Disorder it could be used to provide quality entertainment and comedy to the masses. The movie starts out with our main protagonist, trying to convince his new ""friend"" to engage in a Narcissistic playtime setting. It starts going well as they engage in friendly beatings and torture. They recruit homeless people with the same mindset and start gambling out the outcomes. The more beatings our hero gets the worse his psychosis becomes and snowballs into a trip to a mental hospital, where he lives out the rest of his days...locked forever in a room with an overgrown native American and bars of human soap.I recommend a viewing with an open mind, and a few beers.",Fight Club

355,AgustinCesaratti,The first rule of Fight Club is you do not talk about Fight Club.,9,7 October 2019,"Fight Club follows the story of the Narrator (Edward Norton) whose name is never mentioned, he is an employee of a car company who suffers from insomnia. The narrator attends a support group of testicular cancer victims and, after convincing them that he too is suffering from the disease, finds an emotional release that cures his insomnia. He becomes addicted to therapy groups and to the farce of posing as a victim, but the presence of another impostor - Marla Singer (Helena Bonham Carter) - bothers him, so he negotiates with her to avoid meeting at the same meetings.After a flight home on a business trip, he finds his apartment destroyed by an explosion. She calls Tyler Durden (Brad Pitt), a soap salesman she had met on a plane, and they meet in a bar. A conversation about consumerism prompts Tyler to invite the narrator to stay at home. Tyler accepts on the condition that he is beaten. They both engage in a punching fight outside the bar, for the narrator to later move into Tyler's emaciated home. They continue to have more fights outside the bar, which attracts a couple of curious people. The fights pass into the basement of the bar, where a fighting club is formed governed by a set of rules.Fight Club is a black comedy and psychological film that manages to open your eyes to a reality that many ignore after paying attention to the material instead of living their lives. The satire about consumerism goes hand in hand with a dark comedy, touches of drama and suspense about who Tyler Durden is and to what end he does what he has to do. This almost unique piece shows us the wild and anarchist life of a group of ""knights"" who don't want to die without scars. It is not an example to follow, nor is it to initiate chaos or to be masters of disorder... Just don't forget The First Rule.",Fight Club

357,nixskits,Where's my Furni catalogue?,10,17 December 2009,"It amuses me when some person goes on a talk show and tells people not to see a film! The reaction to ""Fight Club"" and others by certain mouthy types (who might have even seen it!) was really a dumb approach to avoiding attention directed at what they perceive as dangerous. Michael Medved was a bit less silly in his various objections over the years than others (Kathie Lee Gifford for instance), as a critic having watched Oliver Stone's ""JFK"", which he called ""an evil film"" and ""Natural Born Killers"" (he described it as a lot of things, among them, ""never boring"", in his pan review).So here we are, ten years after this David Fincher directed adaptation of Chuck Palahniuk's novel (Jim Uhls wrote the screenplay). Blu-ray is the new standard for watching discs at home and ""FC"" has just come out in this format (with an adorably annoying ""Never Been Kissed"" initial menu pop up showing everyone's favourite friend of Edward Norton, Drew Barrymore!). I'll buy it eventually. For now, the old two disc special edition will hold up just fine with it's four commentary tracks (including one with Palahniuk and Uhls). The world is much more screwed up than a decade ago and almost all of that is definitely not the fault of ""FC"" or any other work which doesn't pretend joining hands and singing ""Kumbaya"" will make our species love itself and end our crises.""FC"" is like a street and book wise reaction to infomercials that promise some help for the unhappy and broken in society. Any mature adult has reached the conclusion that the bad things in life make up at least half of what even the best adjusted of us must cope with. ""Jack"", the ultimate unreliable narrator, is burnt out. His life degenerates into travelling as a paid stooge for a big company, weighing whether paying people for what money can't make up in losses works for his bosses. He doesn't just hit rock bottom, he orders Furni (read, IKEA!) products from there! How much can a person have left of their soul when they are drawn to 12 step meetings for conditions nobody in their right mind wants to cope with?So when the tag team from new friend hell emerge, ""Marla"" and ""Tyler"", ""Jack"" is drawn to both of their live for today spirits. He's such a function of the clock, going out into the world without a watch and an itinerary is his ultimate rebellion. The question is, how long can the narrator keep up with the dastardly duo who shock and invigorate him?There's a wonderful collection of essays on the film, some long and complex, others short and to the point. Not many movies can warrant a book about what started as a book. ""Fight Club"" remains as a phoenix rising out of show biz's late 90s ashes.

360,Det_McNulty,A Social-Commentary For The New Era,9,30 September 2007,"Addressing the ploys of consumerism and materialism, Fight Club created a distinct manifesto of liberation during the last few months of the '90s. Its impact is yet to of worn off and with each passing year the imperative social-commentary becomes more popular. At its time of release, Fight Club was widely misunderstood, due to the ""graphic"" depiction of nihilism which is expressed through the film and was hailed by some as misogynistic. Although it did not receive much attention around the time of release, the rise in DVD sales helped to propel popularity and eventually resulted in Fight Club becoming a cult picture.In 1996, Chuck Palahniuk wrote Fight Club, a novel which held the inevitability of an adaptation. It was only three years later before Fight Club was released as a motion-picture. Twentieth Century Fox acknowledged that the film was going to hold a mass appeal and garner a much deserved following of fans who could relate to the picture's satirical take on the woes of modern life. Emerging talent David Fincher was chosen to direct the adaptation (though remaining hesitant because of his experience with Fox on Alien³), while Jim Uhls wrote the screenplay. Edward Norton was chosen to star as the film's protagonist and Brad Pitt (who Fincher had previously worked with on Se7en) was cast in the key supporting role. It was from here that David Fincher gave birth to his undisputed masterpiece.Telling the tale of a nameless, thirty-something office-worker (often referred to as The Narrator and performed by Edward Norton) who has lost all motivation and self-respect, the picture chronicles his journey through enlightenment. Starting off as a spectator and consumerist, The Narrator's venture begins with his sudden addiction to anonymous self-help groups. It is from the testicular cancer and alcoholics anonymous groups that he gains pity, and because of being an unexposed faker can wallow in the sympathy he has craved for. On a business trip, The Narrator encounters Tyler Durden, a soap-salesman who he chooses to befriend. The two friends soon assemble a fight club, where men endure bare-knuckled, underground fighting. Essentially, the group (which becomes a guerrilla organisation) is a metaphor for ""feeling alive"" and allows men to feel the utmost level of masculinity.Fight Club does not promote violence, deprivation, anarchy, communism or even mischief; it merely works as a representation for turning a mundane, forlorn lifestyle into a way of venting out primitive frustration. The numbed office drones depicted in the film realise that their lives are meaningless and are prepared to go through pain to receive clarification that they still exist both mentally and physically. Fighting is an embodiment of man's most archaic and rebellious instincts. Man's aspiration for chaos is symbolised through Project Mayhem, (the mischief group, built upon members of the fight club) and the disdain aimed towards materialism is etched inside the personality traits of Tyler Durden. Laden with justifiable transgression, the film portrays its hatred of consumerism through subtle character interactions, repressed emotion and glaring visuals (e.g. Ikea, Starbucks, Soap), which are often an amusing arguably contradictory- disparity of beliefs. There are a number of themes below the surface of the picture (such as homosexuality) which should be taken into consideration when in search of understanding.Filmed in damp, dirty lighting and mixed with ""ultra-cool"" editing, viewers will find it difficult to resist the overwhelming generosity of aesthetically pleasing film-making. The satirical temperament of the picture is empathised by the characteristics of the film's subtext. Fight Club is thoughtful, exhilarating and amusing, so the absurd visual stance is best suited for a film of its genre. Characters will often break the ""fourth wall"", letting viewers relate to the ideas more freely. Welcomingly peculiar visuals are an extra ingredient for keeping the viewer instantly immersed. Since the film contains such robust characters, it is hard to deny the charm of the narrative style. When you have each performer delivering witty, anti-conformist sentences then it is impossible to become detracted or disconcerted. In fact, the three main protagonists are some of the finest ever written. Edward Norton, Brad Pitt and Helena Bonham Carter provide what are three of my favourite performances from the '90s, which should be rank among the most exciting and versatile.Sadly, it is within the second act that the picture misdirects its testosterone. Of course, none of the entertainment value is lost. Instead, the nature of the film suddenly becomes a plunge into non-stop anti-capitalism, which in my opinion becomes overused to a slight extent. Fortunately, this does not linger and the narrative turns back to being the journey of self-discovery it started out as. Nothing can stop Fight Club from being a film I love to watch. Its vigorously entertaining ambiance provokes exhilaration and reflection that few films can match. The notions and philosophies of such a statement may be too testing for a number of viewers to grasp; nevertheless, the stinging candour and acrimony should not be ignored.",Fight Club

Some might say it's a black-comedy, others might call it a social drama, others, a social comedy.  I'm not sure which of those adjectives describe the movie best but the adjective ""One of the 5 best movies of the year"" sure qualifies.  Another one would be ""One of Norton's best performance's ever"". In fact, it's probably his best after the one he gave in ""American history X"".  And yet another way to qualify it would be ""By far David Fincher's best movie yet"".  Yes, ""Fight club"" is an excellent movie and true entertainment. Plus, there are great performances by Edward Norton, Brad Pitt, Helena Bonham Carter and Meat Loaf and great direction by David Fincher.The story is narrated by Edward Norton whose name seems to be Jack although he is never called like that by anyone leaving us in doubt.  He explains how he thought his life was a total bore and how he joined certain groups like groups for people with testicular cancer just to make friends. This is where he meets Bob (Meat Loaf) and befriends him.  However, at some point, he sees a woman named Marla Singer (Helena Bonham Carter) in all those groups and guesses she has none of the problems the people attending the reunions have.  However, Jack doesn't either.  So they make a deal so that they do not meet again:  every week, they go to she goes to certain groups while he goes to other groups so they won't see each other.Weeks go by without anything really happening and one day, on a plane, Jack meets a man who calls himself Tyler Durden (Brad Pitt).  Tyler sells soap for a living.  After the plane lands, the two men each go their own way but when Jack gets home, he sees that his apartment has been blown-up and decides to call Tyler to ask him if he might have a free bed at his house. They decide to go to a bar and after three pitchers of beer, they are approaching the bar's closing time and go outside.  This is when, out of the blue, Tyler asks Jack to hit him.  The two men finally end up fighting for real and seem to get some kicks out of it and after a while, they decide to form a fight club whose two principal rules are ""You do not talk about Fight club"".The movie starts off right in the action and never lets the viewer down. Jim Ulhs's screenplay is excellent.  David Fincher also uses a few slow motions to add a certain intensity to the scene.  The music by the Dust brothers is excellent and the other songs used are excellent as well. However, as good as everything about this movie is, nothing beats Edward Norton's performance.  He is simply incredible.  Over here in Canada, the movie got the harshest rating which is ""18 and over"" and did deserve because although there isn't only violence in this movie, it is very graphic and depicted as it is just when it happens to a person.  Also, the violence shown is especially during the fights and no one dies in these fights. It isn't for the faint-hearted and has a disappointing ending but if you can get to gather all the courage you have to watch this one, you'll see you'll be glad you saw it.",Fight Club

371,andrewmerritt-31652,If you think this is about fighting you fail to understand its message,10,25 November 2019,"Fight Club stars Edward Norton, Brad Pitt, and Helena Bonham Carter, and is directed by David Fincher. The plot revolves around an unnamed narrator, who is bored with his job, until he befriends Tyler Durden, a care free person, and together they start a fight club. Fight Club was one of those movies where I watched it, and I felt inspired. Not inspired to start a fight club, but the overall message was what really spoke to me. Fight Club teaches the audience that we are scared of our lives, which is why we work those boring nine-five jobs because we do what society tells us to do. And that's why we buy stuff we don't need so we can also fit into society as well having the media hypnotizing us that one day we'll be happy with that one special person, but that's a lie. And if people refuse to accept that, well then you just haven't discovered the big picture. And no one explains that well than Tyler Durden. Tyler Durden is the person that everyone wants to be him and act like him and he's my inspiration to me because he has a care free attitude toward life and I admire that. When Fight Club was released, it got terrible reviews, but later on it has become a cult movie. And i think the reason it has such a strong cult following, was because when it first was released, nobody understood it, but they instead they thought it was just about fighting. But there's more to it than fighting and that's where people fail to understand this film. And every time I watch Fight Club, the more i understand what it was trying to tell us. So in the end, Fight Club is a punk rock version of A Clockwork Orange, has a very strong message, and something you shouldn't ignore just because it has to do with fighting. And remember the first rule of Fight Club is, you do not talk about Fight Club.",Fight Club
372,A-Ron-2,Really impressive film...,9,11 June 2000,"I feel that this particular movie will become one of the defining moments in early part of the 21st century, once academia really begins to see the problems that have been unleashed by post-modernism and identity politics. Yes, I have heard the film described as fascist, yes I can see some Ayn Randian undertones, but I think most of that really misses the ultimate point that the film is trying to make.  America presents a certain image of what it feels a man should be, but sabotages and undermines our ability to achieve that at every step in our socialization process.  This film points out possible reasons for this... ""we are a generation of men raised by women.""Now this is not a misogynistic comment (as I have seen many attempt to infer), but instead an indictment of the masculine culture in America. Masculine virtue has been undermined consistently by the mercantile nature of the modern state and has not been replaced with anything beyond Gordon Gecko-esque promotion of greed (which is why I find the end of the film to be the most important part, even if it may be a bit simplistic and short-sighted).  When the only 'virtue' provided to men is that of acquisitiveness (which was never a virtue before the rise of the modern state in Europe), then we cannot be surprised by the selfishness with which men act in our society.  When men abandon their children, or neglect their families, they are acting completely within the modern, capitalist paradigm. This is why we cannot talk about these problems intelligently in a public arena.I find it humorous that this film (or the Matrix for that matter) will be pointed to the next time some kid blows away his school or kills himself, because Fight Club is one of the only examples of popular media that actually attempts to deal with the real issues behind these problems. America has killed God and morality, we have gone beyond such limiting concepts as good and evil, and now we are paying a price for it.  However, too many people profit from this viscious cycle for there to ever be a significant change, therefore the film presents us with an fantastic alternative (watch the movie).The nuetering of the American male is a process that goes on every day, it is perpetuated in the media and the schools.  Masculine virtue may be dead, and perhaps that is ultimately what Fight Club was trying to tell us.  Or perhaps there are still ways to reconnect with something more primal in our gender, perhaps there are ways for us to look deeper into what it means to be a man.  This film was one of them, I hope that it is a sign of a shift in the media toward intelligent films about the idea of the masculine rather than simple action/morality plays.Fight Club is a complex film that has managed to capture and illuminate a moment in time in America.  I hope that it is something that men can see and reflect on.  I hope that this film inspires men to think about what it means to be a man and why being a man is not something to be ashamed of.",Fight Club
373,matlefebvre20,I am Jack's entire satisfaction,9,17 May 2006,"Each time that somebody has just watched ""Fight Club"", this person must have something to say on it. It could be something good, something bad or simply something anecdotal.In my case, it's something anecdotal. I was watching the film live on television. That means commercials which include big sales, promotions on varied products and reality TV shows where we are supposed to watch poor fools kissing each other or accomplishing their dreams. This is called wasting our own lives watching somebody else living his/her own.If you think that what I've just said is a little bit hard, then you're right. It's just that ""Fight Club"" strikes so hard when you see it that it automatically leaves its mark on you and never let you go. After seeing it, our visions totally change, our beliefs are seriously challenged and the name of Tyler Durden cannot be forgotten anymore.Directed by David Fincher and starring Edward Norton, Brad Pitt and Helena Bonham Carter, ""Fight Club"" is a masterpiece that succeeds on almost every level evaluated by the film industry. Its greatest success is undoubtedly its capacity to disturb us and provoke thoughts. A half-anarchist, half-communist propaganda work, the movie is also fairly funny and transforms strange situations into banal situations and shocking acts into suddenly full-of-sense situations.Norton plays the Narrator, an insomniac bureaucrat who works as an outside consultant for an automobile company (""a major one"" does he assert). His real name remains unknown, even if many film buffs incorrectly refer him as Jack. In fact, it's one of the movie's many goals. The only thing that is important about him is precisely nothing. Beginning by his very identity...Back to the story, the Narrator meets Tyler Durden (Pitt). Tyler is a misfit who sells soap and lives in a house that is so rotten that it could chase the ghosts who'd like to squat it. Tyler is the messenger of the ideas carried out during the film and his philosophies turn around chaos, violence and misfortune.Together, they start the Fight Club, strictly reserved to men, whose goal is to give to its members the occasion to make roar their bestial instincts without any fear. But when the number of members begins to grow up, the Fight Club progressively changes its status until it becomes something that is really dangerous.Carter plays Marla Singer who acts as the finger between the tree and the bark. She is a misfit too, but she lives her own ordinary existence.The three main actors are quite superb. Norton is over-the-top, while Pitt is incredible and might find friends among those who hate his playboy image. Carter is convincing and adequately dreadful. Another highlight is rock singer Meat Loaf who plays a cancer patient with ""bitch tits"".The biggest irony about ""Fight Club"" is the fact that it cost $63 million to produce when its lead wire indicates that one single cent is a cent too much. According to Tyler, man has evolved terribly wrong and his actual lifestyle might have deprived him from the most essential characteristics that make him a man. He privileges a return to the caveman status.Obviously, I don't need to mention that it's our insatiable need to consume that is attacked. You can do whatever you want with that philosophy. You can attack it, which is, for many viewers, very easy and very tempting. You can criticize it for being macho, too violent to deliver the ideas it wants to share and uselessly filled with sexual scenes.However, those three elements have all something to do with our natural instincts. Our instincts, that's what the movie wants to bring out. It's disturbing, it's shocking, but it's wanted this way.But to balance those intense moments, ""Fight Club"" also includes funny and grotesque scenes. There's something I've remarked about the Narrator and Tyler: they seem to be the only ones to know that their story isn't real and that they are in a movie. It happens that they break the fourth wall and talk directly to the viewer and we can even see Tyler make appear a ""cigarette burn"" in the top right corner of the screen.Besides, many people often forget it, but the film's cinematography and special effects are exceptional. Overflowed with more-or-less obvious subliminal images, domestic rooms transforming into life-sized 3D IKEA labels and elaborate, even darkly comic explosion sequences, ""Fight Club"" becomes a feast for the eyes, as much as it is for the mind.There's no doubt that the movie is a novel adaptation (from Chuck Palahniuk, to be more precise). The constant, almost overabundant narration from Norton's character is a good indicator, as are the impressing quantity of quotes and lines that have become early classics, such as ""The first rule of the Fight Club is: you do not talk about Fight Club."" It would also be a sin to forget the titanic plot twist of the end that astounds as much, if not more than the one from ""Se7en"", also directed by Fincher. The twist renders full of sense some previously unintelligible sentences and allows to contemplate previous situations from a different eye.""Fight Club"" is so overheated that it becomes burning by moments (I think about the car accident episode). But nobody complains about it, if they ever notice it. Because the only thing that is essential to know is that ""Fight Club"" is a philosophical must on the same level than ""The Matrix"" and its true place is in philosophy classrooms. The problem is that few people could bear watching such hallucinating pictures.Too bad... These are superb pictures...",Fight Club
374,tjsdshpnd,Truly Kick-Ass,9,2 June 2009,"This movie can get the two extreme responses. It could be liked tremendously by the viewer and considered as a masterpiece or completely opposite, it could be trashed by the viewer calling it a complete waste of time. Yes, that is Fight Club for you. I am the one who considers it a masterpiece. Fight Club is a violent, in the face, kick ass, gory bloodshed. But if you think that is it, then you are underestimating the greatness of this movie . This movie talks about the protagonist played by Edward Norton who for some unassumable reason has no screen name. He is a mentally disturbed insomniac who attends support groups made for people dying so that he can sleep peacefully. After this support group idea fails due to a girl called Marla who is also faking being on the verge of death, he meets a guy called Tyler Durden played by Brad Pitt who jointly start the Fight Club which has certain rules and which undertakes certain dangerous projects all over the span of America . I don't want to disclose the end, because it has to be witnessed rather than readOverall, Fight Club contains a lot of bloodshed, broken bones, teeth, swollen eyes etc. It is one of the most violent movies I have seen and some scenes you cannot watch instantly. Brad Pitt steals the show in terms of capturing the viewers attention. But the actor who impresses the most is Edward Norton who narrates the entire movie and plays a mentally sick person excellently. The scene in which he beats himself up is superb. Watch this movie at your own riskRating : 8.5/10",Fight Club
375,Deckard-16,A very unique and caustic take on Yuppie burnout.,8,17 October 1999,"This was one of top 10 most anticipated movies of 1999 and it didn't let me down. Director David Fincher is at the top of his game for the third in a row with this violent satire  of modern life. The movie is based on a first novel by Chuck Palahniuk. I read his 2nd novel, Survivor, and based on that reading I heard a lot of the author's voice in Fight Club. Palahniuk has a really unique nihlistic world view. Imagine if Alex from Clockwork Orange became a writer then you'd have this guy. Fight Club benefits greatly from Jim Uhls adapted screenplay. It doesn't have gallows humor, it gallows hilarity. David Fincher pulls back from the overt stylism that set Seven and The Game so far apart from other movies to service a story and script that matches him. The movie has style to burn, but it is never immolated by it. Edward Norton is flat out excellent in the lead as the guy who finds salvation in pain. His escape from enervation and ennui is exhilarating and frightening in a funny sort of way. His doppelganger is played by Brad Pitt who really relishes these kind of dark roles and excels in them. Finally there is Helena Bonham Carter who is the tart from Hell and sizzles like frying bacon. This is very strong stuff and I won't blame anybody for hating it. It does drag somewhat in the 2nd half. If you are in the mood for straight shots of tequila and want a movie to match you can't go wrong with this movie.",Fight Club
376,Figgiedan,My review? Wait for the video....,7,21 October 1999,"David Fincher's least entertaining film to date: about on par with alien3, with alien3 being the movie I'll see again before this garbage. A very angry movie and very hostile.. a few people I know said that if you love Fincher you'll love this movie -- not the case. Pitt and Norton are good.. but at the point where Tyler builds ""operation mayhem"" it gets ridiculous. The ""trick"" third act that redefines the whole movie didn't bother me at all, but at that point it couldn't save itself. A 7 out of 10 -- a 70, C-, less than average. Wish they trimmed the movie as much as they showed liposuctioned fat trickling off the barbwire. Ick.",Fight Club
377,Pedro-37,Excellent on every level.,10,23 October 2002,"I guess enough has been said in previous comments about the brilliance of David Fincher's ""Fight Club"". I don't want to give yet another insight into the movie, but rather my personal feelings.I think it's the best movie of 1999 and one of the best of the decade. Even more so, it's the most watchable. I might consider ""Star Wars"" a better film. Or ""Schindler's List"" - but I never like watching them the way I like watching ""Fight Club"". If I wouldn't be such a movie fan and feel the urge to see at least 10 new movies a week, I'd watch ""Fight Club"" every day. It belongs to a group of movies that never stop to amaze me and that I can watch again and again and again. Other movies in that list would be ""Starship Troopers"", ""The Empire Strikes Back"", ""First Contact"", ""South Park"", ""Aliens"". There's more, but I should get back to ""Fight Club"".What probably makes the movie so watchable for me is that I connect with it and perfectly well know that there are a lot that don't. I have the satisfying feeling of getting along with Fincher on his ride. That he made this movie just for me. I can admire the performances, I can inhale the incredible style, I can laugh out loud about the satire and the satire behind the satire, I can melt at the sight of Brad Pitt's abs or I can be amazed at how incredibly daring the film is. That all I can - and that all I don't while watching it. Because I'm way too engaged. I'm much more involved than with other movies. Involved in the overall excitement, not any particular component. In the perfection of the movie. And after it's over, I feel satisfied. Well, yes, that does sound a lot like sex - but I don't want to explore *that* discussion any further ...Has it any flaws? Every movie has. I think it drags a little bit in the second half. So what. I don't care. I don't want to care. Because I love that movie so much, I forget about the flaws. I feel good that there still are movies being made that I can put my emotions into. That I can love. Yes, I said it before, one can love a movie. The ability to do so separates the film goer from the film fan. Or addict. ""Fight Club"" is why I love movies (I stole that line from Ebert's ""Fargo""-review but it really applies here). And not related to everything I've written before: I'd love to have a fight with Brad. Just a thought. ""You have a kind of sick desperation in your laugh."" Just a line I like to insert here. Ok, the review starts falling apart, it's time to end it ... Rating? Well, I guess you already know...10/10",Fight Club
378,tenthousandtattoos,open to misinterpretation,8,27 March 2007,"there's over 2000 comments about this movie so this stuff has probably been said b4, but what the heck firstly, to clarify: the final gunshot - if u watch the commentary and/or freeze-frame over this bit, you will see that the bullet supposedly ""bounced"" off his jawbone and back out of his mouth, thats why he survived it...now, dunno if this happened in the US but over here there was a rash of morons who started their own ""fight clubs"" after seeing this movie as an excuse to beat on each other or hapless stragglers...i must comment about this - if anyone who did that is reading this, you're a FOOL and you completely missed the point of the film. its a little bit understandable though when u consider the average IQ of these jokers matches their shoe size...anyway, great movie by the way!",Fight Club
379,beregic,one of the best ever,10,26 April 2008,"i think this is one the greatest movie ever made, a great insight into the male psychology. therefore if a wife or girlfriend feel uneasy about her understandings of her boyfriend/husband, this feature might very well help with exactly that, and i am not referring to ""special"" cases that are called as such simply because those are not ""general"" ones. on second plan, this has great take as well , on the social-political landscape present, especially in the ""western society"" that is very rarely debated in a very realistic, yet well stylized and with a ""cool"" artistically make-up form, and for everyones comprehension at various perception levels. this feature will probably affect your unconsciousness more then anything else, will make you have emotions coming from deep down inside and not ""formalistic"" or suggested ones. a very important fact to mentions as well is that this production has been made prior to September 11, 2001 events and when re-watching ( for those like myself that have seen it ""before"" and ""after"") one could see certain aspects that makes the plot even stronger then it was originally designed to be. or who knows, maybe the conspiracy theories do have at least a logical base. also, for those not interested much in the above statements, this movie delivers a great suspense story, the least to say. from my observation this feature has been well talked about, at least from this last mentioned aspect, and probably not many reading this are unfamiliar with the story line.in a nutshell, if you have liked ""the usual suspects"" you will love this one. and if you have already loved it, then you will likely watch it yet again for extra details or mood definer.WARNING: If you are reading this then this warning is for you.

381,WilsonLau,Family Viewing at its best,10,30 October 1999,"Edward Norton has outdone himself again! I have yet to see Norton play a poor role. Fight Club is a electrifying movie with a great storyline full of twists and turns. Brad Pitt also gives an outstanding performance. If these two guys don't get awards for these types of performances then theres gotta be something wrong. I mean it has all three of the most important components to a great movie(sex, violence, great characters).",Fight Club
382,ethlaid,Sorry but have to break Rule number 1,10,5 April 2021,Fight Club is so different yet astonishing. So much symbolism and tension built up by fantastic performances from both Norton and Pitt. Personally I believe this is Fincher's best.,Fight Club
383,rowanmaillot,The best movie I have ever seen - Fight Club,10,2 August 2020,"It is 2/08/2020 and I can officially say I have seen the greatest and most unique movie ever made! Three of the greatest performances of all time in the greatest movie of all time, pretty great if you ask me. Brad Pitt, he delivers one of the coolest, if not, the coolest performance(s) in cinematic history! The film also blends black comedy with insomnia, violence, relationships and a two sided person. If you have not seen Fight Club, I am going to get into spoilers... wait, you haven't seen Fight Club... EXCUSE ME?Fight Club is about a fight club, obviously. It's a club that Edward Norton and Brad Pitt start, it's a club where men beat the absolute crap out of each other to get emotional fulfilment out of it. This movie has some of the greatest narration in cinema history and I mean it! Edward Norton literally made me feel like his exact character, to be honest after watching his character I feel like I might get insomnia. This movie is funny and I mean it, I laughed in scenes I probably shouldn't have.We start off with the movie knowing that Norton's character has a fetish for IKEA (I say Norton's character because his name is never really clear), he literally has everything from IKEA, their fridges, their dishwashers, everything. Which is pretty sad, considering that Norton's alter ego, Tyler Durden ends up blowing up Norton's apartment room. He meets Tyler in an aeroplane and they talk about how they have the same interests (because in a twist we end up finding out that Norton's character was Tyler all along).He calls Tyler and he doesn't respond, so Tyler ends up calling back and Norton asks if he can go to Tyler's place because his apartment exploded. We get the iconic twist towards the end when we find out that Norton was actually Tyler all along, he started the club by himself, he has been punching himself in the face, throwing himself around, burning his hand and I loved the twist, I am definitely going to have to read the book now.We find out Tyler (Norton's character) has made a stupid decision to set bombs to go off in multiple buildings, we get the iconic scene at the end when Norton holds Helena Bonham Carter's hand and the watch as the buildings (with no people inside of them) explode! I have barely talked about Tyler (The Narrator) and Marla Singer's relationship, we see it as if Brad Pitt is making out with her, only to find out that it was The Narrator all along. There are hilarious scenes, for instance, when Tyler and The Narrator go out and get human fat that they get for tests, to make soap.Fight Club is my favourite film of the 90's and it is my favourite movie ever made and of course Fight Club gets an A+",Fight Club
384,Zycho-3,Brilliant,10,21 July 2000,"From the director of the 1995 masterpiece 'Se7en' comes a new thriller from acclaimed director David Fincher. His direction is great in both films, but this one stands out as one of the best films of 1999. Edward Norton and Brad Pitt are plain awesome, their performances are brilliant. While Pitt and Norton impress, the screenwriter Jim Uhlus, also shows a lot of confidence in script-writing.In all areas, Fight Club excels beyond belief, and I highly recommend it.Rating: 10",Fight Club
385,jonathandoe_se7en,Groundbreaking Modern-day Fantasy,9,18 May 2001,"Fight Club has got to be one of the best films ever made, it completely demonstrates what happens when consumer technology and pop-culture society takes over our natural order.David Fincher is a genius, he's made one of the most memorable and funny films any one could possible imagine coming from Chuck Palahniuk's provocative novel.All the actors make a mark on their characters, especially Edward Norton as the disillusioned Narrator. I love everything about each Fincher film made, but fight club contains everything you need in a film. Mischief, mayhem and soap",Fight Club
386,stebird,It's not what it seems,10,26 July 2017,"Fight Club is one of those rare films that come along once in a blue moon, a film that challenges the very limits of your mind and hits all the correct notes in doing so. Brad Pitt gives the performance of a lifetime playing Tyler Durden, but all is not as it seems. The nameless narrator of Fight Club played by Edward Norton asks more questions than it cares to answer, but wait for it, your answer will come in due course, and while you're waiting for this revelation to arrive, you'll be gripped by a stylish, well crafted piece of film-making that will keep you hooked throughout. Tyler Durden is the kind of man you dream about, but never ever want to be , a dirty, downright detestable human being who has no morals and carries with him an irresistible thirst for self destruction.How much can you know about yourself if you've never been in a fight?A fair question that Tyler soon sets out to answer, weaving his way through society picking out the lowest of the low and those with an appetite for destruction, forming the secret Fight Club.First rule of Fight Club, don't talk about Fight Club!Inevitably the thirst to fight, reverting back to our primitive instincts, wasn't enough for Tyler, and he and his assembled group of disciples set out onto a wave of crime to try and scratch the ever growing itch. There was a difficult to get your head round, on-off romance involving Tyler and the narrator with Marla Singer, a mentally unstable woman whom the narrator met at a self help group that the both of them attended. This three way romance tied into the film's twist, but I'm not going to spoil it for you.On a side note, I thought Brad Pitt's ""soap making scheme"" was pretty cool albeit grotesque, one particular scene that stands out for me was when Tyler and the narrator went to the dumpster at the back of the doctors to fish out some ""ingredients"" for Tyler's soap venture, nice!A tasteless work of cinematic art, a new and inventive way of telling a story painted onto the silver screen. It was so good because it dared to be different and boy did it pay off, plus the overall acting quality was superb, the story was superb and the film's legendary twist pushed it onto a whole new level that was previously uncharted.One of the top film's of all time, if you haven't seen it then why not, essential viewing for any budding film fan.",Fight Club

I also thought that the perspective was really interesting and having to question what I was seeing was really fun.",Fight Club

It's confusing in strange ways and makes up many questions but keeps your mind intense and focused at the same time. It's so fascinating.Edward Norton and Brad Pitt are a great combo here. A terrific match-up. I really like the bewildering intelligence Tyler (Brad Pitt) uses, to express himself. The Narrator (Edward Norton) develops his role extremely well too. In addition, the soundtrack of the movie is really cool.This movie is a must see. It blows you away. A jaw-dropping stuff!",Fight Club
390,thesouthfamily2-552-707097,I am Jack's wasted life,10,3 January 2014,"Solid acting, amazing direction, and elaborate production design makes the movie ""Fight Club"" a wild ride. It's one of those mind benders where the more you think about it, the greater it gets. Its funny, brutal, sadistic and a true masterpiece. The movie itself represents the desperate cry of the consumerist modern man for something to put out the anxiety and conformism of his life - taking shape in a brutal, over-violent anarchy of religious echoes. A dangerous movie for the mainstream audience, who will certainly misunderstand its brilliant, powerful statement. The message is simple. Get off your ass and go do something so you don't end up like the narrator or the followers that simply follow orders, no matter how brutal said orders goes.",Fight Club
391,nmholland,One of the Best Films Of All Time With a Perfect Script,10,10 May 2016,"Fight Club is directed by David Fincher and stars Edward Norton, Brad Pitt, Helena Bonham Carter, Meat Loaf, and Jared Leto. Edward Norton's character, known only as the Narrator, is living a depressing life. His day job is behind a desk, and he accompanies himself by buying things that he doesn't really need in order to find fulfillment in his life. He begins attending support groups for conditions that he doesn't have, in order to feel relief through expressing his pain to those who have it worse.Once Bonham Carter's character, Marla Singer, begins showing up to these meetings, he begins to feel remorse in his life again. However, once he meets cool guy Tyler Durden (Pitt), he, along with Tyler, start a ""fight club,"" a place in which men who seek fulfillment may find it through beating each other up. Once things with both Tyler and Marla begin to get a bit shaky, our Narrator must fix his own problems without the help of others.It's very rare to find a film in which you completely love everything about. In my humble opinion, however, Fight Club is easily one of the best films ever made. With its eerie direction, fantastic acting, and more than compelling characters, Fight Club is as close as it gets to perfect, with no issues to be found in it. The flawless script contributes to my liking of this movie, due to amazing dialogue and great detail upon the current setting.If anyone has ever read the script for Fight Club, it's just shy of 200 pages, and that is magnificently impressive. The detail the script goes into is purely astounding, and the lines are written, and performed, perfectly. The script, written by Jim Uhls (and based off of the novel by Chuck Palahniuk), is incredibly written in near every way, with great in depth depictions of how each shot was to be set up, and how the actors were to perform their lines.The direction, by David Fincher, is exemplary, with great camera angles and surprisingly memorable shots. The shot I remember most particularly is when Tyler Durden is delivering the final rule of fight club (that being the eighth), and the camera zooms on the side of his face, passing his head and spinning quickly to the next shot of two men fighting. Every single shot, like the one just mentioned, is brilliant, excellently pulled off by Fincher.The characters, combined with the talented acting behind them, is also very unique. Although the Narrator is supposed to be a boring everyday man, the viewer cares for his situations deeply. Throughout the film, he breaks the fourth wall multiple times, and this adds a very personal level the caring for him through the entire run time of the film. Norton plays this character wonderfully, thanks to his great acting abilities. The character of Tyler Durden is easily one of the best, and coolest, characters ever put to film. Every line that Pitt delivers as Tyler is flawless, and deserves all the recognition that a character, and his actor, could ever receive.The other characters, such as Bonham Carter's Marla, Meat Loaf's Bob, and Jared Leto's Angel Face, are also amazing. The audience quickly sympathizes with everybody in the film, thanks to great acting and dialogue. Once again, the script's lines are written and delivered flawlessly, with each actor giving his or her line ideally. Each character is well rounded, and has a great arc throughout the run time of Fight Club.The pacing of Fight Club is also astounding. An almost 2 hour 30 minute film goes by as if the story is told in 20 minutes, and flies by so quickly. This is mostly due to the quick, yet detailed, script, and fantastic direction. Both Fincher and Uhls make this movie zoom by, as if no time has gone by at all. Each of the actors also contribute to this aspect, ultimately making the film feel very short.The last thing I'll mention is the plot twist. Without spoiling anything, Fight Club has one of, if not the, best plot twists in film history. Everything throughout the film sets up for the twist, yet we, the audience, don't pick up on the clues when watching the film for the first time. Fight Club is a rare type of film in which contains a better experience watching it for the second time than watching it for the first. The twist is perfectly built up to, and flawlessly executed in every way.Overall, Fight Club is one of my favorite films of all time, and I like to say that it's one of the best movies ever made. I'd recommend Fight Club to anyone that can handle violence and language, because it's truly worth anyone's time.",Fight Club
392,JokerMichel,Great,8,12 May 2018,"I was greatly looking forward to this movie. I had read many reviews and they all seemed very positive

393,ups-36964,First rule : Don't talk about Fight Club,8,25 December 2019,"What to say? This movie was so relatable to my daily lives that i just loved it. The narrator suffers the same problems like me, suffeeing in this capitalist world, buying things we don't need. And eventually the things we own end up owning us.As a solution, the narrator develops another personality, Tyler Durden, which is his dream personality. The narrator wants to be like Tyler i.e. cool, awesome and not shy to express his feelings but couldn't do so coz of the fear of this damn society. And this is probably one of the biggest plot twists of all time. The story is interesting and gripping and you""ll surely relate to it. Both Brad Pitt and Edward Nortan has done great acting.Now, talking about the cons, the fight scenes should be longer and the ending seems incomplete or empty to me. But overall, Fight club is worth watching..:)",Fight Club
394,RestlessRust,"All the Right Ingredients, but Recipe Is Lacking",6,5 January 2003,"Fight Club starts out as a cinematic lava lamp--the kind of thing that's most entertaining when you perception of reality is impaired.  The second half is more in-line with stylized Hollywood outings.  Unfortunately, the two halves aren't very compatible, and it's likely you'll end up wishing it favored one over the other.We start out following a man (Edward Norton) as he bounces between support groups for problems he doesn't have in an attempt to release his pent-up hostility and pain.  He eventually meets a woman with the same idea, and the two agree to evenly divide the support groups between them.  She turns out to be in dire need of help, just not the kind she can get from a roomful of testicular cancer survivors.  Norton, however, wants nothing to do with her.Then Norton meets Tyler Durden (Brad Pitt), a bizarre cross between a rock star and a pimp, whose line of traveling soap salesman seems oddly reminiscent of John Candy's character in ""Planes, Trains, and Automobiles."" When Norton's apartment mysteriously explodes, he borrows a page from ""Midnight Cowboy"" and shacks up with Tyler.  But Tyler has powerful ideas and a powerful personality.  It isn't long before Norton's life gets intense.  When Tyler isn't sleeping with Marla, he's running an underground boxing club or devising ways to free his brethren from corporate America. His following grows thanks to his uncanny ability to convince the average man that blind devotion offers the greatest reward.  All this leads to a confrontation that's equally derivative and deceptive.The problem is, Fight Club doesn't merely lead us to believe things that aren't true; it deliberately lies to us.  Successful movies in this genre coerce us into filling in the blanks with our minds only to discover there were no blanks to fill in to begin with.  Fight Club, on the other hand, shows us one thing, then tells us something else, leaving us with more questions than answers (plot questions, not philosophical ones).  That's unfair and disappointing.  It's the sign of a movie that would have been great if the direction had been more cohesive.  Instead, we're left with ""just another wacky Brad Pitt movie.""",Fight Club
395,Manthorpe,Marvelous mischief.,10,23 June 2004,"A somewhat anti-American message about the lack of need for materialism and the need to destroy it, with a powder keg. I first put off seeing Fight Club because of the name, it sounded stupid, and the type of people that were telling me how great it was weren't exactly those with discerning film tastes. Shows how much I know. I'm glad I didn't let that prevent me from seeing this original and thought-provoking film. It's actually not really even about fighting....it is but it isn't....it's something much more. Marvelous, simply marvelous.America is a herd of consumers that seek material items they don't really need for their own personal reasons. Whether it's because of greed, materialism, or power...it doesn't really matter. The fact of the matter is that we really don't need them even if we think we do, this is what Fight Club is really about. Without spoiling anything in the story itself, Norton's character, an insomniac white collar worker bee, has become extremely unhappy with his life although he has everything he ""needs"". But does he? Tyler Durden (Pitt) is an interesting stranger who has absolutely nothing as far as material possessions go, but he does seem much richer. Is he really? It all gets interesting when the two join together to make a fight club of sorts to basically feel more alive and see what happens when they push things to the limit. In comes the mischief and a great film.Some people seem to despise Brad Pitt but when he's in movies as great as this one, it makes you wonder if it's just a petty jealousy thing. Yes, he's good looking, who cares? Is he a pretty boy? By all means. That doesn't change the fact that he's an excellent actor with excellent film choices. One of those excellent choices was Fight Club. He plays his psychotic character with ease and believability. Probably my favorite of all his roles. Edward Norton is also a perfect choice for the film and delivers yet another perfect performance. Both actors give flawless performances that make it impossible to imagine anyone else in their shoes. There's also a strange screen chemistry between the two that I'd have never predicted.Some have complained about the violence in FC. Is it violent? Yes. Is it real? No. If violence in film bothers you, then you're missing out on some seriously great films, including this one.FC is a truly beautifully shot movie. The cinematography and innovative scenes come out of nowhere and are extremely entertaining. I'm certain that I've never seen a film shot quite like this one. Even the opening credits sequence is quite impressive. It all adds up to one of the most stylish films in years. Combine that with a truly original and entertaining story with excellent acting and masterful direction...with a dash of humor, and you have simply one of the most entertaining films one can watch. Without giving away anything you may have in store, that is all I will say about that. It is all but perfect. I would elaborate, but I would not dare.Very highly recommended.",Fight Club
396,ericjg623,over rated,6,31 October 2002,"I was pleased to see that Roger Ebert only rated this movie two stars. It's not bad, and certainly entertaining, but does it deserve to be ranked as high on the IMDb rankings as it is? In my opinion, not a chance, although I was starting to wonder if I was the only one who felt this way.
This film is, among other things, a satire that pokes fun at stuff like support groups, mindless consumerism and overall social conformity (although my view is `American Psycho' did a much better job with the latter two issues). It stars Edward Norton as `Jack'; a corporate drone who, to borrow an overused cliché, basically has no life. Giving credit where due, he is perfect for the role, with a face and personality that, if he were involved in a crime or accident, eyewitnesses would invariably describe as `average'. But all this changes when he meets a rather unusual fellow flying home from a business trip. Tyler Durden, soap salesman (among other occupations) is everything Jack isn't - unconventional, brash, impulsive and seemingly fearless. The two hook up, with Jack feeding off Tyler's manic energy, and their very first night together Tyler suggests they start a fistfight just for the hell of it. Afterward, they both revel in the exhilaration of the experience (neither man had ever been in a fight before) and in due time they form `Fight Club', hence the title of the movie. What is `Fight Club'? It's an underground organization where young men fight each other as a form of therapy, or to just give them something exciting to relieve their otherwise dull and pointless lives. Jack's personality changes to more closely resemble Tyler's, he becomes more confident, in fact, downright aggressively so, as shown in a scene where he blackmails his boss about halfway through the film. Eventually the two's ambitions outgrow Fight Club, and they plan something much bigger, namely Project Mayhem, a plot to bring down major companies nationwide, all of which culminates in a somewhat bizarre plot twist at the end, one which will go unmentioned since it shows the actual nature of Jack and Tyler's `partnership' and is thus a major spoiler. Is this movie worth watching? It definitely is energetic and imaginative, but it's also chock full of pretentious pop philosophy, with dialog like `The things you own end up owning you' and `It's only after we have lost everything that we are free to do anything'. It might fulfill every closet anarchist's fantasies about `bringing down the system', but in the end, it is simply about the substitution of one kind of conformity for another. The members of Fight Club and, later, Project Mayhem, are, in reality, far more robotic than the `corporate clones' this movie purportedly makes fun of. Tyler is just another example of an infantile jerk being made into some sort of existential hero simply because he's a non-conformist, not because he actually has anything worthwhile to say. Once you get past the bravado, you find there's really nothing there. Thanks to Tyler, Jack may have found a passion and a purpose in life, but not for doing anything that actually makes the world a better place. In short, this film lacks the courage to rise above the morass of cynicism and nihilism that unfortunately has too strong a grip on modern American culture. As noted, this movie is not without its good points, the acting is uniformly solid, it throws some intriguing ideas at us, but its `message' ultimately falls flat.

397,eddiez61,"What do YOU think? Who Cares, Shut up.",10,2 December 2010,"The most entertaining movie of the decade, blowing away some very heavy hitters, like Pulp Fiction, Reservoir Dogs, Shawshank Redemption, Goodfellas, The Usual Suspects, The Matrix, and dozens of others including Fincher's own Se7en. Fincher learned a whole lot after Se7en, which I thought was clunky, corny, and obvious. Fight Club is a constant revelation, never for an instant giving away it's intent or purpose till the very very end, and even then it still messes with ya. How many times have I watched it? I dunno - 10, 15 - it doesn't matter, there's always another brilliant detail, another spectacular insight to be admired. Nothing feels as good as a vicarious thrill, where we don't have to deal with the consequences of irresponsible, impulsive behavior. Fight Club is the ultimate vicarious thrill, and damn fine film making as well. It's absurdly remarkable, magically horrendous, and awfully unique. Fight Club artfully reflects our crumbling, decaying society and the outdated, selfish philosophy that guides it. Apparently, we are all so f%#@ed. I am not gay - as far as my history reveals - but I would SO bang Brad Pitt's Tyler Durden. You know you would too, you filthy liars. Like Tyler, ""Fight Club"" dares you to ignore it, taunts you into engaging with it, then mercilessly mocks you for acknowledging it. That's the only rational tactic, it seems, that might actually work to wake up our drowsy, dopey, deluded population. Maybe. I'm predisposed to embrace counter culture, anti-materialistic, anarchistic jargon so this stylish rant flowed right into my receptive psyche like cool clear gasoline. Soon after seeing it I quit my stupid corporate job, burned some hefty bridges, and began trying to find a better way.I may never achieve any kind of socially admirable status, never impress anyone with an enviable accumulation of manufactured items, never be cited for having plainly and obviously contributed to ""the effort."" And that's cool, as long as I don't have to explain myself to any of the rapidly multiplying legions of mindless sheep that assemble dutifully every day to have their throats slashed.

398,NateW,Mind blowing,9,22 October 2004,"Fight Club is one of those few movies that joyously defies description. At once it is repugnantly violent and compulsively watchable. It switches from pitch black humor to stomach turning mayhem in the blink of an eye. Fight Club cannot easily be classified into one specific genre without a great amount of debate. One thing that can be agreed on is that this piece of film-making is utterly thought provoking and fascinating. The filmmakers are to be commended for taking the very complex novel by Chuck Palahniuk and transforming it into big screen material while maintaining the heart of its chaos and message. Brad Pitt and Edward Norton are great together and it is evident that they embraced the spirit of their characters. Their on-screen chemistry is something to behold. When the twist of the story is revealed, don't be surprised if your jaw hits the floor. I know mine did. Rarely have I so enjoyed being totally blown away by a film's ending as I was with Fight Club. It's bold, gritty, unflinching, and unnerving if you let yourself get caught up in all the anarchy. This film is definitely not for the squeamish, but it's not hard to see why it's so well liked by those who can take it.",Fight Club

400,lizziebeth-1,Stylish pitch-black comedy keeps winning die-hard sham-rager fans but is no answer to what ails them.,7,15 September 2006,"""How many nihilists does it take to change a light-bulb?"" ""-Half."" (Gettit?) Fight Club(1999) is a highly stylised hybrid--a pitch-black comedy that's hard to like unless you're male, and (possibly) clawing your way BACK from the edge of abyss.It opens with a CGI-fly-past of firing neurons under the credits, suggesting what follows is caused by misfires in the protagonist's brain. But you miss that at first for all the uncharted territory.James Uhls' impressive screen adaptation continues Chuck Palahniuk's novel attempts to revolutionize men's views of their place in first-world-societies where caveman sensibilities are literally no longer required.Tyler Durden(Brad Pitt) characterizes our generation in one of his early Fight Club welcome speeches: ""We're the middle children of history--we have no Great War"", meaning that men raised without brutality still crave it--and why so many of them eagerly join up. But Club(1999) delineates its message for just one gender, never pretending to speak for women: the narrator observes that before becoming yuppies, ""we used to read pornography"": young girls were never so inclined.Nevertheless, it's frightening how many people the film appeals to. Fans over-enthuse, saying ""this is the BEST movie EVER"". Professional critics aren't so impressed. One courageous video & DVD guide claims that ""...this appalling, grotesque, and interminable endurance-test is fairytale fiction for serial killers, imbeciles who succumb to road rage, and frustrated white guys--all the morons who seek excuses for their increasingly bad behavior and hair-trigger tempers"".This temper-thing in the psych business is called ""sham-rage"" (or ""decortication"" after the severing of the neocortex in 1948 experiments on pussycats)- www.emotion.caltech.edu/courses/ss140/April17-1.pdf. The ""misfire"" in Jack's brain depicts such a neurochemical break.But maybe Jack(Ed Norton) and Tyler(Brad Pitt) have a point. To me, the movie is saying that ""frustrated"" guys are really no good for women, because, frankly, they just don't want what women have to give. Such men might now want to bond only with each other, to satisfy ancient caveman instincts, which civilisation--and women--are trying to breed out of them.That's why Jack & Tyler's fight clubs quickly evolve into organised anarchism, and eventually nihilism--the wish to destroy all moral and social edifices: males are getting back to their roots.Having ""said"" that, Fight Club(1999) tries to throw a lifeline to the seriously disaffected; but that lifeline falls on deaf ears. (*****Spoiler: The ending depicts Jack's retaking control from his ""teacher"" by redefining his personal limits regarding violence. The protagonist successfully battles his delusion to finally regain himself. He has learnt better.*****) The ""nasty"" existentialism of anarchism/nihilism still tends to appeal to young men, despite its dead-end logic. A recent email asked me whether I thought this ""philosophy of unreason"" was a mental deficiency or a choice. I call it a deficiency, as Fight Club(1999) does; the question is only how permanent that is. It can be considered foolishness--which is unlearnable; or sociopathy--which isn't.It's nice to know even its proponents (like my email friend) think this ""unreason"" is subject to cognitive override--choice--but why would anyone choose it unless their unreason validates some physiological syndrome? Anti-establishment anarchism was last big in the 19thC, having FIRST given rise to Machiavelli. During both periods it was a might-makes-right power struggle against ruling elites. We now think of these periods as callous, brutal and primitive, certainly not part of civilisation today. We expect ""civilians"" to abide by higher universal standards of humanism. Clearly, blowing up buildings and bashing each other half to death is antithetical to that social contract.However, I do like the film's position that male bonding, with/without a sexual component, might be just what they need. During a bonding session with Tyler, as they consider Jack's heterosexual relationship, Jack admits, ""I can't get married; I'm a 30yr-old boy""--to which Tyler adds, ""We're a generation of men raised by women. I'm wondering if another woman is the answer we need"".This is gender politics; and Norton goes to great lengths on the commentary track to explain Jack's mistreatment of Marla (Helena Bonham-Carter) as symptomatic of Jack's social and mental incompetence. Misogyny itself, the male hatred of women, may be physiologically inspired in such boy-men struggling to behave civilly. Ancient reptilian brain-structures produce the primal urge to violence (ie just to feel alive), so fight-club violence might not be caused by ""social malaise"" at all.I suspect this is the movie's--and novel's--most unpalatable basis, making Fight Club(1999) seem ""irresponsible"" to its critics.We usually call reptilian brain-structures ""primitive"" because except in lizards (hence ""lizard-logic""), they're buried deep in the brain, overlain by ""higher"", mammalian brain-structures. Lifelong learning encapsulated in the neocortex of, say, pussycats, inhibits/overrides this reptilian dominance, but in some (""decorticated"" pussycats or people) the process may be faulty, or just take too long. However if graduating beyond such lizard-logic (anarchist idiocy) takes ""fight-clubbers"" most of their lifetime, then so be it--until then, such men are welcome to have s*x with each other.Fight Club(1999)'s main problem is that it stirs up the powerful philosophical issue of anarchism/nihilism, but leaves it unresolved, notably with its ending. The entire closing scene, including the bombing, is visually nebulous. Did all that happen, or was it just Jack's imagination? Comprehension is deliberately muddied by Jack's speedy recovery(!) from a fatal gunshot wound. Like many, I laughed at its absurdity.Yet the film's showmanship still wins new converts. It seems to set the benchmark for neocinema by demanding freeze-frame plus several viewings to build its enjoyment. Like Sixth Sense(1999), Club(1999) employs perception-shift for the lead character, but here it's integrated linearly to unfold the story. (In Sense(1999) the perception-shift is recursive- cf. www.cse.nd.edu/courses/cse233/www/lectures/ri.pdf OR http://mitpress.mit.edu/sicp/full-text/sicp/book/node15.html.)Club(1999) further winks at us with single-frame interjections of--supposedly--Tyler's full frontals throughout Jack's narration. They serve both as alerts to Jack's insanity, and as visual ""easter-eggs"".Other clever concepts are borrowed from social philosophy, eg the politics of rich women's fat-paranoia (soapmaking): true recycling, trés Soylent Green(1973).---END_OF_PART1---",Fight Club
401,cleary-joshua,The mixed morals are thankfully only an afterthought...,8,1 February 2015,"And so I returned to my fear of watching IMDb Top 10 films for the first time with ""Fight Club"", worried what I was going to think of it and afraid that I seemingly be the only person that didn't like it. By the end of the film, my fears were mostly quelled, but there was still a niggling feeling that something wasn't quite right. I couldn't immediately see what point ""Fight Club"" was trying to make, and for me it felt like it had mixed morals, but those are merely an afterthought in what is a stylish, humorous and very well acted movie.The unnamed narrator of the film is played by Edward Norton, and provides witty and nihilistic commentary throughout the film. His life is boring, he is an insomniac with mental health issues that go even deeper than that, and he needs to find some excitement. He starts going to support groups for the terminally ill just so that he can feel emotional outlet, a method that's also carried out by Helena Bonham Carter's character. It's a foul idea, but the film very nearly makes you able to see where they're coming from. On a flight one day, he meets Tyler Durden (Brad Pitt), and sees a man that is everything that he's ever wanted to be – successful, exciting, daring, attractive, not stuck in a boring day-to-day job. The Narrator and Durden start spending more time together, and that's when things get crazy.Through the pair's setting up of a Fight Club, initially as a substitute for the support groups, but eventually as a training ground for their minions, we are subjected to a horrific amount of violence and animalism. The Narrator gets carried away, spurred on by Durden, and they embark on ""Project Mayhem"", an operation whose sole intention is to mess stuff up and 'destroy capitalism'. It is only after a sudden blackout from Norton's character that we are provided with our twist, a discovery that changes the entire meaning of the film, and the final half hour does an extremely good job of working out and justifying that.It's a film that is held up by its performances and styling. Norton and Pitt work off each other extremely well, with Norton's narration providing an interesting and witty commentary over the bleak events of the movie. In a film as dark as this, finding yourself laughing really does make you look at yourself. Bonham Carter is brilliant, yet severely underused, and her character could have been made so much more prominent to provide a bit more of the ""twisted moral compass"" that she seems to have. The film is shot through a darkened lens, which superbly captures the rainy, dingy and crumbling world that the characters inhabit.""Fight Club"" is a film with a message, shown by The Narrator's eventual rejection of Durden's ways and philosophy, but only just. He doesn't want to become like him, ruining everything and destroying things for the sake of it. The problem I have with the film is the way that it gets there – in displaying the violent and anarchistic build up to its lead character's rejection of those ways, it glamourises it. The whole point of the film is that we too are taken in as followers of Tyler Durden and his ways, and I worry that, even though the actual Fight Club scenes are only a small part of the film, their extreme nature does more harm than good. It may not be advocating violence, but to people who don't quite absorb its message, it may seem like it does.Despite the hype and huge cult following of the film, it's not Fincher's best work. It has great set-pieces, performances and visuals, but the plot occasionally jumps around confusingly and the message has a tendency to feel muddled. It is worth watching and for the vast majority of the runtime really enjoyable, but perhaps my best advice would be not to read too deeply into it.",Fight Club

403,eye3,Style and attitude do not a story make,4,9 August 2001,"Sorry, gang;  I'm giving this a thumbs down.  This pic has great cinamatography and art direction but that only makes it a video, not a movie.The director and writer had a few ideas for half a movie but couldn't think of anything else while the bills piled up.  The first act was good enough but would have been better if it had made up it's mind where it was going. Too many scenes which promised something proved to be red herrings while others just plain dragged.  The last act summed up nothing which went on before;  it also introduced character relationships and elements which hadn't been seen earlier. Thus the story arc was a complete wreck.  On top of all that, the whole movie runs some 30 to 40 minutes too long.  All of which are the classic signs of poor direction and writing.  It brings to mind the fiasco that was Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves (1991).
It started out as an off-beat buddy movie and ended as cheesy, pyschodramatic wish-fulfillment shlock on a par with The Rocky Horror Picture Show (1975) except with a bigger budget and no catchy songs.  It calls out, `look at me!' but then says nothing else, hoping a fashionably alienated, post-ironic attitude will make up the difference.  It never did and never will.",Fight Club

The barbarism and chaos in this film is balanced with the need for a means to an end and peace. There truly is so much more to this film, but I'm having a hard time to put to words that could tell the story, without telling the story.Overall, if you're like me and haven't watched ""Fight Club"" in the 21 years since it's debut, you need to stop what you're doing and add this to the top of your movie watching list.

But what if you didn't feel normal?

Fight Club is a film that makes us look at a society that we have seem to forgotten. Where money is no longer currency but is a power and those who yield it invade. Fight Club is a throwback to all the old seventies films like Rollerball in which America is ruled by corporations instead of people, it's like Soylent Green where one corporation controls half the world's food supply, it's like Logan's Run where someone decides how long you'll live. You live in your 9-5 daily grind every weekday of every week of every month of every year of every decade of your life without realizing the fact that it is making you dead on the inside. You've become something you've forgotten. You live in a world where you don't control money but it controls you. You live in a world where your boss wears blue ties on blue tie day.

412,adeckofcards,A social reflection,9,1 August 2020,"David Fincher, one of the great filmmakers of recent decades, made the leap in his career with what is his fourth film, 'Fight Club'.
Coming already from working on 'Seven' and having gotten a boost, he ventures to adapt 'Fight Club' and takes to the extreme everything he had previously visited in his previous films.
The film tells the story of a man who, after meeting the mysterious Tyler Durden, embarks on a journey of violence and revelation. This same journey of violence and rebellion is what the viewer takes, guided by the excellent direction of David Fincher, with a montage as accelerated as it is well done.
However, despite its technical excellence, what is most striking in the film is the message or the philosophy that it has. A philosophy mainly represented by Tyler Durden and his way of seeing life as meaningless and in which happiness can only be accessed through the fall. At the same time, a clear criticism of the consumer society is evident, which is very present today.
In this way, it could be said that 'Fight Club' anticipated a series of social problems of today, all at the same time as Fincher's masterful leadership and a story that speaks of the end of a century and the beginning of another.",Fight Club
413,NileFortnerBoogieBuddha954,Let's Break The First Rule in Fight Club,10,14 June 2016,"NO SPOILERS IN THIS REVIEWLet's break the 1st rule of fight club, and talk about fight club, because this film is definitely worth discussing and viewing!From what I've read about the movie Fight Club, it did disappointing business at the box office. The film was advertised as a action, bare knuckle underground fight film. A Jean - Claude Van Damme film like Kickboxer and Bloodsport but with a larger budget. I believe it was advertised this way, because Jean - Claude Van Damme movies are popular, and the rise and popularity of WWE's Attitude Era. They should have marketed/advertised the film as a action, horror, Psycho thriller, and what many people (including myself)would consider to be a classic film. I believe Fight Club is a rare example of the movie being better than the book. I love the book, it is one of my favorites to read. However, director David Fincher (Gone Girl, Seven) takes a very good book, and crafts it into an exceptional film. This film has a great deal of humor, violence, character development, bizarre pranks (Tyler Durden Editing family films), Easter eggs, a mind bending 3rd act (that makes you question the main characters sanity along with yours), a clear story, references, characters you can relate to,and everything we can ask for in filmmaking. I truly believe this is an exceptional film. This is not only one of the greatest films of the 1990's, but in cinema history. Thank you for everyone who was involved with Fight Club, everyone from the amazing novel to the amazing film. Fight Club from me gets a 10/10.

414,Jeremy Bristol,"Um. . . yeah. (major spoilers for this movie, Sixth sense, Perfect Blue, and Psycho)",7,23 June 2001,"I read the review by Roger Ebert--and he seems to have been right in his prediction that most people would like this movie for its ultra-violence instead of its alleged anti-violence stance.  Although I disagree with his apparent assumption that satire should be fairly obvious, I'd have to say that the movie seemed to be almost consciously trying to hide its satire though the bludgeoning effects of Pitt's violence preaching, with only Norton's poorly written and repetitive narration to counter-act (what the hell's up with the ""I am Jack's. . ."" crap, anyway?).  What are we supposed to get out of it--should we be wary of the Fight Club-devotees, or the commercialization/corporate rat race/feminization that seems to create the people who need fight clubs?  Just like with Jonathan Swift (through Gulliver) seemingly sincere declarations that human beings are the most wretched creatures on Earth (even worse than horses), there's probably a little truth either way you view the issue.However, I don't buy into the ""surprise twist"" one bit.  Maybe it would have worked in the book (I haven't read it), with a book's limited focus (a movie--even Rashomon--is always third person perspective, since the narrator is the camera)--but come on!  The same person?  Look at this literally--people interact with both of them at roughly the same time, and after the blonde boy gets beat up by Edward Norton, he sees them *both* climbing the stairs (sure, it could be said the blonde kid and all the others were delusional, too, just like the killer in Satoshi Kon's Perfect Blue, but once the secret is revealed, no one mistakes him for Narrator, they all call him by his name).  This is more pretentious than the Sixth Sense ending, mainly because the teaser trailers for sixth sense show scenes that were cut that show people not seeing him, such as when he almost gets hit by a car--hence the problem with that movie lies with the editing and not with the writing.  Fight Club (and Perfect Blue) just jerk your chain.If we look at the character in Fight Club in the same way Haley Joel Osment describes dead people, we can understand how Edward Norton could be deceived--if he's a walking ""dead"", then he only sees what he wants to see. And if we look at him through the lens of ""Psycho"", then we can see the motivation for the change and the basics of Fight Club's satire. The things Edward Norton wanted to do (tell his boss off, blow shit up, fight) were so heinous to his way of thinking (just like when Norman Bates kills his mother) that he had to split off from himself to perform them, thus absolving himself of the guilt.  However, as stated before, Fight club doesn't pull off the physicality of this psychosis as well as either Sixth Sense or especially Psycho.  It's basically on par with the ridiculous ""Dressed to Kill"" (is it just me, or is Fincher a fan of Brian De Palma?).Did anyone else wonder why the blonde guy stuck with it, even though in one scene Brad Pitt rubs his hair and in basically the next Edward Norton (but the same character) beats the living shit out him?  I guess because he's crazy, too (they all seem crazy).Here's something that I really liked about the movie: everything Brad Pitt says is like a twisted version of a commercial catch-phrase--the same sort of brain-washing crap he's supposed to be against.  I'm not sure if Fincher intended that or what, but it points toward the anti-violence moral.  I do kind of wish he made the movie maybe a year later, though, so he could have capitalized on the new Barbie catch-phrase, ""It's a great time to be a girl.""  That's the sort of supposed corporate brain-washing that Pitt's character would have lashed out against, since he keeps preaching the values of masculinity versus the evils of femininity.Still, most of what this movie is saying has been done before--which leaves Fincher's interesting (but not entirely artistic) visual style and the amount and viciousness of the violence to fill out the originality of the movie.  The part where Brad Pit speaks to the audience and the sides of the film appear was pretty good (and appropriately frightening), but most of those kinds of shots are reserved to the first 30-40 minutes.Also, isn't it a little ironic (or conversely hypocritical) that the director of this movie is in the movie business, and that he did several of Madonna's music videos?  Would that fall under the ""aesthetic criteria"" heading that Woody Allen talks about in Annie Hall?6 1/2 out of ten, which would round up to 7/10.",Fight Club
415,MWNiese,Shocking IMDb Ranking,1,14 March 2008,"Just the fact that most men that drool over this film tend to react angrily when I convey my negative opinions of ""Fight Club"", proves that this film not only fails to deliver any new and important ideas, but also that it encourages the mainstream male marketing plan: Be angry, be violent, be masculine, be straight, be selfish, and most of all be stupid. The film employs a juvenile sense of humor/ comedy approach that's immature and sickening. The ending is a total idiotic rip off that makes the watching of this garbage a waste of time. The deep message here is that young white males victimized by society can fight commercialism by beating the s**t out of each other. Wow man, that's really deep. Cue ""You just don't get the movie man"". Yeah, I just don't get the movie. What a joke.The whole premise behind ""Fight Club"" is tiresome and trite, oh the poor straight healthy young male! And how he's been victimized? ""Fight Club"" is a movie produced by the sickening Hollywood greed machine; and the funny thing is that the makers of this film are essentially preaching about commercialization and greed. That really makes sense. I wonder how many fat cat pots were filled by this production? Here's a tip to all young men that really want to fight greed, commercialism,and corporations........ GO TO COLLEGE, and major in something you have an interest in. I was shocked when I learned that men all over the U.S. started their own REAL fight clubs because of this movie. Brad Pitt beating me over the head with clichéd anti-commercialism ideals for over two hours is not my idea of an 8.7 rating. Pitt and Norton are lukewarm at best and overrated by most.

420,Tetsel,Powerful but Flawed,8,17 October 1999,"Edward Norton has a gift for choosing powerful films, and an even greater talent for performing his roles. In 'Fight Club', he does not disappoint. In fact, even Brad Pitt makes a decent showing of it, and the angelic Helen Bonham-Carter completes an impressive trio. Much of the script is darkly poetic, and the direction is fast-paced and in many parts fascinating. However, the initial shock of the plot loses steam about 2/3 in, and the plot becomes a bit muddled. Yes, it is intended to be mysterious and even a bit ambiguous, but somehow a message is lost somewhere in the montage of realization near the end.  Unfortunately there are some short, lame moments of dialogue that seem cut-and-pasted in from other movies, and are glaringly out of place in this off-beat film. In summary I would say that this is an excellent alternative to the typical Hollywood movie, with a powerful message that was ALMOST delivered expertly.",Fight Club

So why the controversy over 'Fight Club'? Because they fight for no apparent reason. Perhaps because of boredom with life. I wonder if there is ever a situation in which pain in and of itself could be a good thing.

Confused males with no idea what to do with their testosterone or intelects could give a collective and resounding ""I get it!"" after declaring that this was their favorite film. And there was nothing wrong with that because this was not a disposable Michael Bay juggernaut of ejaculate. It wasn't even a Tarantino powerhouse of poised pulp! No, this movie was challenging! Unfortunately, as much as society's chode children loved it, they didn't get the message. They didn't get it like the anti-establiSHAM grim and grime enthusiasts got it.

That's when he meets Tyler Durden (Brad pitt), a charismatic soap salesman with a twisted philosophy. Tyler belives that self-improvement is for the weak - self-destruction is for the strong and capable. Before long, Jack and Tyler are beating each other to a pulp in a bar parking lot. To introduce other men  to the simple joys of physical violence, Jack and Tyler start a secret underground Fight Club which becomes widly successful.

429,MadReviewer,Yet Another Victim Of Keyser Soze Disease,6,14 May 2001,"Edgy, disturbing, and hard-hitting in places, `Fight Club' is a decent film that fails to ultimately live up to its initial promise.  With a devious, deftly handled opening half-hour, it's actually quite shocking how clumsy and awkward the later stages of `Fight Club' become.  It's almost as though director David Fincher so desperately wants the audience to get the point of his film, he's willing to beat the audience of the head with that point - and by doing so, the message of `Fight Club' gets lost.The film opens with the unnamed Narrator (Edward Norton), a despairing young man who's grown depressed over his boring, uneventful life, which seems to have been ripped straight out of a J. Crew catalog.  To alleviate his misery, the Narrator begins attending self-help meetings, but not meetings for depressed people.  Instead, he goes to meetings for cancer survivors, drug addicts, abuse victims; by watching the misery of others, the Narrator starts to feel better about his own life.  It's perverse and macabre, but it's also handled with wicked brilliance, and this is where `Fight Club' really shines.Unfortunately, just when the film starts to get good, the Narrator meets two people: Marla Singer (Helena Bonham Carter), a woman who also attends self-meetings under false pretenses; and the enigmatic Tyler Durden (Brad Pitt), a charismatic man who, like the Narrator, also feels the strain and depression of being forced to live a homogenized life.  Durden's solution to this problem is his Fight Club, which is a group of disillusioned men who strip their lives down to their primitive instincts by beating the crap out of each other and doing other random, anarchic things.As Durden, much credit should be heaped upon Brad Pitt who's simply awesome in the role; even if the raw concept of `Fight Club' sounds stupid, Pitt, as Durden, speaks about his Fight Club with such passionate conviction that it at least sounds appealing for a few seconds. Unfortunately, no one ever seems to question Durden after they've had time to mull over the concept, and the members of Fight Club remain loyal to a man even after they've gotten their first taste of beating each other to a pulp.  What was a clever movie becomes instead oddly fixated on pointless violence, and that's where `Fight Club' starts to lose steam - and some of Durden's later, bigger plans just bring the film to a grinding halt.Part of Fincher's message in `Fight Club' is to point out the frustrations of the characters and the absurdities of their desperate solutions. However, this message is never clear, and in many ways Fincher instead seems to be glorifying the message of violence instead of condemning it. Fincher's direction is almost too good - it glamorizes violence to the point of looking slick and cool, instead of raw and disturbing, as it needs to be. Fincher has phenomenal visual style, but it unfortunately seems to be exactly what `Fight Club' doesn't need.  There's a certain irony to `Fight Club' - the disenfranchised young men belonging to Durden's Fight Club are essentially trading one controlled society for another - but the irony is lost when it is painted with pure adrenaline.Without giving the ending of `Fight Club' away, I'll just say that it's ineptly handled, and it suffers from the same thing many recent films have been afflicted with: Keyser Soze Disease. There's a revelation at the end of `Fight Club' that's supposed to literally blow the audience away, and profoundly change the events of the entire film (as the revelation of the identity of Keyser Soze in `The Usual Suspects' did for that film). In `Fight Club's case, though, the supposedly shocking ending seems forced, and doesn't make all the prior events of the film seem all that much different. It's shock value for the pure sake of shock, not to enhance the rest of the movie. A number of films since `The Usual Suspects' have relied on this shock-ending gimmick . . . but unless there's a good script to fall back on, this gimmick usually backfires.  It definitely backfires in `Fight Club'.`Fight Club' has a few great moments, and it certainly has the look of a great film.  Unfortunately, it's not great. It's a slick, muddled film with a garbled message.  Honestly, rent Fincher's `The Game' instead of this film - it has a similar message, except it's much clearer . . . and much better. `Fight Club' is forgettable. Grade: C+",Fight Club
430,Colbridge,"Challenging, controversial and visceral, it was so much more than I expected it to be",8,20 July 2021,"Fight Club is an extraordinary movie that will take your breath away. Along with Seven (1995) this is director David Fincher's finest work, highly stylised, totally engaging and plenty of moments to catch you off guard.Going into Fight Club I wasn't sure what to expect but I was ready to be confronted by it's violence and provocations. However it was so much more than I thought it would be, notably the dark humour, the off kilter storytelling and that plot twist. It was a lot less straight forward than I bargained for as we find ourselves being sucked into Fincher's nightmarish rollercoaster world of violence, depravity and surrealism.Thanks to excellent work from Edward Norton, Brad Pitt and Helena Bonham Carter you get drawn in as they play around with your sensibilities onscreen. Author Chuck Palahniuk considers the film adaptation to be an improvement on his novel and Jim Uhls does an excellent job on the screenplay.The film is challenging, controversial and visceral and attempts to say something about society, materialism and existentialism. You get a sense with this material that if David Fincher hadn't made this movie then David Cronenberg definitely would have because at times it reminded me of Crash (1996) in it's examination of masculinity, perversity and nihilism.

Remember ""Starship Troopers""? As opposed to the Europeans, the American audience took this whole thing seriously - but ST was meant to mock fascist propaganda flicks. ""Fight Club"" is far more sublime. Tyler Durden installs fascist mechanisms like ""We don't have names"". All the ""fighters"" fall for Tyler and his charisma. They establish a ""Führerkult"". Individuals don't exist. Remember the ""brain wash"" scene. Many dialogues contain quotes from ""Mein Kampf"" or sentences similar to that. You fall for fascism and you don't notice. You feel great. That's the dangerous thing.Of course, the film has many more aspects. But fighting is not the point of the movie, nor is it the split personality. They only means of expression.Watch again and THINK.

Maybe we won't get to discover it the extreme way the main character does, yet we can sit down and think after watching this film about how much (or little) we can relate to him. And this is just one parameter of the film to analyze. In a movie that gives you so much to think about, a few faults here and there can be overlooked. Also, with this movie, Norton proves that he's probably the best actor of his generation. 8",Fight Club
442,aingmire-26563,WOW!,10,17 August 2021,"Now I thought I would like this movie, but I didn't think I would like it this much! This movie blew me away especially the acting! Brad Pitt did fantastic, but Edward Norton did amazing specifically the last 30 minutes. The plot was so good and so well developed and the plot twist was just amazing. There are some parts that are a bit slow. The characters are so good!!! Norton's character is so interesting and great. The ending is just perfect too, Norton and Marla are together and Project Mayhem was finished. This movie is a cinematographic masterpiece.",Fight Club
443,DorianWynHowells,"Watch it! Then watch it again, again, again, and AGAIN!",10,4 December 2001,"What a film! Fincher's fourth film? No? YES! The man is a genius (especially when he and Pitt unite!) When I saw this film for the first time, I was completely blown away! I wanted to immediately rush back into the cinema and watch it all over again! But I thought, ""No, I'll wait for the video/DVD"". So I bought it and have since watched it at least 20 times, and guess what? It gets better every single time! You see things that you completely missed before. Lines take on different meaning's. It's full of in-gags and self mocking.Based on the not so well known novel at the time, Fincher created a 'hit' that really 'hit' home. (pardon the 'hitting' puns!) I have since read the novel four times, and it too gets better with each reading, but the film is a wonderful transfer from book to film and wins out due to a few alterations that make more sense compared to the book.The concept seems relatively easy to grasp when a virgin viewer is prone to watching the film, but I guartantee they will come out thinking ""What the hell?!"" which is what this film does, it makes you think, or at least it SHOULD.The title is kinda misleading. It does tell us what the film is about, and what we can expect, but it doesn't REALLY tell us what the film is about.
Many critics have slammed the film for it's gratuitous use of violence, what ARE they on about?! Grow up is it??!! In my opinion, the title 'Fight Club' doesn't really lead you to believe that you're going to watch a U certificated Disney film are you?! It's an 18, and deservedly so, but their point I believe is that the film would spawn a thousand Tyler Dyrden's ready to start their own fight club's.I like the use of self mocking in the film. There is one scene where Pitt (Dyrden) and Norton (Narrator) are on a bus and they look at a poster with a man's 'six pack', and Dyrden comments to the Narrator, ""Is that what a man looks like?"". Earlier we have seen Dyrden's impeccable torso and abs. Not to sound gay but, what a body! This tongue in cheek, self mocking, is one of many examples in the filmI really like the overall message of the film : 'You are not your job. You are not you're bank account.' the message being, let's stop being so bloody materialistic. Dyrden : ""You know what a duvet is?""Narrator : ""Comfort""Dyrden : ""No man, it's just a duvet!""Quite rightly said. Why buy Calvin Klein? Talk about living in the rat race...let's all be little droids that do what we're told and buy what consumer's want us too - pathetic!Anyway, I could go on and on (I think I might have done). Great film. Great cast. Helena Bonham Carter finally shows us that she can act outside of a corset, cast beautifully against type! Fincher's controlled direction, and good handling of the entire plot make this a must buy, let alone a must see! Perfect 10! Enjoy.",Fight Club
444,HollisWoods,First rule?,8,10 August 2021,"Fight Club really deserves the right to be called a 90s classic despite premiering at the end of the decade. The style of this movie fits in with it's time - the music, costuming, lighting, and cinematography really helping with this. The concept itself is of course the ultimate highlight. The idea of this secret society revolving around people beating each other up evolves to reflect flaws of society that are still pretty relevant 20 years later.While the writing can surely speak for itself, the cast really delivers excellent performances that bring these characters to life. Brad Pitt as the very charismatic rebel, Tyler, is a true stand out. Helena Bonham Carter as Marla is a wonderful supporting character. Of course, Edward Norton is the center as the Narrator. He displayed the character's development wonderfully as this miserable office worker takes a plunge into a new perspective on life.What really puts Fight Club up there as one of the greatest movies of all time is the big twist at the end. Spoiler alert, but the Narrator was suffering from multi personality disorder big time, his other personality being Tyler. As someone who knew nothing about the film, the movie does a great job at hinting this, while not explicitly revealing anything until the last 20 minutes. I thought it was odd when Marla was wondering around the house that you never saw her or Tyler in the same room. That's when my suspicions began.I was definitely more suspicion after my favorite scene when Tyler talks about his job at the movie theater. This is the the only scene that breaks the 4th wall beside the narration throughout. That whole concept of replacing a frame in a movie was such a great parallel to what was going on inside his head, and the fact that both guys were there explaining it validates this. Not to mention, in the beginning, I did catch a few flashes of who I'm guessing was Tyler, as if the director of Fight Club replaced a single frame to insert Tyler in the background before Tyler is introduced. And once it's all put out in the open and explained, all the build up is very satisfying.",Fight Club
445,rachelgallit,Agressive,6,30 April 2019,"This film is irrefutably bright and creative in its adressing of consumerism and attempting to find a meaningful exstance in a sleepwalking world. The protagonists are easy to identify with, at least in concept, as they search for sensation in their boring lives. This identification immediately helps draw the audience in, and keeps us there with flashy fist fights and emotionally packed dramatic scenes. The pacing and editing of the scenes that are meant to feel like a music video hit the mark with precision, and the violence, which could feel over the top and unnecessary, becomes a simple means to an end, as we embrace the events in time to the audio. The whole movie is melodramatic and unnecessarily high strung, but given that the acting is well done, and the subject matter is somewhat commentary on society, it works to convey the intended message.",Fight Club
446,Rhino Rover,mind twistingly awesome,8,9 January 2000,"I talked to a close friend of mine recently about this movie and he indicated that I absolutely had to see it. At his urging, I saw this movie today and I'm still not quite sure what to say. I thought I was going to see a movie about fighting (which there was plenty of) but somewhere along the way, this movie took my brain and twisted it all up. Walking out of the theatre, I didn't know which way was up and everything around me seemed so surreal after this movie.For those of you who don't know what this movie is about, here is a brief summary...as best as I can describe. Even now, I still have a hard time trying to coherently describe the storyline. This was one of the very few movies that I could not tell where the story was heading so I don't want to ruin it for you by telling you too much. The Fight Club is told through the eyes of a young man (Edward Norton) who suffers from insomnia as well as hating everything about his life. He tries to find himself by attending different suppport/addiction meetings and discovers that he can let himself go and is able to open up and bond with strangers. Not too soon afterwards on a business trip, he meets a soap salesman named Tyler Durden (Brad Pitt). Through an unusual circumstance, Norton's character (who incidentally doesn't have a name) end up living together. As you quickly become aware of, Durden's character is almost the opposite of Norton's character. Everything that Norton's character wants to be Durden is and through this unusual friendship, the two create a secrete underground society called ""The Fight Club"". This club's purpose is for men who are trapped in their mundane pointless lives to come together and release stress by fighting each other. The club has a very strict set of rules that create form and structure for the members yet at the sametime allow them to release their frustrations and aggression. Everything, in it's own twisted way, seems to be going fine but as the movie progresses, Norton's character realizes that things (in addition to Durden) are starting to get out of hand. He tries to regain control of the situation and realizes that things are not what they seem.The two main actors in this movie (Norton and Pitt) are fantastic. Edward Norton's portrayal of an insecure, conservative young man is very well done. In fact you don't realize the how well a job he does until the end of the movie. Brad Pitt plays the neurotic character of Tyler Durden equally well. The chemistry between the two of them is very evident and definitely adds to the entertainment of this movie. The supporting actors turn in good performances as well but most of the focus is around Norton and Pitt.The one thing that I can tell you about this movie is that there is a lot going on. Almost everything that happens is representative of something so when you watch this movie, make sure you pay attention. You may not understand everything at the time but it all becomes very clear at the end. But as I hinted at the beginning, it is a very cerebrally twisted movie. It definitely makes you think about what the human mind is capable of and what it isn't. The scary thing is that this movie points more towards what the mind is capable of doing than not doing.The movie is long but the ending is definitely worth it. Overall, I would recommend this movie to any adult. There is A LOT of graphic violence and is not for the faint of heart or the squeemish but if you can handle this type of thing then definitely go see it. You will enjoy it and even if you don't, the ending will make it worth your while.A",Fight Club
447,Diablo1616,AN UNMATCHED EXPERIENCE,9,4 August 2020,"The movie is about a psychotic insomaniac who has no peace in his life and looking for his sleep in crying himself out. One day, on his flight he meet Tyler Dursun, a soap salesman who lives his life to the fullest. Next day, the protagonist finds out his appartment in blown up condition and happens to call Tyler for a stay for few days.
The story then makes a way of froming an underground fight club.
A Project Mayhelm is on the run but the protagonist has no idea about it.One of the member working in that project gets shot in head and thats the moment when story takes its turn. New discoveries will be ade by us while watching the film.A plot set in 1999 has a lot more to offer us in many ways. May that be a cinematic experience, a musical experience or a triller experience, Fight Club has it all.

452,johnmschofield,a reasonably good film but no masterpiece,6,18 September 2009,"I do not know why but I believed that this film was mainly about some people who fought each other for pleasure and from my point of view I was not prepared to watch it for that reason. It was only recently when I saw that the film was in the top twenty five or so films in the IMDb top 250 and it had attracted over 300,000 votes that I decided to buy it and watch it. A month ago I did and intrigued I stuck with it even though I started to nod off at times. I watched it through to the end and was surprised by the twist and I decided that it was relatively entertaining film but no masterpiece. I am glad I watched it and I have to say that it is not a bad film but I probably wont be watching it again. I am not a shallow or unintelligent person but this film just doesn't ring any of my bells. I will take some time to try and tell the potential viewer why. I like all types of films from comedy to deep introspection but this film seems to try to get its basic message across in an incredibly complicated way. I suspect there are additional subliminal messages and I am sure that the product is trying to work on several different levels but it seems too cluttered as a result. I cannot say its an important film unless you like contemplating your navel and if so this film is for you. Some of the time the self indulgence of inventiveness depending on how you see it works but when it doesn't it is just boring. I can see why the film has such a high rating and why a lot of people like it but I am just not one of them and repeated viewings are not going to change my mind. I cannot recommend anybody watch this film because it is a great piece of cinematic brilliance but simply because opinion is all and it helps to see the thing your are commenting on.",Fight Club
453,audrablum,It earned its place in history,9,4 May 2018,"This week I watched Fight Club (1999). It wasn't what I expected at all. The film really was artistic and definitely felt like a 90s film. I will admit that I did not see the plot twist coming. I do think the film was good, but I wouldn't say it was my cup of tea per se (but I think I knew that going into it). I really liked the way that the characters were set up and how the main character met Marla Singer. The film was definitely engaging. I can't say that I necessarily felt anything watching the film other than the occasional disgust when the characters would do something gross or the occasional weird feeling when the story went somewhere strange. The editing is probably one of the best things about the film and I feel that it may have triggered its own editing genre that seems to have what I call the pause and whiplash effect. The narrator will be speaking, the visuals pause as he explains, then the visual is unpaused and takes the viewer through a whiplash sequence of shots before returning to a normal pacing. The perspective of this film was told from the main character, who also served as the film's narrator. I'm not sure that there was a point to the film other than crazy people can lead an army. I think that it was more about telling an interesting story than serving much of a deeper meaning. The payoff for this film comes toward the end when we realize who is really in control and when the main character achieves his goals, even if they were oddly screwed up goals. All in all I'm glad to have finally seen this movie and can see why it has taken its place in film history's hall of fame.",Fight Club
454,theforager,How to Start Your Own Cult,7,20 June 2020,This is little mind bending but more violent with motivations towards cults. Clearly not recomended for young minds.It started like a crash course for Psychos to start their own cult. It was like two partners started a gang to fight and destroy brands. When it looked like that story is now getting out of control suddenly it is revealed that Tyler and Edward are same guy with split personality. This makes story interesting. Edward and Tyler both played thier roles very well. But its closing was very bad and without any sense.,Fight Club
455,Decko_koji_obecava,Style over substance.,3,21 March 2003,"This is a good example of what happens when people who've been reading comic books and watched better movies all their lives get to make their own. I may be wrong in my assessment of David Fincher's adolescent pursuits but the point I'm trying to get at is that there is very little articulate and nothing even remotely original about ""Fight Club"". Both conceptually and visually it seems to be one big incoherent, messy smorgasbord of Orwell, early '90s MTV, Kubrick, punk, etc, etc.When all the unnatural 'coolness' (jump cuts, hipper than thou narrative, flickering images) is stripped away, what you're left with is a bunch of half-ass, unfinished ideas about capitalist social order, human nature, battle of the sexes, meaning of life in a modern world, male frustration etc. And in a movie that chooses to treat its characters solely as metaphors rather than to tell a story, it's especially important that at least a shred of uniqueness in point of view is present. As it is, ""Fight Club"" doesn't even seem to have a coherent point of view about the subjects it touches on, other than maybe ""go let it out"" or ""if it feels good do it"". Yeah man, rock'n'roll!!!It begins with nameless character (played by Edward Norton), known in credits only as Narrator, spiritually and physically beaten 30-year-old professional fighting insomnia and seeking a way to reconnect with the world, although I doubt he was ever properly connected to begin with. He is engaged in a losing battle with life he chose (although judging by his misery you'd think somebody else chose it for him). Battle that's fought on modern day yuppie frontlines - corporate offices, airports, his expensive IKEA decorated condo, airline first class, business trips etc., and is in desperate need of something. Watching from aside one would think that something is emotional comfort, meaning, love or a thing along those lines. Whatever it is, he seems to have found it, albeit briefly, in various disease support groups that he now starts to frequent pretending to have different ailment or disease for every day of the week. Listening to people, in some cases dying, open up about their problems gives him a visceral sense of freedom. Suddenly he can sleep and enjoy life again. ""I let go. I found freedom. Losing all hope was freedom"", he reasons. Until..Marla Singer (Helena Bonham Carter) strolls into his life and messes all of that up. She, you see, is also a 'tourist' - someone pretending to be sick - and the knowledge that another person like him is present at these meetings bothers our Narrator to the point that his insomnia returns. He confronts her about that and to avoid running into each other they divvy up the meetings in a lame exchange that tries to be funny but only ends up resembling something Rachel and Chandler might say to each other on 'Friends'.The story then shifts to Narrator's relationship with a strange but fascinating fellow named Tyler Durden (Brad Pitt) with whom he hits it off on a plane during a business trip. Their bond intensifies after Narrator returns home and finds his condo blown to smithereens as a result of an electrical malfunction. Having no family or friends to turn to in a time of need, he calls Tyler and soon moves in with him in a boarded-up apocalyptic house. On Tyler's insistence they found a weekly fight club that starts up as a jealously guarded secret clique where a few young males can nurse their anxieties and frustrations by beating each other to a bloody pulp!? Bingo! This is what Narrator has been looking for all his adult life.Soon, though, the whole thing grows in popularity, Marla makes a return, Tyler's behaviour takes stranger turns and problems start to pile up. It is during this part that the movie makes its various cheesy points. Case-in-point the scene in which Tyler ambushes a convenience store, takes the clerk outside, points a gun to his head and under a threat of death forces him to go back to college. Wow, symbolism overload!!! And how deep, too!The rest of the movie seldom gets better than that including a sketchy ending that features a crucial fist/gun fight, a bomb with obligatory display counting down and other such things no true Hollywood action movie can do without.In the end I kinda felt like I watched an extended commercial/music video that made me think of Spike Jonze. Then I learned David Fincher also directed music videos. And although this was more viewable than Jonze's dismal ""Being John Malkovich"" it's still a pretty mediocre offering. Those who refer to ""Fight Club"" as a masterpiece probably also consider Eminem and Fred Durst to be the modern generation's sharpest voices.",Fight Club

An extremely dark movie and one in which Pitt and Norton show there true acting skills and range as professionals. A film in which is original in its presentation and in fact in its plot.

The concept of Fight Clubs being set up across the United States is really cool although the first half an hour of the movie is dull and bizarre.When Bradd Pitt showed up the movie took off and became very interesting and attractive to watch. I was eager to see more. Having said that the movie was overloaded with intense scenes of what I would consider unnecessary violence and vulgar emotions.The twist at the end was unexpected and a masterpiece of film history, something that this movie should be credited with.

460,shadow_blade-89459,Violently Touching,9,3 May 2018,"""Fight Club"" (1999) is a magical mental drama masterpiece. The film is told from the perspective of an insomniac office worker, the narrator, played by Edward Norton. He tries to conquer his sleeping issue by attending support groups where he meets Marla, played by Helena Bonham Carter, and begins an uncomfortable relationship. He soon meets crazy man Tyler Durden, played by Brad Pitt, and form the notoriously evolving underground fight club. Through the escapades of the fight club develops another other worldly challenge, appropriately named ""Project Mayhem."" This film is full of twists, turns, and if the viewer plays close attention, reveals to the finale.David Fincher is remarkably on point with the pacing of this film. Moments where the viewer would anticipate slower cuts, it speeds up just enough to keep them interested while allowing other areas to breath. The edits were timely and purposeful adding a level of excitement that might have been taken away if edited differently. I found the point of this film to be more serious and caring than the title implies. Even though this film has violent moments of fighting and vandalism, it's refreshing to know that the story lends itself to a reset of the world, allowing the commoner to rid themselves of the negatives of the world. The payoff, though slightly unfortunate, is well worth the watch. I highly recommend this film to anyone needing a little excitement with a heartfelt message.",Fight Club

When I was in the states last year I saw it on video, and wanted to dislike it. But I just could not. Although I fall asleep about half way through the film, I thought it was really good. So I watched it again about one month later, when I was back in Germany, and loved it. I am a guy, and 17 years old, so I maybe am supposed to like this film, and it is very good. It might be a bit confusing. I think this is aside The Sixth Sense, Toy Story 2 and American Beauty, Blair Witch Project and American Pie the best movie of 1999. 1999 was a good year for film making, there were a lot of good/great movies, this is one of them. I do not like Brad Pitt that much, and even Edward Norton is not one of my favorite actors. But both of them did a good job in this flick. My favorite part of Fight Club was the scene where Brad Pitt explains the rules of Fight Club to the others. That was great. Good points about Fight Club : acting, directing, story, style, SOUNDTRACK, actorsBad points : also style ( sometimes it is just stupid )All in all, I rated Fight Club 9.5/10 and recommend it to everyone between 10 and 35.

It is a about a man named Jack (Edward Norton) who is stuck in a depressed state. He is unhappy with his job so he tries to delve himself into creating the perfect apartment, when this doesn't fill the gap he goes to support groups for people with terminal diseases hoping he will find fulfilment there. While at these support groups he meets Marla (Helena Bonham Carter) who he later takes an interest in. On Jack's journey to fulfilment he crosses paths with Tyler Durden (Brad Pitt). Tyler believes in fulfilment though loss and pain and he and Jack fight. This leads to an underground group called the Fight Club and a journey of fighting and violence embarks from there.Fight Club is a dark comedy which was directed by David Fincher who had also directed Seven, which Brad Pitt had previously acted in. Fight Club portrays controversy and diverse degrees of masculinity and extremism including terrorism. I didn't wait so long to watch it on purpose, life just worked out that way. Fight club is certainly one of my favourite movies now and I finally understand all the fight club references that are used by others in daily life.

Edward Norton strikes us with a powerful performance .. not as good as his performances in ""American History X"" but still powerful .. he plays the average hardworking man who is enslaving by the materialism of life .. he meets his misfit match who is Brad Pitt on the other side .. if I have to describe Brad Pitt's character I'd say it is completely the opposite of Edward's .. Brad Pitt's performance was powerful too, his best since ""The Legends of Fall"". I don't know which one I prefer more .. I guess they are even. Helena Bonham Carter's performance was good ..the script is deep yet funny and light .. not boring or weak, just great.. the script is loaded with good lines .. the script so powerful that the movie takes your full attention since minute one till the ending and I don't mean like those cheap pointless thrillers.. you may spend a few minutes thinking about the thoughtful meanings of the movie after you finish watching it.

The fight clubs are simply an expression of people's frustrations. The movie is about the shallowness and materialism of contemporary society - the emptiness and pointlessness of existence. It's interesting that it focuses on these feelings within men - not women. The movie has parallels with The Matrix and I think if you like one then you'll like the other. Good movie. I gave it 8/10. The fourth good movie of '99 (after The Matrix, South Park and Sixth Sense).",Fight Club
468,robsellke,"Fantastic and interesting plot, insane twists, and good acting",9,16 May 2000,"""Fight Club"" is one of those truly original movies.  There aren't any other movies like it.  Brad Pitt plays Tyler Durdan, a colorful and insane projectionist/soap-dealer/fighter/waiter with a crazy attitude towards life. He urinates in his customers meals, adds pornography into children's movies, and uses human fat stolen from the liposuction clinic to make his soap.  Edward Norton plays the narrator, a timid worker with a chronic sleeping disorder, numerous unnecessary self-help groups, no life, and a huge collection of Swedish specialty furniture.  They finally meet on an airplane, when the narrator's coming back from a business trip.  The narrator's condo blows up from gas and he moves in with Durdan.  Tyler lives in an industrial neighborhood in a decrepit sagging wreck.  The two of them have a brawl in parking lot and truly enjoy it.  Several guys see them fighting and join in.  Thus, Fight Club is born.  Every Saturday a group of men gets together in the basement of a bar and beat the crud out of each other.  Durdan and the narrator are co-founders and they come up with crazy goals, assignments, rules, and projects for Fight Club.  The club mutates and things start to get confusing.  The plot then has a major, completely unexpected twist towards the end that turns the story upside down.  ""Fight Club"" is a fascinating conveyance of a story, and it is definitely worth seeing.",Fight Club
469,dean2900,An all-out attack on consumerism,10,4 December 2006,"Warning: Spoilers This really is a great comedy. I never ready the short novel but do have read the differences. It sounds to me like the movie improved upon a short 200 page book.The male macho ""Guy Flick"" persona is what Fight Club is disguised as. In reality, Fight Club is a strong attack on consumerism, corporate sponsorship gone mad, and a dark satire.The lead character (initially only known as the narrator) is your average corporate middle-class American. He works for a large car company and examines faulty cars. He is the man that determines which will save the company more money; A) Out of court settlements or B) A Recall of the faulty parts.The narrator flies across the country from city to city with what he refer to as his ""self-serving friends"". Anyone who has had a mainly travel job for a large company will understand this reference immediately.Our narrator is addicted to purchasing meaningless stuff. He buys the yen-yang coffee table, has a great collection of clothes. He asks himself what type of khakis defines him as a person? The point is of course what a person wears does not define who they are. The larger point is that the world is out of control and people are working long hours even at menial jobs in order to purchase things that they do not need and do not really make their life better.Norton feels so empty and suffers from insomnia and when his M.D. refuses to prescribe him sleeping pills, he starts attending groups full of people with terminal diseases. This acts as a catharsis for the narrator and allows him to sleep again. However, after some time he spots Marla who is a tourist to the group just as himself. This enrages the protagonist since he can no longer get anything out of the groups since Marla's presence bothers him so much. He ends up confronting Marla and they make agreements to who gets to attend which terminal illness groups. Marla makes a big play to get the brain parasites group. Marlas also comments that she has more right to the testicular cancer since Norton still has his. This is very dark comedy and is funny even if you feel demented for laughing at it.Once Norton's character meets the infamous Tyler Durden, things change for him. Tyler makes soap for a living and likes to talk about how easy it is to make napalm out of household items and orange juice. Tyler questions what a man is. He asks ""Is that what a man is"" when he see's the Calvin Klien type ad on the bus.The Narrator's fancy Condo with all of his collections suddenly explodes one night leaving him homeless and without all his possessions. This is a pretense the movie uses in order to set himself free.The narrator then meets Norton for a few beers after his Condo blows up. Tyler says he can stay in his house. The narrator agrees but Tyler asks him for one favor first -- HIT ME AS HARD AS YOU CAN. The narrator hits him in the ear and Tyler punches him back. Norton has now found his replacement for the support groups.Norton's character then goes to move in with Tyler who lives in a condemned building in a bad part of town with limited electricity and were nothing works.The narrator and Norton get into another fight and onlookers get involved. Soon enough we have FIGHT CLUB. There are eight rules of Fight Club but the 1st two are NO ONE TALKS ABOUT FIGHT CLUB.The movie has a subplot that continues with Marla and Norton's character blackmailing his boss he can have fight night every night and the money. However, the main point of the movie is watching Fight Club turn into Project Mayhem. This shows a down wired spiral into madness or freedom depending on your point of view.By the end of the movie, the twist comes and the goal is to destroy history, consumerism, and the credit card industries.I will not completely spoil the ending for those who have not seen the movie but it is a good thing this movie came out in 1999 instead of after September 11, 2001 or they probably would have re-written the ending.",Fight Club

Starring Brad Pitt, Edward Norton, Helena Bonham Carter, Jared Leto, and Meat Loaf, and directed by David Fincher, didn't do to well by the critics, but, got mixed reviews by the audiences because of the story and the way it was made.  At first, I thought this movie would suck.  But, I checked it out and it was an OK movie.  But, I watched it more than once, the movie's in my list of all-time favorite movies.  It was a weird movie, but, it was well-made. David Fincher did a good job again with his camera work, the performances by the main and supporting actors were extraordinary, and the music (composed by The Dust Brothers) had a very good mix to it.

I'll say this, it is the perfect movie for young troubled, bored, ignored, misunderstood, ever-changing teens who need to escape from the shadows of their predecessors and give themselves that angry identity of screw the world I'm different.Looks like some reviewers lives are so blah that they need to push the levels of taste until they are totally disgusting and morally wrong. What kind of parents do they have is my question.First of all, punching someone in the face that many times can kill them or at least send them to the dentist for free. What makes the kids of today enjoy this type of behavior, fantasy or not? A lot of shirtless men, sure that's a great reason to applaud this movie for some of the messed up women out there who keep picking violent men as boyfriends and then wonder why. I saw no redeeming value in this movie. It took me for a ride and then fooled me at the end, but if anyone rates this in their top 5, 10, whatever then I can guess their age category. Go to school, get a job, have a nice life and adjust your attitudes. I sure don't have the perfect life but obviously better than some of the messed up kids who like this because I don't need to watch people beat the s*** out of each other for entertainment. I'm shocked by the number of positive reviews for this crap. Get therapy, please.I give this movie a 3 of 10, and that's generous. It sure is not rated an 8 like the score in front reveals.

Wildly inventive, exceptionally cast and undeniably controversial, there's an endless list of subtexts and viewpoints which will fuel debates for years. Fight Club is not just a movie, but a wake up call to a disenfranchised generation sick of being told by advertising what to drive, wear, buy, smoke, drink and eat in order to be cool.

474,sullibrandon,"Not a bad movie, but not a great one either",5,13 February 2006,"Fight Club is not a bad movie, per se, but it really does not deserve all the credit that is given to it for being such an awesome movie. It started out fine, I was enjoying myself, well, not necessarily enjoying it, but I liked that it was mentally stimulating - I can respect that about Fight Club. But then the movie just turned....weird. The idea of these characters being part of an underground fight club was not a bad idea, but what the filmmakers did with it might have been. There was a book written about it, and the book focuses much more on the psychological aspect of all that is going on. Obviously, Fight Club is also a very intensely psychological film, but it doesn't seem to entirely know what it is doing with this.It is a movie with no particular teaching in mind or direction in its step. It is a movie in which the director, through intertwining suspense, violence and dialogue, tries to pound into the viewer some sort of questioning or some sort of thing to make us think. Unfortunately, because of the director's attempt to make the viewer ask questions, what comes onto the screen is a jumble of jargon, the focal point of which is the fighting, not the psychological aspects. Occasional mention of sex is thrown in liberally, and somehow made to fit into the plot line, but on the whole it seems kind of useless. The movie to me was just confusing and really not that great. Like I said, it's not a bad film, it just isn't all that.I like plot twists in movies, and the plot twist in Fight Club wasn't all that bad. In fact, it might have made the movie. But there were several factors that didn't work for me. One was the way the plot twist seemed just kind of tossed in there. I mean, obviously, it is integral to the whole story, but I could tell that if the entire storyline was looked at completely intensely, every piece would not fit into place. In the Sixth Sense, every last piece fit perfectly. In Fight Club, it obviously didn't. Also, the ending of the movie kind of spoiled the whole thing for me. The guy shoots himself in the mouth, stays alive for several minutes afterward, and everything continues on as it was going too, except for the fact that Edward Norton's character is going to die. What the heck!? The entire movie just seems confusing for the sake of being confusing. It believes that if a movie is thought-provoking, it is automatically classified as good. That is not necessarily true. I could take a bucket of truth and have characters in a movie speak several twisted versions of it, toss it into a setting, a story, and a climax, and call it a movie, but that doesn't mean it's good. Too much of Fight Club seems like this. Yes, it is very thought-provoking. My thoughts were provoked. Yet there is something integral missing, that piece of movie-making that makes other movies good, and the lack of it leaves Fight Club somewhere in that place between a strange movie and a great movie.",Fight Club
475,watto124,What does everyone see in this movie?,7,28 August 2001,"Don't get me wrong, Fight Club is extremely worth watching and is always entertaining, but I've seen the film 3 times now and I still don't see what all the fuss is about. I mean Edward Norton is awesome, and the first hour of this film is first- rate, but it wouldn't suffice to say this film goes over the top, into the sky, into orbit, and dies in a super nova of endless surrealistic imagery and crazy dialogue. POSSIBLE SPOILERS: I thought the surprise twist/ending was very well executed and very cool. But after we find out the truth the film goes on for another 20 or so minutes! This is definitely not the pinnacle of David Fincher's films. ""The Game"" and Se7en"" are masterpieces, and ""Alien3"" is a great movie. I just don't really like the film or the ending to Fight Club where they just stop everything.            Or maybe I just don't get it. 10/10",Fight Club

482,gut-6,Another Donnie Darko,3,22 July 2007,"It's either this or Casablanca or Donnie Darko as the most overrated American film ever, and just behind Donnie Darko as the most pretentious. I had heard about the cult status of this film, and the book it was based on, years before I saw it, though what little of the plot I knew about didn't make it seem terribly interesting. Sure enough, it wasn't.This movie gives pretentiousness an even worse name than it already had. It has the anarchic nihilism of an old Etonian in a punk outfit, the laughs of a Bob Hope routine, the outrageous pranks of South Park's Captain Kaos, the acting subtlety of an amateur pantomime, the philosophical depth of a fortune cookie, and the coherence of a William S. Burroughs cutup.And then there's the ""plot"". It seems to consist of a number of separate unrelated ideas which are strung together into what is supposed to be a story, but with no obvious attempt at logical integration. A man is dissatisfied with his humdrum life. So of course he attends group therapy sessions for conditions he doesn't have. Then he meets his alter ego, Tyler Durden, who of course devotes his life to pulling unfunny satirical pranks. Then, naturally, they start fistfights with each other up for thrills. Witnesses see the obvious appeal of these fistfights and start joining in to form a secret nationwide movement. The movement understandably turns into an anti-consumerist terrorist cult financed by selling home-made soap. Finally Tyler Durden is revealed to be the protagonist's alternative personality whom the protagonist starts to fear and dislike, so he kills off his imaginary friend by shooting himself in the head, while managing to survive the injury himself. I kid you not, that is this film's pathetic excuse for a plot. Perhaps this is really just a clever satirical comment on the arbitrary nonsensical plots of Hollywood action movies. But that wouldn't make it any less lame.As if this nonsensical plot isn't tedious enough, the film-makers drag out its exposition, so that it has the length and pace of an Antonioni movie, despite the relentless action. It feels even longer than its already excessive 2 hours plus.I only rated it 3/10 because I have seen worse movies that I still gave 2/10. It probably deserves less. I realise that many somehow think this film is amazing. If so, it only proves that we have created a future where everything is amazing for 15 minutes.",Fight Club
483,LeroyBrown-2,"Seriously, 8.7 from IMDb voters?",2,4 March 2008,"I can not understand what the fascination with this film is. All I get from this film is a bunch of guys who starts out beating each other up and then rebelling against society. And it's started by a yuppie, no less. Do they feel trapped by the conventions of society? Do they feel emasculated? If so why don't they just go to one of those caveman retreats where you dance around naked and doing primal screams, so you can connect with your ancestors and your inner caveman and spare society from your destructive urges.I have heard and read some people saying this is the greatest film they have ever seen. It makes me wonder who they identify with, is it The Narrator the guy who feels impotent by society or Tyler Durden the rebel leader who has taken a path against social convention. Personally I think both characters are among the most worthless characters I have ever seen in the Movies. Neither have any really redeeming quality. Both on the extreme side. One meek and almost helpless while the other is brash and fearless. Even when we find out the truth about the characters it really doesn't help the situation.This is a well crafted film, it looks good, crisp direction, well acted. Edward Nortons needs to be called what he is, the best actor of his generation, even better than Sean Penn in my opinion. He does a fantastic job playing the meek office drone. Even in his narration we hear a guy who seems to have little passion for his own life. Brad Pitt is very good too playing Tyler Durden. The guy is the opposite of The Narrator. He has passion but for what? to harm society? This movie has been described as subversive, a call out against societal convention. But to what? To chaos and destruction against society? Is that really much more preferable? Well like I said previously go to those caveman weekend, strip naked, yell out your primal scream and don't come back because society is better off without you.",Fight Club
484,madshell,Keep your soap to yourself,5,15 October 2000,"After viewing this film, I begin to wonder if the filmmakers want us to believe that every man wants to ultimately rebel and then flog themselves to near death for doing so.   Evidently, they have that vision of despair; that lack of faith in humanity.Perhaps some call it artistic expression, but pure cynical humour, to me, is self-indulgent garbage.   All it does is propagate more confusion in a blatant refusal to understand.Where Se7en had brilliance -- in the display of the seven deadly sins, the clarity of each character, the horror of the consequence of action -- Fight Club almost displays the horror of human life itself, and that's just plain bad art.Yes, Brad Pitt and Edward Norton are wonderful in it.  But why are they in it? If the filmmakers are so unhappy with themselves and humanity, they should at least give us a vision of how they feel things SHOULD be!  Or let someone else get greenlighted that can at least appreciate something about humanity. Sell your soap somewhere else.  I ain't buying it!",Fight Club

(Pun intended.) Norton, Pitt, Bonham-Carter and yes, even Meat Loaf, are each giving in this film some of their collective best work. Even the make up deserves mention. Usually, one thinks of make up in terms of Planet of the Apes. Here, it is subtle. Varieties of bruised flesh cross the screen, simple, small scars underscore the film's point.

486,andrew7,Hello??? Doesn't anyone care about coherency anymore???,2,27 October 1999,"First, the good stuff.  The acting was superb.  Edward Norton was very strong (though I expected more, somehow) and Brad Pitt was a phenomenon. I'm glad Sean Penn pulled out of this role, though I'm sure he would have nailed it as well (and in a very different way, I'll bet).  The direction was also interesting, though it seemed like the director was enjoying himself to much.  So much of it seemed like the ""wouldn't it be cool if..."" style of direction.Now, the bad stuff.  This plot is more full of holes than Independence Day. I mean, it makes absolutely no sense whatsoever.  Other reviewers have said that if you go to this movie, you must be prepared to think.  Very true, you must think about the film's themes and the film's subtext every step of the way.  This was extremely interesting and enjoyable.  But whatever you do, please do not think about the plot.  It doesn't hold up under any scrutiny at all.  At a very basic level, this film doesn't make sense.  I can't elaborate without throwing out a huge spoiler, so I won't.If you ask me, plot is the first thing.  If you have a weak plot, that can be forgiven by other strengths.  But if your plot can't even stand up without the willful indulgence of a forgiving audience, then you've already fouled up too big to ignore.  This movie could not have been good without massive script alterations.  No matter how good the acting, how good the directing, how clever the dialogue, this movie could not have been other than a travesty of modern film.  Horrible.On the other hand, from the number of posters here who seem to think that Edward Norton's character was named Jack, it's quite clear that people indeed don't pay very close attention to films.  No wonder this film is so highly regarded.",Fight Club
487,MissCzarChasm,The Ultimate Cinematic Trip,10,15 April 2001,"When Fight Club was released to theatres i refused to go see it. The previews made it look like it was movie purely about senseless violence without a point or a message. One night while at a friends house they were raving aobut Fight Club and someone had brought it over to watch. i wasn't into seeing it but what else could i do. When the movie was over i couldn't believe what i had just saw. All my negative feelings about the movie were put to rest and i realized that i had seen a great movie and now it's in my top 10.I won't go into the plot because i think that the viewer should experience that for himself instead of reading this review. i will however say that it's not all about violence and the violence that is displayed in the film has a reason for being there. it's all about letting out aggression and finding out who you are. The violence is just a small part of a bigger picture.The acting is top notch. Brad pitt is in a lot of my favorite movies(Seven, Interview with the vampire, snatch).He's a very good actor and he jsut has a certain charisma when he's on screen. If anyone hasany doubts about his abilities they should see tihs movie. Edward Norton is also very good in the film. He's a very versatile actor and he fits intot his role very nicely. Helen bohnam carter is very good as the sole female in the film. she can more that handle her own with the 2 male leads. good supporting roles are also give by meat loaf and jared leto. Meat loaf is especially good in his role as bob.The direction by David Fincher is excellent. This film is a little dark like seven but there is more of a visual flair in this film. he's a brilant director and he has a eye for what's good in a film.In closing fight club is a movie we all should see and hope everyone gets a chance to see it.",Fight Club

491,sashamyshkina,The problem with Fight Club isn't Fight Club itself.,8,1 August 2021,"My first instinct was to write some witty, over-used joke about the first rule, but then I realised that I actually had a decent chunk of serious things to say about this movie, so here we go. Speaking of the first rule, I just broke it.Fight Club is another one of those films that the so-called filmbros will tear you from limb to limb for not liking. Ever since its release, to say that it's built somewhat of a cult following is an understatement. It's been so ingrained in popular culture that even I've got to admit I made the ""first rule"" joke a couple of times before I had even watched it. And the problem is that ever since then, it's been worshipped as the epitome of filmmaking, the most profound commentary on culture, the greatest movie of all time, etc. Etc...Don't get me wrong, I enjoyed Fight Club a lot. I've always been a fan of Fincher's, and this film, stylistically, is a beautifully gritty thriller, the kind that I've come to love. And it certainly deserves a lot of the praise that it gets. I don't think that it's the greatest movie in existence, but I did like watching it a lot. And a lot of the stuff that I'm about to say is going to make it sound like I hate this movie, and I don't. Fight Club is a good movie. However, I think that the biggest problem with this movie isn't the movie itself, but rather, the culture of people who have come to worship this movie like it's some sort of cinematic god. You know, those same people on Letterboxd and Instagram who think Parasite is an obscure foreign film and think that Joker is ""relatable"".And it's honestly kind of annoying that this perfectly great movie had been ruined by this filmbro culture, to the point when someone says it's their favourite movie your first thought is ""oh s**t"". And that's the thing - I have nothing against people who do say Fight Club is their favourite movie, but just because of that small percentage of people who are just... like that, your mind will automatically go RED FLAG even if it completely isn't. And it's almost ironic how this movie has been packaged and adored by the masses, adored for its anti-consumerist culture by the very consumerists that it criticises.I'm realising that this has veered away from being a review and is slowly turning into an essay about how much I hate filmbros, so let me just wrap it up with some final thoughts. I don't hate Fight Club, but I hate the people who have ruined it for people who genuinely like it.-Sasha.",Fight Club
492,mrrockey,An Intelligent Film that Definitely Deserves a Rewatch,9,9 September 2013,"Fight Club is one of the smartest films I've seen in a long time. The title is a little misleading. It makes the film sound like nothing more than a dumb testosterone flick but in actuality, it's a thrilling, intense look at masculinity and individuality.The story of this film is that of a unhappy, lonely man who works as an automobile company employee and is only referred to in the film as ""The Narrator"". He's not enjoying his job, he has insomnia, and he has to go to support groups just to be able to sleep. His life pretty much sucks until he meets Tyler Durden, who is the embodiment of everything the Narrator wishes to be. He's cool, laidback, dresses like a movie star, has a buff body, and most of all, free from consumerism. They quickly form a friendship and one night, they fought each other just for the heck of it and ended up really enjoying so they form a fight club for men to take out their frustrations with their fists. The club gets more and more members overtime so Tyler comes up with ""Project Mayhem"", a plan to bomb buildings with credit card companies'recordings.What makes this film so great is how both inviting and disturbing it is. At first, when The Narrator meets Tyler Durden, we see and understand their problems with society because it's actually a very common frustration normal people have. Because of this, it allows us to at least understand where these people are coming from and be able to sitback and enjoy the first half until the second half comes along and gets really freaking dark and intense.The second half is when it gets dark and disturbing. Instead of them just beating the sh!t out of each other in a basement, they decide to freaking blow up buildings! At this point, you could either be completely disgusted with their behavior, or disagree with their methods but still understand their position, or completely agree with everything they do(minority). But whether or not you agree with their behavior, you still feel sympathy towards the Narrator because he's just a normal guy who happened to have a messed up mental conditioning and he's never EVIL in this movie, he's just frustrated in a lifestyle he doesn't enjoy. So this movie does get pretty darn intense because you care for him.The directing and acting in this film is superb! David Fincher is considered to be one of the greatest filmmakers of our time and he definitely lives up to the hype in this movie! The way he uses narration, quick-cuts, and CGI-animated sequences is amazing! He makes the audience feel just as lost and confused as The Narrator does in this film because of these things and a mediocre director would've just played generic ""suspenseful music"" but Fincher adds style and panache to what could have been just a generic psychological thriller.Everyone does a solid job in this movie. From Edward Norton playing his role with cynicism and frustration, to Brad Pitt making Tyler Durden a surprisingly likable and charming character that is both cool and terrifying, and Helena Bonham Carter who makes her character quirky and kinda funny. All in all, the acting in this film is great!Lastly, this film brings up a lot of thought-provoking questions. Can you actually be your own man in a world this corporate? Do people really need to be ""freed"" from their jobs such as construction workers, waiters, cooks, taxi drivers, and teachers to do their own thing? And is there such thing as true freedom? These are all really thought-provoking questions and you'll definitely be thinking about these things after watching this film.Overall, this is an intelligent, intense film that really makes us think about our positions in life and because of that, I'm gonna give it a 10/10.",Fight Club
493,melodyso,Sick concept but left confused,6,8 October 2021,I just finished watching it. The message is powerful. The concept is refreshingly new. I'm surprised by how high quality it is considering it was made over 20 years ago. I love the neon cinematography.I don't quite get the 2 people in one theory tho. The explanation in the movie didn't quite convinced me. I'm a bit lost in the story development like the expansion of fight club and plan to explore all the buildings.I like the message tho. How lettinf go of everything sets you free. And the privilege of being alone and having the opportunity to chase one's dream.Okay. Gotta watch some explanation video on YouTube now.,Fight Club

495,cinemaniac2002,"A brilliant, searing indictment of urban disenchantment",8,22 December 2005,"FIGHT CLUB is a brilliant, searing indictment of urban disenchantment, disheartenment and finally, disenfranchisement. Peppered with sarcasm, it culminates in a testosterone driven explosion of cultural anger and resignation against the apathetic emptiness of consumerism.The book's author, Chuck Palahniuk, has indicated that the Marla character was the catalyst, and that without her, there would be no story. Yet, her significance is not fully recognized. That's his only ""complaint"" (though he doesn't verbalize it as such) on how his story was adapted to film.It's apparent from many reviews (such as the usually caustic Kenneth Turan) that, as in Kubrick's EYES WIDE SHUT, the message of this movie is getting lost. Just as EYES was not about sex or eroticism, FIGHT CLUB is not about violence. The violence is the result of the psychosis that consumes the protagonist. It's the vehicle used to demonstrate the ultimate isolation which causes him to disassociate himself into another identity. This movie is about social and cultural despair - the kind created by total consumerism and lack of purpose. What results is the solitary emptiness felt after realizing that ""things"" do not create happiness. Neither does having a ""well paying job,"" unless it also aligns with a sense of purpose. And when one has a ""career"" such as his, to render catastrophic car accidents to statistics for the sake of mitigating the damages of corporate America, well, what can be realistically expected? Anyone with a conscience would ""explode."" I know I would. Many people did not interpret the significance of that. Sadly, so many people are only regularly pabulum-fed typical Hollywood movies that they can't comprehend anything which departs from that overused formula. It's really sad that the novel's author, Chuck Palahniuk, screenwriter Jim Uhls and Director Fincher's vision, along with the wonderful characterization of Norton, Pitt, Bonham-Carter, MeatLoaf, and all of the other actors, was essentially all for naught on so many levels to the general public.A word about ""violence"":As with the Columbine tragedy, violence portrayed in films does not itself cause it. That particular tragedy was caused by parental neglect and irresponsibility.The insane and psychologically impaired will find their excuses to perpetrate violence, one way or another. It's still not a reason to jeopardize our first amendment rights. Nor is it a reason to try to attempt to placate people with pat answers to everything with generic films that say absolutely nothing.Still, some people may be too psychologically fragile to see through this. We all need to take responsibility for our own psyches. And art should not suffer at the hands of those who cannot intelligently perceive it. That's called suppressive Nazi Communism. And it's more dangerous than any person's individual threat - because it will affect us all. If we think people are apathetic and dangerously dis-associative now, just wait and see what happens if the Patriot Act is ratified and we lose our freedom of speech.",Fight Club
496,t-81966-84968,a brief evaluation,8,24 March 2020,"""Fight club"" is a dark, fast-paced movie that audiences don't have much time to think about, but unlike other films of its kind, each of David fincher's quick cuts serves a unique purpose besides keeping the audience from getting bored. The most thrilling thing about the whole movie is not what the movie is about, but how David fincher pushes the audience into the mind of the narrator ""me"", forcing the audience to feel ""me"" in the real world. It also opens up another possibility for storytelling in the film world",Fight Club

Don't expect it to be life changing though.",Fight Club
498,abum190,"Oh, Fight Club, you almost had me there",7,21 December 2006,"Movies like this are intensely frustrating. They get so close to the greatness mark, enticing you with how good they are, and then, at the last second, as if to spite you, they pull back and go for the Hollywood ending. And then you almost forget the brilliance of the rest of the movie. And any filmmaker that can come close to blocking out the memory of the great parts of his movie with just one crucial scene needs to be beat up. Or have his face shoved into Meat Loaf's man-titties.But I can mostly forgive David Fincher for leaving that copout ending simply because the rest of the movie is so darn good. This seems to stem mostly from Jim Uhls's close adaptation of Chuck Palahniuk's novel, a masterpiece of existentialist grit and wit. The film follows the book through most of its plot, incorporating much of Palahniuk's clever and bitter commentary on our material society into Edward Norton's jaded voice-over narration, which is unnerving for the five seconds it takes to get into the rhythm of the story. That's how good this plot is adapted- we can settle right into a rhythm and a dark tone that match those of the book perfectly.Edward Norton is the perfect choice for Fight Club's bored protagonist, as is Brad Pitt as Tyler, the enigmatic man that encourages Norton's character to join him in starting a fight club. In this club, men come to the basement of a bar and essentially beat each other up in an attempt to reach into the core of their manhood (the screenplay says it with far more deftness than I do). But it's about so much more than the fight club, as Norton's narrator soon discovers. Tyler has a plan to change the very fabric of their society and in the process changes the very fabric of Norton's character's life- more than he realizes at first.For the entire movie, Fight Club is about man's slavery to society and his escape from it. Unfortunately, the ending, which I won't spoil, takes an entirely different direction from this theme, and, as a result, takes the movie an entirely different direction from greatness. The ending of the book, however, is perfect, and if Fincher had stuck with the book through the entire first two hours of the movie, why couldn't he use the book's perfect ending for the last 10 minutes?It's still a must-see though- the ideas expressed by this movie are some everyone should hear and ponder. Plus, it's freaking good entertainment.",Fight Club

501,vbz,"""Clockwork Orange"" this ain't...",8,28 December 1999,"Is ""Fight Club"" an endorsement of faschism and violence, or merely a cautionary tale? None of the above. David Fincher's controversial fourth feature is simply put, one big joke, that the unsuspecting audience is subjected to, under the pretense of criticizing modern consumerism and materialism, as well as mourning the loss of true masculinity by today's y-chromosome bearers. Edward Norton, a renegade corporate slave, and Brad Pitt, a flamboyant, mysterious rebel, organize a cult-like establishment where men can turn to for venting of their innate aggression. Before long, the aggression is redirected toward the rest of the world.  The film spews much venom aimed, it seems, at human life in general, occasionally hitting the right spots, provoking the viewer to sport a wicked grin or two, but no more. Fincher's penchant for nihilism does not leave room for any other feelings when viewing these frequently pointless displays of brutality. In the end, especially in the light of the twisted, ""Sixth Sense""-inspired parallel ending which only strengthens the ""joke effect"", one gets the impression that the movie is trying to meddle in too many genres at once, while not being powerful or engaging enough to stand outside genre boundaries.",Fight Club
502,charlietuna,The best satire of 1999,9,25 March 2001,"Fincher picks up where he left off with ""The Game"" and finally hits his stride.  Whereas ""The Game"" was a movie trying desperately to be novel, ""Fight Club"" succeeded as being the best black comedic satire in several years.  While the mainstream critics once again missed the boat, getting side tracked by the movie's violence and neo-fascist imagery, Fincher, Norton, et al. sat back and laughed.  Easily the most original movie of the year, ""Fight Club"" illustrated how creative CGI can be in a movie that isn't a standard action adventure romp.  Splicing in Tyler Durden's image at key moments added to the richness of a story that was as tightly told as the ""Usual Suspects"".  ""Fight Club"" is a must see film, not for its gimmicks, action scenes, or visual effects, it is a must see film because it is funny. Funny???  Yes folks funny.  In-between the blood and vandalism there are classic lines about Generation X and in particular the ""X"" men as Durden quips:""Our generation has had no Great Depression, no Great War. Our war is a spiritual war. Our depression is our lives.""and""We are a generation of men raised by women. I'm beginning to wonder if another woman is what we really need.""If you sat in the theater taking this movie on its face as a film about a psychopath and his desire to re-order the world, I would hope you had problems with it.  If however, you got the joke and saw the film as slap in the face of an entire generation of weak, materialistic, and gullible kids looking for meaning between the pages of self help books and Saks Fifth Ave. you laughed along with me and recognized this a great film.",Fight Club

504,Lt_Coffey_182,"A fantastic political statement, not to mention a genius of a film",10,20 January 2005,"This is truly superb, one of the best films I have ever seen. This film has a very funny sense of humour, gritty fight scenes, clever concepts, a very clear political agenda and most importantly, one of the best endings of all time.David Fincher has seriously come on leaps and bounds since the disappointing Alien 3. As with Seven, his directing is spot on. It's dark and murky just like an underworld fight culture would be. At the same time, very good special effects are integrated within the film. The plot moves forward tremendously and sets the viewer up nicely for the ending. There is a fair amount of shock imagery in the film such as Norton's fight against Jared Leto. I don't mind violence in films but that particular scene is so relentless that it is hard to watch.Acting from everyone in this movie is superb. Norton gives his best performance after American History X. His delivery of dialogue is laden with sarcasm and is a joy to watch. The many character transformations he goes through is entirely believable. Pitt is also on top form, definitely better suited to playing edgier roles such as this and Twelve Monkeys to Meet Joe Black et al. Helena Bonham Carter is very sexy in this role, whilst at the same time, utterly repulsive. A very strong lead certainly does this film many favours. Meat Loaf is also a great character in the film who has a great rapport with Norton's character.A surprisingly psychological film, I would like to know what Freud would have thought of this film. This film actually got mentioned in one of my University lectures so it obviously has impressed the academic world somewhat. What is really fascinating is Tyler's anarchic solutions and how his ideology, whilst floored, does have its intentions. His Marxist beliefs are much more pure than those of Lenin in the Communist Russia era as Tyler even intends for himself to be insignificant within Project Mayhem. The relationship between Pitt and Norton is great to watch as it leads to great character development and adds to the humour of the film.Anyone in to suspense, black comedy, psychological thrillers or action will love this film. It is definitely one of the best films of the decade and has a massive following that will love it forever. Brad Pitt has never been so good and his performance as Tyler Durden is now legendary. Fight Club has clever concepts to spare and oozes style, offering much more than entertainment.",Fight Club
505,aptpupil79,probably the most misunderstood film of 1999,10,3 March 2004,"probably the most misunderstood film of 1999. those who misunderstood it said it was violence for violence's sake or that it was animalistic and brutal without purpose...stuff like that. those people p*** me off. the film is actually very philosophical (though flawed) and lends itself to much more interpretation and analysis than any other contemporary action film (with the matrix being the one exception). stylistically it's a modern noir tale - shot almost entirely indoors or at night, an underdeveloped look that deepens all the dark areas, the voice-over narration, the beginning shows the end, and there's the femme fatale. at the same time it doesn't work solely within the mores of film noir. from the very beginning it differentiates itself with a very active camera, visual effects and the like. what results is a fresh looking film that may one day have a name like ""neo noir."" a great soundtrack. pitt and norton are really good and well cast for their parts. i loved this film the first couple times i saw it, but i don't think it stands the test of time as well as i originally thought. seven and the game (also from fincher) are more likely to hold up to repeated viewings. seven is filmed just as well, if not better, and the game is a bit more solidly grounded philosophically...but that's primarily because its philosophy is vastly more simple. fight club is more ambitious and, i suppose, should get points for that. at any rate, fight club will stand up against the ""american beauty""s and ""matrix""s of its time. all those films, at their core, fundamentally question our lives and contemporary society, much as douglas sirk and rainer fassbinder did in their time.

506,RoBiN_SinGH211221,"""The First Rule Of Fight Club Is: You Do Not Talk About Fight Club. The Second Rule Of Fight Club Is: You Do Not Talk About Fight Club.""",10,30 September 2020,"Fight Club is one of those movies that hits the spot without missing an inch of it. The nameless narrator (Edward Norton) is an insomniac office worker who lives a materialistic life. From the very beginning the movie comments on the capitalist nature of society by portraiting how consumerism moves the world, but is unable to give relief in the end. Flipping through catalogues of new furnite for his apartment were the narrator's only personality trait. To fight against his insomnia he starts attending to support groups. By lying to people, pretending he has conditions he does not have, the narrator finds relief - the emotional acceptance he finds in the support groups is enough to allow him to sleep at night. The emotional complexity of the character is nothing unrealistic. David Fincher makes a subtle, yet clear, comment on the nature of materialist societies where no one really listens to each other nor care about each other. The system doesn't care about anyone, the distance between people - especially enhanced by how they function in the capitalist world - is a major plot point. However, when the narrator is finds someone who's a faker just like him he loses his emotional escape - "" Her lie reflected my lie. Suddenly, I felt nothing. I couldn't cry, so once again I couldn't sleep"".Shortly after Tyler Durden (Brad Pitt) is introduced into the story, the main character loses everything he valued. Deprived of his possessions he seeks solace in the company of a man who is the polar opposite of what he is. If the narrator is a worker who's way too worried about his condo and his job, Tyler is a freewheeling soapmaker who couldn't care less about all those things. The contrast between them is clear; Tyler refuses any consumerist logic from the narrator whilst making he see how futile is the lifestyle he was leading - ""Right. We are consumers. We're the by-products of a lifestyle obsession."" The characters here portraid are so different because one of them is free, while the other is not. Tyler, in a nihilistic way, helps the narrator realize that his existence is meaningless enough - something that is clearly displayed in the capitalist world - that all they can do is giving up everything. The self-destruction promoted by the Fight Club is ironically what allows the narrator - as well as many other frustrated men - to find solace in their mundane life. Little by little the narrator is stripping himself off his previous beliefs about job, about behavior and the value of things. It's interesting to note that the narrator doesn't quit his job immediately, picturing how hard it is actually to cut ties with the system - he eventually does though.Many subtopics are discussed through the movie. We see the narrator and Tyler, now living together, talking about many things. They talk about how both had an absent father, how both lacked a sense of direction in life at some point and were told to follow the common sense - ""He says, 'get a job'. So, I'm 25, I call again and say, 'now what?' He says, 'I dunno. Get married"". The nature of the system we live in tells us what to do since the moment we're born, while both of them agree on that, they also agree that this is all a great waste of time. It's important to notice though that both them had no significant connections with other people, especially with women as Tyler comments - ""We're a generation of men raised by women. I'm wondering if another woman is really the answer we need"".As the club grows the movie delves even deeper in those reflections about what really matters in life - ""Advertising has us chasing cars and clothes, working jobs we hate so we can buy s**t we don't need"". Tyler becomes the source of inspiration for everyone who attends to the fight club; everyone is much more like the narrator, but they're striving to be more like him. At some point, Tyler decides that the club is meant to be something bigger - what he would call Project Mayhem. While the original Fight Club was something kept like a secret idealized to give some sort of freedom, through self-destruction, to its members, Project Mayhem is about declaring a fight against the system. The frustrated collective consciousness was the straw that broke the camel's back - ""We've all been raised on television to believe that one day we'd all be millionaires, and movie gods, and rock stars. But we won't. And we're slowly learning that fact. And we're very, very pi**ed off"". However, the narrator starts to slowly go against what Tyler was meaning to do - kinda of recalling a bit of his past self and a sort of respect for the authority of society - and when this happen it's the moment the movie reaches its climax.The genius of the movie is displayed when we discover that Tyler Durden and the narrator are the same person, they have always been the same person. Due to his declining mental health and his rather meaningless life, he created an alter-ego - someone capable of manifesting everything he wasn't as a system abiding person. The contrast created by Tyler's different personalities is amazing to watch as the truth unfolds; and the ambivalence created when we discover the truth about Tyler Durden is even more marvelous. This movie portraits very well how a person can reach the extremes of their mind in a system that overlooks the relevance of your very existence - when you become just a number, just a braindead member of society, having your hopes and wishes constantly ignored. In the end Tyler recovers his sanity only to see that his actions can't be reverted - so he only stands by and watches. The final scene is beautiful; what could be better than watching the system crumbling before your eyes while ""Where is my Mind"" plays? This movie is a masterpiece and it is so entrancing because of how real it is - in the end the movie shows many things we know and think but tend to keep hidden. It is provocative, funny and thrilling and most importantly: It is so damn real. The plot aged perfectly and I don't think it is going to get old so soon - this movie is a must watch.",Fight Club

Thankfully I have one friend who'd already watch it and literally made watch too. The result was obvious (This film causes these reactions). I felt it was too short, it kept wanting more and more. The way the story is told is unique. But that is not all. The script, the acting, the photography, etc.(I can go on and on). This film is definitely a masterpiece.The teasers show only small portions of this film, making it seem like a mindless fighting movie. This is not the case. The story is about a furniture obsessed guy, who had insomnia. He decided to form a club in which he could unleash all of his energy and finally be able to caught some sleep. But after a while, things went out of control, and nothing was what it seemed.People often tell me that I am too picky when it comes to movies. That pretty much nothing impresses me, that I don't like popular films etc. But after watching this kind of film it is difficult to be impressed by the average film.This movie set a new personal mark in this genre.

Brad Pitt & Edward Norton pull out all the stops as two men who start up fight clubs as a new form of therapy.  I would normally talk about the plot here, but it's so hard to find where to begin.  The story takes so many twists and turns that the usual person would be completely lost, but they're not.  In a way, this is one of those movies that makes even the most incompetent human being feel smart... which is good.  I used to get into fights with my family about this movie; my Mom was outraged by the amount of violence and vandalism, and all I replied was, ""Hey, you went to therapy, it takes different strokes to quit being so screwed up.""  Of course, I took martial arts and knew about the healing power of fighting and how it always released my stress.  Apparently, Mom didn't get it.Everything about this movie is awesome: the script, the characters, the acting, the special effects (the opening credits and scene showing how the Narrator's apartment was destroyed were so cool), everything.

Don't get me wrong, those movies can have an appeal of their own, but isn't something I was on the edge of my seat to see.  Well, we had company one night and they had brought over Fight Club.  I felt almost obligated to watch it, so I did.  I was elated to find I was completely wrong and had totally misjudged this movie...it was awesome!Brad Pitt was fabulous in this movie as crazy, over the top, yet charismatic Tyler Durden.  I haven't seen him perform this well since 12 Monkeys. Edward Norton, however, has always impressed me...even in movies I didn't really care for.  That being said, it was no surprise to me that his role as the bored, nameless Narrator was absolutely fantastic.  Edward Norton is incredible...going from a man ""going through the motions"" of a typical ""yuppy life"" to letting loose and ridding himself of the frustrations he feels through his new found ""support group"": Fight Club.Fight Club is an incredible journey into madness and destruction that draws you into its clutches and doesn't let go until the very last scene.

Other than this we're looking at a film made for awkward teenage boys who can't watch it anyway cause it's mostly rated 18. It's the slightly older awkward boys who sadly do get to see it and end up slobbering over it and writing rave reviews about it.

514,smithpaulusmc,Rule Number One,8,24 November 2019,"Most critics claim, and I agree, that modern American psychological film started in 1999 with David Fincher's Fight Club. Prior to this, artistic visualizations of the psyche and man's place on the earth were left to the realms of science fiction or simply inaccessible to mass audiences. Fight Club delivers the story of a nameless narrator (Edward Norton) whose dronesome existence has left him hollow, only finding meaning by frequenting a multitude of inapplicable support groups. What begins as a look through the window into the soul of the modern man, crashes into a tale of revolution against everything normal.
Fight Club finds its feet early on through the fantastic characters played by Edward Norton and Brad Pitt. The duo is dynamic, clashing in their personalities but similar in their goals. Additionally, Fight Club offers a tantalizing pace that whizzes between bare knuckle boking bouts, near head on car crashes, and plots to take over the city. Everything about this work screams ""don't look away for a second or you might miss the whole thing.""
20 years later, Fincher's Fight Club remains the hallmark beacon of exemplary editing, carefully crafted story-telling, and powerful plot twist. Is urges the audience to question the filmmakers' motives in every shot. Knowing the story's surprise ending does not spoil the fun, but breathes new life into the story, allowing you to savor each frame anew.",Fight Club
515,Paul-103,Wasn't impressed,6,16 November 1999,"After reading through some of the reviews, it's obvious I'm in the severe minority.  I waited for this movie.  I even looked forward to it.  I've really liked Edward Norton's performances lately, but Brad has been missing big time.  Since Kalifornia has been my favorite Brad movie so far, I was hoping he would recapture some of the full characterization he gave in his acting in that movie.  Alas, I still see no power in Brad's acting ability. Edward Norton was good, but was limited by the character.  Didn't have as much punch as I was hoping.  Kind of intriguing and kind of silly.  Not my favorite movie of the year.",Fight Club
516,Q-Man,A movie that you will think about long after you have seen it.,7,5 August 2000,"I rented Fight Club with reservations. I thought it was a film about a bunch of guys beating each other senseless, but the reviews were good. The film was much more than I expected and held my interest from beginning to end. It is a movie that you will think about long after you have seen it. I would have originally rated it a ""6"", but a week later I raised that to a ""7"". I was tempted to go higher, but it has been months since I have seen it, and I know there were parts where I thought ""oh, come on, this is bordering on ridiculous"". It is a great commentary on modern society told with lots of insight and a surprising amount of humor. I didn't expect a ""surprise"" ending, but started to suspect that things were not what they seemed to be. Now when people ask me if I have seen any good movies recently, the Fight Club is the first one I recommend. Although I have no desire to be beaten to a pulp or to do that to anyone else, I could certainly identify with many of the ideas expressed by Edward Norton's character.",Fight Club
517,tj_director,Fincher.,9,28 February 2000,"After watching 'Fight Club' my mind was made up that David Fincher is definately one of the best directors around, but I can only use that term lightly, as I've only seen this and Se7en, Alien 3 doesn't count as i was too young when I saw it, he also did an Aerosmith video and anything concerning them scores in my book. Anyway, I watched this film in a cinema at an empty matinee, but I really wished I had watched it with friends because it's one of those films that deserves to be talked about afterwards, many people will be intrigued(?) by the ideas in he film, I wasn't as I already had that way of thinking, but this film will open many people's minds. I can't put all the kudos on Fincher, because as with every film it's the writer that makes it, and I read the excellent script (spec and shooting) by Jim Uhls. (it's based on a book by C.Palanuik) and it's good to see that the film hasn't changed a great deal from the paper.The start of the film is a really, really good credit sequence, the soundtrack is excellent, and it got me really pumped up, and i expected more adrenaline moments like this later, but they never came, and that's my personal fault with that 1st sequence. Anyway had I read that the film is very good 1st half, but got stupid 2nd, so I just sat there expecting to take things with a pinch of salt, but I never felt dissapointed, and I never got bored like I thought I would. This film kept me interested the whole time, which is unusual for me in films without a point A to B storyline, like the 'will he get the treasure type' story. What I like about the directing, and this is what I like about Fincher and his style - he's Fresh, he isn't a Follow-the-Leader type, he does things in slightly different way, the credits going the opposite way in Se7en sum him all up for me. Fight Club also stays visually interesing throughout, and the imagery has stayed in my head since I watched it months ago. I'm just dissapointed it didn't get any major award nominations, It's really a film that deserves the praise, American Beauty got nominated with it's dark and sexual representation of American Suburbia, which is something the Acadamy stays away from, so why couldn't Fight Club have one, I personally found that Fight Club had a more positive message than AB (PS I don't hate A.Beauty) Fight Club's the kind of film i'd take an under-17 to watch, as it has something to say, and could teach some people a thing or two.
I know a lot of people who thought that Fight Club was a film just about fighting, I knew before watching it wasn't and I hope that's not what it'll be remembered for, and it should be a film that is remembered. Fincher has 2 modern-day clasics under his belt, and that takes some doing.",Fight Club
518,diztorted,A near life experience,10,23 April 2001,"You enter into this film...and what do you see? ""Your power animal"". Mischief, Mayhem, Soap, is not just a slogan, it's not just a part of a fad philosophy, it is a complete different way of life. This film is not for the weak-minded, or for those who live their lives deep inside their happy commercial, consumer life; but for those who are ready for the change. It is a message for all of us saying ""I understand you"". Acknowledge you are alive by self-destruction rather than rot yourself between shallow stuff that will only bring you temporary joy. By seeing this film, at the end you will be scarred with lye, your eyes opened wide and reborn as someone different, someone else.In his previous films, we could see how David Fincher sets us through the mind of the mad men, the murky world of John Doe, the memories of Victor Van Orton. But now, it is something completely different, we can see how the brain of the narrator works and how the brain cells act as a gun is stuck inside his mouth. This is only the beginning.Watching this film was really a ""Near life Experience"", I felt how the world of Tyler Durden invaded me and I became not only a voyeur watching how Fight Club worked, but also a member of Fight Club itself. All the anger, the frustration and the loneliness were washed away by a new Nihilist philosophy that is hard to break. And after all this is Marla Singer, the symbol of the unexpected, a person who is free in much ways the rest of us are not, because she's not afraid to die. Some of us would like to be like that, but we are afraid.I was afraid of writing about this film and not being able to really tell what I really feel about it, but after all...What should I care for what any of you would have to say! ""You have to give up"" There it is, I said it.",Fight Club

Edward Norton plays a fantastic role in this violent thriller and Brad Pitt  also comes across well but the storyline lacks clarity and explanation. I am very surprised that this reached number 29 in the top 250 films as there are far more exciting and better developed movies out there and the fact that it bettered my personal favourite Terminator 2 was a real shock. Nevertheless, I would give this film 6 out of 10.",Fight Club
520,dukevega,One of the All-Time Best,9,2 December 2007,"Being a movie fan such as myself, I am always hard-pressed to answer when asked to name my top five or ten favorite movies. This movie is always one of the first ones out of my mouth.Some have complained about the violence and possible suggestion becoming a terrorist is okay, but they are missing the point. This movie is about defining yourself in your terms rather than letting others do it for you. The fighting is about making you focus on what's real, much like when Tyler swerves in front of a truck. With the prospect of your own mortality facing you, you realize what truly matters and what does not.With such a powerful message delivered in such an unconventional way, I am still amazed it got made, but I am glad it did. This is by far one of the most thought-provoking films I have ever seen. If you have yet to see this film, by all means see it AS SOON AS YOU CAN. The time you spend watching it will be some of the most well spent in your entire life.",Fight Club
521,pickle-92642,You never forget the first time you watch Fight Club.,10,1 July 2021,"This movie is absolutely amazing. It's got a perfect plot, perfect cast, perfect script, perfect twists, perfect ending, perfect everything. This is definitely David Fincher's best, the only other answer I'll accept when asked what his best film is is Se7en. Anything else, and you're just trying to be different. Anyways, I cannot stress enough how much I like this movie. It's my 4th favorite at the moment, and it has defo earned that spot. Once again, being a 16 year old dude, I was destined to love this. But weren't we all?I've already broken the first two rules, but this needs to be talked about: This is possibly the greatest twist in cinematic history. I did NOT see it coming at all, and when it happened I was shocked ngl. The way it was executed was perfect. It's one of those twists when it subtly hints at it the whole movie and when it finally reveals it you're still shocked.This movie is just made so well. No wonder it's one of the most cult films ever made. It's just too perfectly made, and it's stays with you for a while. Definitely will forever be one of my favorites.",Fight Club

523,takatomon,guilty pleasure (missing the point?),9,18 November 2001,"I must admit that when i first saw this movie i loved it up until the ""liposuction"" scene. I thought that it was simply there for shock value until i saw it again and came to the conclusion that every review i've read is missing the point of who Tyler Durden really is. Everyone takes the story at face value, but maybe Tyler is really the devil. (security cameras don't lie... hint hint) Most people seem a bit too enamored with Brad Pitt for my taste. He's a perfect choice to play Tyler I feel because he is so easy to hate in this movie. It's sad that Ed Norton doesn't get his props in the movie. (Brad this and Brad that blahblahblah) It is Ed's deadpan narration and odd mix of antisocial-empathy that are central to the movie for me.The scathing sarcasm is a perfect foil for the films redeeming social commentary which is unfortunately offset by it's appealing to the audience's basest voyeuristic desires. (give 'em what they want) If anything this film was designed to test the boundaries of good taste (if you see it on VHS you'll miss the worst line of dialogue ever: ""I want to have your abortion."") If that isn't purient pandering... i don't know what is. Don't get me wrong, this film delivers comedy in spades. Cornelius' ""power animal"" is hysterical as is his revelation regarding Marla or Chloe's take on the famous line ""medication time"". The film is filled with sly homages to some of Hollywood's greatest films ever: Bladerunner, One flew over the cuckoo's nest, Harold and Maude, Planet of the apes, 1984, Room with(out) a view, The last Emperor, and alot of the late Stanley Kubrik's films. I'm a bit surprised that it made the 30's in the top 250 as i don't think of it as even slightly mainstream, but 30,000+ people liked it. I'll admit i like it too, parts of it intensely. The love story part of the movie is both funny and sad at the same time. It was really a treat to see Helena Bonham Carter drop her prim and proper victorian persona and British accent and get down and dirty. She does a good job of being both beautiful and repulsive at the same time, may she never be typecast again! I give a recommendation based on it's beautiful yet ugly cinematography, outrageous comedy, unique love story and it's mostly missed message: ""The world is being destroyed and we're all to blame."" It's too sad that the world just doesn't get it, but then again... John Lennon couldn't save the world either.",Fight Club

(as opposed to action adventure violence where the hero or anti-hero never gets a scratch and the bad guys can't shoot the broad side of a barn) to me... the message of the movie is that if you really like it... then perhaps you are part of the problem. i bought the dvd and now i can't quit sneezing... hmm.",Fight Club

It was as if this is the only movie to have a plot twist in it, and it's a plot twist that's not even that surprising to begin with because we're so focused on the excessive violence from start to finish by the time the plot twist hits we just don't care about the characters anymore because of how dreadful the movie is as a whole...All in all Fight Club is just a movie designed for men who think fighting and violence is cool.

528,axsmashcrushallthree,Huh?,5,27 May 2006,"I have been attempting to watch IMDb's top-rated movies for some time, and I rented ""Fight Club"" with anticipation. I had breezed over the Palahniuk book and had been intrigued with the subject matter - I was looking forward to seeing how a capable cast and director would turn out the material into a film that was so highly rated here. Would this be a bullseye like ""The Goodfather"" or an overrated episodic fable like ""Shawshank Redemption""?Much like the subject matter, the film hits you right in the face from the beginning. The Narrator is on a quest for understanding. He initially explores this through encounter groups that challenge his ability to express vulnerability and to get in touch with his feelings. His quest remains elusive, and he meets the main female character Marla in the groups. She is also struggling. On a business trip flight, he meets Tyler, a soap salesman. His relationships with Marla and Tyler takes us through the rest of the film.I will not attempt to describe the plot and evolution of the characters - this has been done quite well by others without exposing spoilers. I will say that this movie walks a veritable tightrope in the manner of Robert Rodriguez, Quentin Tarantino, and Hung Kam-Bo. The first half of the film is dynamic, with tight crisp direction, cinematography, and dialogue - the characters are fleshed out and you believe them. Unfortunately, it begins to lose its grip about halfway through. The sense of a coherent ideology interweaved with complex character relationships is overwhelmed as director Fincher goes to the well too often with gratuitous violence. While violence is certainly an extension of the ideology here, the overuse of it convolutes the message. There is also a ""surprise"" that alters the viewer's perception, but it is carried out so implausibly and with such obviousness that the framework is further weakened. Near the end of the film, I began to become bored with the proceedings and had to restrain myself from fast-forwarding to the end. Much has been alluded to here about the ending. Strong symbolism is certainly evident and the ending makes for a great recapitulative exclamation point. But, for a movie that is rated by viewers as the #33 greatest movie of all time, it ain't that great - the ending even becomes obvious as the two competing ""characters"" pull out all stops in advance. Movies such as ""Public Enemy"", ""La Bete Humaine"", ""White Heat"", ""Donnie Darko"", ""The Matrix"", and even the passive symbolism of ""Castaway"" made a greater impression on me.I found ""Fight Club"" to 1/2 of a very good film, but this is ultimately unsatisfying. And what about the film's point of masculine evolution? The message of an enlightenment through aggressive clanship in hand with passive isolation has been explored in countless films to much better effect, including ""American Me"", ""Lord of the Flies"", ""Brassed Off"" (yes!), and particularly ""A Clockwork Orange"". The latter film is probably the best exemplification of this idea.Overall, ""Fight Club"" doesn't contain enough to build a true ideology, mythology, or any real lasting impression for me. Its points become too obvious and blatant to give it any more than a 5.",Fight Club
529,ShitizSays,My all time Favorite movie of all time,10,5 October 2011,"Why I like this movie? I don't know but right from the first scene it just keeps me with it and i want to watch it till end. I love everything about this film; editing, acting, direction, cinematography, sound and everything. Brad Pitt truly emerges as champion of this film when Edward Norton leaves you with open mouth. Based on a novel by Chuck Pahlunick, this movie has everything that i wanted my movie to had if i ever made one. The reason why i love this psycho thriller movie is its fast paced story movement and camera work. My favorite scene is when Norton is hugged by a fat man and inner conflicts of his mind are going in the narration, it is awesomely pictured and acted upon. You get interested in the plot with every moving second and feel like you have become a pat of their world.A must watch for every one. Truly recommended.",Fight Club
530,Castor-5,A Clockwork Orange and Taxi Driver of the 90s,10,16 October 1999,"My theory has already been proven.  A film so original, with solid directing and outstanding acting will be judged poorly by the critics.  Some moviegoers will complain about it's excessive violence and how it seems to have no point.  They will also complain that the ones that like or love it must be very sick minded people who you should stay far away from.  This happened when A Clockwork Orange and Taxi Driver were originally released in theaters.  Look where they are now?Some already are considering this a classic, and as the years go by it will be recommended every time you want to find a good old release at a video store.  And why shouldn't it?  Everything about it is original.  The story deals with a lot more than fight club and has one of the smartest screenplays written since Pulp Fiction.  Edward Nortan and Brad Pitt both give the performances of their careers.  There are also so many memeorable scenes in the film such as the scene in which Edward Nortan literally beats the living hell out of himself in front his boss and when Pitt meets the owner of the bar they are holding their fight club meetings under every night.  Some of the most original filming you will have seen in a long time also give the film an adrenaline rush while you watch it.Some will walk out of the film getting ready to throw punches.  Some will want to puke from all the disturbing images and violence throughout.  But, like Pulp Fiction, whether you like it or dislike it, there's not much you can say that's wrong with it.  The film is obviously not for everyone, a lot more for guys then anything else since they feel more hatred to the subjects brought up in the film.  But a film so original and so amazing on every level you can't go wrong on the caliber of how great this film really is. So watch for the weeks to come as the film will be blamed for violence that goes on around our country, seems that a lot of the best films released have gone through the same routine.  10/10",Fight Club
531,sunilaas,FABULOUS,9,5 August 2020,Another master piece from David fincher.. fabulous & joyful movie..Brad Pitt he steal the show in every scene..and the plot twist mind-blowing..a must watch movie,Fight Club
532,compi24,"Review of ""Fight Club""",10,21 July 2011,"Ahh here it is. My review of David Fincher's classic adaption of Chuck Palahniuk's transgressional fiction master work. ""Fight Club"" tells the story of a corporate drone (Norton) who (like many) is displeased with his life. He, in turn, forms a 'fight club' with Tyler Durden (Pitt) a soap maker to escape from this sedative lifestyle. Now right off the bat, if this movie were shown to the original pioneers of film (i.e. Porter, Chaplin, Capra) I can safely say that upon completion of the film they would promptly scream, yell, cry, and then explode. . . .maybe. They would definitely be appalled by what they would see. However, this does not make ""Fight Club"" a bad film. For, film, like literature, can take on many forms and eventually evolve over time. Though the themes displayed throughout the film are definitely strange and at times shocking, they are also peculiarly thought-provoking and at times pragmatic. The movie's messages on defiance and nihilism are deeply rooted within it's very intelligently written script. The dialogue is hilarious and at times disturbingly provocative. Brad Pitt and Edward Norton are two intensely talented actors, and seeing them work together on screen is really entertaining. Though anyone who watches this movie will walk out of the film talking about Brad Pitt's unforgettable portrayal of Tyler Durden. Pitt's obvious dedication to the role, paired with the near-perfectly written script he was given, makes for a character that I will quote many a time to come. Another aspect that I found particularly unique was the cinematography. I found that Photographic Director Jeff Cronenweth did a noteworthy job with the visuals of this movie. He really succeeded in using lighting to accentuate just how dismally somnolent the narrator's life is. I also felt that the use of lighting towards the end of the film was also very aesthetic. As for direction, David Fincher is . . . .well he's David Fincher. The guy really knows how to put a film together. In the end, ""Fight Club"" is a dark, dreary, appalling, hilarious film that I am glad to call a classic piece of American culture.",Fight Club

535,Sam_Gray,"stylish, but a hollow, perhaps even hypocritical film (spoilers)",7,24 February 2000,"Let me start my saying that I do like Fight Club in the overall sense, if only for its stylish direction (on the technical side, at least) and occasional sense of humor.But there are loads of things wrong with the film, too.  While it picks a valid theme, that being the general aimlessness and cynicism of Generation X, its conclusions are uncertain and its execution is all wrong.  The entire film seems to support nihilism and self-destruction as an answer to the problem of philosophical and spiritual emptiness; in other words, the film (particularly Tyler) seems to promote embracing that emptiness.  But then, the whole movie jumps ship in the last few minutes and ends ambiguously, on the one hand seeming to suggest such nihilism is wrong (the narrator ""defeats"" Tyler), but on the other hand seeming to confirm the rest of the movie (the narrator and Marla stand together and watch, with seeming contentment, as the bombs go off).  So, in the end, the movie isn't brave enough to make any real statement at all.Furthermore, if Fight Club IS criticizing materialism, than it's insanely hypocritical (""The things you own end up owning you, but please buy the DVD"").  And, if one wants to criticize trendiness, as this movie again may or may not be doing, don't include a techno/industrial soundtrack.And I have to say, I have never, at least before this film, seen a movie that is degrading to both men and women.But, I have to say, reviewer Durden7 is right about one thing.  Fight Club is a movie that is generally going to draw people that are predisposed to liking it, anyway.  But, this is NOT the definitive film of this age, although it might be the definitive film of those that are satisfied being defined by film.Nevertheless, I do recommend Fight Club, at least for a rental.  I've got to admit, it is kind of cool.  Just go into it aware that you're not getting style over substance, you're getting style rather than substance. 7/10P. S. American Beauty covers a similar theme, if with an older subject, and does it better (and without going Marxist).",Fight Club
536,dreamingescapist,You are not!,9,21 July 2019,"'Fight Club' remains a pop-cultural phenomenon (both, the movie and the novel), and it is as relevant as it was upon its release. Initially disliked by the studio, and underperforming in the box office, 'Fight Club' later gained recognition and cult following. It is not an easy movie - it sows confusion and discomfort. It is hard to understand what is the film's real message - it is clearly anti-establishment, anti-commercial, anti-advertisement. Yet, it is a big-budgeted Hollywood movie with big-name stars and product placement. In that, I see, lie the genius of this movie - a real rebel takes all the corporate money that they can get and turn it into the piece of art against the same corporate world. Being an A-category Hollywood production doesn't devalue the message of 'Fight Club', it actually magnifies it. Besides, David Fincher's visual language (that is perfect for 'Fight Club') needs big budgets.Is 'Fight Club' a perfect movie? Definitely not, there are its own flaws and a couple of moments that can defy the logic, but we are mainly here for the philosophy of the movie. And we love what we see. We can't deny that we love this film only because we all have had our own Tyler Durdenish thoughts (and daydreams).",Fight Club

Consumerism is not about what you consume but it is you who are consumed by where you live, what you wear, and what you buy. Gradually you become nothing. How can you escape from it? Well, just start Fight Club.The nameless protagonist, the Narrator, is mentally exhausted, suffers insomnia, on the verge of collapse. A remedy he happens to find is touring of support groups. Joining those groups feigning illness is already getting away from morality. Then one day, he meets Tyler.Fight Club started when Tyler asked the Narrator to hit him ""as hard as you can"". The two are getting drawn to the aimless fighting. They find pain and bruises exhilarating. Soon after some other rough guys join them to share their fun. Tyler mocks gym-goers, saying ""Self-improvement is masturbation. Now, self-destruction."" And the enthusiasm of self-destruction grows into a cult.Fincher shows things in a persistent first-person view. It feels like the camera focus is precisely on the Narrator's mind. He even sometimes talks to us viewers directly. I won't do any spoiler, but this is the type of film that will seem completely differently on rewatch.I wouldn't say I love the film very much. It is full of frustration. The explosive energy seeks the outlet without success. It challenges conventional dramatic structure.

Both characters, each being one person in general, with each version representing a different form of themselves, with completely different personalities, and furthermore different out looks on life. The nameless narrator (Norton)reprents a typical person who needs the recognition of materialism to define himself, feeling a rational fear of death, and a wondering notion of his own value in life. Tyler Durdon (Pitt)is a much more fascinating character, for he is the very opposite of Norton's character. He is completely free of all the limitations most people allow themselves to be consumed by, despite in an ironic manner being in a physial form that shows just how perfect he comes off as.He doesn't consider anyone in existence to be special, including himself, saying that nobody is defined by anything, ""Your not your car, your house or your suit', these very words prove his release from those limitations. Unfortunately his desire for everyone to feel that same form of release escalates beyond the formation of Fight Club, and into the evolution of project Mayhem, a much wider form of release than fight club. The true initiative itself is to create absolute chaos, in order for others to be truly set free. He's not talking murder, or sacrifice, despite there being several brokems eggs for his omlete. Director David Fincher, ""The Game"", and ""Seven"" has demonstrated his unique talent through this uniquely isolated character Tyler, brining out the very independence that he stands for. In fact both characters, since each representing two different sides of one coin resemble the complete positive and negative quatlties of that very coin. ortons nameless character is the very negativity his character is, physicallyand mentally drained by the pain of his insomnia, looking for an escape. Pitts character Tyler is everything the narrator wants to be, fit, confident, and completely free of limits. I'm not proclaiming Tyler to be a God, because lets face it, based about his opinion about the man upstairs, he really doesn't care. In that creates a form of envy for the narrator, being the fact that he created that very personality without knowing it. Tyler is just the person our narrator wants to be. It's like Tyler said, ""People everyday imagine themselves in better ways"". This very concept is appiled in both physical and mental aspects, and i commend Pitts stance on that very issue. We always want to be better at something, even if it isn't an insecurity, or even an issue of lacking confidence, but merely our unending desire to be better. ""Fight Club"" itself is one of those films that simply uses it's form of specific clarification to manipulate it's charismatic chaos, as well as bringing several concepts of human nature, that include both the relaese and restraint amongst ourselves.",Fight Club
541,brainofj72,A Modern Masterpiece,9,27 September 2005,"""This is your life and it's ending one minute at a time."" Do you ever feel like that? Do you ever feel bored with life? Frustrated with your job and the people around you? Do you ever feel like you've wasted your precious time on this Earth? Do you ever feel like you can't feel at all? Well, ""Fight Club"" is the movie for you.Many (who haven't seen the film) seem to be under the impression that ""Fight Club"" is a big, dumb, brutish, excessively violent guy movie about some kind of brutal kick-boxing club. This couldn't be further from the truth.Here's the real plot: Our unnamed protagonist and narrator (Norton) is a man who hates his job and everything around him (Sound familiar?). He has a crippling case of insomnia which he can't seem to cure. He is a zero in a vast sea of electronic digits. Then he meets the enigmatic Tyler Durden (Pitt), a hip, confident funk song of a man; in other words: everything our narrator isn't. After a rather unfortunate event, he comes to live with Durden, and the two inadvertently become the founders of a club for disaffected men to take out their frustrations on each other. But eventually, Durden injects his own twisted ideals into ""fight club"" and it becomes something much larger and important. It also becomes a nightmare for our protagonist. By the way, wondering why the narrator goes unnamed through the entire film? My guess would be to stress the impersonality of the modern age.At first glance, it may seem like these men hurt each other because they are nothing but raging piles testosterone with nothing better to do. While this may play a minor role in their actions, the main reason they fight is because they are victims. Victims of the age of computers, credit cards, and Starbucks. They fight because they feel nothing and they want, long, and need to feel something, anything. They relish inflicting pain. They relish receiving pain. They relish the fact that they can feel. But don't be fooled and think that this is a depressing, unrelentingly serious film about deprived individuals; ""Fight Club"" is as much a comedy as a drama or a thriller. I actually found myself raucously guffawing on more than several occasions throughout the 2+ hour running time.The film is beautifully photographed and masterfully directed by David Fincher, who drenches the film in his wonderfully original and fantastically stylish approach, but the style is not a gimmick to cover up a shoddy film; it works. It works perfectly. Fincher has always had a strong visual flair, and ""Fight Club"" may be his most aesthetically interesting film yet. The film also features some fantastic acting, principally from Edward Norton and Brad Pitt. Norton gives a dead-on performance as the frustrated every-man, and Pitt gives a very spirited performance as Durden, who may just be the biggest celluloid badass since Clint Eastwood's ""The Man With No Name"". Helena Bonham Carter is also notable as the only prominent female character in the film.Another strong contributing element of the movie is the fun soundtrack. The film's instrumental hip-hop/techno score, courtesy of The Dust Brothers, really enhances the experience; I can't imagine the movie without it. And as a personal plus, the film uses two of my favorite songs of all time: ""Goin' Out West"" by Tom Waits and ""Where Is My Mind?"" by Pixies (which are both utilized perfectly).But what is probably the most fascinating aspect of ""Fight Club"" is the way it dissects the psyche of a mentally unsound individual. But you will know what I'm talking about when you see the movie, I won't spoil it for you.Also, don't be fooled by the critics who condemn the film for being overly violent and graphic. I quite simply do not understand this claim. There are a few brutal fight scenes and maybe two gun-wounds. It is not excessive or graphic. It is necessary to the plot.""Fight Club"" is not about action. ""Fight Club"" is not about convention. ""Fight Club"" is not about brutality. ""Fight Club"" is about the adverse effects of our modern dystopia. ""Fight Club"" is about enlightenment. But most importantly, ""Fight Club"" is about rebellious, impeccable, and thoroughly entertaining film-making. ""Fight Club"" is a modern masterpiece.9.5/10",Fight Club

I like David fincher style with the cuts and the comedic sense of directing it looks like a tamed Tarantino style as it is more realistic.I loved the performance of Edward Northon as always but I did not see brad do anything remarkable.",Fight Club
543,k-09931,A brutal film about capitalism with two incredible leads.,8,24 March 2020,"This suspense movie was really good. Edward Norton, Brad Pitt, and the rest of the cast did an excellent job in this movie. The plot to the movie was very dramatic and suspenseful. You'll be shocked to see what happens near the end. I would definitely recommend this movie. It's a must see.",Fight Club
544,judemcrobbie,Can't talk about it,10,27 January 2021,"This breaks the first rule but here goes. This movie is genius.
Manages to push politics on masculinity and capitalism in a way that doesn't feel in your face like...other movies.
Contains either my favourite or second favourite plot twist, this or the prestige. The thing that sets this plot twist apart from other movies is how well it is set up. Throw away lines at the beginning seem like nothing until you know about the ending.
Tyler Durden (Brad Pitt) is a perfect juxtaposition to The Narrator (Edward Norton), Durden being the embodiment of masculinity and is what every man wishes he could be, and the narrator is meant to signify the classic man of today's day being heavily materialistic and money-hungry at the start and morphing into the voice of reason in the final act.
All the performances are strong especially Brad Pitt's as Tyler Durden. The chemistry Pitt and Norton have clearly shows after how well they bounce off each other.
Up there with one of the most rewatchable movies due to the minuscule the perfectionist Fincher puts in there.",Fight Club

547,Pulpthatsfiction,it change my life,10,6 October 2007,"This film completely change my life in many ways. first I will write about the greatness of this film. Frist style filmaking this film has is porbaley one of the best. Director David Fincher gives amazing film style. Like he thinks that in movies we see to much of the actors eyes so he covers up the eyes in darkness, which gives hes films a creepy feel. The acting is superb and Oscars should have been given out to Brad Pitt and Edward Nortan for sure. Brad Pitt gives one of the best and most life changing performances. Edward give also gives one of the best performance. The Films SFX and editing are some of the best I have ever seen and should have won Oscars. The song at the end credits ""Where Is My Mind"" Pixes, is now one of my fav and fit the movie like no other could have done. almost every thing about perfect and is underrated and should have gotten more atition thing it did when it came out. There is only one thing bad is that the film kinda slows down but still goes not effect this film. This film has change my life in so many ways, I could go on forever. First this film change on how think about life and that I could die at any minute and should not care and make the best of it, also my view on everything has change from my friend and family to the random bug on the ground, I have being speaking my mind more to people then I did before I say this movie. I thank everyone that made this movie it change my life. The movie has so much awesome lines you will be saying all day after you see this movie. like quotes like ""I want you to hit me as hard as you can"" or ""This is your life and it's ending one minute at a time"". This film is amazing every way and I will recommend this film for people looking a way out of there life.",Fight Club
548,framer94,See iT Too BeLieVe iT...***9/10***,9,1 September 2002,"Probably the most influential film since Pulp Fiction. The film questions reality, morality, manhood, and how the media influences society to be like sheep following one another. More importantly, the film shows us what a normal life can do to you.This is one of those films that you cant watch the once and catch everything--- every time you watch it, you learn something new-- and it's the little things which make you jerk forward, and say ""uhhh never saw that before-- that's clever!"" e.g. the waiters advertised on teh hotel TV in Ed Norton's room work for him...wont be a cinema pest and spoil the rest though.The lighting is costantly at a green/lime light-like buzzing hue to make us feel in a state of non-being, and the sharp editorial implicates the melow state of existing before Norton meets Pitt in teh film.It's the film that put Ed Norton in the controversy line, showing evryone that he's ben in something worthwhile, not mindless hollywood sheep-garbage. It was also the second controversial Film Brad Pitt did before Snatch. Fight club could well of been a solid landmark, surpassing Pulp Fiction, but it's mainly aimed at youths aged 17-34, and doesn't necessarily appeal to people in their middle age because of the speed of the direction, etc. Plus the subject matter only appeals to youths anyhoo.Watch it, then watch it again to see what you missed, then watch it again to see what you missd before that time!Cracking---9/10***",Fight Club
549,o-12574,Memories of youth,9,7 April 2020,"When I was in college, I downloaded and watched the movie, but I didn't understand it at that time. I remember two men fighting at the bar every night. The opportunity of film festival decides to buy ticket to appreciate god again, as expected as the improvement of the mind, basically can see a movie. Compared with Pitt, I like NORTON more. I am impressed by NORTON's handsome appearance and excellent acting. The score of the movie is great, and the script and narrative technique of the ghost director are indeed outstanding. After three months of writing a film review, many details and emotions are not so vivid, if the international film festival has a chance next year, I should revisit the classic.",Fight Club
550,MrWhite2,"This shocking, disturbing film proves David Fincher to be a Great American Filmaker of the New Generation.",9,21 February 2003,"First of all, let me say this, THIS IS VERY DISTURBING! Although this film is not nearly as violent as David Fincher's first great film 'Se7en', it is about ten times more disturbing and shocking. It makes the shocking 1971 Best Picture Nominee 'A Clockwork Orange' directed by desceased veteran film director Stanley Kubrick, look like a Disney film. You'll be surprised how much less you will flinch on a man getting shot through the back of the head, than you will when you see a scary man brutally beat himself almost to death with his bare hands, while hearing the carteldge crunch in break. Another reason why it is more disturbing is because everywhere, everyone, and everything is so filthy in the film. The story is about a depressed insomniac (Edward Norton - in a great performance that should have earned him an Oscar nominee) who doesn't know his name. Since he wants people to talk to him he goes meetings for terminally ill and addicts, such as A.A. , testicular cancer meetings, ect. He feels good there since people talk to him, and don't just tune him out like the rest of the world does. One day at a meeting, a tourist, Marla Singer (Helena Bonham Carter) comes into the meeting and steals his precious attention. Since him and her are the only people who go to the meetings who are faking an illness or addiction they hate each other. After that the movie splits into a kind of like two part movie. The first part I love. The first part is when the narrator (Edward Norton) meets a drifter by name of Tyler Durden (Brad Pitt) who makes soap from stealing extra fat from a place that does liposuction. After they become friends and start living together they both share a horrible and mischievous hobby of street fighting. So, they decide to start up a club where people come to a place at night, forget and never talk about their life and fight, hence the film's title 'Fight Club'. There are a couple rules of Fight Club that are made by Tyler and the narrator, 1) Do Not Talk About Fight Club; 2) Do Not Talk About Fight Club!; 3) When someone says 'Stop' or goes limp,  the fight is over; 4) Only two guys to a fight; 5) One fight at a time; 6) No shirts and No Shoes; 7) Fights go on as long as they have to; 8) If this is your first night at Fight Club, YOU HAVE TO FIGHT. After a couple of brutal fight scenes, and Edward Norton brutally beating himself in front of his boss horrifying him, the film goes into it's second part. I got kind of lost in the second part, but I have got to admit this part was very interesting at the least. The second part is when Fight Club turns into something a little bit more violent and frightening than beating each other silly for fun. In this part, they decide to blow up a federal bank to screw up the credit accounts. This expedition is led by the notorious Tyler Durden. When Edward Norton finds out about his evil plan, he tries to stop Tyler Durden. It gets even more weird after that with a surprise ending that will leave you stumped. This is a great adaptation of Chuck Palahniuk spellbinding novel that will make many of the novel's fans pleased. The movie's great cinematography, film editing, acting, writing and especially directing (thanks to the excellent David Fincher) makes this film Fincher's second best film, slightly not living up to the standard of 'Se7en'. Grade: A-",Fight Club
551,SillyPuddy,Way off the mark,2,12 June 2007,"This film certainly has its share of fanfare and hype. I really was hoping I would like it even though the trailer didn't impress me. Well, it turned out being worse than I thought. Meanwhile, Fincher continues to get worse with each effort. The only reason I didn't rank this as 1 was on account of the brilliant Ed Norton. Pitt just plays himself the same way he usually does. The violence gets really old quickly and so does the film. This was way too long and pretentious. Fincher has some interesting points with all the IKEA furniture bits. Perhaps it would have been better in an hour TV show like Ray Bradburyesque. About the only amusing scene in the last half of the film was when Norton is beating the crap out of himself in his boss's office. Of course I liked this scene best when Jim Carrey did it in Liar Liar. Fincher obviously thought he was doing something important here with his pop culture references. I suppose I'm not so easily impressed because I don't rely on American mainstream movies for entertainment. Ooops..sorry to burst your bubbles but despite what some people think, Fincher is not God. After Aliens3 he struck gold with the thrilling ""Se7en"" and followed that with the mediocrity of ""The Game"" only to follow that with this rubbish. Then he went off the radar completely after the embarrassing ""Panic Room"". Not even Jodie Foster or Forrest Whitaker could breathe life into that sleep fest. The twist at the end of FC may have worked better if the darn film didn't drag on for another half hour. Then cue the Pixies song to show that we're cool....puke.",Fight Club
552,im_veritas_photo,"Great Comedy, with Interesting Twists",9,11 January 2008,"Theory: The entire population of Planet Earth can be divided into three groups: 1) Those who categorize ""Fight Club"" as a true comedy, 2) Those who think ""Fight Club"" is something other than comedic, and 3) Those who have yet to see ""Fight Club"".I'm in group 1). Seriously, folks, if you miss the humour of ""Fight Club,"" you're too darned serious for your own good, and you're missing much more than half the content here. It is a very, very funny movie. You might think the jokes rather dark, but after a short while I forgot about the humour's blackness, and just laughed out loud at the pervasive hilarity.This film is not really about young-adult-male-on-male fisticuffs. Although there is a lot of that in there, it is not really the central theme. Yes, those who named the film put another joke over on all of us. But it kind of backfired on them: That misleading title most likely prevented ""Fight Club"" from garnering more well-deserved film-industry awards than it did.Once I say that the acting is truly superb (especially from Edward Norton and Helena Bonham Carter); and that the screenplay makes a fine plot, just full of interesting twists and turns; and that the production values are top-notch... Well, there isn't much more to say about this movie, as far as I'm concerned. In a good sense.What really intrigues is the way this film makes me think about other works of art that might be comparable. Here's a rather trivial example: Consider ""Forbidden Planet,"" a sci-fi flick released a full 43 years before ""Fight Club"". Yeah, the one with Robbie the Robot. A definitely schlock-ridden film, but it had a fine central premise: Left-over ""ancient"" technology of an alien planet sensed the monsters resident in the ids (that's as in brain theory, folks, not ""identities"") of the humans investigating the place. They are attacked by their own brain waves made real. Took them a long time to figure that out.To me, ""Fight Club"" is a work of art that invokes memories of prior art, emerging to become even more superior with every invocation.So good, I might even buy the DVD, rather than just renting it. Loved it. Nine out of ten.",Fight Club

554,fiteclub!,certainly not bloodsport,10,19 October 1999,"I had been anticipating fight club for a long time when i heard some people talking about it at my high school.  i wanted to hear what the buzz was and was shocked when people were calling it ""gay"" and said that ""it looks really stupid"".  after viewing this preview again, i realized that too many people were viewing this as a stupid van damme bloodsport or one of those cliched chuck norris movies.  fight club is actually a blistering social satire as well as a technical masterpiece bordering both thriller and drama that often leaves you shocked.  if more people took the time to see what this film really is, it could surely be one of the word-of-mouth phenoms of the year.",Fight Club
555,fiteclub!,My mind is still blows,10,15 October 1999,"The general complaint about Fight Club is how the plot twist, which to some was genius but to others pointless, lead to a banal ending.  I disagree. Like Sixth Sense or The Usual Suspects, when a movie is so good or so excellent that anything else would be a let down, Fight Club uses a twist that really doesn't have to do much with the movie.  Yes, it does put things into a new and limited perspective, but it is still a great surprise and a wonderful jolt for the audience.  I found that the last scene of the movie could have been developed more realistically, and I am actually disappointed in Fincher for once for blowing the chance to make one of the most ironic endings in film history.Fight Club is a 2 and a half hour comedy.  You will find yourself laughing more at the satire of this film then for it's action subplot.  Like The Matrix and Run Lola Run, Fight Club is a new breed of movie meant to blow your mind and trigger ALL your senses for as long as a movie can possibly do.  To the cynical eye, The Matrix, Run Lola Run, and Fight Club all had their disappointing moments, but to the faithful filmgoer, Fight Club is a treat not soon forgotten.",Fight Club
556,flip304,"Ten years from now, this will be called a masterpiece",10,25 April 2001,"If there was any film made in the 90's that will go on to cult status it will be ""Fight Club"". Though it recieved mixed reviews and didn't really do anything special at the box office, every single one of my friends agree it is one of their favorites of all time. I think everyone at my school loves the movie.For me, violence is not a big deal. I am the first one to admit I am decensatized to violence, so this film really wasn't at all a big deal in terms of violence. People would complain that it made it seem cool to go out and beat the s--t out of your friends because it will ""set you free"". Me and my friends get in fist fights all the time, we enjoy kicking the crap out of each other. To me, when the fight is over, I feel great. Call me sick if you want, but I feel relieved after a fight.One thing that took this film up a notch was the acting. Of course there is Edward Norton, who I have yet to see in a bad film doing a bad job with the role. But for me, Brad Pitt takes the gold. Pitt has always been one of my favorite actors. I think one reason I like him so much is because he is called a ""pretty boy"", but he has never really done a ""pretty boy"" role. He can actually act. His portrayal of Tyler Durdan is so amazing, he deserved more recognition than he got.For a film that is called ""Fight Club"", they don't really spend a great deal of time invested in the clubs. I think most of the film focused more on Edward Nortan's insomnia, and then focused on ""Project Mayhem"". But believe me, ""Fight Club"" is a better title.David Fincher is a director that really has a huge future ahead of him. His direction is so detailed and organized it's scary. On the DVD commentary with Brad Pitt, Ed Nortan, and Helena Bonham Carter, Fincher says of this one scene with Ed and Helena walking down the sidewalk for 30 seconds, ""Yeah, I think we did this shot about 27 times"". He is very picky and wants perfection (much like the late-great Kubric).I'll admit that I was confused a little at the end. But once you figure it out, the second viewing is so much better. Roger Ebert calls it ""the Keysor Soze Syndrom"" to add a suprise ending that changes everything about the entire film. I'm happy it went with a ending like this. Several reasons are one, it keeps it interesting, two, it makes the film even more unique than it already is, and three, how else would you end it(?). Seriously, I don't think I would have loved it as much with a different ending.Overall, this will be the leading cult film of the 90's. Just look at how ""A Clockwork Orange"" is today, classic. 10/10",Fight Club

558,TexMetal4JC,An amazing sibling to American Beauty,10,12 July 2001,"Fight Club is, in short, an amazing movie.It is amazing that it has such popularity, yet the real nature of the plot is still a mystery to someone watching the film for the first time.It is amazing that it can produce such polarized views from a populace, yet still garner such high rankings to be in the Top 40 of all time.But not only that, Fight Club is amazing because it combines terrific directing (David Filchner - Se7en, The Game) with terrific acting (Brad Pitt - Se7en, 12 Monkeys, Interview With a Vampire; Ed Norton - American History X), a great plot and social commentary that rivals American Beauty for its satirism and black humor.Indeed, American Beauty and Fight Club are like siblings. Both movies intertwine commentaries throughout a basically goofy and funny plot and turn potential comedies into something far deeper and thought-provoking.And just like American Beauty, Fight Club has its haters, the people who cannot stand the movie, the people who think it has no point, the people who refuse or are unable to grasp the underlying condemnation of their materialistic world.And that commentary is exactly what makes American Beauty and Fight Club a pair of instant classics. When society looks back at the turn of the 2d/3d millennium, these two movies will tell them volumes about our decadence, our shallowness and our misguided priorities.Overall Fight Club is not a cinematic classic, in the true Citizen Kane/Casablanca sense of the word. But it IS a classic, one of several movies that society of the future will look to to grasp our understanding of life. Fight Club is an excellent movie, with only minor flaws (the plot twist towards the end does leave some plot holes unfortunately: mainly the car crash scene). It is well-acted, well-directed, well-thought out, and it joins American Beauty and American Psycho as being one of the finest examples of contemporary black satire ever made.And did anyone else notice that Papa Roach took lines from this movie and used it in their song, ""Between Angels and Insects""?9/10 (With a possible 10 after a 2d viewing)",Fight Club

It punched you right in your seat and wouldn't give any mercy. It's name was Fight Club, starring Edward Norton and Brad Pitt and directed by David Fincher.

The Club expands and new Fight Clubs form in many other cities around the country. Then a woman who is addicted to hope meetings for cancer patients and such whom the insomniac knew (Helena Bonham Carter) comes in between them both. This film is incredible. I love it.

560,Millennialprince,Fight club is an excellent movie that must be seen.,10,14 August 2017,"Fight Club was one of those movies from the 90's that was going to polarize people because of its subject matter. Some critics thought of Fight Club as an exercise in sadomasochism while others thought it was a biting social satire. I would argue with the latter, but the truth is Fight Club is a cautionary tale against the dangers of nihilism. The film starts with Jack a white collar worker, who suffers from extreme bouts of insomnia. However, insomnia is the least of Jack's problems Jack has become dissatisfied with his life. He has become numb to the banality of his everyday life. His life has become a series of routines that is one step away from turning him into a drone. So in order to alleviate his existential crisis, Jack goes to support groups so he can feel better about himself. Most of these support groups are dedicated to people who have terminal cancer, so in essence, Jack latches onto these people to remind himself that he's more fortunate than them. But he doesn't do this out of pity he does this to give his life meaning. Alas, Jack's sanctuary is shattered when a sardonic Goth named Marla enters the picture. Jack has seen Marla in various support groups and he knows that she's a faker just like him. However, unlike Jack Marla goes to these support groups as a voyeur. Jack threatens to expose her but she retaliates by threatening to expose him. So they come to an agreement of sorts, they agree to share certain days for the support groups. Weeks later, Jack meets Tyler Durden on an airline Durden is everything Jack is not. Durden is charismatic, confident, crass and strangely funny. Durden informs Jack that he's a soap salesman. The two engage in idle chat, but it's clear from the get go that these two have a lot in common. Later that night, Jack has what could only be described as the worse night of his life, his condo explodes and to make matters worse the police suspect him. Inevitably, Jack calls Tyler and the two agree to meet at a local bar. Durden gives Jack a monologue about his philosophy on life and the two hit it off becoming fast friends. Durden persuades Jack to stay with him at his dilapidated house and Jack agrees. As a favor, Jack agrees to hit Tyler and the two engage in a street fight. This is the moment where the film really takes it stride, as Tyler and Jack engage in various street brawls other people take their lead and soon word spreads around about these street brawls. Tyler and Jack create a club called Fight Club, an underground fighting club where people can fight with complete strangers. As the film progresses, it becomes apparent that these people that join Fight Club are lost souls and misfits of society. Most of these men have become broken and emasculated, from working at jobs they don't like to buy stuff they don't need as Tyler surmises. In essence, Fight Club becomes their sacrament, their key to enlightenment. The film grows murkier as Marla starts to engage in a liaison with Tyler and Jack begins to have doubts about Fight Club. To divulge any more would simply spoil the surprises that happen later in the film. But I will say this, what transpires in the third act of Fight Club is both perplexing and prophetic in this post 9/11 world we live in today. Many people have complained that Fight Club tonally is inconsistent, but this is not the case Fight Club is a dark comedy from start to finish. There are scenes of utter hilarity in Fight Club, like the scene where Tyler and Jack steal fat from a liposuction clinic to make soap or the scene where Jack beats himself up to blackmail his boss. These scenes may offend some, but for those select few that appreciate this type of dark humor, they will really get a real kick out of these scenes. Over the past decade, Fight Club has developed a cult following of sorts and it's not hard to see why. Fight Club is a biting social satire about the superficiality of American culture and the absurdity of the materialism that is embedded in our culture. It also serves as a cautionary tale about the dangers of going beyond social constraints and dedicating your life to philosophies that are primal, bestial and potentially dangerous.",Fight Club

562,Rod-54,Intriguing but the message seems confused,7,28 June 2000,"I saw this first on video, quite a long time after its release, though I had been intrigued at the time by early favourable reviews suggesting a deep and interesting message.  It is surprisingly in the art-house genre, dark both visually and philisophically and quite disturbing.  The visual darkness is obviously needed since much of the film is about an insomniac's often distorted recollections of his nocturnal activities.  The performances and the effects are strong.  My difficulty is with the message.  If, as the lead character asserts, people in general will go a long way to avoid a fight, why are so many men attracted to the fight clubs?  I had anticipated a message of the type that the modern world comprises a computer industry and many services industries and so it is a world for nerds and women, leaving little role for traditional male stereotypes.  Instead, the film portrays no contrasts of this type.  The men appear to be escaping from hum drum lives or some kind of shared fear.  The only woman, whose contribution to the plot left me in the dark, is certainly not a stereotypical service worker.  When the revolution came I was confused as to what it was all about.  Was it, for the men involved, nothing more than ""something more exciting to do""?  I would have liked a clearer statement, even if it would have attracted more controversy.",Fight Club

564,ltj36,Methods of Mayhem,10,19 November 2000,"""Fight Club"" is a movie born to let people discuss. It can be considered a masterpiece of the modern times (as I did) or a stupid and excessive movie. The story is told us by an anonymous Narrator (symbol of the every man), which is disappointed by his life and find comfort visiting people affected by cancer. Then he meets two dropouts like him: the strange Marla Singer (Helena Bonham carter, dressed like a scarecrow) and the fascinating Tyler Durden, which involves him in an hurricane of violence and anarchy. And the Narrator doesn't know how to stop him and himself. The story begins with a fantastic introduction in the false - golden life of the narrator, affected by insomnia and depression and it is like a shout for freedom in a society trapped by herself in the logic of ""making money"". Tyler founds an organization called Mayhem to destroy all the false symbols of a life untrue and makes little acts of terrorism, introducing frames of porn movies in movies for children. Brad Pitt and Edward Norton gives two astonishing performances: the first is fantastic in denying his image of sex-symbol for an acting voted to destruction, the second, the normal man willing to revolt to society, is one of the best actors of 2000.",Fight Club
565,conspracy-2,"I am Dave's impressive, black film",6,21 May 2000,"I can not say much about this film. I have just finished watching it this instant, and it's taking its sweet time to sink in.I can talk about the shallow stuff. The direction, as always with David Fincher, is impressive, innovative and flawless. He seems to be able to bring out hidden levels of talent in his actors. Even the usually good Brad Pitt moves up a notch when taking directions from Mr. Fincher. The camera, quickly and smoothly moves around places in some sequences that are, well, impossible to film. Everything about this film's feel relates to Edward Norton's inner character. It's just excellently well done.I can talk about the role of Brad Pitt as the Jesus-like rebel with the anti-establishment ideas and his rounding up of brainwashed disciples. A little controversial parallel, but in the bigger scope of things I think it's suitable.The resolution of this film is unexpected and excellent. Do all you can not to know anything about this film before you see it. The surprises should be surprising (and they are).I gave this film a 9. The only thing that held me back from giving it a 10 was the 'I am Jack's over-used joke line' (although it does, come to think of it, make sense in light of the ending).

568,Quinoa_Chris_Kirk,The anti-anti-corporate film,2,15 October 2014,"Fight Club (1999) is considered a cult classic by those who praise it for its brutal critique of the meaninglessness of modern urban life. It is condemned as ""irresponsible"" by some critics who claim that it advocates violence. I claim that both of these positions reveal a total lack of insight into what the film is actually saying, and an unwillingness or inability to read the text of the film as a whole.It seems that all criticism of the film focuses only on the first half. The first half depicts a man living a consumerist lifestyle in an anonymous American city who meets a powerful man who inspires him to make radical changes in his life, primarily through all-male meetings of consensual bloody violence called Fight Clubs. The debate about whether violence is a legitimate response to a suffocating culture of submission is a legitimate one, but not one that will ever be meaningfully discussed in mainstream media. State institutions have a monopoly on violence. End of debate.The film is stylishly designed, charmingly performed and its philosophy is quotable, the only problem is the second half, in which Fight Club becomes Project Mayhem. The second half appears to be nonsensical but a rather cynical message can be drawn from it. Whether the destruction of credit card companies to erase personal debt without loss of human life is a legitimate response to capitalism is not a debate the film encourages. These men are not depicted as free-thinking radicals liberated from wage slavery, but as a mindless army blindly following the orders of their deified leader.Maybe the anarchists, activists and eccentrics are feeling validated by Twentieth Century Fox for offering them entertainment that presses the alienated buttons they have been sullenly nurturing and so resist a critical examination of their beloved product. The revelation that the two main characters are actually the same person is merely dismissed as bad plotting, but is much more self-aware and manipulative.There is a tiny clue to the true ""twist"" in the film. There is a comment in the narration that we hear but do not understand, and so forget. This is an effective method of subliminal messaging that is demonstrated in the film by Brad Pitt's character inserting single frames of pornography into children's films. ""It's called a change-over. The movie goes on and nobody has any idea."" Everyone knows that different genres are designed to induce different feelings in an audience; horror movies scare, comedies make you laugh and thrillers thrill. Fight Club starts off as social commentary, designed to make you think, and moves into thriller, designed to cease thought by getting you excited. Most thrillers have completely inane utilitarian plots. I worry about thrillers that have actually raised serious and complex issues.The hero of the film, who has spouted all this quotable philosophy, is completely insane. It seems the story so far has been an episode of acute dissociative schizophrenia and if you are on the protagonist's side you will stay on his side as he wakes up from this episode, realises that he is Brad Pitt and Edward Norton, and attempts to stop the progress of the destruction he has instigated – blowing up the credit card companies – because it is obviously wrong.The film successfully negates everything of interest that has been presented, and does it all in the mindless thriller genre, so the cult followers of the film can remain willfully ignorant to how they have been manipulated.When the protagonist realises that he is unable to stop the destruction of the credit card companies, he decides to kill himself. He shoots himself in the mouth, both killing himself (Brad Pitt) and not killing himself (Edward Norton). He has thus liberated himself from the man who liberated him and so is now free to watch the destruction of the buildings he tried to save.For the first half of the film we are Edward Norton and our minds and lives are opened up by Brad Pitt. The second half of the film then reveals that Brad Pitt is a lunatic who must be stopped and that actually he is a part of us, he is an aspect of ourselves that we must destroy. We enjoy the destruction vicariously through this film, we buy the DVD and maybe even the t-shirt. Our inner anarchist is stimulated, excited and finally subdued; put back to sleep for another decade of employment, consumption and the thought-provoking philosophy of Hollywood studios.http://www.personaproductions.com/2014/10/fight-club.html",Fight Club
569,smoothrunner,Improper education,9,17 November 2020,"'God, the King, the Empire, the Union Jack - all the overthrown idols can reappear under different names, and because they are not recognised for what they are they can be worshipped with a good conscience. Having found it, he can wallow unrestrainedly in exactly those emotions from which he believes that he has emancipated himself' (G. Orwell). That's what ""Fight club"" is about. Emasculated middle class men of European origin who got bored by their comfort life and became destructively violent, rejective of private property, revolutionary against existing order and hierarchy, who have no sexual principles to the point of sexualization of children entertainment and eager to hide their real identity behind masks while prone to terror attacks... Does it sound familiar? I guess that our collective main protagonist materialized his Tyler Durden alter ego in person of Antifa. And it's not that violence or promiscuous sex or rejection of property could cure them. It just shows that men remain men no matter how you try to emasculate them. Their repressed manhood will still manifest itself, but unshackled and not properly harnessed. It will manifest in uncontrolled violence (instead of controlled violence and code of honor), destructive behavior (instead of courteous), superstitious beliefs in ideological dogmas (instead of Christian faith) and dubious ""martyrs"" and ""saints"" (instead of real ones), rebellion against consumption and property (instead of following common sense, charity and respect of oneself's and others property), weird asexuality (instead of chastity and sex within marriage) and wild tribalism (instead of healthy patriotism).

570,b-a-h TNT-6,Excellent,10,30 January 2001,"Dealing with our society's faults is not easy task. This movie does it perfectly and, most important, is not pretentious enough to give answers and teach people what to do about it. Many questions whose answers are left to the viewer arise through this film. Is Tyler Durden really crazy? Was the fight club just a product of the narrator's increasing paranoia or rather a cure to his frustrations (or both?). Were the people in project Mayhem finding their real ego or were they just followers? Is the world we see really what we think it is, and are we actually who we think we are? Is it possible to change the world, and how far can we go to change it?Paid critics trashed this movie. Those reviews - some of which were so empty they were laughable - were exactly part of the system this movie wants to criticize, and therefore came out like actual glorification. Those same critics believed that Pulp Fiction dealt with the pornography of violence (strangely enough I never found any other movie where killers were so ""cool""). Or they strongly believed that the light-hearted American Beauty dealt with our society's real faults (""...there's so much beauty in the world""... yeah, I'd like to see what people in Mexico City's surroundings think about that).Fight Club is a violent movie, but violence is not mindless and it's not seen as ""cool"". It's simply a projection of one man's frustration with a system whose surface covers emptiness and lies. This man (let's call him ""the narrator"") has a job, nice house, and a decent amount of money. But in his subconsciousness he realizes that a consumeristic life will never tame his awareness that much in the world is wrong and he's not doing anything to change it. Physically, he is suffering from insomnia but inside he knows - because he is part of that system itself - that he's been keeping his eyes shut for years. As a consequence, he simply tries everything that would make him feel far away from being part of the world he knows. He starts going to cancer support groups and this makes him feel better - dying people show more humanity than anybody he's acquainted with, and being next to death sort of makes him feel numb. Eventually, a woman without any disease - like him - shows up and that's when he realizes he's hiding, rather than fighting. Thus, the beginning of ""Fight Club""...If you've never seen the movie you might think this is a rather depressing or very-intellectually ""boring"" film. It's not. There are exceptional graphics and it's very funny, the performances are excellent - especially Edward Norton's. Even Brad Pitt, who I never thought was anything special as an actor, is very impressive here.The movie came out little more than one year ago. Will it be a classic in the next years? Let's see. As for my take, it's quite possibly the best movie or the 90's.",Fight Club
571,b-a-h TNT-6,Some thoughts...,10,2 January 2002,"*SPOILERS AHEAD*Ok, I don't want to tell people what they should think and what they shouldn't, but I have to say it. There... about the twist in Fight Club, there's something that a previous user (as well as some other users) are obviously missing.There are numerous hints that become apparent after a couple of viewings which suggest that the narrator only partially acts out as Tyler. One of the scenes is the one with Raymond K. Hassel, the clerk that he threatens with a gun. Rewatching that scene, a couple of things become clear:a) There are blurred boundaries between ""when"" Tyler actually talks and when Tyler's talking is just an illusion in the narrator's mind. Raymond answers some questions, yet a couple of times the narrator has to do the talking for Tyler, as apparently Raymond didn't hear what Tyler just said. What does that tell us? That in these small fragments the narrator failed to bring out Tyler. In other words, in these small fragments Tyler wasn't ""acted out"" by the narrator. When they are alone (they practically never talk to each other in public), the narrator is having a conversation with himself in his mind, but he's not speaking out loud, as he doesn't need to act out Tyler.b) The same is true for the scene in the car. There are fragments where Tyler speaks out loud on behalf of the narrator, but again, the boundaries are not defined, since the whole film is the subjective view of a man suffering from ""dissociative"" psychosis: the narrator ONLY partially acts out as Tyler. This is not just to justify why the space monkeys in the back answer Tyler's question. Fincher, I believe (and I've been watching the movie a lot, to see if there are flaws on this) paid particular attention to this, and it came out well. In fact, the whole conversation that the narrator and Tyler have in the car is just an illusion in the narrator's head, as he's not speaking out loud except in a couple of fragments. The couple of fragments where he's speaking out loud are, apparently, where emotions are prevailing (the narrator screaming ""I wanna know certain things first""): the ""wall"" that he has built in his subconscious to permit him not to ""act out"" the two personalities is torn down for a small fragment of time. When one of the two personalities is specifically addressing questions to an external person, of course, he doesn't need this ""wall"", so he can act out one of the two personalities.Another thing... Fight Club doesn't attempt to give answers to the question it raises; in particular, doesn't portray the fight club, Project Mayhem and Tyler himself as the underlying philosophy that one should follow. This becomes more and more obvious through the movie, the final twist being the ultimate proof of the irrationality of these solutions. Sorry, but it bothers me a little that one refuses the validity on the twist on the whole and then blames the movie for being ""empty"".I say that the movie righfully does not offer solutions (there's only a brief hint in the end about *love*): let's face it, no matter how long, a movie can not support the weight of such heavy questions as the role of society and the equilibrium of the human in it. But the movie addresses heavy criticism about what consumerism portrays as ""happiness"". I say -- in this, Fight Club succeeds in spades.",Fight Club
572,sublime501,A truly brilliant film.,10,31 May 2004,"Going into FIGHT CLUB, I wasn't quite sure what to expect. All I had really seen of the movie was a bunch of sweaty, bloody men fighting in a basement with others watching and cheering them on... But then, I had also heard from many people that it was exceedingly good. Hence my uncertainty.What I got, I certainly wasn't prepared for.FIGHT CLUB is so much more than just sweaty men beating each other up. It is, in reality, a truly brilliant film about the world we live in and our lives--how pathetic and pointless they may actually be. It is filled with satire and social commentary, and is easily the most thought-provoking film I've seen in a long, long time. Anybody who can't see the symbolism of Tyler Durden (Brad Pitt), or the Narrator (Edward Norton), or basically any of the characters, or of the fight clubs themselves, must have a heart of steel, and a brain of such.Sure, on the surface, FIGHT CLUB isn't much. Well, it is, but it's when you have the intellect and experience that you can dig deeper and uncover the film's true brilliance. It's there.On top of its brilliant use of satire and irony, FIGHT CLUB is still an excellent film. Everything from the direction, to the script, to the actors (all of which surprised me in being very good, namely Norton and Pitt) is exceptional. From the opening moment you get drawn in to the lives of everyday characters with true depth to them, and you're in for one hell of a film. You'll laugh throughout, find links and morals to our society and our role in society as consumers, and find yourself marveling at the absolutely epic closing shot.I hadn't yet found a film that I will readily give a perfect score, a 10 out of 10.

And that Norton isn't supposed to talk about Pitt in front of Marla, because Pitt isn't real. And the fact that Norton always says that Pitt and Carter are never in the same room together.

Although David Fincher has come up with a few movies people didn't care for, he is also responsible for thrillers like ""Seven"" and ""The Game."" And this movie is a let-down because I want so much to like it, but when I really think, it's not that good! The movie begins like somewhat of a black comedy. Norton is a white-collar office worker going through a state of depression in which he attends meetings with victims of various kinds of cancer. He befriends a testicular cancer patient named Bob (Meat Loaf) and discovers that a woman named Marla (Bonham-Carter) is going to all the same places.He meets Tyler Durden (Pitt) on a plane. Tyler owns his own soap business and from the start we know he's more than he says. Tyler and Edward Norton find therapy in beginning an underground bare-knuckle fight club in which men compete for fun and derive some sort of perverse pleasure from beating each other's brains in. The first few fights are actually somewhat entertaining, but as they progress they become more graphic and more tasteless. Tyler seems to disappear at one point and Norton is wondering what is going on as all the members of Fight Club begin to form some sort of underground army to challenge the establishment. Things grow frustrating while we keep trying to figure out what is going on. No one is acting right, not Marla, Bob, or anyone else. While not in the business of killing, these men plan to blow up several high-rise office-buildings while no one is in them. Norton tries to stop them. The final twist is a nice touch, but much of the movie is fighting and excess that could just as easily have been left out. We don't need to know that two men who are never fully developed lost their two front teeth in a brawl. The self-destructive feeling that not only is in the characters but gradually becomes the viewer is not what we want when we sit down and watch a movie about fictional characters in very personal situations.",Fight Club

582,stathisvoukelatos,You call it weird?I call it unique,9,13 December 2010,"Fight Club is a flawless masterpiece,an unprecedented epic.It is a classic,not like The Godfather,Taxi Driver,Scarface and so on,it is a category of its own.In fact i consider this movie the most unique movie of all time,and i am pretty sure that many people agree with me.But you see,many people hate this movie because of its very violent,its fight scenes are as realistic as it gets,there is excessive use of profanity and of course they hate it because of its so called weird scenes which the movie obviously contains.Indeed this movie is unconventional but you cannot libel it for that very reason.Personally this movie gives me emotions that almost no other movie does.The plot is about a young man named Jack working in a major company who is suffering from insomnia.The solution he finds in order to combat insomnia is to attend in various seminars for people suffering from cancer,tuberculosis,e.t.c.Everything is okay until a woman named Marla starts attending in the same seminars just for fun(""it is better than the movies and they offer coffee""),thing that obstructs him releasing his emotions in order to calm and be able to sleep.From that point and so on the plot thickens...a lot...He meets another guy named Travis who makes soaps for a living and moves to his house-an abandoned desolated one- after his own apartment's explosion for unknown reasons.Then during a night they decide to take up a new activity in which they will release all their anger,sorrow or whatever that burdens them.This activity is bare-knuckle underground fighting and they gather more people who consist of the so called Fight Club.The rules about this club are very simple and the most important rule of them all is the following;""You do not talk about Fight Club"".Everything is quite normal until the situation is getting out of hand and various vandalism,assaults and so on are taking place as a part of a revolutionary ""project"".Then Jack after his friend's Bob death and his friend's and co-founder of the Fight Club Travis disappearance,begins a battle against the time in order to avert an oncoming explosion of some credit cards buildings.The end is messed up yet beautiful,where Jack realizes that he is the same person as Tavis and one of the most wonderful ending of all time is taking place as he(with a hole in his jaw due to a shoot) and his girlfriend Marla are holding hands at the top of building watching the tallest buildings of the town are collapsing...To sum up Fight Club is not your ordinary prime time movie,it is libeled for being different but i consider it special,unique,one of the greatest and most beautiful movies of all time...",Fight Club

It has a very understandable plot, but parts of it are bizarre and confusing, which made me not like it entirely. However, I gave it a second shot recently, and I've come to enjoy it......a lot.Fight Club tells the story of a guy played by Edward Norton. He doesn't have a name, however, he is known as the Narrator since the movie is told by his point of view. He is an office worker who can't sleep due to being diagnosed with insomnia. He later meets up with a guy named Tyler Durden (played by Brad Pitt), and he is a soap salesman who the Narrator finds strange. But, the Narrator's apartment is destroyed, and thus, decides to stay with Tyler. The two form and unlikely friendship and form an underground club for men to fight each other.There's also a woman named Marla (played by Helena Bohnam Carter) and she gets in the way of Tyler and the narrator's friendship as Tyler becomes attracted to her. From there, things can only get better or worse for Tyler Durden.Fight Club is a fantastic movie. Like I said, it does have some moments that can be strange and are questionable. But they are there because they fit in with the atmosphere the film is going for., and I've come to realize that after watching it again. The ending, which I will NOT spoil, is the most confusing part of the movie. Watch for yourselves, and you'll see why.The acting from Norton and Pitt were great. They played off each other very well. Helena Bohnam Carter did great as her character, and Meat Loaf is in the movie as a testicular cancer patient named Bob, and had very smooth acting.Bottom line, Fight Club is a movie I recommend to watch twice in order to like it.

I didn't empathize with a single character, and somehow I found it very unclear what the appeal of the fight club itself was. As a result, the cult that builds later in the film seems pretty absurd since the basis for it was so poorly explained. What's more, are we as viewers supposed to be able to identify with Edward Norton's character because he seems to have some conscience and a hint (however small) of normalcy?  Not only didn't I understand where he was coming from (until the end), I didn't really care. I would give this film a score of 5 out of 10, because it had some good performances (namely Norton) despite not having much to work with in terms of script, and because it did keep me interested. I find it laughable that this film is trying to come off as art, though..",Fight Club
587,claybo76,I am Jack's rising level of disgust.,10,21 February 2000,"Fight Club is the most underrated film ever.  It's lack of critical acclaim, box office success, awards and nominations astound me.  Perhaps because this film dares to be different, and brave enough not to stick to the golden rules of Hollywood film making.  Boasting brilliant performances from the two leads - as well as the rest of the excellent cast - FC transports the viewer into a disturbing journey through violence, insomnia, pain, relief, anarchy and alienation.  Which is not to say that FC is without it's charm and humour.  David Fincher - who is only getting better in my opinion - steers this film into his own cave of cinema brilliance, with inspired moments and dazzling visual scenes.  He constructs visions of confusion, mania and realisation with the ease of the film genius that is David Fincher. From the opening credits this film had me.  I couldn't look away from the screen. 
This movie is THE best film to come out of 1999.  The fact that it got ignored by the Academy Awards, the Golden Globes and other such awards fills me with disgust.  A token Sound Effects Editing Oscar nomination proves that Hollywood has no place for films that challenge our senses, which don't treat the audience like three-year-olds and spoon-feed them plot lines.
Edward Norton is still to get his credit for being one of the best actors in movies today.  I hope that one day he gets the accolades he deserves.  Brad Pitt is not just a pretty face either, and lately he has been showing how good an actor he really is.  This timeless classic will only be appreciated by the few of us in the world who recognise the brilliance in this film.  Until people are ready to open their minds, FC will always be underrated.  This is an excellent movie.",Fight Club

Creepy, dark, brutal, funny and ultimately dangerous and subversive.  This movie is a complete and total affront to the Western capitalist system we live in.  Many feminists I know have argued that it is a disgusting ""dick flick"", a testosterone overdose, but most viewers will see much more to this movie.  Pay extra attention!  There are subliminal messages in the first act that flash for a split second.  Keep your eyes peeled.",Fight Club
589,Shecky J. O'Pootertoot,I don't get it,8,22 July 2001,"Fight Club is definitely not what I expected. I thought I knew what the film was about from the commercials. I was wrong. I mean REALLY wrong. I walked out of the theatre not knowing what it was that I just watched. Was it a dark comedy? Social commentary? Commercial satire? An exercise in style over substance? I don't know. Maybe all of the above, maybe none. I think it is a mistake to over analyse this movie. And let's face it, the media made way to big of a deal about the violence in this movie. I remember one station reporting that there was some fear that real life ""fight clubs"" would start springing up around the country. Get real. The fact is, most guys don't like to get in fights, or more specifically, they don't like to be hit. Maybe after a couple or ten beers, but not usually. It's taken me three or four viewings to fully appreciate this film. The directing is excellent. Fincher is a huge talent, and with this and Se7en on his resume, he's the kind of filmmaker that you know you're going to get something interesting from. Pitt can be great when he picks the right parts. And Norton is easily my favourite young actor. He always comes through. I don't really believe in a lot of the ideas that Fight Club pushes, but it's interesting none the less. And there are a lot of laughs between the gruesome beatings. Just don't take it too seriously, and you'll be okay. I give it an 8/10 stars. G'night!",Fight Club

When it came out on video my brother said it was a very good twisted plot movie. A week later I saw the movie and thought it was great too.  I've seen the movie three times and see things you never saw before in the last time you watched  it.  It was the best film of 1999 in my perspective.  I say The Beach is the best movie of 2000.  I am reading Fight Club right now and it is good.  I read The Beach and loved that book too. Now honestly when you first heard of this movie you expected it to be a lame-brain fighting movie, right?  That's what I thought.  At the end of it, I said Oh, My God.  This was a great psychological movie.  If I say anymore I will ruin it for you so I'll stop here.

There is strong sex in this movie but this movie is not for the faint-hearted because of the very strong blood violence because it is so graphically bloody. I loved this movie, it was recommended by a friend and I have to say, Brad Pitt and Edward Norton SHOULD make more movies like this. Brad Pitt plays a bad boy soap salesman and Edward Norton plays a bored office worker with insomnia. The plot twist was good but the twist at the end was absolutely shocking.

593,theresamgill,You Do Not Talk About Fight Club,6,12 June 2018,"All the clues are there-- probably every frame analyzed by huge cult followers. Fight Club is a film that is almost begged to be rewatched, yet there's still something that compels me to not give it all the credit it has garnered. There will be plenty of you that are huge fans of this film, and those that haven't seen it may end up really enjoying it. So, I will make sure not to give away the mind-numbing twist, unlike Rosie O'Donnell (she spoiled it on her talk-show).Let's start with the main ingredients (of the cast and crew, not for soap). Edward Norton and Brad Pitt are brilliantly cast for their roles. Norton fits the insomniac 100% even if his narration dulls slightly after two-thirds of the film, and, along with his iconic wardrobe, Brad Pitt has the perfect look of a rabble-rouser type of friend. And when is Helena Bonham Carter not awesome? There are also fun parts for Meat Loaf and an unrecognizable Jared Leto. Needless to say, I have no issue with the acting.As regards to the skewed time line, I have zero complaints about the first 45 minutes or so (Pitt's monologue for the fight club is pretty dang cool) of the film. The setup is all there with some clever dialogue, especially for subsequent viewings, and David Fincher employs a certain craftiness to how he envisions the film to play out. It's not so much that the film had too many issues, but my vision and expectations for what to come were basically on the opposite spectrum of what did happen. What I can say that is that the writing started becoming as crazed as the protagonists portrayed in the plot that followed. To pinpoint a little better what I am trying to get across; basically, I felt the film took a turn for the worst as soon as Project Mayhem was mentioned. I was fine swimming with the sharks in the deep end the movie was already in, but they lost me when the water started to fall off the side of their flat perceived world.It's becoming a much bigger problem than I anticipated to discuss this film (despite explicit directions to not talk about Fight Club) the way I should be able to, but to do so is too compromising to those that haven't watched it, so hopefully I can refrain. As I say that, let's talk about the ending without talking about it: I'm not a fan of it. The anti-establishment campaigns of the cult army club thingamajig went too philosophical in its uprising message. The most basic way to express my opinion on it is to say that it bit off more than it could chew. I believe a smaller payload with a different direction for the fight club could have made the twist more rewarding. In its strange defense, the ending is exactly what was needed to propel Fight Club to the level of cult status (ironic and satirical for an ironic and satirical film, I got that). Achieving this cult following does not cement a film to greatness necessarily, but it causes viewers to at least try understanding better the effects and results from the film. With that perspective, I do understand the brashness of the storytelling that captivated a set of audience. In fact, I would probably admit to recommending this film because of iconic moments and the uniqueness of its entirety; however, I will keep my outsider place of personally believing it is overrated in what it accomplished.

I cant wait for Fincher's next film! Ed Norton (as always) is outstanding.And Brad Pitt(who,for some reason i'm always trying to find reasons to dislike)was very convincing.Pitt is blessed with some of the best lines in moviedom that I have heard in some time.Very memorable!

I cant wit to get to the supplemental disc.The packaging is also unique and very creative.The DVD really brings out great points even more than the theatre at times.I could go on and on,but most of what I have to say has been said on this board already.For you people who dont get it,YOU DONT KNOW WHAT YOU ARE MISSING!",Fight Club
596,Dante Hicks,It doesn't get much better than this,10,25 June 2000,"Similar in idea to 'American Beauty' but certainly not in style or content this bleak look at underground culture and the spiritual redemption it brings is easily one of the most intelligent films I've ever seen. Directed by the same man who brought us the superb 'The Game' this is another film which you'll have to see more than once to truly understand.  Focusing on sad white-collar, middle-class Norton whose only real dream in life is to own all the contents of an IKEA catalogue it follows him through a chance meeting with charismatic stranger Pitt and the unfortunate events which conspire to draw them together. After a nights hard drinking they start a friendly-ish scrap which is viewed by a couple of others and from that small acorn a mighty oak called Fight Club grows. This is the point around which the whole film revolves with Norton and Pitt forming an underground club which draws more and more disillusioned young men to join it. Based on firm 'Queensbury Rules' it is a cathartic if bloody way to spend your night. Eventually as it becomes a huge operation Pitt, the de facto leader, moves it up a gear and creates his own cult from this secret society. This is where the film becomes brilliant and the twist near the end is magnificent, better even than the much talked about 'The Sixth Sense'. It just has so much to say about things: the emasculation of an entire generation of young men (""No great war to fight, no great depression""), the growing isolation we all feel from one another and the need to find something to draw us back together and most importantly, the power of an exciting, challenging idea and it's fermentation into cultism. However, where many films would just say 'This is a bad thing' 'Fight Club' doesn't. It is more a condemnation of a materialistic society which has forgotten about a large section of itself. You can empathise with these men completely, even when they band together against this uncaring society that has reared them to be something their instincts don't understand. It's as close to genius as you'll get and one film you'll talk about and think about for days.",Fight Club
597,fidelio74,"A memorable, iconoclastic, disturbing film",7,21 September 2012,"'Fight Club' is a memorable, iconoclastic, disturbing film. Director David Fincher's visual style is really on display here - he has an exceptionally good eye, and the film is not only thematically dark but also quite dark visually. The visual darkness of this movie recalls Fincher's earlier film 'Se7en', which also starred Fincher regular Brad Pitt.The Narrator (who remains unnamed throughout the course of the film but who is played by Edward Norton in a wonderfully neurotic performance) is an insomniac office worker who feels as though he is a slave to corporate ideals and senses that his humdrum life has no meaning. Things change drastically via a chance meeting with an anarchist soap salesman named Tyler Durden (Brad Pitt). Together, the two men channel their latent male aggression by forming a primal 'fight club' which meets on a regular basis in the dank basement of a seedy bar named Lou's Tavern. This cabalistic club invites fellow frustrated angry young men to find catharsis by fighting each other and rediscovering their baser instincts. But Tyler has an even more ambitious agenda in mind...This film, while highly recommended, is definitely not for the squeamish. Special makeup effects genius Rob Bottin provides some very graphic makeups and, while the film is about a lot more than just violence, there are some pretty horrifying moments. The violence depicted here is stomach-churning and horrific, and this is precisely how violence SHOULD be presented on screen. This is, after all, what real violence is like.'Fight Club' has become a cult classic and rewards repeat viewings. The source material - Chuck Palahniuk's 1996 novel - is an excellent read shot through with a dark vein of black humour. Returning to the film, particular mention should go to British actress Helena Bonham Carter, who is wonderful as the bonkers Marla Singer, a suicidal woman who is sucked into Tyler's world. Carter made her name in period pieces like 'A Room With a View' and 'Howards End' so it is exciting to see her play a very different role here. And she has great fun with it.I sense that 'Fight Club' is going to live for a long, long time. For a mainstream film, it is intelligent, vital, and has a great deal to say about modern society and the way we live our lives.",Fight Club

If u don't like complicating movies that are just plain weird, don't see this. Brad Pitt and Edward Norton totally are 2 of the BEST actors on the planet. I'm not going to tell you what this movie is about because i want you to see for yourself, but just remember, be WIDE AWAKE because it is long, confusing and weird. it has a NON original ending, but probably one of the best of it's series. it's OK. 8/10",Fight Club

602,formicidae,A lot of depth for those who look.,10,8 July 2001,"To the world: This isn't really a movie about dumb guys beating each other up because they're too bored to do anything else. No, Fight Club is actually about personal and cultural revolution within a corporate consumer society that destroys the human spirit. At least, that's how I saw it.I loved this movie, and rating it a ten is not some whimsical fancy--I don't hand out gold stars for nothing. It looks good, sounds good, pacing, dialogue, acting, etc. are all excellent. Why it didn't rate higher on the mainstream critics' lists for cinematography alone is beyond me.What really makes this movie shine, though, is the unflinching way in which it looks at North American society--our mass consumerism, our slavery to stuffy corporate office jobs, our growing lack of what makes us human. The movie doesn't pull many punches.Norton's character is the automaton office lackey who is desperately searching for meaning in his materialistic shell of a life, Pitt plays the modern-day surfer/hippie Tyler Durden whose devil-may-care, spontaneous attitude to life offers the perfect (?) solution. These two personalities struggle to reconcile their different perspectives on life without destroying their relationship. To make things more difficult, Bonham Carter creates a love triangle to further test the friendship.Is it better to be free, alive, and chaotic, as in Pitt's anarchistic vision, or safe, secure, and bored like Norton's capitalist American Dream life? Or, can a compromise be found? Can love conquer all? This is the peripheral, deeper stuff Fight Club is made of, not the smack-down action that the trailers and critics focused on.This movie demands at least one viewing. If you're queasy about violence (there is a graphic fight scene or two), then watch it with someone who's already seen it and ask for an edited version. Even if you don't end up respecting the movie's message or the complicated questions it asks, it remains a well-crafted film, deserving of recognition.",Fight Club

I was thinking that it was a look inside a secret world of amateur ultimate fighting, an action film with the top notch stars like Pitt, Norton and Bonham Carter.  Boy was I wrong.  Fight Club is so much more involved and intricate than that.  It is a statement about American consumerism and one man's attempt break away from Ikea catalogs and triple chai lattes.  What American Beauty does for the suburbs, Fight Club does for this materialistic society we live in.  The story is interesting but what really makes this film is the director and the effort he put into it.  This film had some scenes and shots that had me scratching my head saying how did he do that.

608,Josef Tura-2,Desperately seeking something,7,17 October 1999,"The movie fight club for me was summed up in by one line from Tyler Durden. Our image of God is our father and if our father's dumped us what does that say about God? (Roughly Paraphrased) This is a film where the main characters and those they influence are looking for some sort of meaning, any sort of meaning outside of Ikea furniture. Brutal violence and monkish asceticism provide one way out of the hellish reality the film portrays. In a strange way the violence in fight club almost becomes a fellowshipping between men. A forum to simply let it all go regardless of who you are fighting. The film directly relates the endless varieties of self-help groups to the idea of  fight club. In a way they are the same. Both attempt to purge by sharing communal pain and letting go of inhibitions.     The fight clubs touch a chord and quickly swing wildly out of control spreading like a cancer throughout the nation. The members of fight club become like pods from invasion of the body snatchers - human in form, alien in nature. This film suggests that the masses are so desperate for meaning beyond popular entertainment and yuppie culture that they will do anything to find it. They will die to themselves and live only for the cause. Using the medium of film seems an odd choice to convey this message, since it is effectively incriminating itself. However, the film makers self-conscious style suggest that they are aware of the irony and perhaps the film itself is a comment on the impossibility of organizing a secret society dedicated against the all principles of society. It is just as useless as making a pop film about the emptiness of popular culture. The irony of hearing Brad Pitt say that not every one can be a movie god or a rock star hints at this paradox central to the film. Ultimately, the film is an entertaining vehicle that conveys the hopelessness that seems so widespread in society today. As Tyler Durden says this generation has no great war and we have no great depression. WE only have a spiritual war and our lives are a great depression. A generation with no more purpose, no more struggles, with peace without effort will create it's own struggle even if it's just a bunch of guys beating each other to near death. This film does not cop out. Even if you disagree violently with it, Fight Club forces you come up with your own position on the issues it raises and for that fact alone, you should see it.

The man in question (Edward Norton) is a lonely, sad insomniac, a lost soul of modern-day America and a serious victim of consumerism. Suffering from a lack of purpose, he begins to attend cancer support group meetings to see other people in pain. But when Marla Singer (Helena Bonham Carter) starts doing the same thing, he no longer finds it appealing. He is trapped. Enter Tyler Durdan (Brad Pitt), a charismatic and slightly eccentric soap salesman who meets the insomniac narrator on a business trip. Tyler changes Norton's character's entire outlook on life, and together they create underground cult of bare-knuckled, bare-chested fighting matches to make them feel alive.It is clear from the very premise that we are in for a confronting ride. Some, if not most of the concepts in ""Fight Club"" are rather sickening; and the violence is incredibly graphic and excessive. But this movie has so much to say, and so many issues to address on so many levels that, if you can stomach some of the less poetic elements, it is absolutely and one hundred percent worth every second. Its scathing dark satire of American culture, namely consumerism and masculinity, is some of the best of its kind... but due to the excess and devotion of said satire, the film can often be mistaken for both an endorsement of the values and acts it portrays and blatant nihilism. This is a sad misunderstanding of the film's moral.And what is that moral, some might ask? This is a subject of great debate. The top contender is that of Individualism, but along the way the film explores very dark philosophies on self-destruction, civil disobedience and ""freedom"". All this rather vicious ambiguity stems from the film's origins as a novel. Chuck Palahnuik, as an author, is very interested in studying disjointed society through the eyes of those who are, by their behaviour and attitude, rejected and shunned by it. He enjoys and excels at identifying hypocrises in the social views on normality and abnormality, civility and barbarity, right and wrong, as well as drawing parallels between different interpretations of these themes. His characters are almost always what would be considered collectively as dangerously abnormal, whether the satirized subject matter is violence, sex, rituals, culture or any other subsets of these themes in relation to American society.As interesting as this approach is, where does it leave the reader, or in this case, viewer? The answer to this will wholly depend on the individual. If you are able to not only see through but forgive what we are shown, which is in essence pretty sick material, to get deep enough into the film to analyze and judge what you feel are the *real* matters at the heart of it, you will be able to validly evaluate your own opinion of ""Fight Club"".Thankfully, the film still has a lot to offer when appraised soley at face value. The direction is highly engaging, the score (composed by musical group ""Dust Brothers"" in the debut film-score appearance) is greatly reflective of the film's atmospheric excitement. The acting too, is quite sublime.Norton, as always, delivers what this reviewer can call without doubt a flawless performance. His diversity as a character-actor is practically unrivaled in today's acting industry, save for perhaps the prowess of such talents as Russel Crowe or Sean Penn. Helena Bonham Carter has had a jewel-embedded acting career, with her role in Fight Club high on the list of most significant. And Brad Pitt gives the greatest performance of his life as Tyler Durdan. Not since 'Twelve Monkeys' has the Hollywood heart-throb so aptly demonstrated why he is such a renowned figure in modern society.Despite cynicism and a bad wrap from the squeamish, 'Fight Club' is still proving to be one of the most intelligent and provocative films of its generation, spawning a significant cult following all over the world and blowing the minds of even the most jaded cinematic viewers. Regardless of personal styles and tastes, definitely a must-see for all film lovers.",Fight Club
620,teodorodontosaurus,I really shouldn't talk about this!,10,15 April 2018,"Some people say that this movie has no plot, but ignore them! Even Chuck Palahniuk agrees that it's better than his book.
In the year 2000 (I was pretty young back then), I received a video game magazine from a childhood friend. At the ""Movies'' section, I saw some reviews about Fight Club. That's the first time I heard about the movie; I didn't even bother reading about it (back then I wasn't into movies anyway). I remember that the name gave me a false impression of the movie; it sounded too catchy to be a good movie. I figured in my head a Van Damme or Steven Seagal brainless action movie or something and rejected the concept of Fight Club.
Many years from them, I totally ignored it, and even encouraged people not to watch it... until one day. It was a foggy and gloomy night and my father was watching the 8 o'clock PM every-saturday movie. At one point, I decided to watch the movie with him. Then, at one point in the movie, I found out I was actually watching Fight Club. I was stunned; that couldn't be the brainless action movie I pictured in my head all these years. I was so intrigued, I immediately watched it again, after a few days. I was even more stunned. Then, for the 3rd time - The movie was getting better and better. I was a fool for ignoring it...
I somehow consider this movie underrated, although it has a pretty solid fan base. The title deceived many of us; I thought I was one of the few people deceived by the title... I was wrong again. After becoming a fan, I started spreading the good news about the movie. Many had reactions like ""Dude, I DON'T watch those kind of movies"" or ""Come on, you cannot like those type of movies!"" or ""Ehhh, I hate stupid fighting movies"". I tried in vain to open their eyes but their answers were even more frustrating: ""I know it could be entertaining, but I don't like simple movies"".
I believe that even today, there are people that consider this movie a typical cliche action movie. Something must be done... or not.
Every time I watch this movie, i discover something new. Of course I don't want to talk about this movie and reveal spoilers, but I must say that there are also some subliminal messages (especially at the beginning, before the narrator meets Tyler Durden).
This movie is pretty much perfect to me, and it's also a nostalgia-inducing factor.
Now, I must pay for the fact that I mentioned the name ""Fight Club"". We all know what I'm about to lose...",Fight Club
621,gromit-17,A big disappointment..,1,12 March 2001,"And what a waste of talents. and my time. Yes, the movie does have some fancy camera work. But I consider David Fincher would be more successful to be a TV commercial producer than a movie director. From Seven to Fight Club, I don't see any growth in his filmmaking. Dark and grotesque as usual (or even more) but his movies absolutely has no emotional impact on me, excepts the unpleasant after taste.",Fight Club

623,buyjesus,is this possible?,10,24 November 1999,"wow. wow. wow. you'll have to see this at least 3 times. everything about this movie is right and it's about everything that is wrong. only a few months earlier would have been a more potent time to release it (it was originally scheduled for summer release but pushed back when people started killing each other in public)David Fincher is a god. His movies so far have been very enjoyable and powerful. They each engulf you and don't let go of you but none of them have come close to touching the complete immaculate piece of brutal art that fight club is. There is so much energy here; a sense of chaos,disillusionment, and permanence that this film will leave in you. It's a shame that this film is already nearly gone from theaters.  There are so many moments that should be considered immortal classics of film. Hopefully video will be able to capture this.Brad Pitt, Edward Norton, and Meat Loaf are all perfect in their respective starring roles.  This film is also a trap. It toys with all your emotions, pushes your softspots and forces you to deal with the issues involved- and not just those on the surface.  It's easy to understand Durden's disgust at the mainstream culture- the commercialization of everything, the ugly standards of beauty, the pre-planned go-nowhere futures, self-serving friends and acquantices,the social-darwinism that weeds out our meek weak and unwanted-that don't fit the stereotypes, corruption and destruction of just about the only things that are sacred.  and it's even easy to feel the emasculating power of just feeling something-physically.  and it's easy to understand how he takes it too far- how it goes to the furthest extreme. and as long as you're paying attention, the part of your mind that most needs this movie- the subconscious, will get it and proceed accordingly. what do you feel about this as a man? as a woman? what does your anima think? animus? how about the collective? why are there no women to protect these men? how do you really feel about everything that's been happening lately? how do you (as a man/woman) really feel about the bonding these men share (homoeroticisms, etc.)?I am Jack's complete stupificationthe icing on the cake is the awesome soundtrack by the dust brothers that compliments the movie superbly.even if your not paying as much attention as you should, the end will justify all means. it is classic and it leaves you exactly where you started which was the point of project:mayhem, wasn't it?",Fight Club
624,cwpnewpaltz,"Better than expected, no less violent, but more intelligent. Still, in the end, unbelievable.",7,28 July 2000,"OK, I'm an old codger compared to most of those who visit this site, but I'm a real movie fanatic. And Fight Club is not one of the 30-odd greatest movies of all time, nor is Edward Norton the greatest actor of all time. But this is an interesting film, mostly because one doesn't even know its genre until it's almost over. Sci-fi horror, that's about as close as I can come, unless madness is a genre. The whole idea of this narrator with his meaningless life bringing us into his insane world without letting us know until the end that he's insane, not just bored and sullen, and it's insane (and not just an attempt to gain meaning through violence) is really pretty clever. But the climax has no credibility; it's just a great visual effect. (I saw this on DVD, by the way, and thought all the director's and special effects guys' comments were interesting, but really made it clear they were done for their own sake and with awards and kudos in mind). This really is movie-making for the MTV generation, and if anyone of that generation really feels upset that he was deprived of recession, war and pestilence, given an expensive education and subsequently accepted a high-paying white collar job and its attendant condo lifestyle, I say, hey, it's not illegal to join the Peace Corps or the Army and actually be of use to someone other than yourself.",Fight Club

628,alafolle,Am I the only one who caught the humor?,8,18 July 2000,"Quite a lot has been written about this film, both good and bad, and I can't help feeling that most people took it too seriously to notice how extremely funny it is.""Fight Club"" is a wickedly hilarious satire that skewers every aspect of post-industrial society.  From 12-step programs to the aggression-therapy men's movement, from conspicuous consumerism to black-clad anarchists, from Freud to Nietzsche to New Age psychology... you get the idea.  The dialogue is packed with memorable and funny lines.  Pitt and Norton had several humorous asides, and Norton performed a little bit of brilliant slapstick. This had me laughing more than most movies which are marketed as comedies.Many movies have poked fun at the yuppie lifestyle (few as brilliantly and thoroughly) but here we are not presented with politically correct good guys like we were in ""American Beauty"".  The satire in ""Fight Club"" spares no one.  As Tyler Durden says, we don't have a great war or a great depression in this generation.  The loss of our individuality to the corporate lifestyle is THE big issue in civilization today, and few movies have made the case as convincingly, or as humorously, as this one.Some have commented that ""Fight Club"" glorifies violence and male aggression.  I disagree completely.  Yes, the movie mocks the demasculation of men in today's world.  But the men of Fight Club are shown to be sado-masochistic thugs, conformists with fascist tendencies, mindless followers, latent homosexuals, and ultimately insane... Hardly a ringing endorsement.  Tyler Durden is an appealing anti-hero, but he's also stark raving mad and extremely manipulative.  This does not glorify violence... it shows how people are driven to violence.(Minor spoilers ahead...)I didn't care much for the ending, but not for the reasons which have often been cited.  Who cares if it's implausible?  The entire movie is unrealistic if taken literally (Bombs from soap?)  Everything is exaggerated and distorted.  But the ending puts the focus on the psychology of an individual, rather than on sociology-- power and violence-- which is where David Fincher had the most interesting things to say.  It also opens the door for not-so-bright folks to get the impression that Fincher wants them to go out and start a revolution, which I seriously doubt.Overall, however, a very good movie.  Don't take it so seriously that you miss all the fun.",Fight Club
629,SanderStrijbos,Mischief. Mayhem. Movie of the year!,10,2 February 2001,"When I rented Fight Club I thought I was gonna see another Brad Pitt flick, but what I was renting was just the best film of 1999! (Magnolia is a close second).It's violent, it's funny, it's brilliant! And the twist in the hotelroom is just perfect! All the clues are there, but I (and I think no other soul on this planet) could predict this twist. This twist is in my top 3, together with the Usual Suspects and the Sixth Sense, but I haven't decided yet which one is 1, 2 or 3.Back to Fight Club.It's visual style is incredible and it shows right in the beginning during the opening credits. The dialogues are even better and this film confirms something I suspected since Se7en: David Fincher is one of the best directors at this moment! (Maybe *the* best!!!)The acting is terrific! Pitt is very good, but he's nothing compared with Norton, who gives (just another?) brilliant performance (after American History X). Is it in his blood to act... no, to *be* his characters so perfect?Fight Club proves there can be controversial films within the Hollywoodstudios. It defines a decade (the 1990's) and it's certainly one of my all time favourites.I rate this film a 10 out of 10.",Fight Club

631,stallone-9,Strange but unique,9,15 March 2008,"David Fincher continues his streak of great movies with Fight Club.This is perhaps his greatest cinematic achievement.A movie simply unique and unlike anything done before.Eddy Norton and Brat Pitt shine here and give amazing performances.The plot is rather strange. The narrator (Edward Norton) is an automobile company employee who travels to accident sites to perform product recall cost appraisals. His doctor refuses to write a prescription for his insomnia and instead suggests that he visit a support group for testicular cancer victims in order to appreciate real suffering. By attending the group, the narrator feels important and cared for and then is able to sleep soundly and subsequently fakes more illnesses so he can attend other support groups. The narrator's routine is disrupted when he begins to notice another impostor, Marla Singer (Helena Bonham Carter), at the groups he goes to and his insomnia returns.During a flight for a business trip, the narrator meets Tyler Durden (Brad Pitt), who is a soap salesman. The narrator arrives home to find his apartment has been destroyed by an explosion. He calls Tyler and meets him at a bar. Tyler agrees to let the narrator stay at his home on the condition that the narrator hits him. The narrator complies and the two end up enjoying a fist fight outside the bar. The narrator moves in with Tyler and the two return to the bar, where they have another fight in the parking lot. After attracting a crowd, they establish a 'fight club' in the bar's basement. Soon, other fight clubs are established around the country, with Tyler's help.

632,AMichaelL,The first film to change me.,9,11 January 2012,"When I first saw Fight Club, I was 13. I was so in awe by the shocking twists that I hardly understood the bigger picture. When re-watching, every year since, sometimes multiple times, I always find my position in life determines how I view the movie. It is always a great movie, based on one of the better philosophy books written in the modern day (yes, Fight Club is a philosophy book, no arguments), but sometimes I view the characters with differing amounts of sympathy. Sometimes I wish I could join Project Mayhem, sometimes I am so glad I can't. But through and through this movie is anti-consumer, and it examines the way we have muddled ourselves into these collections of corporate brands as personalities, and it has never been done in a better way, before or since.I had never had the revelation that capitalism was evil and that actions are usually motivated by a want rather a need, until I saw this movie, and even at 13, I realized how gravely applicable this message was to our culture.This is, still, one of the best movies around. It has insane entertainment value, and somehow, right in plain sight for all to see, it proclaims that capitalism has failed us all (and rightly so). Marx would be proud!",Fight Club
633,ferni-tierni,Analysis/ Opinion The fight symbolizes the protagonist reviving his ability to fight against a monster that is habituation.,10,18 March 2020,"The first time I saw this movie I was 13 years old. I had limited ability to cogitate the dimension of the bomb that was chucked into my mind, but my intuitions recognized that this was something special. I am a 31 year old right now. I just watched the movie for a 4th time, and recognized that here is a ridiculous amount of esoteric information thrown to the viewer and with such a unique style that it is passionately invigorating. It hits a chord that wakes up your soul and stimulates you to rebel against otherwise invisible entities. How habituated are we to consumerism? How has consumerism shaped our identity? How much is consumerism debilitated us at diverse dimensions and levels? How alienated are we from our noble savage that we have turned to selfishness and malevolence?We are presented with the protagonist (Edward Norton). He sets off an identity crisis after accidentally setting fire to his apartment. In the earlier scenes of that movie we see him decorating meticulously every single object of his apartment, like the objects he owns are his identity. ""You buy furniture. You tell yourself, this is the last sofa I will ever need in my life. Buy the sofa, then for a couple years you're satisfied that no matter what goes wrong, at least you've got your sofa issue handled. Then the right set of dishes. Then the perfect bed. The drapes. The rug. Then you're trapped in your lovely nest, and the things you used to own, now they own you.""After the protagonist's commodities are gone he goes into a mental breakdown where he literally has no place where he belongs, no place to stay. Under the severe affliction he meets Tyler Durden. ""You are not your job, you're not how much money you have in the bank. You are not the car you drive. You're not the contents of your wallet. You are not your  khakis. You are all singing, all dancing crap of the world."" Tyler delivers a powerful philosophical dialogue that seems to be exactly what the protagonist needs to hear. Before the night is over Tyler challenges him to a fight. Now this is the critical part about the movie. The fight symbolizes the protagonist reviving his ability to fight against a monster that is habituation. Tyler says: How much do you know about yourself if you have never been in a fight? Basically what it means is if you have not fought for something you believe in to the death, how much you know about what you can accomplish. Tyler teaches him to wake up and care. Care that he has been abused by the system and consumerism to the point that he has a mental breakdown after losing his possessions. Act on the injustice, develop convictions, ideas, care, and become humane, via learning how to fight, fight for what he cares about. This is the central idea of fight club. We are going to teach you to care.The movie has deep psychological teachings about habituation. At some point of the movie Tyler sends off members of the fight club to fight random people on the street. He specifically instructed them to lose. He wanted to hit the most primal sensation in human beings when they are attempting to survive a life or death circumstance and help them believe that they can win and defeat their fears. He metaphorically attempts to face Carl Jung's shadow. A person cannot be good if he has not learned to dominate his shadow (shadow symbolizing the control the person has to participate in deliberate destruction). Tyler's philosophy aims to make his fighters develop discipline, convictions, identity, resiliency, humanity, fearlessness, and solidarity. Tyler is conducting a concerted effort to target the original and elusive culprit of the fighter's inability to be happy in society. Why are you unhappy in this society? Maybe you need some of Tyler's philosophy.Before the protagonist met Tyler he was deep in an identity crisis. He had chronic insomnia, a job that he found with lack of meaning, materialistic ideas and behaviors, lack of discipline, lack of ability to suffer, and loneliness. He was suffering navigating through the Jungian analytical process of individuation. Before he could develop and establish an identity that was resilient to consumerist bombardment he had to face his deepest fears and face his shadow. Why have we not faced our shadow? Why are we incapable of being humane? Why do we not have the collective ability to end wars? Why are we so bad at constructing healthy relationships? Why do we struggle sacrificing and suffering for others? The protagonist in the movie understood that Tyler's philosophy was going to emancipate him from his suffering and help him discover his ego and shadow, and allow him to progress to also discovering his anima, animus, and old wise man (archetypes of the collective unconscious).Anyone that wants to understand this movie and the criticism it does to materialism and consumerism is in for an entertaining, passionate, unique, and frenetic ride. The soundtrack is one of the best I've seen in any movie. The intensity of the scenes is high and the grim violence can be disturbing, but makes it up with witty comedy and a genius dialogue that achieves a deep analysis few movies have demonstrated. I personally have not read the book, but feel satisfied with this masterpiece that transcends anything that I ask of a movie.",Fight Club
634,Rocketeer_Raccoon,Incredibly overrated and makes little sense,2,20 December 2015,"I'm as confused as a rat in a maze as to why Fight Club is rated so highly and is in the top 10. The story and the overall film doesn't make much sense, I mean how on Earth does an insomniac office worker have a split personality believing he's talking (and fighting) to someone and starts up a cult following of men that not only do they all appear to enjoy fighting without moral question but are completely brainwashed and have become terrorists to his cause? Not only that but the main character breaks the fourth wall. I just find this film to be incredibly weird, also I don't understand why Marla just can't give a straight answer of things that are happening between them which the main character doesn't realise he's doing. But the weirdest thing about this film is when he's fighting with Tyler Durden, there's a part where he's being dragged and it's seen from a security camera which shows it's just him dragging himself, but how is this possible? He looks like he's being dragged by a ghost.Personally, I didn't like this film and from what I think from a general consensus, no way is this a masterpiece, maybe the revealing of the split personality thing but everything else is just weird.",Fight Club

I loved it how the entire movie was presented from the narrator's point of view. We see his visions, we believe him, we live the story together with him.There is a passive love in this movie, that's what I'll call it. It's emotions are often portrayed through the passive voice of the narrator, the lighting, the costumes. Everything in Fight Club adds on to the effect. And this creates a profound connection with the characters.I fell in love with this movie to such an extent that I watched it twice alone and once with my friend.

But it's pretty hard, i mean i always feel a pressure of rating movies like this. Should i rate it high according to my opinion or because everyone else likes it and it's on most movie top list i check upon. These feelings mixtures a bit. If i've seen the movie before i check'd it out on IMDb i would never have guessed that it would be on the top 250. But it is and i can't complain i guess. But i decided now to give this movie an 8.

638,jason-210,A symbolic representation of psychological healing,10,9 April 2005,"It took me a while to figure out that Fight Club is not on a level that allows the audience a normal ""suspension of disbelief"". It is unreal, dark, and nightmarish, and has all the hallmarks of powerful symbolic dream, or story made out of a chain of such dreams. It is also a story of hope. One could say, in Jungian terms, that this is a story about a man's inner journey of discovery of the Self.What we are watching is a personal representation of a psychological journey, beginning with the realization that something is missing in the protagonist's life. That something is contact with his own subconscious.Because of the great tension between Jack's inner subconscious and outer consciousness, communication finally breaks through in a form that Jack can understand. The form is a manifestation of a real person who represents everything Jack is not - in other words the missing half. Shortly after its appearance, Jack's life is changed forever. This symbolised by the destruction of his flat.In the beginning communication with the the alter ego (or shadow, in the Jungian sense) is just an occasionally contact or dialogue; but gradually it is integrated into Jack's life. Later, when Jack realizes that the manifestation is in fact himself, he can't let go of the conditioned idea that he is ""two"" people. He is still dual. Can he really be one person. How? A ""death"" is needed. Death in this sense is symbolical. It symbolises the end of the old way of life, the old Jack, and the beginning of a new life, with both halves integrated. The fact that this is achieved by suicidal effort represented a conscious decision by Jack to change himself, without relying on ""outside"" help. It also represents is willingness at last to face the unknown. Of course he must sacrifice his former life complety to become a ""whole"" or ""healed"" person. So he shoots himself.When the two halves have come together, and a new perspective on the Self is reached, the crashing down of the buildings immediately afterwards was a symbolic representation of Jack becoming free from the bondage of his personal habits and history. In other words, the credit card conditioning, IKEA nest lifestyle and everything else is ""set to zero"" as it crumbles into nothing. In fact the image of a crumbling tower'is a well known and documented symbol of a sudden and radical end to all one is used to.Now Jack can start a new life with meaning. Notice that after he shoots himself there is of course pain, but he seems to recover. This is also symbolical of the healing that is taking place. Notice how his voice has changed.Very Jungian.

642,Horror-88,"Weird, WEIRD ending",6,18 November 2016,"I was really looking forward to this movie, hearing it was a cult classic, but it really didn't live up to expectations. Ultimately, this movie is about a bunch of guys with first world problems and to escape these ""problems"" (by the way, the protagonist's problems include living a dull life with a stable, reasonably well-paid job that he hates. A lot of people would die to have the life he's living) they beat each other up in a so-called 'fight club' to be something they're not in their normal life. They also decide to take it out on other people and become a crime gang.The whole movie, you're waiting for something exciting to happen, and instead, nothing happens. Then, you come to the incredibly confusing/weird ending where we watch the protagonist run around the city in his underwear (yes, you read it right). I don't really understand how this is 'cult', but I wouldn't recommend watching this. It's boring and very long and there's no great conclusion to look forward to. Special mention to that I despised the main character. His actor was really annoying. Don't know who that was, but thankfully I don't think I've seen him in another movie. And no wonder why. His facial expressions were the most annoying parts to this movie. Even on the front cover!",Fight Club
643,Adrian-32,"For the most part solid, but bizarre ending throws whole thing off course",8,16 October 1999,"""Fight Club"" is a jarring and often thought-provoking satire about people fighting against the system, and the explosive violence that could erupt when humanity starts to retaliate against society and it's confinements. It's dark social commentary basically points out the fact that man's search for self-identity and value can only be achieved through raw violence, because that is the only way a man can find out just how powerful he is, letting go of life's monotonous routine and deconstructing himself in every possible way. The film's gritty and unflinching portrayal of havoc breaking loose, mentally and physically, is at times hard to swallow, but overall it is a pretty fascinating thing to watch,  and only it's strengthened by the lead performances and a caustic script. Edward Norton is great as a bored business man who begins to explore the satisfaction of destruction and rebellion, and Brad Pitt is simply terrific as the fearless sociopath who guides Norton through this journey, he successfully keeps his character believably complex. ""Fight Club"" is pretty much a solid movie for the most part, but for some reason it derails into bizarre psychological revelation in the last third. In many ways it is weakly established, especially the conclusion, and it just throws the whole movie off-course. But in the long run, ""Fight Club"" is strong enough to keep the virtues outweighing the flaws, and it is overall still an audacious and powerful film that will keep you laughing, cringing and thinking all the way through.",Fight Club

646,Cheesedemon28,For the Faint of Heart,10,21 January 2004,"(slight spoilers)The thing that's so interesting to me about Fight Club is not only that it twists your cerebrum into intricate slipknots, but that it's one of those movies that Isn't just there to please an audience. Its purpose in life is literally to change an audience, and that I think, is the reason why so many critics have lambasted it. Some of the criticism is laughable, like a reviewer in London who stated that the film ""echoed the policies of the SS."" That is a complete and total misconception of the film.I'm not going to spoil any of the plot or sub-plots, because they are just so amazingly distorted and exciting. There will be several instances when you see this film that you will actually feel and hear parts of your brain bending. This is especially evident near the end of the movie, where you have absolutely no idea who is who, what is what, and more importantly, what the hell is going on. It's so insane that it's almost liberating, euphoric even.To me Fight Club seems like a film anyone can enjoy; those who really want insane plot twists, theory on society, or a really entertaining film will find Fight Club to be all of those things and more. However, there are SO many whiny fools who take Fight Club to be more than it really is. It is NOT a macho, hyper-fascist flick that incites violence amongst GenX-ers. Critics get so lost amongst the violence(which is brief and mostly non-graphic) and revolutionary sub-plots that just goes to show that there is an unfortunate amount of people who need to be told that the film is ""not good,"" because it shows you so many things that aren't working in society.That's why I titled this ""For the Faint of Heart."" Anyone who doesn't like being called ""another brick in the wall,"" should be inspired to be different, to be yourself. Fight Club isn't so much of a movie as it is a 2 hour comment on individuality. I hope that kids who see this realize that it's more than just a brutal fighting movie. It's a beautiful, beautiful film, a diamond in the rough.Ah, but what is the most unfortunate thing about Fight Club's scathing reviews? I have a hunch that like 2001 before it, Fight Club will be hailed by the same critics who called it filth in 2000 will love it in 2020. I can see it now. ""A revolutionary masterpiece!""10/10also: Where is My Mind? Perfect ending song.",Fight Club
647,YellowTea,Stylish 90s Satire,8,1 November 2021,"I don't know why this movie is considered one of the best of all time. I'm not saying that it's awful by any means as I've evidently awarded it an 8. In order for it to be considered one of the best films of all time, in my view, it'd have to have a variety of beautifully interwoven and affecting elements: humor, happiness, sadness, sentimentality, dread, hope, etc... (The Shawshank Redemption comprises many or all of these things and is thus deserving of its ranking) Fight Club is an excellent movie in its own right, mostly stylistically, but I feel it falsely derived much of its acclaim from its anti-capitalistic and consumerism bent rather than the content of the film itself. The movie is a great outlet for those dissatisfied with modern living especially as it was starting to emerge in the late 90s. It's sort of a cinematic stray into fantasy that I'm sure would bode well for many angry young men then and now. I used to simplistically assume that it was a ring-based bare-knuckle boxing movie in the same vein as Rocky or something. It's really just about a sleep-deprived, psychotic office worker who hates his job and his life and so invents a ""fight club"" that periodically commits acts of vandalism and destruction. It's a good watch for what it's worth, but it's not a movie for everyone. It's very much a matter of taste kind of film.",Fight Club
648,motezart,You Are Not Your F'king Khakis.,10,7 February 2014,"Nearly everyone knows the rules, number one of which I'm about to break.What do you do if you're sick of your boring, pathetic life? In the most cathartic, DIY approach possible, Fight Club answers this question: you change it. The absolute prototype of an existential thriller, it wouldn't be taking too much of a leap to suggest that Fight Club is one of the best films ever made.Jim Uhls' excellently adapted screenplay of Chuck Palahniuk's novel (this is the only major work by Uhls that I can find), this thriller has been exciting male audiences the world over since its release in 1999. Even Palahniuk himself said the film was amazing. In fact, he admitted that film was so good, the book in comparison made him feel ashamed.A nameless, pitiful, seemingly friend and family-less Office worker (Edward Norton) suffers from insomnia. True to Palahniuk's style, the solution to the insomnia comes in a bizarre way. He finds relief by attending support groups for diseases, diseases he doesn't have; these people really listen to him, and afterwards, he sleeps. At these meetings he meets Marla Singer (Helena Bonham Character), a nemesis and lover, and it is through her that Mr. Office worker discovers his true self, but not until after he's transformed more than just his own life.Mr. Pitiful Office worker meets Tyler Durden (Brad Pitt). Durden helps Mr. Pitiful Office worker admit to his misery once and for all. Channeling their suppressed male aggression in its rawest form, they start fighting each other. Soon Mr. Pitiful Office worker realizes that he and Durden are not alone. Men, downtrodden, tired of their insignificance as worthless individuals all aim to do something greater. They jump at the chance to vent their primal steam, and the solo fights turn into group fights. Durden's vision eventually transcends aggression in its physical form and becomes something much greater, a community where the individual ceases to exist. As part of this whole, every unnamed member is an equal and significant contributor, and it is through the whole that the individual finds meaning. As part of the whole they are changing the future together.This movie is a directing marvel. With time shifts, psychological manipulations, and very meticulous scene planning, we are kept on the edge of our seats for the entire film. Accompanied by the pounding soundtrack composed by the Dust Brothers, Fincher achieves the rarity of making a movie better than a book. Fincher turns the concrete basement of Lou's Tavern into perhaps the most famous arena in all of modern film. The house on Paper Street, a lone abandoned mansion, becomes a factory of redefinition, of reinvention. In the final scene an amazing mesh between the visuals and the music, The Pixies' ""Where is my Mind,"" Fincher creates one of the most stunning combinations of sight and sound in all of film. And it's a pretty damn good ending to the plot too.The most memorable scene is when Durden is behind the wheel of a car full of passengers. He buckles up, pins the gas, and lets go of the wheel. The car veers off the road and crashes, flipping multiple times. We are force fed the hard truth here. The Fight Club mantra: to change to our lives we need to rid ourselves of our past failures, forget the job, the kids, the car, the living room, the flat screen HDTV, and just let go.

650,Liedzeit,A punch on the nose,2,16 January 2000,"This one is sick. I had hoped and prayed I would not live to see another film as bad as the Matrix but Fight Club is. In a way it is even worse since it is not as obviously silly. The actors can really play the directing is as good as could be expected by someone like Fincher (I loved Se7en). So what is wrong? Well, it is sick. Now, that is not a smart thing to say when criticising  a film but there is no way to avoid it. Fight Club is extremely violent. This is something I do not like in general but for a movie with a title like Fight Club to be expected. And it is not senseless violence like in Matrix but belonging to the story. Indeed it is the essence and in this sense acceptable. What is wrong, if not evil, is that it is presented as a possible solution to the emptiness we feel in our lives. So our generation did not enjoy the blessing of an honest good war? No wonder we degenerate and start buying IKEA furniture. Is this a joke? It is not meant as one.
Our hero (the `Narrator') cannot sleep. He is not really happy but who is. What to do? First he finds some unusual hobby. He goes to meetings of people who really suffer.  And the mixture of real feelings mixed with the ridiculous situation gives him energy some fake `sense of life'. There he meets the beautiful Marla. My heart jumped with joy. There was some kindred spirit. They should fall in love, marry, settle down, have some kids live happily (more or less) ever after. That is what I want (I know I am the one who is sick but this is what watching classic Hollywood movies did to me.) It would have been perfect. Unfortunately the film would have been over after fifteen minutes. That is why our hero first has to go to point zero. And he does it by establishing this Fight Club and moving in with lovely Brad. Okay, why not. But does it have to be terror organisation next? Come on. What is the point of the whole thing? You enjoyed the film? Punch yourself on the nose and start thinking. Or even better stop pretending that you do. The schizophrenia angle was rather foreseeable but the happy ending was okay. Like I said... the two hours in between where at best annoying at worst...

But here's why the movie spoke to me -- it seems to me that the filmmakers, whether consciously or not, are saying that people who grow up with no moral or spiritual compass to guide them will eventually be morally and spiritually bankrupt.Tyler even says this in one of the scenes (something along the lines of ""our fathers are our role models for God.  And if they left us, what does that say about God?"").  Pow.  Tyler believes God's no longer in the picture, so he can do whatever the heck he wants.  Tyler represents people who've grown up with no belief in God or any sort of values system that He handed down, and that lack of belief is ultimately what leads to his extreme behavior.

I've never been more impressed with editing and storytelling done so stylish yet clearly readable at the same time. Every shot has a mood. Every cut is perfect. Every poetically narrated line is memorable. Every scene is profound. The strange music gets you into the original mood that the film emulates. Every character is defined. You can relate to every character in some way, whether it be a bit of yourself or a bit of someone you closely know. This film, if you're open enough to pay attention to its meaning, will set you free of the burden of becoming a pack rat trapped in the rat race.

657,Turin_Horse,"A dark, intriguing and haunting film about.... NOTHING!!!",2,27 September 2013,"So, there was once a loser, a guy who is so depressed and alienated by society and his job that he has to join different self-help groups, even though he does not suffer from the conditions of the attendants, just to find some human warmth. Suddenly an unfortunate incident leaves him homeless, and he turns to a recently met friend for help. This means a dramatic change in his life, his friend is handsome, strong, full of self-confidence, charismatic, bold, audacious, that is, just the opposite from him, and the one he would maybe like to become. And his friend opens for him a sort of liberation path, through fight!, the most basic and primitive of human instincts; first between them, then starting a club of fighters who meet every week to release their life frustrations through violence and direct hand-to-hand combat. The other most primitive human instinct, sex, appears abruptly too, but it's not him, but his friend whom becomes the sex partner of the girl he likes. Most of the film time is spent in the development of the fight club, which gets bigger, with some of its members going to live to the friend house (much to the displeasure of the protagonist), and then finally turning into a sort of protest/sabotage/terrorist group.And suddenly his friend disappears, and in his search for him the protagonist discovers that his friend founded many other fight clubs in other cities. And here the ""great"" moment of the film comes!... the protagonist discovers that his friend is actually... himself!!, it is a fictional personage created by his own mind, the person he would like to be, the embodiment of his ambitions, of everything he admires... and hates all at once, the fictional being through whom he takes revenge on the senseless world he lives in. And thus we are forced to completely change our perspective and interpret the whole story under a totally new point of view, and it is just then when we realize the story we have been told is about.... NOTHING AT ALL!!!.... liberation through violence and sex?? oh yeah! we might believe that if the end of the film showed us something different from a guy meekly pleading his lady to come back with him, something different form a guy horrified at the tragical consequences the acts of violence he has promoted have had. Regret from having departed so much from the established social order?? it just does not make sense.Then we start to think of the internal coherence of the story, and we find so many plot holes and so much inconsistency that the whole film literally deflates into nothing but a bunch of senseless violent scenes and a ridiculously pretentious and void criticism-against-the-system message.Probably one of the most overrated films at IMDb, a perfect example of a film which should have never been made.",Fight Club
658,alishahmohd,Honestly did not enjoy this movie at all......,5,18 November 2013,"Fight Club is regarded as a fantastic movie and it is currently rated in the IMDb top ten. I guess this was supposed to be a movie for a specific generation, or for the people who were actively watching films in 1999. I still to this day do not understand what all the fuss is about? Yes this film is different from the traditional action and drama films but just because its different, it doesn't mean its good let alone fantastic or a work of art. Now this movie is supposed to be a representation, imagination or fragmentation Edward Norton's character the unnamed narrator and the movie in almost its entirety is his imagination including all the characters you see appear in the film including Brad Pitt. So basically this movie follows the ""It was all a dream"" concept where whatever you see is not real. I do not mind the idea if it is presented properly but this movie takes this concept to extremely ridiculous levels, where I have a hard time deciding if this film is supposed to be a drama film, an action film or fantasy.Fight Club has too many weird moments, unnecessary violence, Edward going bonkers and crippling and destroying another man during a fight for almost no reason at all. The film also has some disgusting scenes like the Fat guy with bigger chest than girls with implants that's disgusting, and made me want to turn off the film, not because there was a fat guy but I was disgusted how terrible this film portrays such people as if they are aliens. The plot is hardly a saving grace, it starts out promising, with people who are depressed are seeking help that could have been a good and interesting premise to base the film upon, but the more the plot progresses, the worse and the more ridiculous it gets. After the first 30 minutes this film was a torture to sit through. The ending was also nonsensical to me because I think the entire premise of this film is flawed from the start. The Narrator can't kill Tyler directly so he shoots himself so Tyler dies because Tyler was what Edward wanted to be. Whatever don't spend too much time thinking over that. The only saving grace is the acting of the lead actors Norton and Pitt. Edward Norton is really into the character at least he did the best he could with the script he was given to work with, despite all the ridiculous moments, Norton's good performance breathes some life into the movie. Brad Pitt also does a commendable job as Tyler although I did not like Tyler, I felt like Brad was at least trying.

660,isaiahwilson15,Fight Club is the perfect example of what a book to movie adaptation should be!,9,20 October 2015,"Thanks to its unusually gritty yet emotional tone and an all time great plot twist, Fight Club is able to differentiate itself from many other sub-par book to movie adaptations. It's status even goes beyond a simply great movie adaptation, thanks to its clever dialogue, which helps keep the feel of a drama movie. Unlike most other dramas that often come across as boring, Fight Club is able to take its a rather abstract theme, and portray it in a way that is both visually and mentally pleasing. Many of the best moments in the film are the insightful conversations that take place between ""The Narrator"" and ""Tyler Durden"". Then the film reaches its highest point when it forces you to piece together all the little details that have popped up throughout the movie. Then of course there are the fights. The fights extremely brutal, and even seem excessively gory at times, yet they still leave the viewer craving more! The only issue have found with the movie concerns its abstract plot. At times, the theme of the movie tended to kinda go over my head, but in no way did this take away from my overall experience!

661,constructionbob,"It's either incredibly intelligent, or incredibly stupid.",8,19 June 2000,"After watching this film, and beginning to puzzle over just what the heck I'd seen, the above came to be my conclusion.  This film has a lot to say-and it is, for the most part, a scathing and accurate critique on our materialistic society.  The narrator has a void in his life, that he finds he can't fill with more things.  However, the movie steadily gets more chaotic, perhaps on purpose, as he begins to fill that void with self-destruction/anarchy instead.  It's scary, and it's supposed to be, so I did not fault the movie on this.  I don't mind a movie not coming to a clear plan of action after its running time.  Complex social directives are not going to be spanned/solved in 2 hours+, and this particular one is no exception.Perhaps my biggest problem with the film was that confusion resulting from the anarchy, however.  It's like the movie wanted it both ways-it wanted to rail against the chaos and mindlessness of Tyler's Fight Club, and the resulting ""Project Mayhem"", but still offering such a bleak world that that chaos may be the only way out.  It's the same unnaturally hopeless feeling I get from Hardy's ""Jude the Obscure"", though that may be an unfair comparison.  Then again, Hardy may have enjoyed this movie, who knows...I can't finish this review without commenting on the *surprise* ending, though a responsible covering of said ending would involve spoilers, so I'll be vague.  Suffice it to say that it's somewhat of a copout, and makes much of the rest of the movie make even less sense than it did before.  It creates plot holes where there shouldn't be.  Maybe it worked better in the novel, but I don't know.  In closing, I'll just say that whatever you think about this movie, you'll probably break the first two rules of Fight Club over it.  And in this idea-starved climate, maybe that makes it worthwhile watching on its own.",Fight Club

Not only does it improve on several aspects of the book, but it is also visually stunning. It's like ""2001"" without outer space.

""Don't talk about Fight Club."" What is the second rule of Fight Club? ""Don't talk about Fight Club."" The first two rules of Fight Club are the same--remember the first two rules. The major plot twist (people who have seen the film or have read the book know what I'm talking about) makes ""Fight Club"" an original, instant cult classic, right up there with ""A Clockwork Orange"", ""Night of the Living Dead"", and other cult classics. Many who have seen the film don't follow the rules. If you have seen the film, keep your mouth shut when people who haven't seen it (and who want to see it) are around. Don't ruin this great film for them.But there is more to ""Fight Club"". It is a satire on life in the present day. It comments on consumerism and who we conceive ourselves to be. ""This is your life, and it's ending one minute at a time."" Tyler says he doesn't want to die without any scars, well, neither do I.

665,rkeaney,My Review - Fight Club (1999),10,11 November 2006,"this movie is absolutely amazing!I mean seriously how many movies can u say that every time you watch it it gets better... The answer- a very small number...Fight Club is to me an amazing piece of cinema..The thing about truly great cinema as i have observed first hand by recommending this movie to friends and family members is that you will always get mixed reviews and maybe it will only be a small percentage sometimes.. but almost always a great movie will get through to someone..Fight Club for me is that type of movie...This is one of my all time favourites.I'm not going to divulge in to the whole plot of this movie as i believe it must be seen first hand to be truly appreciated.The Writing is superb as is the acting,also this movie contains one of the most thought provoking twists i have ever seen in a movie which i think is a key aspect to movie greatness.. something that will truly make u think and grasp your attention.The underlying theme of this movie i think will play a very strong role in making peoples decisions and opinions of this movie.As the underlying theme will clash with peoples morals,peoples way of life,and peoples basic opinions as human beings.No one can say that if someone told you that all of your material possessions were absolutely useless to you and u only need basic things to get real happiness out of life ,that you would agree 100% with them,there would always be a tiny thing that we love that we wouldn't , and couldn't cope with losing.. this movie brings the basic fear to life and shows us that we really don't need all these material objects..This , i think scares people..it scares people because a lot of people will not want to be influenced by a movie but some will embrace it and realise that its a movie with a very valid point. i am one of those people..Some people will not like this movie for very different reasons and some will love it for other reasons also.By No Means can i say that this is the greatest movie ever.. because you can draw different opinions and views of every movie for one reason or another.There is all types of great movies such as epic,comedy,romance etc... but movies like these are also in that category movies such as Fight club,American Beauty,etc..If You haven't already i urge you to go and see this great movie hopefully like me you will not be disappointed ..10/10-Amazing!!",Fight Club
666,Snatchy,Another Fincher fairy tale,1,14 August 2000,"I've heard many people say (and seen many reviews written) that Fight Club is a classic.  Mind blowing.  Completely fresh.  Sorry, but I just don't see it.  I'll start with the positives.  Ed Norton and Brad Pitt were excellent. Pitt perfectly captures the super-cool, no attachments, nothing-to-lose attitude that so many young guys have before they get old and come back down to earth.  Norton is also perfect as the uptight, frustrated yuppie bored with life's vapidity.  Even Helena Bonham Carter, who I normally don't much care for, was okay in the generic girlfriend role.Now on to the negatives.  The story is just utterly preposterous.  Maybe even more so than Fincher's last absurd movie, The Game.  The movie really lost all believability when Fight Club turns into the cult, Project Mayhem. Although it has a nice twist ending with the Pitt/Norton dynamic, I couldn't buy that they could get legions of grown men to become such mindless, fanatical followers.  Pitt's charismatic, but not nearly charismatic to cover up the fact his philosophy is tired and his idea of subversion is nothing except vandalism and petty theft.  The movie has pretensions of making a statement about consumerism but I thought it made them pretty succintly with the intro where Norton describes his perfect condo, filled with things he really didn't need.  Everything else is overkill.  And the final big plan to blow up (I won't say what in case you haven't seen the movie yet) in order to level the world playing field is...well....pointless. Just like The Game, Fincher takes some good parts and sews them into a tapestry of mediocrity.  I give it 6 out of 10.",Fight Club
667,TheMovieeGuy,"Quite simply, the best film of 1999!",10,27 March 2002,"Wow, unlike the very OVERRATED American Beauty, which won the best picture Oscar (What was the academy thinking?!), 1999's other film about mid-life crises, Fight Club, at least had the guts to say what was on it's mind without the complete hypocrisy found in American Beauty! Sure, Fight Club used anarchy to prove the point that American society is based on commericalism, but at least it wasn't hypocritical like American Beauty was! Great acting from Brad Pitt and Edward Norton, great social commentary, and great direction from the always terrific David Fincher makes Fight Club the best film of 1999! A 10 on a scale o 1-10!",Fight Club
668,Stroheim-3,The Most Distubing Movie I have Ever Seen,7,19 October 1999,"Slowly the face of film has been changing.  I guess it may go back to the structure of Annie Hall and that one little scene that was entirely animated.  Recently, the generic structure of films has been changing with the success of both Rushmore and Election; it is obvious that the look of movies is changing.  Then comes Fight Club.If this is what we have in store for the next millenium, count me in.  The look alone is worth the $8.25 I paid for this film.  From the microscopic, CGI tracking shots through the strange interludes and fantasy sequences, David Fincher took me on a wild ride from which I'm still trying to recover.The cast all gave brilliant performances.  There wasn't one point in the entire film that I thought ""hey, that's (stick name of star here)!""  They became their character.  Even Meat Loaf who has had a string of crap recently is awesome in his role as a testicular cancer patient who is looking for a release from his frustration and anger.Thus is the point of the film.  Fincher paints us a portrait of a group of men who are sick and tired of their lives.  Like Kevin Spacey in American Beauty, they are frustrated with their jobs and their bosses and their lives in general.  Everyone knows what it's like to be just so stressed out and pissed that you just need to hit something!!! ... and hit something they do. Fight Club gives these men an outlet to let out their aggression in an orderly fashion.  They move from Superego to Ego; their fights have rules!!!Now (SPOILER ALERT!!!!)... this movie does not glorify violence.  Once Fight Club becomes out of hand and starts moving into the realm of anarchy, any idiot can see that this is not cool.  These men, these Ego figures, become the Id - they essentially become Nazis.  They make soap out of humans, they all shave their heads and they are totally dressed in black.  I think of fascism.  Again, they become tools except now, instead of being tools of society, they are tools of their own collective Id.The disturbing part of this film is that the line between healthy aggression and unhealthy aggression is so finely drawn.  The characters move from one to other so seemlessly that you almost don't even notice it (like the subliminal frames in the movie).  In addition, why do you think Edward Norton's character isn't given a name?Put yourself in his position... that could be you.",Fight Club

The plot and the ending sure were different from other cheezy Hollywood Block Busters. I also admire the director and the actors for making a movie that many of directors and actors wouldn't have done.  Norton's acting was good but Pitt was bit pretencious, not that I'm jealousy of his good looking or anything.  The first opening scene was cool but that was it.  I was offended by most of the nasty violence especially for the ending scene. Beside the vilonce, this movie's motto is not different from other cynical movies that assert the world is not fair and screw it.  If David Fincher was totally indifferent to succeed at box office and make a culture film, he could've used an actor who might look less good but has a better acting skill than Pitt. If anyone wants to see see a sick, but meaningful movie, I would recommand Train Spotting.",Fight Club

676,iF....,One of the most bashed GOOD movies of the 90s,8,19 March 2000,"I saw Fight Club opening night without wanting to go see it. A friend of mine pressured me to go with him so I did. When we were in the theater I was complaining about how bad this movie was going to be, mainly because these types of movies are not my taste. By the time the movie was over I was left speechless. The first thing that came to my mind was that from now on I was going to see every movie directed by David Fincher.Fight Club is filled with so much energy its not even funny. It makes the audience want to be in the movie. The direction is absolute perfection. Fincher certainly has an eye for cinematography. Everything is composed so beautifully, with the help of computer generated graphics it makes the film seem even darker and more impressive. Ed Norton has never been better as an actor. His performance as an insomniac is pure perfection. I'm positive enough to say that he will never be as good as he was in this film. Helena Bonham Carter is as usual, beautiful. In Fight Club it comes to show how the power of makeup can change a person's appearance. To many people her look may seem repulsive, but I think she looks attractive despite her role, I dug it. All I can say is that without her Fight Club isn't the same. Brad Pitt is a macho guy who is pretty much Ed Norton's character alter ego. I can't really comment on him, don't like the guy that's all.All I can really say is that Fight Club is quite possibly one of the most energetic and memorable movies of the 1990s. Everything an entertaining movie needs is right here. Looking for a good time, look no further. Unfortunately this wasn't nominated for any Academy Awards which it truly deserved. If you ask me, Fight Club can kick American Beauty's ass any day! Like every other person out there, I thought the Academy Award nominees for the 99-year movies were terrible. Fight Club was the best picture of 1999",Fight Club

I noticed from the beginning of the titles, with the rock 'n' roll in the background, that it would be good without a doubt.  The first twenty minutes were very interesting, and the next hour after that was so intriguing, I thought I was in love.Soon after, however, things got a little bizarre, and that comfy, welcoming atmosphere was beginning to vanish.  The plot was becoming stranger and stickier by the moment.  I'm not sure if the shocking ending, which seem to be so popular these days, struck me as cool or disappointing.  It left me with an awe which would keep me thinking about it for days.The acting is fun, with plenty of fighting for the guys and enough of Pitt for the girls.  It shouldn't be considered mediocre or below for any young people out there at all.  It certainly wasn't for me.

681,kenvandenbussche-2,Many people will disagree with my comment on this film. But I will fight for my right ...,5,21 October 2007,"Just like that other Brad Pitt-movie ""12 monkeys"", ""Fight club"" is so weird that it becomes hard to fully enjoy it. Both movies are considered classics, yet I fail to see why. A few years back, I thought these were truly awful but in time I learned to appreciate them a little more. Still: I simply cannot shed that feeling of disappointment and therefore, to this date, I don't consider either one of them to be as brilliant as some other classics such as for example: ""Pulp fiction"" or ""Memento""And it all started so well. The story is about a man who suffers from insomnia and desperately tries to escape his boring existence. He meets a charismatic soap salesman and starts organizing the ultimate form of excitement with him; which they call Fight Clubs. These are hidden places where normal young men fistfight each other to get rid of whatever aggravation they possess. The liberating effect of these brutal fights actually brings these men closer together and is the beginning of a very strong yet dangerous companionship.The huge plot twist of this dark and controversial movie is as unexpected as the one of ""The usual suspects"", but that doesn't mean that it is just as good. Basically: this change is so bizarre and far-fetched that it almost entirely destroys the movie for me. I simply couldn't bring myself into believing that a thing like that could actually happen. Also: looking back at everything that had transpired before, I sincerely felt that it just didn't make any sense anymore. Furthermore: I hate movies that create a beautiful truth and then tear it all apart instead of letting you enjoy it a little more. I like surprises when watching a movie, but I don't like being left empty-handed at the end of a movie. I find such dishonest endings to be a huge letdown almost every single time.The acting of the two leading men is good, but I have seen a lot better by both. Edward Norton's finest performances will most likely always be in the two-faced court drama ""Primal fear"" and the classic, shocking ""American history X"". I also like him much better in some of his other movies such as ""25th hour"" and ""The score"". Maybe his character in this film wasn't interesting enough but something about his acting didn't quite get the fullest of my attention. On the other hand: there's Brad Pitt who's acting seemed better, but even he did far more compelling stuff in ""se7en"" and ""12 monkeys"". The best acting performance in this movie however came from Helena Bonham Carter. I had never seen anything quite like this from her and she was really good. There's also Meat Loaf in the unusual role of Bob.In short: If it weren't for the obscure darkness near the end, I would probably like this movie a lot better. It certainly is a unique movie and that seemingly makes up for an interesting experience, but the weirdness of it all gets in the way at some point. I personally lost touch with this film because some things don't seem to add up here. Nevertheless: I will always recommend this movie for those who are open-minded and eager for something new.",Fight Club
682,rickytrapp,Brilliant. Masterpiece. Soap.,10,9 June 2010,"Fight Club. What can you say about Fight Club. It's awesome? Not enough. Brilliant? Not there yet. Should've won Academy Awards for Best Picture, Director, Actor, Supporting Actor, Supporting Actress and Adapted Screenplay? You're on the right track. Stay with me and I will run you through the whys.Why should it have be nominated for Best Adapted Screenplay? Not just because it was adapted from a novel written by Chuck Palahniuk, because it spoke to a generation that understood all the philosophical bullcrap that came out of Tyler Durden's and the Narrator's mouths. But the philosophical bullcrap actually makes sense and shows perfectly each character's state of mind.Why should it have be nominated for Best Supporting Actress? Helena Bonham Carter was the only person who could've played Marla Singer. No one else could have acted as perfectly in the role as she did. As probably the only main female character in the film, she performs just as well as the rest of the male cast.Why for Best Supporting Actor? It should need no explanation. When you finish watching Fight Club, what do you remember most about the film? Brad Pitt. As Tyler Durden, he is more than perfect. He is the spokesperson for rebellious outcasts, a role that has done many times before, none as good as Pitt who immerses himself into the role. Slick, cool and crazy, it is undeniably one of the best performances of all time.Best Actor? Edward Norton matches Brad Pitt's performance with the key component of subtlety. Norton gives the performance of his career as the Narrator, a guy who has taken so much crap, he doesn't really give a damn. His performance as the Narrator tops his other brilliant performances in Primal Fear, Red Dragon and even American History X.Best Director? Fincher took Chuck Palahniuk's twisted novel and twisted it even more to make a world of his own vision. Without Fincher, this movie wouldn't be the same. It wouldn't be the same cult classic that a lot of people come to love and worship.If you put all of these element's together, you get Best Picture. A story of violence, philosophy and soap. Fantastic direction, amazing cast and a brilliant screenplay put the pieces together.There you have it.

I looked at IMDb's top 250 and I was familiar and unfamiliar with some of the films on that list. I decided to watch some of the films on that list and I wanted to watch Fight Club first because it just attracted me in ways I can't explain. Watching Fight Club was an amazing and great experience. The movie is about 2 hours and 30 minutes long, but for me, it actually felt like the whole film was an hour and a half long! One of the many great things about Fight Club are the acting. Edward Norton and Brad Pitt have oscar worthy performances in this film, and they are very different and unique characters. Helena Bonham Carter has very good acting in this film as well, and her and Brad Pitt are the funniest things in this movie. This film is probably one of the best dark comedies ever. The camera work in this film is outstanding. The zooms, the wide angle shots, and every frame in this film is beautiful. The ideas that Brad Pitt's character expresses are very thought provoking, and proves that this film has the style and the substance as well. The soundtrack is very catchy and the editing is also praise worthy. The twist (that I won't spoil) is also executed in such a creative way, it is one of the best parts of this film and it gives this movie rewatchability. I showed this film to one of my family members, and she said that the film was satisfying. I actually 100% agree with her because all of the lines that are said and the things that happen in this film all add up and gives out the sense of satisfaction.

Mostly, however, it is about grown men beating each other into gumbo, because the actual meat of the movie barely touches on that. Essentially, it is a little bit of philosophy wrapped up in a lot of very, very bloody boxing. There's something suspect about the whole matter.It's a rush, sure, but if they wanted to film a WCW match, why did they feel the need to wrap some half-baked quasi-New Age ideas around it? I fear that a bunch of guys around the country will miss the spirit-vs-flesh angle and decide that this fighting thing is Way Cool, Man, and will set up little Fight Clubs in their basements until they all die from internal hemorrhaging.

We can only deceive ourselves to vent our desires on the lifeless commodities that are more inferior to us in this society. Our initial dreams were broken up, and then distributed to bits and pieces of commodities. Like Edward Norton in the Fight Club began to buy furniture with passion, our pursuit has evolved day by day: a beautiful dress; an expensive short trip; a brand-name car; a luxurious apartment ... As Tyler described, we are all already enslaved by material, although our most primitive subconsciousness still seems to have resistance. But it seems that we can only use matter to paralyze our fragile and perhaps sensitive nerves.Tyler's preaching is not superstitious, because Tyler itself belongs to the most illusory existence in this world. He has no entity, but it is real. Because of this, he can easily say: ""Nothing can represent you, your clothes can't, your car can't, where you live can't ..."" Because in fantasy, he can easily have everything He can look handsome, easily wear beautiful clothes, drive beautiful cars, sleep beautiful women, and live beautiful lives.

Tyler itself is a contradiction. In fact, that Tyler may only be the one that Edward Norton in the film made that he can't eat grapes and said that the grape acid is vented. Just like some of our subconscious minds have vented when we have no sense of ourselves. Material venting is no longer enough to paralyze Edward Norton's nerves in the film, and he has never been able to break free of his restraint. Only through fantasy can he get a little relief. He not only imagined a Tyler image to help what he actually wanted to accomplish. Like many people, I also believe that he imagined the whole so-called story. I believe no one will think that the story will be true.",Fight Club

Due to the buildup I expected something pretty good. My enthusiasm went progressively downhill as I watched the story develop and when Ed Norton performs the revealing scene (Which I suppose I should not describe here) I felt like pulling the tape out right there, I was that insulted. I am struck with jaw dropping amazement at the vote results here in IMDB. What possible value does this movie have to place it higher than so many great films in the top 250 list? I have a feeling that this flick speaks to the 16 to 21 year old male (the same group that the worlds armies traditionally love to make eager immortal uncritical soldiers from). I would like to see a demographic breakdown of the registered voters in IMDB. I get the impression that a hoard of enthusiastic male youths flooded the IMDB with high votes immediately after the release of this puerile tale. Oh well, if you want to vote this sloppy trash highly, knock yourself out.",Fight Club
697,pgear83,Amazing Satire and Philosophy,10,7 June 2008,"Undeniably one of the best films of the tremendous cinematic year that was 1999, David Fincher's Fight Club is a cultural landmark. Chuck Palahniuk's acerbic first novel (and still the best the 5 of his books that I've read) is visualized with Fincher's stylistic creativity and the result is a modern classic.Edward Norton plays a white collar stiff, whose life is so nondescript that he is known only as The Narrator. He acknowledges that he is mired in shallow consumerism; a slave to the ""IKEA nesting instinct."" He is also an insomniac and can only find catharsis and sleep after sitting in on 12-step program meetings for dying people. This strategy fails, however, when Marla Singer (Helena Bonham Carter) pulls the same stunt and ruins the reality that he has found. After an explosion that destroys the narrator's apartment, he moves in with soap salesmen and revolutionary Tyler Durden (Brad Pitt). Together, they start an underground society in which men reject civilization and unleash their primal urges upon each other.Fight Club is often described as anti-consumerism or anti-establishment. There are, however, two less talked about ideas that I take away from it. The first is the conflict between biology and society. Sitting on a bus, the protagonists see a rather gaudy advertisement for Gucci underwear. Durden asks derisively, ""Is that what a man looks like?"" I would argue that it is the insidious nature of the consumer culture, that it actually emasculates men by tapping into their male drives. It is the natural role of the male to be the hunter/gatherer, so buying things has become the modern incarnation of this. Another example of this interplay occurs when the narrator described how his father would leave his family to start a new one every six years. ""Setting up franchises,"" says Durden. Interestingly, the behavior described here does approximate the behavior of human males, pre-civilization. The short average duration of modern marriages suggests the hard-wired nature of this behavior. The fight club, however, is an outright rejection of modern society, in which men revel in short bouts of non-lethal violence, perhaps as they were meant to. When these urges are bottled up, it may not be too much of a stretch to suggest that the result can be wars and genocide.There are also, I believe, religious implications to the fight club and to Project Mayhem. Tyler Durden's philosophy seems to be part anarchism and part determinism, behaviorism and materialism (in the metaphysical sense; certainly not in the consumerist sense). He is about three parts B.F. Skinner and one part Henry David Thoreau. It is those facets of Skinner-type philosophy that are of the most interest to me and that Durden espouses most fervently. Like any good materialist, he utterly rejects the notion that human beings have any special worth. He extols to his followers: ""You are not a beautiful or unique snowflake. You are the same decaying organic matter as everything else... We are all part of the same compost heap."" Yet ironically, in supposedly freeing his followers from consumerism, he makes them slaves to his own purposes. They are shaved to become like the oft-mentioned sacrificial ""space monkeys."" They are removed of their names (this has a very anti-Christian feel to, since the having of and giving of names by humans is considered an important gift from God among the most meticulous followers of that religion). ""Sooner or later we all became what Tyler wanted us to be,"" says the narrator. Durden also expropriates the idea of 'hitting bottom' as the beginning of salvation (the 12-step program is a fundamentally religious construct), further casting him as a sort of Anti-Christian. B.F. Skinner suggested that understanding the science of human behavior was the key to controlling that behavior benevolently. Similarly, Durden exerts control over his followers for what he believes are good ends. Whatever the merits of those ends, there is no doubt that Tyler, in some ways, becomes very much like the corporate fascists he despises.Finally, Fight Club is a definitively 'male' movie. This is neither good nor bad, but it is undeniable. The character of Marla is entertaining, but almost entirely defined by her relationship to the two male protagonists. The picture would have almost worked without her. The idea of castration is presented as a deeply held male fear and is used skillfully throughout the movie. If we can take one thing away from this film, it would be the danger of denying the difference in biology between males and females. Males have a need for some level of violence and it is important that we have acceptable outlets for it. Conversely, it is interesting to take note of some of the ways in which society attempts to homogenize the sexes. Take the idea of ""paternity leave"" for new fathers - it's great in theory and it should certainly be an option, but I can almost guarantee that it will never become the norm, because it is a practice that is just so contrary to our deeply ingrained biological drives. To deny this is the height of naivety and will do no one any good.Overall, Fight Club makes my top 10 list for superb acting (especially by Norton, the best American actor of his generation), great humor and satire and its excellent script, thanks largely to the excellent source material. To conclude, I'll quote the deterministic, yet strangely comforting words of Chuck Palahniuk, from near the end of Fight Club (the book): ""We are not special. We are not crap or trash either. We just are. We just are, and what happens just happens.""",Fight Club

Fight Club may be controversial, but that's probably because many people don't like looking too deep below the surface. As satire, as pure entertainment, as social commentary, Fight Club excels. It's not a smooth ride, and there may be some suspension of disbelief required to take it all in, but isn't that one of the things that fiction is all about?

The story of a bored and depressed man that starts an underground fight club to feel something is very interesting and watching the characters go at each other fists first is so freeing.The plot is great and the ending of the movie is absolutely fenomenal.

It centers around this unnamed main character, as he battles to gain a taste and feel for life. He meets and befriends a guy named Tyler Durden, who ultimately steers that battle towards the forces that he thinks stand in the way. There is a prevailing sense of empty progression through the story, because quite frankly not a whole happens in terms of plot. So in the end you're left with a lot of style and not a whole lot of substance, which is ironic considering that is pretty much what the characters bemoan in the first place.

704,DerBarenJude,"Incredible movie about life, fighting, and masculinity/femininity",10,26 November 2004,"Fight Club's simple title, aptly chosen by the author, betrays the extremely relevant tones that the film conveys. The film, one of the better adapted movies from a novel, offers social commentaries so scathing and obvious that they will most likely force you to reconsider your daily routine and lifestyle.Possible spoilers.The movie's main character, quite appropriately, has no name. He is instead referred to by the pseudonyms that he provides while crashing various self-help groups. His motive for doing so, insomnia, serves as the focal point for the film's plot. The narrator/main character, while seemingly asleep, actually becomes the founder of a national organization of everyday people who defy society in multiple ways: picking fights with innocent people, setting up underground fight clubs, and even destruction of corporate symbols. The main goal of the film is to take society's clichés and stereotypes and reexamine them, hoping to decipher the truth about why we have so quickly and wholeheartedly embraced them. The places this movie takes you will shock and astonish you in several ways. The plot is only increased by the perfectly appropriate and understated performances of Brad Pitt and Edward Norton, respectively.

I still remember the first time I saw him, the end is the extremely insightful, even though inspired by the book - which also i read - the film knows to be very well suited, and managed to pass all a sensational way.The acting is also a high point of the plot, Brad Pitt in one of his best performances, alongside Snatch. Norton has in Fight Club, for me, his best performance overcoming Red Dragon - I think very good. Besides other highlights, such as Helena Carter and other secondary actors.Now, one of the most amazing things is that you do not get tired of seeing it.

But when I've seen it for the second time (even if I wasn't keen of it, friend made me) – all bits and pieces came in their places and I've realized that this is the best movie ever made. Unlike most movies today, this one makes you think. You may enjoy it without being anarchist, whore, drug addict, uneducated, aggressive, neo Nazi and everything else that caring 1star givers classified us. It's their problem they want from movie to be linear, classical thriller, to have logical plot, believable characters etc. It's their problem that only conclusion they can come up with is that ""this will make stupid people that are on the edge, to blow up buildings and deliver pain"" or ""it portrays sadistic violence, anarchy and terrorism in an appealing light and attempts to make it seem intelligent; instead of what it is insanity"". If it isn't sad, it would be funny...People can't make difference between satire and critics on the one side and glorification on the other side...

707,tricksixxx,One of the best films of the time.,9,13 January 2006,"Fight Club will forever be a classic in my book. I have never quite seen a movie that so wonderfully grips every part of the human emotion and shakes it like the edgy camera seen in the film. Granted it's not some Million Dollar Baby drama with dying characters and tear filled moments of sorrow. It doesn't have women being abused and daddys dying of cancer. What is does have is some brilliant acting, a hard-nosed look at the reality of the every day average blue collar American, and redefines the meaning of mentally insane. This movie stands on the edge and creates a new genre for itself. The script is crafted spectacularly and the plot is so interesting, you will have trouble pausing it for a quick bathroom break. The violence does not try to hide from it's importance in the movie, and the dark gritty feel of the camera matches the setting and tempo of the film with perfection. Never in my lifetime have I seen a movie so artistic and genuinely intriguing. While there are still a few better movies to date, this one ranks up there as one of the best films ever made. 9/10",Fight Club

By the time Oct. 15 came around I was so pumped up for it I became almost obsessed with it before I even saw it.  Then, when I did see it, I really became obsessed. 
This movie was one of the most original movies I've seen in a good while.  I especially enjoyed Brad Pitt as Tyler Durden.  He can play the scummiest person and still make me love his character.  Ed Norton is equally remarkable as the lead role of the Narrator(Jack).  These two had a great chemistry together.  I could watch them go about their daily life for weeks upon weeks.  I was completely enthralled by the events of their days and nights.  The visual work was dark and grimy in most parts which brought out the seediness of the city and it's inhabitants.

Someone commented that ""This film is the voice of disillusionment, of realising that the world we live in places unrealistic hopes and expectations on our lives and goals.""  Excuse me, no: WE place them.  Nobody is responsible for the choices we make in our lives but us.  Norton's character--and anybody like him--is trapped only by his inability to make those necessary choices in his life.  And the answer isn't anarchy.  While the ending is somewhat disappointing and goofy, at least the film has the intelligence to recognize that fact.  Fight Club is a very well done movie, with an intoxicating visual style, compelling script, and performances that will blow your hair back.  But lest anyone miss it, what Tyler espouses *is* a bad thing, for the individual and society, and that's the real moral of the movie.

712,deputydoofus,A cinematic thrillride and a warning to society. Two great movies that don't necessarily gel together.,8,14 February 2000,"Fight Club is the type of move that jumps up and screams ""I'm a good movie."" It offers so many good ideas and so many cinematic elements that it creates one heck of a wild ride.  It is a film that reveals the plot pieces so delicately that you have to care about what's happening.Fight Club is a thoughtful movie that thinks it could work best as a thriller disguised as an intellectual movie.  The ideas are used to distract the viewer from trying to understand the underlying plot details.  The ending is a bit of a stretch...to say the least.  The somewhat bizarre chemistry between the two leads ends up slapping the viewer in the face. This is a good thing, however, but it is very difficult in determining if this has anything to do with the ideas.  Perhaps there are some underlying thoughts to this deception, but I thought it was a bit of a distraction from determining why the movie was made.There are certain thoughts I thought were very valuable in determining the purpose of the movie.  When Tyler gives the Fight Club members an assignment to get in a fight with an ordinary person and lose, the Norton character says, ""This is not as easy as you think, because most ordinary, normal people would do anything possible to avoid being in a fight.""  There is a breath of relief in this statement, and it says that most people are not the people in Fight Club.  However, the knowledge that there are enough people that could cause a terrible revolution is terribly frightening.  The best part of this idea is the culminating scene between Norton and his boss that turns out to be the most humorous and just downright worthwhile scenes of the past year.Many people have said that Fight Club is corrupting our youth, and, yes, there has been a new upheaval of violent fight clubs spawning throughout the country since the movie's release.  Whether it has something to do with the movie, I have no idea.  I think we've been building up to it, through the violence our children see through movies, news, and on shows that present violent and aggressive characters as role models, like WWF and WCW wrestling.  Perhaps Fight Club is more of a warning than an attempt to cause trouble.  The authors have a somewhat resentment to the societal factors that deprive humans of obeying their nature.  It is a call out to say that perhaps our image of the ""perfect society"" is not attainable.  Deprive people of what comes natural, and there will be a nasty, unhealthy revolution.  This can be used as a metaphor to the movie industry itself. After a prohibition by a board of ethics in the late '30s decided what would be appropriate to show in the movies, movie makers were angered for not being able to show their entire artistic vision.  As time went by, filmmakers became so fed up with these restrictions that they started breaking and bending the rules wherever they could, without realizing the ethical consequences.  The moviegoers went to see these movies because they had never been able to see them.  No one really cared about what the negative repercussions would be from showing these movies, or whether these movies would make the world more perverted or violent.  So now, we have Fight Club, a movie that is about the negative backlashes drawn from a deprivation of human nature, presented in a form that tries to break from the restrictions of film.  The movie is overly violent, but I think that is part of the point.  I don't think it criticizes the violence it portrays because it allows us to understand the thinking behind the violence. Instead, it exists on screen to wake the viewer up, and say ""This is what society is becoming.  Is this what we want?  Are our solutions ever likely of determining the goals?""  Fight club is definitely against restrictions, and that is apparent both in the plot of the movie and the actual existence of the movie itself.The main criticisms I have against this movie deal with the fact that the blend of cinema and ideas don't seem to quite come together in any cohesive fashion.  The cinema distracts from the ideas while the ideas are used as a distraction for the cinema.  These are minor complaints, though, as there are so many valuable gifts from examining both of the film's elements.  My rating: 9/10",Fight Club

Even Brad Pitt puts in a good performance. Made me respect him as the pretty boy actor he is instead some guy who just looks good to all the chicks in the land. Ed Norton is the main man, though. He teams up with Pitt to form a club where beating the living (blank) out of each other is heaven. Every guy who seems run down and lost in the world and sees it wants to join. Soon they have a legion of guys at their disposal. that's when Tyler (Pitt) starts to put into action a series of terrorist actions against the city of Los Angelos. Meanwhile, Ed Norton's character is getting phased out more and more as it goes on and he starts to feel left out. From there all heck breaks loose.

It's the best combination of a great writer, great director, great actors, great music makers. And the outcome is a movie which needs to be watched 7-8 times to understand it. I watched it probably more than 8 times, and I still discover something new in the movie. Maybe a hidden frame, or an important word or sentence which I couldn't understand before. The enjoyment you'll get by watching it once is limited. You will like the movie more and more every time u see it and finally think it is the best movie ever made. There's no end to depth of the movie. And to my surprise, for the first time I see a movie is BETTER than its novel. The script writer took the novel, converted it into a movie script removing the boring and dull parts, and made it ready for an outstanding movie.

717,The_Real_Review,Overrated by wanna-be intellectuals,1,10 July 2004,"SPOILER!!! This is one of a few movies overrated by wanna-be intellectuals. The script is slick in that it disguises its propaganda. Propaganda you ask? Lets start off with the FACT that Edward Norton's character in this movie is psychotic and Brad Pitt's doesn't exist. Brad Pitt's character Tyler Durden is a figment of Norton's imagination because Norton's character is psychotic. This whole plot twist becomes even more aggravating when you realized you wasted over two hours watching a movie about a psychotic anarchist. The movie's message is great for impressionable kids; the system is against you so how to succeed is through violence in some cases terrorism. Please, spare me the rhetoric. I realize the movie is fiction but it does not excuse it. Even fiction should entertain; this just drags you down into the sewer and gives impressionable misguided kids bad ideas. Sort of what the Clock Work Orange did for racists and neo-Nazis.The people who watch this need to realize that for every person or corporation in society that is corrupt there are a large magnitude of corporations and people that are not. Society in general and Capitalism are not bad. Far from it, in society today whatever is bad is used as propaganda to generalize everything as bad. This movie does the same. It conveniently keeps out any opposing arguments for its purpose. Which is to portray sadistic violence, anarchy and terrorism in an appealing light and then attempt to make it seem intelligent, instead of what it really is - insanity. Capitalism is what has given the west it's high standard of living and life expectancy. No other economic system offers this prosperity.People are always searching for tips in life or tricks they could use because they do not have an imagination themselves. Movies like this are candy to someone with no imagination. Forensic science could easily determine if someone beat himself up or whether your boss did but then you blow the plot of this whole movie because where would Norton's character get all his funding? Instead some will feel they have a ""new"" way to black mail their boss, how pathetic. So much of the movie is laughable when you analyze it. Did I mention Tyler Durden, I mean Edward Norton's character intimidates a mobster? Please.This movie attempts to be smart and that is why it fails. Smart people do not punch themselves until they bleed, live in abandoned decrepit buildings or perform terrorist acts. Smart people also do not waste their time watching dumb movies like this over and over. They read books, go to college and learn how things really work.

Well, director David Fincher did. I went to the theatre and saw this movie with an open mind, confident with the notion that this would be a pure fighting action movie. However, I was dragged into a story blacker than night. It embraces widely, it puts its grip around consumerism - the Ikea generation where brands and advertising defines our identity as hollow and poor. We are left quivering with strength, but empty of something meaningful; that's the message of this story.Here we are trapped in a world of shopping culture, but is it about an identity crisis, some kind of revolution, or straight up terror? I couldn't really tell. The movie is quite surreal, a struggle between two people who become something totally different.Very good performances from the three main actors. The movie has a dark and visual power, and turned out to be quite disturbing, but it was very fascinating - and very good!",Fight Club
719,Bob_647,Grizzly psychological thriller with a side thrust twist.,9,28 June 2020,"Fight Club is one of the most unique films I have ever seen. In addition to presenting a rather fresh take on life, Fight Club also presents its material in a fresh way. My main interest in the film is in that, in my opinion, it does not present characters for us to think about. Rather, it presents actions for us to think about. I will say that I cannot recall ever having been asked by a film to both suspend my disbelief the way this film asks in its third act & at the same time come to terms with an understanding that there is no room--or need--for disbelief.Edward Norton stars as a depressed urban loner filled up to here with angst. He describes his world in dialogue of sardonic social satire. His life and job are driving him crazy. As a means of dealing with his pain, he seeks out 12 step meetings, where he can hug those less fortunate than himself and find catharsis in their suffering. It is not without irony that the first meeting he attends is for post-surgical victims of testicular cancer, since the whole movie is about guys afraid of losing their cone.This movie is literally the first time I ever came upon something that, at first sight seemed incredibly stylish, sophisticated and entertaining. The plot lured you in before turning you upside down, the acting was nothing short of perfect (has there ever been a more memorable character than Brad Pitt as Tyler Durden?), the music, the screenplay (based on what is now my all-time favorite book), the lighting, the pacing, the everything! Virtually everything about this movie took my by surprise, save for one man.David Fincher, director, was probably the only reason I went to see this movie in the first place. His work on 'Seven' and 'The Game' had me excited to see what he would do next, but I came to this movie expecting a stylish flick that offered a good plot and hopefully some good acting but what I got was so much, much more.Perhaps these comments will not make sense to the average movie goer who will dismiss this film--and, unfortunately, its premise--as another Hollywood flick filled with gratuitous violence. I'd go as far as to say that this film is not about violence. It is about choices. It is about activity. It is about lethargy. It is about waking up and realizing that at some point in the past we've gone to the toilet and thrown up our dreams without even realizing that society has stuck its fingers down our throat.Norton plays an average Joe who is living a dead end life. He needs something to change his life. Tyler and Marla will take care of this, and that is all I want to give away. Other comments will tell you more, but I suggest you let it all sink in while watching. As for it's ending, it doesn't rival 'The Sixth Sense' - it blows it away. One of the best movie endings I've seen. Even better if you're a Pixies fan.It's at about this point that the movie stops being smart and savage and witty, and turns to some of the most brutal, unremitting, nonstop violence ever filmed. Although sensible people know that if you hit someone with an gloved hand hard enough, you're going to end up with broken bones, the guys in Fight Club have fists of steel, and hammer one another while the sound effects guys beat the hell out of Naugahyde sofas with Ping Pong paddles. Later, the movie takes still another turn. A lot of recent films seem unsatisfied unless they can add final scenes that redefine the reality of everything that has gone before; call it the Keyser Soze syndrome.I would argue that anyone caught, at some point in their lives, between a rock and a hard place--anyone who has reached bottom on a mental level--anyone who has uttered to themselves ""Wait, this isn't right. I would not do,say,feel what it is that I just did,said,felt... I do not like this. I must change before I am forever stuck being the person that I am not."" These people, they will know what I'm talking about. These people will not only recognize the similarities between Edward Norton's character and themselves--they will be uncomfortably familiar with him. These people will appreciate Fight Club for what it is: a wake up call that we are not alone.Honestly, how many times have you seen a movie that, with every viewing, gets even more complicated yet so simple that you can't help but laugh. Every time I watch this movie I notice something new about it, such is the depth of what is on the screen. Then there's the tiny issue of the story of Fight Club, penned by Chuck Palahniuk (who has one of the most fertile imaginations around. Don't believe me? Read 'Survivor' and weep!) the story is nothing short of incredible, a pure shock-value social commentary on the state of the world at the end of the century. You'll cry, you'll laugh, you'll do all the clichés but most importantly you'll identify with every single thing on the screen.The film is a cinematic punch to the head as it challenges the status quo and offers a wakeup call to people immersed in a materialistic world where those who have the most stuff, ""win."" I think that Fincher's film wants us to tear all that down, reject corporate monsters like Starbucks and Blockbuster, and try to figure out what we really want out of life. It's almost as if the film is suggesting salvation through self-destruction. And it is these thought-provoking ideas that makes ""Fight Club"" a dangerously brilliant film that entertains as well as enlightens.",Fight Club
720,m1xer,The Best Film of all Time-Life Changing......,10,10 March 2013,"How could a movie entitled, FIGHT CLUB be so deep, so complex, so witty, so flawless....I do not know but I have fallen in love with this movie almost a decade ago and make a point to watching it every couple of months.It is my all time favorite movie, a ten out of ten in every way.The twist is amazing, re-watches make a lot more sense each time and the acting by Pitt, Norton and even Carter put David Finchers Fight Club to a whole new level.My favourite film just ahead of Sixth Sense from 1999, and obviously it is as I just said it is my favourite ever.SO Quotable and so ground-breaking. How deep this movie is breaks all kind of boundaries.PLEASE see this with an open-mind and realize it is not all about fighting, although the CLUB is a major aspect of the film, hence the title.If I could of named it, I probably would of named it Tyler Dudren since it is about Pitts character quite a bit.Like I said I thought I would say something about my favourite film which is a 10-10 but I do not want to give anything away.ENJOY!",Fight Club
721,zhongzl-kelley2014,I never finished the movie until I read the trivia,10,4 January 2016,"The movie turned out to be a huge surprise. I thought it was another Woody-Allen-style gloomy movie about a loser going through his mid-life crisis by understanding some philosophy that doesn't make sense in real life. But it isn't. As the movie unfold, I gradually noticed that every shot was precisely calculated, every object in the frame symbolizes something. Fight Club is more than what it seems like.The CG is amazing. With the swooshing audio effect, the sense of reality is as compelling as it can be. It's especially astonishing to understand that the opening CG is actually the biochemical reactions happening in the narrator when his hallucination is pointing a gun at himself. I could hear myself breathing when he told Tyler ""The gun is not in your hand, it's in my hand."" He realized the existence of Tyler is a hallucination. But like any schizophrenia patient or dissociative disorder patient, he couldn't put off the hallucination like ""puff"" and go on with his life. The only way to stop Tyler is to kill him, which is to kill himself.However, if he becomes aware of his own mental illness, he should've go to a psychiatrist instead of a police station(full of terrorists). Because what's different from other schizophrenia patients is, Tyler Durden is trying to alter the narrator's identity, reforming him into another person. Instead of giving him paranoia like in Beautiful Mind, or give him horrifying visions like in Black Swan, Tyler is an outburst of this loser's potential, and this powerful figure is trying to replace the body's former owner. The mere thought of it gives me a shiver.There are numerous suggestions of the two leading roles being actually one person. We don't know our protagonist's name, for the start. On airplane, Tyler opened his suitcase but the narrator didn't open his. He received a call from a booth with a ""no income calls allowed"" sign. When he hit himself in front of his boss, he said: ""This reminds me with the first time I met Tyler"". When Tyler was hit by Lou in the basement of Lou's bar, the narrator seemingly received some impact simultaneously... Although it sounds like a absurd fairytale, this salary man started a terrorist attack without even aware of it. Although due to false advertisement and too obscure cues, this movie hasn't received the credit it deserves, Fight Club has become my favorite movie and David Fincher my favorite director.",Fight Club
722,ericventura,You Do Not Talk About Fight Club,8,12 August 2017,"The first (and second) rule of Fight Club is ""You do not talk about Fight Club"". So I won't divulge too much.The entire production is an achievement in of itself. Somewhat like The Usual Suspects (1995), there are some twists and surprises. The editing, cinematography, production design, sound, etc. all contribute to the effect, which is quite difficult to do. To give just enough in the first viewing, but the second viewing reveals all. However, to me, the whole thing feels empty. The film gives a lot of advice about life, but never really says much. Yes, there's a whole entire level below the visual and audio level revealing a hidden satire, complete with subliminal messages, but, to me, it just does not have substance. No character development, no theme, no significant plot. It really just comes down to one element. Fight Club is, by far, not my favorite film, but I give credit where credit is due. Fincher's primary goal was that when the movie was over, to at least have the viewer think about what they just saw. Most likely, for every viewer that has seen this movie, Fincher achieved his goal.",Fight Club
723,forpassord,REALLY?!,3,15 October 2019,"From what I know about the ""twist"", this movie is impossible: The dialogues between Norton and Pit are impossible, (most of) the physical interactions between Norton and Pit are impossible, many, if not most of the reactions from other persons to the dialogues between Norton and Pit are unrealistic and so on. It baffles me that NO ONE in this movie REALLY questions the main character(s) behavior. To me, this movie therefore was ruined by the ""twist"".Edward Norton's acting was as always great/brilliant. Brad Pit was Brad Pit, and in my eyes almost the same character as in ""Snatch"", except without the accent... Bonham Carter reminded me of Bonham Carter in ""Sweeney Tod""...If you do not know why the whole premise for this movie is impossible, or if you do not care, or if you do not understand, or if you do not care that this movie is the equivalent of the emperor's new clothes, then you might like this movie!

726,obliv,"if you DON'T like this movie, you're part of the problem!!!!!!!!!",10,7 February 2002,"very little of what passes for media, or even worse, art, actually does anything to confront society's ills. people constantly harp on ""hollywood"" as promoting violence and hastening the decay of society, when, in fact, hollywood is merely icing on an already rotten cake. fight club has the audacity not only to expose the abcess at the core of the modern world, but to also show how simple mindless reaction to that decay is equally evil.fight club has the balls to actually confront the problems of the modern world. in a world where faction on both sides of the political spectrum peddle simple answers (just say no, violence in movies is killing us, etc) no one has ever bothered to even mention that our lives are hollow. in the film, tyler durden is created as a reaction to that. in claiming that rejection of materialism and a comfortable lifestyle in favor of a weekly dingy club where men beat the crap out of each other, fight club trades the nervous shell of comfort for the hard fist of real, honest feeling. pain, it says, is better than numbness, and there is some substance there. ultimately, though, it isn't fight club's violent reaction that saves ""jack"", but his connection with marla. this is another way of peeling back the disguise. simple mindless reaction to conformity is not what will save us. in the end, it's is our isolation which makes us hollow, and our connecting with other people that will save us.this is tough for some people to see, and to accept. maybe alot of folks would like to have ""jack's"" life, full of pre-fab furniture and a dull day to day job. this has been promoted as the ""american dream"", and frankly, it sucks. lives of boring conformity and consumerism are not anywhere near as fulfilling as lives filled with passion, even if that passion comes with a struggle or a price. dullness, comfort, and hollwness are not something to aspire to, but something to avoid.some people were bothered by the violence of fight club. to be honest, i didn't even notice. the story is so deep, and works on so many levels, that i was caught up in  trying to take it all in.i find it interesting to see how many people were not only upset by the content, but by the visual style of the film. it is gritty, muddy and dark. that isn't a mistake or a lack of insight. it is exactly how this movie should look. it is daring, and flies in the face of the soft focus, backlighting rampant in so much mainstream film making. I simply think its interesting to see people who can't accept that there is no guarantee that things, in story, theme, or style, must be ""pretty"".most movies intend to make money. some aim a little higher. those are more important. those are art. art is under no obligation to make you happy. the fact that fight club continues not only to live as an organic document, but to become more and more relevant as time passes simply affirms its greatness. the fcat that many couldn't abandon their imprinted concepts of society, life, and what movies should ""do"" only makes it better.",Fight Club
727,Kilroy-17,"Just when you're sure this movie makes no sense, it starts making sense...",7,19 October 1999,"What a trip!  First of all, watching the previews for this film gives you no idea what you're in for when you see the film, that's for sure.  All you know is that there's going to be some bare-knuckle fighting kind of like tough man competitions.  This film is dark, edgy, and out there.You expect good acting because of Brad Pitt and Ed Norton and they are strong in this film.  If you liked Pitt's Jeffrey Goines from 12 Monkeys (should have won the Oscar that year), then you'll like him in this.  Not quite as whacked but he's walking that path, that's for sure.>The surprise in the film for me was Meatloaf.  His first appearance, in fact every one of his appearances caused me to have a gut clutching belly laugh. I won't spoil it though.  It has to be seen.  Furthermore, he acted well and you didn't find yourself seeing Meatloaf on the screen.  He was Bob.  I'm laughing now because I can see him in my mind.  You will too.Make no mistake, this is no girl-flick.  So the fact that Rosie O'Donnell didn't like it is not surprising. > Anyway, as the story goes along, I found myself asking over and over, what's going on here?  I was not lost, but the story hadn't presented itself yet. Or maybe it was that it hadn't grabbed me yet.  Whichever, just when I thought that it was never going to really make sense, it made perfect sense. It snuck up on me and then I couldn't wait to see if what I suspected was correct.  That made the movie fun.

728,kensmark,Most Folks Utterly Miss The Point (spoilers),4,1 April 2002,"I saw ""Fight Club"", and, mostly, I was bored.  The amazing thing about the movie isn't the movie itself but how the vast majority of people who see it -- especially men 16-40 -- see it through machismo-colored glasses and never really 'see' it.""Fight Club"" is not about consumerism or evil corporations or even about fighting.  It's about the dangers of homophobia, plain and simple, about being deep in the closet and being angry about it.As such, it's a hit-and-miss film, with good moments and bad.  One of its major drawbacks is a wildly inconsistent tone, a common problem with satire. But let's look at what so many viewers somehow miss.Start with the trail of bread crumbs that begins with Tyler Durden dressing like he shops for clothes in Ru Paul's trash.  Watch Jack hug a man with enormous breasts and no testicles and hear him say how it's oddly comforting.  Watch him and Tyler 'share' a woman who is, in fact, more masculine than either of them.Watch dozens of men join a secret, no-girls club (an underground social movement) in which they can't keep their shirts on or their hands off of each other.  Watch as this club turns into an adoring cult.  Watch as they scorn women -- especially women who use liposuction to 'artificially' try to be sexy and appealing to men.  Listen to all the dialogue complaining about emasculation, about how the world won't let you just be a man.Yes, very subtle.  The 'twist' at the end is like an exclamation point, and the falling phallic towers, and the gun-fellatio, and the unending symbolism of self-love / self-hate are a tad over the top.Why do these men fight each other?  Because they're too deep in the closet to express their feelings any other way.  Why do so many men who see this movie miss this searchlight glaring in their eyes?  You be the judge.The movie is clearly intentionally surreal, so why anyone would take it at face value is beyond me.  The fighting -- contrary to what many people absurdly claim -- is desperately unrealistic, no more realistic than the fighting in a typical 1970's kung fu film and less interesting to watch.  No one who's seen or been in a real fight -- that they were sober enough to remember clearly -- could say that the fighting in the movie is realistic. 
Nothing in the movie is realistic past the point where Jack meets Durden. The story is the fever-dream of a deeply conflicted man.  It's not even subtle about it.  The first act of the movie -- pre-Durden -- is all right, and pretty original, but once Durden shows up the film spirals down into drawn-out repetition and heavy-handed symbolism, becoming more and more hyperbolic and tiresome.I mean, OK, OK -- homophobia and repression are bad.  But the movie doesn't have much of a point if the audience leaves the theater without a clue.",Fight Club
729,Kuntos_the_Destroyer,A film with brains and the balls to use them,10,14 January 2002,"**SPOILERS**I could obey the first two rules of Fight Club, but I'd be doing exactly what Fight Club tells me not to. I could go on for hours words about David Fincher's technical wizardry, throwing in everything from simple jumpcuts to a hugely original use of CGI, but that would be emphasizing the obvious. I could also compare it to its more Oscar-friendly babyboom counterpart, American Beauty, but I only have to point out that movie lacks both the balls and the brains of this one. Finally, I could write a spoiler-free review about Fight Club. But I'm not going to, because that wouldn't be doing the film justice.It, however, is not as if this hasn't happened to this film before. At the time of release most American critics (and far too many European ones, too) completely misinterpreted the film as being excessively violent (peculiar because the violence is always integral to the story and its themes and, equally important, never glorified) and even fascist (which is as much the object of Fight Club's parody as is consumerism). Fight Club, much like the equally good Chuck Palahniuk novel it's based on, casts its subversive net far and wide. Yes, it's satire of consumerism (""things you own end up owning you'"") is easily the most vocalized (Tyler Durden in-camera speech, anyone?) and since that's the voice of Tyler Durden, the Narrator's possibly subconsciously self-created saviour figure (I told you about the spoilers, right?), we should definitely be hearing it. It should however not distract us from the fact that the Fight Club/ Project Mayhem world the Narrator is drawn into is sneakily similar to his earlier yuppie materialist existence. For example, do the Space Monkeys get anything out of Project Mayhem except for the illusion of some kind of purpose in life?There's deeper stuff too. There's an interesting streak of surrealism throughout the movie, not unfitting for a film viewed through the eyes of someone who is by most standards insane (in fact, almost the entire film is a flashback). Fantasy and reality flow over into eachother up until a point where it's really left to the viewer to decide what is real and what is not (or both, the flashback-humor quip for example). Is Tyler Durden merely a fantasy or does he simply become one in the Narrator's eyes? Do the Narrator and Marla live happily ever after (because the building they're in doesn't explode - onscreen)? You can read a lot into this film depending on what you want to read into it (fascism, it would seem, is one of them) and depending on how you interpret the events. On a related note, many people have argued the book's ending is more ambiguous than the film's (in the book, the Narrator ends up in a white place - Heaven or an asylum? - where people await Tyler Durden's second coming). I don't agree. The film ending seems an explosive version of a happy Hollywood wedding-type ending but considering the storytelling style it's obvious it only seems that way. Did the Narrator really kill himself and is this merely what he wants us to see - some final hallucination? Anyway, it's not as clearcut as it seems and therefore a cinematically perfectly acceptable substitute for the book ending. And in some ways, the film is also simply about existing and reaffirming that existence through (physical) experiences that test one's self. Even religion, friendship, love and the emasculination of modern society get thrown into the mix.But ultimately that's all side-servings to central story, that of a man brought up on TV shows and microwave dinners and on the assumption that material possessions will make him happy. Also a man who has been kept from acts of subversion so much that they have gained a mythical quality. Who is so disconnected from his own humanity he can't find a way to approach Marla Singer, who is what he really wants. Does he create his own macho alter ego to exercise (exorcise?) both his contempt for society and love for Marla? Does he eventually find maturity and responsibility by denying this alter ego and sacrificing (or at least being prepared to do so) his own life because he understands its worth now? Maybe. Maybe not. In either case Fight Club is both a movie that'll you thinking for a long time to come and one that has an emotional depth that's lacking in most films this intelligent.So I'm leaving out the quality of the movie experience almost entirely, eh? Well, yes. That's something you likely know already (or you read on for far too long). Still, two notes on that account: the acting is top-notch and the film's way funnier than my comment. So work your ass off, buy the DVD and discover that while you may be a consumer, at least you're one with good taste.Rating: 10/10",Fight Club
730,Kuntos_the_Destroyer,I am Jack's need for multiple comments,10,23 April 2002,"I recently saw Panic Room, which was so commercial it brought up an old question. A question which I thought was interesting enough to write a second Fight Club comment about (trust me, it's the first and only time).So why does a movie attacking consumerism contain the flashiest style you've ever seen? Why is it so spectacular? For the same reason it's loaded with advertising messages (check all those Starbucks cups!). It's not hypocrisy, it's irony. To get the movie's messages to a large audience, it has to be flashy and spectacular, because else we probably wouldn't be watching. We are all part of the same hypocrisy, especially the filmmakers (didn't anybody see the irony in casting pretty-boy Brad Pitt, having him criticize the Calvin Klein-ideal of a man only to show off his hard abs a couple of scenes later?). The film is counter-culture but all counter-culture is part of the culture it's rebelling against. To deny that, to deny this film was made to make money; that would've been hypocritical. What it does instead, is realise the inherent problem in adapting a book into an art form that is almost by definition commercial (you can't afford to make movies nobody's willing to pay to see) and play into that. It exaggerates Hollywood conventions to a level where it's kind of ridiculous. It doesn't attack the stylistics themselves but our preoccupation with seeing them (much like it doesn't attack personal property but consumerism instead - there's a significant difference). It gives us what we want (exactly the same goes for the movie's ending) but in a way that's so over the top you can't help but look at it with a big smile on out faces.And big smiles is what this film is after as much as contemplation. Fight Club is not some heavy study of today's society and it certainly doesn't provide all the answers to the questions it poses. It's a comedy and a smart one too, because it realises sometimes merely highlighting the questions is enough. Fight Club is not fascist, not hypocritical and not the answer (as another commenter already pointed out; if you liked it, you're probably part of the problem). Fight Club just is.

I've owned several copies of it since, and I've tried not to watch it too often so I can retain some fresh perspective when I do. This one isn't like the other movies. This one belongs in a different category, somewhere that serious-budget movies almost never dare to tread, but somehow, this was made. Between the stunning screenplay based on the fantastic book, and the amazing directing and basically perfect acting, there is no slack to even try to critique it as a normal film. It is inspired art. Some people will hate it. In fact, lots of people will hate it. Given the intelligence of the average consumer, that's the finest calling card I can imagine for a mainstream concept film.I'm a capitalist with an economics degree, so don't take this the wrong way, but this movie is the perfect assault on the concept of the economy being anything more than a means to an end, both critical and wary of the hollow, pathetic stupidity and vulnerability of the populace that has nothing better to do than participate in it and buy their hopes and dreams off the rack at Target. Even beneath this, the strong flavor of empowerment, Nietzsche-style, makes itself known with the charisma of the finest salesman and challenges everyone to find a better way. At once subverting society and subverting itself, the layered texture of the whole thing is probably too good for mass consumption. Well done.

734,Cloud20,It's a mad world...,9,4 February 2006,"Fight Club (1999) Edward Norton, Brad Pitt, Helena Bonham Carter, Jared Leto, Meat Loaf, Zach Grenier.Directed by David Fincher.Spoilers herein. I admit, when I first rented Fight Club about two years ago, I was pretty disappointed. But the reason I probably was is because it was a very different film that I had seen from others. Friends had recommended it to me saying that I would either love or hate it, but I found myself stuck in the middle. Considering that it had a high rating on the IMDb's Top 250 movies, and all of the hype that was surrounding it, I knew that I had to see it. One of the things that I didn't care for in Fight Club the first time I saw it was that I missed most of the satire and black-comedy behind the violence. However, the whole movie did have an interesting yet strange feel to it. About a year ago, I re-watched the film to see if I would find anything different about it. While watching it, I liked it much more than I did the second time. I caught more of the black humor, and it was hypnotically entertaining. The story begins with an executive (Edward Norton, playing a character without a name 'Narrator') whose bored with his life and can't sleep during the nights. He begins going to testicular cancer groups so it would make him feel better, but he can't sleep while a lady who fakes her cancer (Helena Bonham Carter playing Marla Singer) remains at the group. After his condo explodes, he is taken in by a mysterious soap salesman (Brad Pitt as Tyler Durden) who shows him a bizarre form of therapy which they call the ""Fight Club"". 'Fight Club' isn't an easy movie to talk about, write about or forget about. It works in such brilliant ways that other films don't, and in the end the movie works on almost every level. In the sense of storytelling, it definitely succeeds. It was probably the most talked about movie of 1999, and there was much to say about it. One could say that 'Fight Club' is laughably over-the-top, or to say that the film itself doesn't make sense. I began to think that until it all caught up with me in the end. I will not give any spoilers why it did, but I wasn't really expecting a surprise. It could be compared to the bizarre style of films like Stanley Kubrick's 'Clockwork Orange', Oliver Stone's 'Natural Born Killers' and Terry Gilliam's 'Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas'. But there's so much chemistry and psychological attitude put to this movie that you may not be able to ""get"" it the first time around. It's a social satire that has almost everything I'd look for in one. I can't really say that I thought this was directed David Fincher's best film (I enjoyed Se7en (1995) more), but this definitely makes a case as his most visual and daring film. He gives a great direction once again, gives the whole movie a very vivid feel. One of the only bad things that I can actually say about this film is some of the very strong violence (one scene in particular involving Norton and Jared Leto's character fighting) and a lot of people might think that it would lead to a pointless ending and the average viewer would be left with a negative message. But that isn't the way that it's supposed to end. You really do have to think beyond the movie, no matter how much it doesn't seem real. Since I loved Edward Norton's performance in 'American History X', he once again gives a great performance and background narration. Brad Pitt gives possibly his best performance to date, and the supporting roles are also good. The violence is probably the most controversial part of the movie. While I didn't find it too extreme, I thought that others who hadn't seen it should be aware of it. I found a lot of Fight Club quite amusing and funny, but it does get more effective toward the end. The anti-socialism in the film isn't told in a mean-spirited or hated way, the people fighting each other to released energy and power out on one another. But after its all over, you begin to realize how scary the film really is, and apocalyptic it would be in real-life. But the film is still humorous and isn't meant to be as serious as it is. I never read the book with the same title by Chuck Palahnuik, but after seeing the movie I am interested in reading it. Definitely one of the best films of 1999 along with 'American Beauty' and 'Magnolia'. To sum it all up, 'Fight Club' is one of the best viewing experiences I've ever had in my life, and one of the rare films that kept me entertained on several repeated viewings. It's a riveting, dazzling and completely original story that didn't leave my mind for a while. 4.5 out of 5 stars.",Fight Club

736,Manji,"Fight Club, American film tragedy or just misunderstood?",10,25 February 2000,"From the title, I'm sure many believed I would discuss how the film ""Fight Club"" was a blatant display of contemporary fascism, but that's not what I think. Beyond the violence, the big names, the media attention, I saw a message and not just a film. Almost like the child-genius in ""Magnolia"" telling his father that he needs to be treated better, I saw ""Fight Club"" tell me I need to re-evaluate what is important in my life. This is not to say that the film has changed me in some grande way, sure I did change, but ever so slightly. After ""Fight Club"" the purpose of film changed, that's minute in comparison to the great picture that is life. It's my humble opinion that a film like ""Fight Club"" was totally misunderstood.Unlike many who saw the film, I left the theatre fearing physical pain. I now shudder whenever I hear a friend mutter that he wants to ""beat the hell"" out of someone. It's scary that a strip of celluloid was able to do that to me, rather than further desensitize me towards violence, the film has caused me to avoid confrontation. I think that's wonderful, but a lot of people do not. A lot of people are disgusted by the film, simply because of it's vastly horrific violence. But truth be told the film does not even have as much attack on the human body as I was expecting. So what made it appeal to me, a ""modern teenager""?It was the director, David (""Se7en"", ""The Game"") Fincher. He's a visionary, I see him as one of the few young talents in Hollywood that actually have some sort of feel for what the camera is allowed to see. His directing is fresh, dark, gritty and especially URBAN. Through his previous works we have seen at least two sides of the class spectrum which have always shown some darker side of man. In ""Se7en"", we witnessed the absolute hell that could befall a pair of civil servants, two officers of the law and though it was not a major display in the film, there had to be a point in the main characters' lives when they had to come to grips with what and who they were dealing with. Needless to say, there is a sad ending and a great tragedy. Meanwhile, in ""The Game"", more than a year later we are treated to the darker side of the rich socialite, and we are treated to a happy ending. But in ""Fight Club"", there was no happy or sad ending.There was loss and there was gain whether it was wanted or not. And amidst this, Fincher was able to take that whole idea of ""funky"" and ""digital"" to it's darkest, while he erased the classes which were present and highly focal in his other films. Indeed this is true as we see the various faces and races which the actual ""Fight Club"" incorporates, mixed together trying to release some aggression. And things do get over the edge, but there is a sense of loyalty borne between the men who dare to journey into the darker side of himself. ""Fight Club"" to the characters in the film was practically religion and a new way to live. They were better than most people in the real world, because they did not live for the material items, they were actually able to live for life. That means that they were living for something that material items and cool gadgets could not buy. Would it eventually lead to mass murder? Perhaps, but I think they would have gotten bored with it by the time it got that out of hand. I believe that much is true because, regardless of the new found strength they were given by ""Tyler Durden"", they were still products of the Generation X. Basically they have all inherited some short attention span. It was a fad, nothing lasts forever in this day and age. Besides which, ""Fight Club"" would have eventually become commercialized.Big industry is always looking for the next big craze, and I don't think that the members of ""Fight Club"" would support something that could be commercialized. Once you commercialize it it becomes an easy target for merchandising, then they would be back at square one. But they can always live in the now and know that they were doing something different, doing something real, and doing something beyond therapy to help improve themselves.So I say to Fincher, and Palahniuk (for his original novel), and Uhls (for the adaptation to the screen), and Norton, and Pitt, and everybody who helped to make such a great film, and of course the Dust Brothers for an absolutely seamless soundtrack; Thank You! You have actually accomplished making a film that has actually entertained me beyond the visual and story and was successfully made in the 90's. Don't get me wrong, there are a vast number of incredible films made in the 90's such as ""Usual Suspects"", ""Philadelphia"", and ""Trainspotting"", but ""Fight Club"" was directed towards me, and that felt good, I felt appreciated. I could identify with the struggles like no other film before it, that just makes me feel great. I think it was misunderstood, maybe I'm right or maybe I'm wrong, but that still doesn't mean that it was a bad film. To conclude I would just like to say that I wish to read the original novel by Chuck Palahniuk, but half the adventure is actually finding a copy which I have unsuccessfully accomplished. It's a rare book, so there must be a good reason for it's popularity.",Fight Club

I'm pretty sure everybody expects 2 hours of pure fight scenes and no script, like some of the Van Damme movies, or Jackie Chan.Well, I have something to tell everybody: NO. Yes, you heard me right, NO. This movie is not just about fighting, this movie is excellent, and it has messages to send to the people who watch it, of course, you have to understand, like and figure out the message.I've talked to several people after watching this film a couple of times in the theaters, and most of them said they were affected by this movie, and I do not blame them. I was kind of affected too, not like most of the people, they say they feel a desire to hit somebody after watching the movie, I did not feel like that after watching it, but I felt that something inside me changed.Tyler Durden... If I ever change my name, I'll call myself Tyler Durden. Brad Pitt makes one hell of a performance, and Ed Norton is also great, as in all of his movies.I can say one thing after seeing this film... I want to be like Tyler Durden. I liked that character SO much.. that it is even hard to explain.It's both, Brad Pitt and Ed Norton best movie, no question about that, even when Norton's ""Primal Fears"" was also excellent.I'll rate this movie with a 10 out of 10, I think it deserves that score, and most of the other user's comments say so. ...And remember, the first rule of Fight Club is, ""You do not talk about Fight Club"".",Fight Club
738,AbandonedRailroadGrade,Awesome,10,30 September 2000,"This is hardly the dumb martial arts flick I was expecting.  The film I can compare it most to is Terry Gilliam's 1985 comic fantasy nightmare, Brazil, except it's even better.  It's all about life spiraling out of control--an individual's life, a society, a civilization, maybe even God himself.  That Fight Club seems to have earned the accolades of both nihilists and moralists, as well as repelled others of both stripes, is a testament to its even-handedness.  Underneath its absurd viciousness, there's a truth to the desperation it sees in the lives of ordinary men who find themselves cogs in the Machine, men who yearn to tear it all down.  But if there's sympathy for their taste for manly struggle, for the pungent reality of blood in their mouths, and their misty dreams of a Kaczynskiesque hunter-gatherer caveman utopia, there's also no doubt about the dark roads down which such formless rage will lead, where jack-booted armies and madness are the only rewards for despair.

The film covers every bit of angst dripping off the pages of the novel. Its quick edits and clever film-making is something to revel in, still after multiple viewings. It's dark, it's hilarious and the plot is one hell of a ride.The characters are fantastic, as are the actors portraying them. Edward Norton does a fantastic job as the everyman sucked into a dark underworld. Helena Bonham Carter shines as Marla Singer with some of the best dialogue in the film. This of course coming behind perhaps, the greatest character created, in film, novels and the whole world. I am of course talking about Tyler Durden. Masterfully portrayed by Brad Pitt, Tyler is a dangerous, sneaky but ultimately, cool customer.This film will capture every part of you with every time you watch it.

740,SlackerRus2000,"If this is your first night at Fight Club, you have to Fight!!!!!!!!",10,25 June 2008,"What can you say about a film, whose ideals center on anti-consumerism and rebellion/anarchy. I'm sure most people have wished for simpler times in their life, especially when confronted with an increasingly hectic, fast-paced, and technology-centric society. Fight Club aims to make that a reality.Fight Club center on Edward Nortons character, lets just call him Jack. Someone who is half yuppie/ half Starbucks frappucino corporate drone that the 20th century seem to churn out in alarming numbers. Jack suffers from what a lot of Americans suffer from disillusionment with themselves and their problems. Jack also fixes this ailment the way corporate America has told Jack to do so, buying more crap. Soon enough Jack can't sleep, something is wrong. Then comes Tyler Durden, who changes Jacks entire view on life. Jack wasn't just suffering from insomnia he was comatose, unable to see the world for what it really is. Then comes Fight Club and some uncanny relevations about himself and the world he has created unfolds. This is the essence of Fight Club.The reason this is so influential is because while your watching this film you can't help but relate. Everyone at some point in their life has felt empty, hollow. I guess, Fight Club is at its best an eye-opener. Never has America's consumer greed been put under such a microscope and examined in such an artistic and mesmerizing way.Fight Club at its heart is an ""F#$% You"" to modern society and the measuring yard it has created to measure your own self worth. Fight Club aims to liberate the viewer from the confines of the metaphorical jail of American idealism and societal control measures. It aims in the only way you can really get someone to understand, a bone-crushing punch to the face.",Fight Club

The reason that people bash it or call it a facist film is because it really struck a nerve and the only way those people can comprehend Fight Club is to speak negative about it.

745,demondrink,David Fincher is the Master.,9,21 August 2002,"Ignore the small-brained carpers. Fight Club is the most visceral and intelligent film that mainstream Hollywood has produced in a long time.The film, for anyone who has just arrived from another planet and hasn't heard of it, attempts to address the issues of how a lost generation of men can restore meaning to lives, which are being controlled by advertising propaganda and fascistic little men in suits. It is about addiction and rehabilitation; imprisonment and freedom; control and insanity.Easily David Fincher's best movie, combining the darkness of Se7en and the elaborateness of The Game in a weirdly optimistic and grotty fusion. Squalor has never seemed so liberating. A message to all those conservatives who decry it: it's you who needs to grow up. There are more things in Heaven and Earth than are dreamt of in your philosophy. ""I say never be complete. I say let's evolve. Let the chips fall where they may."" - Tyler Durden",Fight Club
746,g_ryder,"Plight Club: in the end, it will be too late to stop it.",9,26 June 2012,"There are two basic modes in which every animal (including human) lives its life. The first mode is characterized by security, safety, comfort, patience, defensiveness, caution, consolidation, inhibition, staidness, mildness, meekness, suppression, submission and conformity, whereas as a complete contrast the other mode is characterized by aggression, assertion, excitement, risk, initiative, boldness, spontaneity, impulsiveness, recklessness, violence and domination. Often the shift from the normal staid mode to the aggressive mode takes place very rapidly, even as small as a fraction of a second.Modern man has been forced by the need to attain social control of the masses to suppress the aggressive mode which was a necessary mode for the hunter-gatherer and warring man to survive and thrive. Today, most people have been programmed to live the staid life of a 9 to 5 routine, neatly dressed up, working to build a comfortable life, accumulating possessions that fortify this life style of maximizing luxury. But there is a downside to this: there is no sense of adventure left, it is a lifestyle of ultimate boredom because it is totally predictable, it leaves no room for a creative, innovative choice driven life style, and the mass aggressive outlet is in the contrived wars that dominating nations unleash upon the hapless smaller nations that dare to defy them even in the most trivial of issues. The only positive mass channeling of this aggression is in competitive sport or games, but come to think of it, that too is a contraption which is a distraction from the genuine aggressive response whose real value is in creativity.The other result of this suppression is in the development of a neurosis that leads to mental disorders, drug addiction, life of crime and ultimately an irresistible urge to destroy it all without even being consciously aware of it.Fight club is a story that vividly encapsulates this plight of modern, civilized man, the developing neurosis, the urges of aggression that are a response to boredom, the need for genuine excitement and adventure that are now a near impossibility, all build up to the inevitable destruction that is the only default genuine excitement that is left for man, an urge to destroy, that modern man is not even conscious of and will not be conscious of until the last moments of 'recorded time', and by that time it will be too late to stop it.""Perhaps only poetry had the strength to rival the attractions of narcotics, the magnetism of TV, the excitements of sex, or the ecstasies of destruction.""(Saul Bellow)",Fight Club

752,Cioran,The best film of last few years!,10,7 January 2000,"Fight Club is the best film of last few years. Technically brilliant, with superb story, acting and profound psychological and social content. Fincher is by far the most innovative and creative  American director after Stanley Kubrick.This film is deeply philosophical and focusing on 'the meaning of life' concept. The story starts rolling with the depiction of the dissatisfying life of the main character. He tries to fill the existential void with goods, he tries to bond with people in sobbing and sharing about their pain and misfortunes, in the end nothing fills the void. Edward Norton's character is disgusted with the nihilism he sees around him - the superficial corporate greed with it's corporate pawns. Life falsifying and denigrating consumerism, which reduces individuals to mindless drones and leads them to believe that gathering material possessions, looking outwardly according to norms would make them happy. In essence the character gets sick with all the excessive socialization, all the unnecessary symbols of conformism and social status which leave him alien to himself. The character is confused who and what he is and what he essentially wants. He's only recourse is to the core of his being, his body. It's chemical mechanisms are simply rewarding or punishing, there is nothing less real or unadulterated in human existence. The corpus doesn't  prevaricate. It transmits the signals and mind simply receives and interprets them. The signals are utterly authentic and that's Palahniuk's  probable justification for the fighting and the violence, which was cruel but based on consent, much like courageous, ultramasculine boxing and ultimate fighting contests.
Pain and pleasure are unifying sensations between all people and also the signs of human separatedness from the world and the signs of individual corporality. Circumstantial changes in endocrinological hormonal secretions are often addictive and artificially sought in our culture.
First half of the film revels in consumerist critique and finding a way for these, mostly lonely and slightly alienated men to endure the nihilism of their existence. After the bonding has happened and Tyler Durden is awarded the status of a great visionary,a spiritual leader much like most autocrats have been raised to their throne by unsuspecting people (Hitler, Mao etc) the film takes a leap forward and starts analyzing the psychology of revolutionary activity and revolutionary groups.Tyler starts project Mayhem and goes further and further into anarchistic activities to take the power back and overturn this spirit eroding, life degrading social system.Fight Club's analysis of revolution is a lot smarter and deeper than the one in Matrix because the end part is raising the question 'why does revolution always seem to eat it's children?'. Why do idealistic men wanting to improve the society  and the situation of countless humans end up instituting the most violent and gruesome regimes. What is so flawed in human nature that turn good intentions to often even worse oppression than the one before? The references to Maximilien Robespierre, Lenin and Hitler are quite obvious in this film. The lead character wanted to liberate men from socialization, to enhance their individuality but ended up removing their individuality, denigrating and sacrificing them in the name of greater good. He sacrificed his own ideals, thus the fight in the end and another reference to historical revolutionaries. Robespierre who was responsible for the 'reign of terror' era of the French revolution got his jaw shot off before taken to the guillotine.",Fight Club
753,cogs,Subliminal Hollywood,10,23 January 2000,"It is difficult to talk about Fight Club without giving away crucial information so it is better to concentrate on the film's formal aspects.With that said Fincher's film is formally the most interesting film out of Hollywood in years. It is productive to align it with John Boorman's ""Point Blank"" which also challenged the veracity of the image and that of the narrator/protagonist. It is nice to see that some of Hollywood's elite are still willing to be involved in intelligent cinema, even if it damages their marquee value. Finally to those who have seen the film and are going to see it again pay close attention to the first 30 minutes for the subliminal insertion of the image of Pitt's character. Fincher's film is full of all these details that are entirely significant without being excessively stylistic.",Fight Club
754,Cochese-6,One of the Year's Best: Speaks out to a generation of Gap-fed children,9,30 November 1999,"""Fight Club"" does the best job of any film I've seen in conveying the pathetic truth of how dependent people (particularly teenagers) have become on materials in this country. As a High School sophmore, I assure you I see it all around me; Kids feeling insecure because they don't wear Gap clothing, or getting put down because their parents didn't buy them a Land Rover when they turned 16. It's pathetic, and this is only one subject which ""Fight Club"" addresses strongly. (I want to make it clear that this is NOT exclusively what""Fight Club"" is about, but it is what I personally took out of it the most.)The film isn't necessarily aimed at my age group, but I think it should be. After all, my generation is the one which is being fed all this materialistic crap, and is definetly most affected by it. I'm sick and tired of movies like ""Drive Me Crazy,"" and ""Varsity Blues"" to name a few, where Hollywood tries to relate to teenagers when it's just reinforcing exactly what ""Fight Club"" rips apart (You have to be popular to be somebody. You have to wear this, etc). So for all those kids who are trying to fit in with the ""in-crowd"" here's a little tip; See ""Fight Club,"" and BE YOUR OWN PERSON.

Yes, Fight Club has some powerful messages about culture, society, work, identity, and abandonment. However, if you strip it all away - fight club is merely a simple tale about a guy finding himself. The look and feel of this movie is astounding. Every scene and movement has a Kubrick level of sophistication. 
Fight Club is not for everybody. It also demands something of its audience. It is best to view this movie as a whole rather than its parts. Each part is weak in some way, but as a whole there is a powerful, visually stunning message that is not terribly complex, but still very intriguing.",Fight Club
756,The Truth,"Excellent film, flawed ending (spoilers).",8,17 April 2000,"When I had watched Fight Club two-thirds through, I thought it could quite possibly be the best film of the nineties. The social commentary was smart and forceful, yet subtle enough not to be preachy. To explore a subject of such importance (the post-modern society and what it does to man) with such clarity of vision was a bold deed, something rarely seen in a big budget Hollywood flick. Added to that, Fight Club had a great visual look, a set of powerful actors (Edward Norton is as good as ever, and Brad Pitt shows acting capability I would never have expected of him) and some of the most brilliant dialogue ever seen in cinema. To sum it up: this far everything seemed perfect.But then came the so called surprise twist, and for a while it felt like a punch on the face. Although I had anticipated a solution like this (I noticed immediately that the character played by Norton had no name), I never expected it to be this crude and over-emphasizing. There's nothing wrong with the idea the twist presents; it has in fact been evident throughout the film. But the way the film exposes it is so straightforward that it makes the viewer re-examine every scene of the movie in the light of this new revelation, and on that level the script simply doesn't work. I could give you numerous examples, but that would give away the surprise (and I've already stretched the IMDB guidelines far enough), so I'll leave that job up to you.As I said before, there's nothing wrong with the surprise twist itself, only the way it is presented. Had I written the script, I would have made it far more subtle and ambiguous, so that the audience would not be told the truth, and they would have to figure it out themselves. By choosing the road it does Fight Club crudely underestimates the viewers' intelligence, which is strange considered how intelligent the overall script is.The other thing I would have changed was the way Fight Club ended. Although the ending was not as disappointing as the surprise revelation, it was still somewhat lame. The film had already wondered so far off the beaten path, that it should have had the courage to go even further. Now all we get is ""love is all you need"", and while it may be the truth, this should not be the film to tell us that.",Fight Club

758,tcdarkness,A movie better than its book,10,2 January 2003,"I first saw Fight Club about two years ago.  Of course, I loved it.  I own the soapbox DVD.  So when the time came for me to choose some reading material last summer, I picked the book to read and see how it compared. I actually liked the movie better than the book.  I think it is better than the book, something that does not happen often (see Jurassic Park, both versions of Red Dragon, many Stephen King translations to film, etc.)The book is definitely unique.  It is told like the poems the Narrator reads about Jack's organs.  It is a lot of first person dialogue from a guy you are sure is a wimp.  I think the movie improves on it by the gimmicks like the changeovers and frames inserted.  Moreover, I feel the ending to the book was rather lacking and disapointing (maybe because of the great ending to the movie).  Most importantly, I think the movie emphasizes the actual Fight Club/Project Mayhem aspect better.  It is a major source of conflict in the film, while more of a backdrop in the book.  The book is more of an exploration of the relationship with Marla and the narrator's state of mind. It's also very short (if you try, you can read it in a day), while the movie is over two hours long.  If you read the book, you'll see a lot of the dialogue is lifted from there, but I think some of the quotes from the movie are snappier (the ""I want to have your abortion"" line on the alternate take found on the DVD is from the book, but the line ""I haven't been f**ked like that since grade school"" is just hilarious.)  About the only scene I could see from the book making the movie better/funnier is Tyler cooking Marla's mom's collagen ""gift.""The movie's very deep.  We, the audience, see characters in the same light as the Narrator does as the movie progresses.  Though Tyler seems to be the perfect buddy and collaborator, we all soon find him to be just a psycho and the liberated space monkeys as lemmings.  The despised Marla (I am Jack's raging bile duct) we all come to find endearing... somehow. 10/10",Fight Club

This can be seen in the Madonna videos he directed; it was plain for all to see in ""Se7en"" (a horrible film) and it is evident again in this film as well.This film is disturbing to watch, but, unlike ""Se7en"", at least it's not revolting. It will be liked by all those who think that, in order to criticise the distorted way in which we live, it's essential that an amount of violence as high as possible be shown and represented graphically, even though it doesn't really add to the story. It's not just the violence: it's the whole film that is unpleasant to watch, for no plausible reason.This is not being original, or visionary, or artistic, or intelligent, thought-provoking, innovative. If you met someone on the street and he punched in the stomach for no apparent reason, how many of you would you say that his action is ""thought-provoking""? Not many, I suppose. This film is the cinematic equivalent of a punch in the stomach by a stranger, but it's a little less subtle.Moreover, this film is also boring, very boring.I'm rather tired of directors that seem to indulge in shocking the public with unrealistic plots and hyperrealistic violence. Clearly, some of those directors have realised that they can play that game and get away with it (plus a lot of critical acclaim and, probably, a good deal of money). Personally, I think that this film is basically nonsensical. I suspect that, as with ""Se7en"", it succeeds in making some people feel trendy because they can stand industrial amounts of imaginative violence. Transgression is the word.Sometimes it's even ludicrous. In the sequence in which Brad Pitt gets beaten by the landlord, after the second punch his face bleeds, but after the third one the blood has disappeared. Miraculous, indeed.",Fight Club

While the book is a great read and still hold the reader in a death grip it can at times be confusing and the lead to the finale tricky to follow. Whereas the film is impossible to look away from. It's grit and acid strong taste juxtapose it's dark comedy and aggressive realism. I truly believe along with may others, that what has been birthed here is arguably, the greatest film ever made, and certainly in the top ten. 
With phenomenal performances from both Brad Pitt and Edward Norton, alongside Helena Bonham Carter playing an evermore enthralling Marla Singer Fight Club is a film for the world, and whatever the fate of humanity in the years to come Fight Club will still be here, still be relevant and we will still be saying, I know this, because Tyler knows this.",Fight Club

The ending is somewhat inconclusive and a bit unsatisfying. But as a whole it is a great film. Fincher is a man with a vision. He is inventive and creative. Norton is good, but the movie belongs to Pitt. I think this guy willbecome an even greater actor than Norton. The problem is: he is too goodlooking. But he showed it in Seven and now in this movie: the guy can act. Fight club is violent, yes. But is it exploitive? No. Never is hate, crime, power or money a reason for it. It shows that self-inflicted pain can be healing. It can give solace. Growth by selfdestruction is the theme. Modern society has never been satirized the viciously.

771,rumfoord,Better than the novel,10,13 December 2004,"Fight Club is a fantastic movie in almost every sense. Aesthetically speaking, it is probably the most imaginative Fincher film. What's really impressive though, is the way that Fincher managed to broaden the appeal of the story, without compromising Palahniuk's message. The book is certainly entertaining as hell, but the reader is always councious of the way the book attempts to indoctrinate you (in the same vein as Atlas Shrugged). This is due in large part to Palahniuk's narrator being closer in character to Tyler Durden than Fincher's narrator is. By balancing the characters in the film, Fincher keeps the dynamic interesting, and avoids descending into a preachy tone. This accomplishes the almost unheard of on screen feat of actually improving upon a book.Indeed, judging by Palahniuk's work after fight club, it seems he too prefers Fincher's permutation. Bravo!",Fight Club
772,shobill,"Vicious, surreal, and brilliant",9,11 July 2004,"I thought I knew the premise of this film: men forming anunderground fight club to get back to the basics of raw, visceral`manhood"" in our regulated, civilized society. Well, it was aboutthat, plus much more. In what is actually a deeply satirical andsurreal tale, Edward Norton plays a young put-upon corporateoffice hack into our modern consumer culture but vaguely unhappywith his life and attending a multitude of support groups, eventhough he doesn't share the other members' situations, until hemeets an offbeat soap seller (Brad Pitt) on a train and theyaccidentally exchange suitcases. The two end up living with eachother and in a rather bizarre manner, which just gets stranger as itgoes, fight each other for stimulation and form a fight club which issoon joined by many willing others. Adding to the intrigue is theinterest of Norton and Pitt in another offbeat character Marla, wellplayed by Helena Bonham Carter. Also notable is Meat Loaf'scharacter Robert Paulson, a big man who developed femininebreasts after a bout with testicular cancer. The film is certainly notjust about the fighting, which doesn't even begin until a half hourinto the movie, although there is plenty of vicious raw flesh andblood grappling and crunching to satisfy all but the most sadisticfan. Rather the story develops into even more surrealistic twists toseveral surprises at the end much of which I could not predict.

776,Dave-79,Brilliant statement of American Culture,10,24 June 2000,"Aside from the what has already been said regarding Fight Club, there are some exceptionally brilliant moments in this movie.  The first 40 minutes are the most intriguing for me.  I especially liked Edward Norton's character and his narration concerning the support groups, insomnia, material posessions, his condo, and his work.  I particularly enjoyed his negotiating with Marla on how to split up the support groups.  When he and Tyler have their first fight there is a pause, and he says, ""Let me tell you something about Tyler Durden.""  Then he goes into this whole thing about the part time jobs which Tyler holds.  That little digression is perhaps one the most brilliant five minutes in film I have seen.  Although this movie really is a ""Dark Comedy"" of sorts, there are many socially true statements made. For instance, Tyler saying, ""The things you own end up owning you."" Exactly!  The imagry throughout the film is fantastic.  Apart from the fight sequences, which are well crafted, we have the cave sequences with the power animal...great stuff! And of course that old abandoned house.  Edward Norton and Brad Pitt have some of the best on-screen chemistry I have seen.  They blend perfectly.  This is the best chemistry Norton has had with another actor since his work with Matt Damon in Rounders.  Overall, Fight Club approaches a rare perfection.  The dialog and narration are its greatest strengths.  Easily one of the top 5 movies of 1999.",Fight Club
777,marysia,The Freedom of Fight Club,10,2 September 2004,"Words cannot describe how much I love this movie. We will glance briefly over the fact that Brad Pitt has probably never been sexier and spends a good deal of time partially nude. Actually lets just contemplate that for a moment before moving on.Mmmmmmmm.Anyway. I find the movie as a whole intensely sexy. A perfect dark mixture of surrealism, freedom, violence and sex. I too have never been in a fight. The very concept terrifies and arouses me. I think to actually just go the f**k for it and not only take the pain but take it in an uncontrolled way and return it might do a lot of us a power of good. Grab life by the balls and kick it in the teeth. But it's so far from anything most of us are likely to do (especially women, of which I am one) that it probably would take an episode of real mental breakdown to be able to do it. Fight Club is a lot like bdsm, well really only sm. It's (the actual fight club part not the whole movie) about the emotional and social freedom inherent in inflicting and receiving pain. If you're hurt you can cry or scream, if you're angry or frustrated you can lash out. The ultimate stress release. The way pain strips you of all complexity until there is nothing else that exists but excruciating sensation.To cry not because you're depressed and life sucks or something bad has happened, assuming you even cry then, but because it hurts. It hurts it hurts it hurts it hurts it hurts. There's something very pure about that.The difference between bdsm and fight club is that, in general, bdsm is controlled and will not leave permanent marks or anything requiring hospital treatment. This is a positive and a negative. It lacks some of the freefalling savagery of fight club but in return it gains practicality. We cannot all walk around with our faces bashed in and in the end you will get seriously hurt. There are only so many times you can have your head bashed against the floor before you don't wake up. I don't particularly want my head bashed against the floor at all. I suspect I like the concept a lot more than the actuality of fight club. I am a big coward.The movie as a whole is a trip in every way. It has things to say, it's beautiful and painful to look at, the characters are interesting, the end is fitting. One of the best movies I've seen.",Fight Club

So many people watch this and talk about how it ""made them think"" and claptrap like that.Here's a few of the things that ""Fight Club"" made me think: 1. Could the ending have been any worse?  More contrived or arbitrary in any way, shape or form? (After a little more thought, I decided that the answer to these questions is no.) 2. How many more movies are we going to be subjected to that are desperate to show us how crass materialism is ruining our lives? 3. Is it possible for David Fincher to come up with yet another ""Forced Super-Gloom"" set design for his next movie, or has he blown his wad with ""Alien 3,"" ""Seven"" and ""Fight Club""?Hey, whattayaknow, it did make me think.The real problem with this movie is that it had a lot of promise.

780,johnlewis,Biggest disappointment ever seen.,2,23 November 2002,"After reading and hearing so many good things about this movie, Iexpected something slick and well written at least. What I saw wasa loose, sloppy, romanticised portrait of a sociopathicschitzophrenic. The overall silliness of the first five minutes is anindicator that this is not a movie to take too seriously, which is fineif this were any kind of comedy-but it just isn't. It isn't campy, and itisn't funny in any parts. The potential for this film was much higherthan it turned out, especially with all the great talent of so many ofthe actors, and having such a unique idea for the main plot. BradPitt was excellent, as were so many of the supporting actors.Norton was not, but he had an impossible task doing somethingthe screenwriter and director wanted, but which was to be almostnot human at all. He was forced to be both very inhuman andinhumane. If someone is really inhuman, it is difficult for the viewerto empathize unless they have the same tendency of beingsociopathic. An inhumane sociopath is a fascinating film subject,but not if they are robotic. Yes, I'm over 45, but I enjoy many kinds of youthful films, or can atleast see why they are liked. I enjoy a wide variety of artistic,abstract, and strange films, as well as mainstream blockbusters. Ibase my opinion on overall excellence, not on technicalachievement. Actually a movie this bad, but at the same timeinnovative, would have benefitted from being made more lowbudget, without all the expensive scenery, props and specialeffects. Then it might have focused more on humans and havebetter insight into the main character's condition and mind, insteadof being merely hinted at, glossed over, and romanticized. All thegood and bad things that can justifiably be said about this film, themost truthful one that stands out the most is that it is just rawstupidity. I realize it is a fantasy story. But that a wimp like Nortoncould convince a horde of millions (all men-no women by the way,since women in the whole world are apparatently only inanimatesex objects) to convert to some sorry cult with no causes otherthan anarchism and individual brutality, is beyond stupidity. This film does have good technical qualities and some greatacting; and it does have content. Some special effects movieshave no real content or human interaction. This does have somegood content, but it is heavily diluted with bad story writing and toomuch emphasis on a selfish, unknowable character.",Fight Club
781,hcreeve24,I am Jack's stunned mind,10,7 March 2001,"Fight Club is unlike anything you have ever seen. It is at a dark comedy, a social commentary, a twisted love story, and finally a total assualt to your senses.  Edward Norton plays the narrator, a biting commentary on the facelessness of our society. He is suffering from insomia when he starts to go to self help groups.  The groups help him sleep.  Helena Boheim Carter plays Marla a fellow support group faker whom the narrator despises. When we meet Tyler Durden we know he's trouble.  Tyler comments on how the proper mixture of OJ and gasoline will make Napalm.  Durden is brilliantly played by Brad Pitt, he plays Durden as a sadistic anarchist, who believes society should de-evolve from its friendly nature. Tyler and the narrator form Fight Club, a club that the basic goal is to beat the crap out of one and another.  It is a brutal club based on a idea of infinite freedom.  The club slowly evolves into a sick little militia called Project Mayhem. The rest of them movie is a sick little game between Tyler and the Narrator.  The end result being the stunning truth about their relationship. Fight Club is ingenious and it isn't for everyone. The movie is bizzare and shocking it is twisted and brilliant.  The movie is one stunning twist after another and it is a testament to Finchers genius.  This is a fantastic movie and I would recomend it to everyone.",Fight Club

David Fincher gave Hollywood and the whole world a big bloody middle finger when he made this and in my opinion there had never been a better movie made that had this strong of a reaction and made sure that those reactions would stay with everyone for all time. I'm not sure if this can be considered a satire but if so, then this movie is the poster child for all satires. For anybody born between 1985 and 1999 this is the pinnacle of movie going experiences and I'm included in that group of people who believe that no other movie has grabbed a hold of a nation and shook the foundation of their lives and said ""Get the F**K UP and do something with your life""!. Everything about this movies screams PERFECTION. The acting is top notch from everyone involved (Norton, Pitt, Bonham Carter, & Meat Loaf) with all the characters making us as the audience feel sympathetic, angry, and every other feeling for them.

When Tyler Durden, a charming and fascinating soap salesman, befriends a disconnected, confused white collar worker known as Jack, the duo enter a world of radical and social destructiveness to avenge years of corporate intoxication and brainwashing. Spending his nights haunting touchy feely support groups for life threatening illness's he doesn't have, Jack desperately tries to seek some kind of emotional connection to his mundane existence. His numbing job as a mindless number crunching robot feeds an obsession for material possessions, his life appearing complete and perfect.But Jack's life is suddenly turned upside down when his apartment is mysteriously blown up, and he falls into the alluring world of brutal bare knuckle brawls in a pub basement where barely-living nobody's duke it out as a bizarre form of therapy and male bonding. As the Late nights of violent and senseless beatings at the fists of stranger's turns addictive, and the underground fight club moves out of the basement and on to the streets, Jack and Tyler's dystopian lifestyle attracts an army of fellow freedom fighters. Tyler and his dismal devotee spread their messages of enchanting pandemonium and lead a full scale organization of mayhem and chaos against the foundations of an out of touch society. But as the stakes of Project Mayhem escalate and reach unexpected new heights, Jack learns that his leader is more than a just a flamboyant soap salesman with devilish tendencies. Tyler Durden proves to be insidious, unpredictably dangerous and closer to Jack than first thought.",Fight Club
787,gheremond,Generation X's cry for freedom,10,18 August 2015,"This may well be one of the most important films ever made. It marks the creative pinnacle of the great David Fincher and the film's critical and commercial failure at the time essentially marked the end of his highly productive period, it was all downhill after Fight Club. Driven by two stellar performances by Edward Norton and Fincher regular Brad Pitt, this is the closest to a live action revolutionary manifesto you are ever going to get from Hollywood. What would happen if gen-X woke up one morning and decided they have had enough with being white collar slaves, shopping from IKEA and living gloomy lonely lives in condos? Mischief, mayhem and of course... soap. Fincher and co. are on fire in terms of creativity and this shows in every aspect of the movie, direction, special effects, soundtrack, killer one-liners, hardly a scene passes without something hilarious, visually breathtaking or immensely quotable taking place (this must be the most quotable film this side of the 80's). It's also philosophically dense and with it's hardcore anti-consumerism stance would make a great companion piece for Into the Wild. Or V for Vendetta.The real triumph of Fight Club though is that it takes a page from Tyler Durden's playbook and maintains a carefree, defiant and feel-good attitude, even when the s**t hits the fan and although Fincher is known for a tendency towards darkness, he is not willing here to succumb to the doom and gloom of Seven and it's this optimism that makes Fight Club a winner.

Unfortunately, the film grows tiresome after the first few thrashings.  The message is a good one, but the delivery is a mess.  The sad thing is that lots of testosterone laced young ones will probably get the wrong idea and take the more brutal and sociopathic parts seriously and even model this behavior to some degree.  Can't the idea of rebelling against social brainwashing be made less violently?  There must be a gentler way to show that all we need is shelter, clothing and food...everything else is just filler and working twice as long as you have to to clutter up your life is madness...making a national past time of watching oversized men run into each other in a futile attempt to bring a ball across a line on a field is sheer lunacy.

792,rubenvanbergen,Moralizing and more predictable than it is made out to be,6,17 November 2012,"I have two problems with this movie. Firstly, it badly wants to convey a message about consumerism, evil corporations, the shallowness of modern society, and all the things that that phony guy in college used to talk about while wearing expensive brands and a $100 haircut and generally making way too much of an effort trying to look like he just doesn't give a sh*t. Unsurprisingly, it's exactly that sort of people who tend to evangelize about this movie and how profound it is. Secondly, these same people will also insist on telling you how surprised they were with the ending and how clever they thought it was. Don't get me wrong, it's not super obvious, but as twist endings go it's pretty vanilla. It's a bit like the appearance of twins in any mystery story (you know the reveal will involve them swapping identities at some stage) crossed with the age-old ""it was all a dream"". Anyone who pays attention to these things I give about a 50% chance of guessing it before the end (or 90% if you know there is a twist). So the message is laid on a bit too thick and the ending not mind- blowing. Big deal, right? Indeed, these are no big vices, but the problem is that the film and its following are so infatuated with themselves that they lead one to expect something between artistic genius and an article of faith. The fact that (understandably) it is neither makes the movie disappointing, which it otherwise might not have been.",Fight Club
793,filmquestint,Fincher's half,5,6 February 2005,"I sat through the first half of this movie with my mouth open. It was so exciting, brilliant, a Fritz Lang for the new millennium. Edward Norton's face. That insomnia that he carries all over him is so magnificently drawn that creates the opposite effect on its audience. I was awake, very awake, sitting on the edge of my seat, devouring every moment, enjoying it like hell. Helena Bonham Carter was a like a great silent movie star doing her first talkie. Pola Negri, Theda Bara. As if this wan't enough, Brad Pitt, and Brad Pitt is Brad Pitt with all its fabulous connotations. Then, can you explain to me why I detested this movie? Why it made me so angry? Can you? I can only tell you that half way through I turned against the movie or the movie turned against me, either way I didn't like it. I felt cheated in the worse possible way. I felt treated like a moron. You start promising me the most unique film experience I've had in a long time but what you delivered was a tired, opportunistic, gimmicky, easy piece of nonsense. Why? David Fincher is one of the most consummated craftsmen American movies have ever had. Don't you agree? He can tell you a story, even something like ""Seven"", a horror thriller, in a way we've never seen before, at least half of it. He has an eye like no other. That's why my frustration. An artist like that putting himself at the service of something that's not done, not finished not worthy of his talents. You may think I'm being a bit too hard on the man. But let me tell you, it's out of love. I expect so much from him, I've seen what he is capable of. But so far have been only halves. Brilliantly acted, sensational to look at, but halves, just halves. He should look at Fritz Lang, Pietro Germi, Alfred Hitchcock, Michael Powell, William Wellman and naturally John Ford, Martin Scorsese and Steven Spielberg. Fincher already inherited something from each one of them. Now the trick is that it isn't a trick. Half is better than nothing. But in the grand scheme of things, it's not enough.",Fight Club

The irony is that the film in really serves as a strong critique against the two main characteristics that Tylor represents: anti-establishment and masculinity. To begin with, the movie was produced by one of the biggest media corporates in the world, cashing on the corporate hatred and self- hatred generated precisely by those corporates. The crowd who followed Tylor thinking that they are liberated from the capitalist treadmill are in fact merely shifting from one treadmill to another. Same as the fascist followers who felt empowered carrying out the orders, in the process of working for Tylor they are really being exploited and given a tiny share of the power and resources they gathered - exactly the same as working for a company. Will their lives really change after credit records are destroyed? We have seen how communist revolutions rose and fell. What is, then, the whole point of the movement? It is a project of the protagonist set out to find his own value, instead of being defined by others. It is a process that requires internal examination and self-awareness. The crowd he draws is used for his personal project; eventually he becomes aware of his other self, Tylor, examined his own actions and those of Tylor's, and finds peace again with himself.Another mockery the film makes is towards the concept of masculinity. I quickly noticed the crowd drawn by Tylor consists only males, and the character itself is the projection of perfect masculinity perceived by the society. In a civilised society where powerful positions no longer require physical strength, certain male members feel a great sense of insecurity – exactly the members fight club attracts. Frustrated by their failure to gain influence in the establishment, they go to the gym and boxing clubs to regain confidence, or engage in reckless behaviours to show how daring they are. The film portrayed these people as flat in character and seemingly stupid. The only trait that sets Tylor apart from them is his intelligence. In fact, it was the intelligent part of him that woke him up from the corporate slavery, not the masculine part. Violence and sex are used as a tool to express power, but after the short-lived pleasure derived from the power trip, the ensuing wounds and pain are long-lasting. While Tylor dominated Marla in bed, the protagonist does not even feel the pleasure from sex. In the end, the feminine and powerless Marla saves the protagonist by reconnecting the conflicting parts of him and completes his self- searching journey. My mood was manipulated by the film the first time I saw it; the motivational speech about self-discovery and pursuit of passion sold me. But when I realised they were blindly targeting companies, I suddenly realised the stupidity of the ideology with which the crowd was bonded, and from that departure, I felt alienated from the protagonist and from the film and was able to see the bigger picture. From the interviews of the author and the director I did not see the same interpretation I had, however, I believe an art piece has its own life after its creation. From cinematographic perspective, this is a very well made film. Once again Fincher did an excellent job. I recommend this film.",Fight Club
795,joehemmings68,"Visceral, Film Studies Fodder",9,12 January 2015,"I've probably seen this film more times than any other, having studied it on two separate film studies courses. The plot is so well written, that whether it actually makes perfect sense isn't really relevant, it's completely absorbing. Brad Pitt, Edward Norton and Helena Bonham Carter all do fantastically well here, especially as they interact with each other. The film in it's entirety is uncomfortable, the fights themselves are filmed in a brutal, uncompromising way, but scenes where characters simply talk can be enough to make you squirm.This is visceral film making. It's nasty, it's scrappy, it's stylistically inconsistent. Morally it's a mind bender, with numerous theories as to where the director is coming from here. You'll want to watch this multiple times to get a complete understanding of what's happening, and where you stand.This is far braver than any of Fincher's other films, and it's also far more all over the place, and I love it for that. Fight Club gets under your skin, and it does it through the strange structure and atmosphere, and that's a powerful approach to film making, one that's rarely attempted and even more rarely pulled off.",Fight Club
796,limau,"Great ending, everything else quite dire",5,2 April 2006,"I find this film hard to watch, not because of the violence, but rather I don't really care about the characters to want to keep my eyes on the screen and found myself looking at something else more interesting half the time. All I can think of when I do watch is - ""Why?"".Of course it became clear why towards the end. And it is also clear to me that the film relies on the boys' fascination with violence to keep the film going until the ending when you can see what is happening, at which point it actually got quite thrilling. Otherwise there isn't really anything that is very interesting, just a middle class boys' fantasy of a more exciting existence while living their own very comfortable but dull lives. It's for boys who get stuck in this contradictory existence - hating the good life they have, wanting to destroy it but in truth will never give up their comfortable lifestyle. It's as stupid and as childish as the insertion of naughty bits into the film.It is for the ending that it got higher vote that it did, nothing much else to recommend it otherwise.",Fight Club

I have no idea why people think this, he has the best view on life. Ed Norton gives us another terrific performance, he has always been my favorite actor. Fincher demonstrates once again what a terrific and innovative director he is, his last two movies The Game and Seven were superb (I still think Seven probably has the best ending to a movie). People always critisise this movie for its violence, if some people look a bit deeper and actually watch the movie properly then they will see that this is one hell of a movie. Easily my all time favorite movie. A definite 10/10",Fight Club
798,Flints,Laugh Fest...,7,26 April 2000,"Fight Club is a laugh fest from beginning to end.  Brad Pitt is very engaging as the fight club 'director'.  I was very pleased with the entire film.  While a great deal of violence is in this picture, it is in a perspective that makes it cartoonish.Congrats to all involved in this film.  The story, the screenplay, the acting, everything is well-tuned for good entertainment. And, great fun!",Fight Club
799,texasgal1976,An Overlooked Classic,10,28 May 2000,"Fight Club is one of those films that I think will be appreciated more as time goes on. The story has so many twists and turns and is never boring and the outcome is even a bigger revelation than the one in The 6th Sense. From start to finish the film never slows down. It is mind-blowing and amazing and the direction and other camera tricks by Fincher is top notch. Perhaps, the most impressive thing about this flick is Ed Norton. There is one scene that Norton's character has with his boss that is Oscar-worthy. It's a shame the Academy, however, decided to ignore him this time. Brad Pitt, Helena Bonham Carter, and Meat Loaf also give noteworthy performances.",Fight Club
800,bleakeye,Intense!,10,22 February 2001,"When I first saw the movie trailer of Fight Club, I thought that this has some potential to be a good movie.  But... I didn't get to see this movie because of a hectic schedule that I set myself up for.  Exhausted, I stopped following my schedule a few months later.  I went out, got myself a membership to a local video store and decided to become an instant movie buff and got a whole bunch of newly released video tapes.  Out of all the movies I saw, Fight Club stood out and was the only movie that I repeated over and over.  I knew about the great actors, interesting idea and the violence of this movie, but I was shocked to find a thought-provoking and breathtaking film.  I have seen hundreds of movies before this and I was impressed to say the least.  This is the most relevant movie for me.  Like the main character, (played effortlessly by Edward Norton) I also was and still is suffering from insomnia and also from, what looks to be the same reasons as he was.  He was suffering and needed something in his life.  He meets Tyler Durden (seemingly played with great ease by Brad Pitt) in a plane trip and becomes his new best friend.  Together, they develop Fight Club (self-explanatory isn't it?).  I will not say more about this movie because I want people who haven't seen this to not know what to expect like I did when I watched this film.  The surprise does help give the film the feeling that it needs.  Not a film for everyone due to excessive violence, sex and gore ,but for anyone who can stand it all and hasn't seen it yet, watch it!",Fight Club

802,moz-1,The most important cultural text in cinema.,10,6 March 2001,"This is without doubt a phenominal movie that should change everything in, not just cinema, but the world.  The whole film is a prophecy that reaches out to society, flailing in consumerism.  The direction is perfect, subtle and uber-cool.  Pitt and Norton both give career bests.  Finally, Chuck Palanuk provides a source of unparallelled genius throughout.   The first time you watch this movie, you enjoy it.  It appears to be all good fun and the twist at the end is pretty stupifying.  Then, maybe a few months later, you pick it up again (now well aware of who Tyler Durden is) and you realise that this truly is a masterpiece in every sense of the word.  Not only are you over the initial spectacle of the whole thing and thus able to experience it at a deeper level, but the way Durden's schizophrenia is incorporated throughout the entire narrative makes you wonder how you didn't spot it before.Now watch it a third time for true enlightenment.  Gradually, as you here the dulcet tones of the Pixies once again, you realise everything makes sense now.  That desire, that missing feeling you have felt since you were a kid, is suddenly satisfied, or at least identified.  From this point on you can watch this movie again and again, and never get bored.I think that Fight Club should have been shown twice in a row at the cinema, because that is the real experience.  You look once and then you look again and it doesn't get worse, it gets better.  In my opinion the same was true with The Usual Suspects and Memento.  Both had shock endings, but when you have got over the gimmick of a twist you can really start to appreciate a classic like this.",Fight Club
803,unigolyn,The litmus test for intelligence.,10,29 August 2002,"I believe Roger Ebert is a literate man. I also believe he lacks true intelligence. As does anyone else who dismisses this movie on grounds of excessive violence (this from the man who wrote Beyond the Valley of the Dolls, a movie in which a character is killed by forced anal sex involving a 20 inch pointed strap-on dildo, for christ's sake). People here who fail to see the brilliance of this movie, comment that the 'excessive swearing and nudity' sickened them. Since when is nudity a sickening thing? Does the word 'f**k' make you convulse in nausea? It's just the human body, we all have one. It's just a word depicting an activity that the majority of us partake in. Prudishness like that doesn't sicken me, it does infuriate me though.Excessive violence? First of all, there isn't that much violence in this movie. What little there is seems to have an unpleasant quality, though - it's realistic. When you pound a man's head into a concrete floor, it really does turn into a bloody mess. What's the problem? Is violence not a real concept? Do people actually never fight? This movie deals with violence responsibly, more responsibly than any other movie i can think of. This isn't Arnie throwing faceless bad guys through plaster walls, this is a depiction of what really happens when you beat the living shit out of people, or when someone gets a bullet in the head. It's not excessive in the slightest. It's just real.'How much can you really know about yourself if you've never been in a fight?' asks Tyler Durden. How much do you know about the reality of being human if you've never left the creature comforts of your safe little worlds, if you've never run for your lives, if you've never felt adrenaline pumping into your body and your instincts taken over as your hand clenches into a fist? Ebert is a prime example of a literati, who by the looks of him has never been in a fight. I doubt he fought in Vietnam, or has ever faced violence. And that's my point - human beings aren't simply their intellect, they are also animals with instincts. What's your point, Ebert, that we must forego our urges? What if the urge is to fight, and the fighting is consensual? I know that you aren't against excess in sexual matters, due to your involvement with Russ Meyer films. Are some urges, in your opinion, more harmful? Sex is better than violence? Ask a rape victim if he or she had preferred a good beating instead.But Fight Club is not about violence. It's about survival instincts (they fight to feel alive, not to cause pain). It's about men with no great depression, no great war. Throughout human history, men have had to fight for their survival, whether in earning a living or fighting in wars. No longer. What's the point now? That's what the movie asks. I am not personally a consumer-minded individual, i consider myself more of a hedonist. I don't care about things, unless things actually let me enjoy myself more. I don't need Tyler's preaching. But a lot of people do. If a pair of CK underwear makes you feel better about yourself, then there's something seriously wrong.Someone here said that this movie's message is an insult to the world that our ancestors fought to give us. It does not insult that. It insults and questions the way we live in that world. Did soldiers storm the beaches of Normandy for Britney Spears and valley girls saying 'like, duh'? Did Churchill sacrifice Coventry for Big Brother and cell phone ringtones? Did the people Hiroshima and Nagasaki die for Pokemon?This movie is about a lot of things, it's brilliantly written, brilliantly shot, brilliantly acted, brilliantly directed. It makes you think, it makes you smile in agreement, it makes you shake your head in disapproval. That is, if you have a brain. If someone asks me what the best movie i've ever seen is, my answer would have to be Fight Club.P.S. some people have called this movie fascist...Fascism - A system of government marked by centralization of authority under a dictator, stringent socioeconomic controls, suppression of the opposition through terror and censorship, and typically a policy of belligerent nationalism and racism. ...says the dictionary. The space monkeys worship Tyler Durden in the same way Buddhists worship Buddha - he is to them an enlightened individual to whom they look for instruction. Cult of personality does not a fascist make. Tyler Durden is a clear-cut anarchist.",Fight Club
804,rock_rishab,Face facts,10,7 January 2009,"So after reading many of the ""I hate"" comments I realized a thing or two, well 1st of all there a few who think this movie is in a way (even if u may not realize it) an insult to Capitalism. Well let me tell you something, ""IT IS TRUE""Well there were people asking for the fact that why would young men join something this mindless. Well I have to say this but, ""Mindlessness is the virtue for a tortured soul"". There are many people who would do anything to get out of their present situation, for example many poor Thai people (like villagers) who take on ""Muay Thai"" (or kick boxing as many know), just as a way to get out of their present situation or life. Plus this is a movie not a documentary, there are bound to be mistakes. Get the idea behind it, if you are looking for flaws you can find it in ""Monalisa"" too. And Oscars, well Shawshank Redemption also didn't get that much noticed did it? So didn't so many great movies. ""The Departed"" I mean come on, Martin Scorsese did deserve an Oscar, but ""Departed"" was not the one he should have received it for.""Raging Bull"","" Goodfellas"", etc etc. He never got one for these???? Isn't that strange. I'll say no, because this is what life is ""Random Events, with no reasons most of the time"". So what if fight club didn't get noticed for Oscar. Even better its like an artist never being realized for his caliber in his times. And this is movie is for dumb people? So what makes you so sure that you are that smart? Well this is after all a guy movie, and people who have actually been devoured by the consumerism and life style factor of our times can never realize it.

Brad Pitt, Edward Norton, and Helena Bonham Carter all give excellent performances as the roles they play.Here's how it goes down: We start in a room where the narrator (we're not given his name) has a gun pointed in his mouth. Tyler Durden (Pitt)is holding the gun. The narrator flashes back to another point in the movie. He had insomnia, and he couldn't sleep. on the DVD player, if you slow it down at the right time, you can see Brad Pitt in the picture. The narrator goes to support groups to see real pain people have. Eventually, he gets to sleep. Really good sleep. However, he loses his sleep yet again when Marla Singer (Carter), a drug-addict who has no diseases at all, comes into his support groups. They talk over who gets which support group on which days. They agree on it, but when they exchange numbers for when if they want to switch, his doesn't have a name, so she wonders which one it is...""Cornelius, Rupert, Travis? Any of the stupid names you give out each night?"" On a flight, he meets Tyler Durden. He talks about how the safety cards in the pocket in front of the seats show calm faces when experiencing a 30 000-foot escape or 600 mph drop. When I first saw this, I realized that he's right. Why the f*** would anyone look calm when they're about to die, and during a crash of all things? After meeting again at a bar since the narrator's condo blew up, Tyler asks the narrator to hit him. The narrator pulls away from the scene to talk about Tyler. He gets the film go from one reel to the next. He likes to add pornography into children's films. He also urinates in the soups. They eventually get in a fight and they go over to Tyler's house where they will stay.Eventually, Fight Club is assembled, with many men involved. 8 rules of Fight Club: 1. You do not talk about Fight Club. 2. You do not talk about Fight Club. 3. When someone taps, goes limp, or yells Stop, the fight is over. 4. Two people to a fight. 5. One fight at a time. 6. No shirts, no shoes. 7. Fights will go on as long as they have to. 8. If it's your first night in Fight Club, you have to fight.A lot of other things occur in the movie and the twist is really cool.

All the performances are top notch, Edward Norton is fabulously understated as the lead, Brad Pitt brings Tyler Durden to life in a way that proves that the guy ain't just a pretty face. Helena Bonham Carter, Meat Loaf and Jared Leto excel, especially The Loaf, because he is an incredible actor that deserves more credit than he gets for his acting.The twist, although I guessed it halfway through, is brilliant, and David Fincher brings the whole thing together like the Mona Lisa.

Brad Pitt, the star of the movie, played his character (Tyler Durden) flawlessly.  Throughout the movie, Ed Norton's character (the narrator) was trying to fight his inner demons which were preventing him from getting any sleep.  With the help of several small terrorist groups, a disturbed female that pretended to suffer from testicular cancer, and Tyler Durden (a self righteous psycho), the narrator can finally resolve his problems.

I'll just try to simply put why I loved this movie, or why you have to see it even if you might hate it. Because yes, you might hate it. Still, you have to see it.Fight Club is unique, or, at least, was when it came out in 1999, it definitely was. I was only 16 when I saw it, and to be honest, I went in for Brad Pitt. When it finished, I just knew I had seen one of the most outstanding movie I'll ever watch. I had forgotten Brad Pitt: the movies tones, themes, execution and wonderful ending (and I'm not talking about the twist here but really the end of the movie that caught me off-guard) are just top notch. It made me think, laugh, stress, cringe, confused me, punched me in the face and left me speechless.Now, 12 years later, I have re-watched it many times, and each viewing brought me new perspectives, and I never ever get tires of this movie.Whatever your opinion on Fight Club is, It's impossible that none of the many one-liners of Tyler Durden (or part of his speeches) ) make you tick, react, or remind you of your own life.Maybe Fight club was a generational movie. Maybe it is overrated. Maybe it's for some pointless.

813,dslacker,A Movie About Ideas,10,3 September 2000,"This is a movie about ideas - class and generational conflicts foremost among them.  This film should make you think about how our society depends on consumers spending money on useless junk to keep the corporate world and the upper class it supports intact.  My generation (boomers) spent the first 40 years of its existence under the thumb of the WWII generation before it. Now the boomers are in control and it would appear the only lessons we learned were how to keep the next generation enslaved more effectively. There are plenty of other ideas in ""Fight Club"" but these stood out in my mind.  There's violence too - one of the grossest scenes I've ever seen was Tyler deliberately egging Lou (owner of ""Lou's"") on as a way to establish himself as 'God' of Fight Club.  On the other hand, the narrator beating himself to a pulp in his boss' office is one of the funniest scenes in recent movies.  Every year Hollywood issues dozens of movies where bullets are flying every 10 minutes, bodies stack up like firewood, and blood and human tissue spatter the screen almost continuously.  ""Fight Club"" has none of that - its too busy being original, pumping out intelligent observations, and raising questions with its audience.  The answers it gives are not the answers we (or society) can live with, so the solutions must come from somewhere else - maybe we're being asked to think for ourselves?  The writers, director, and creative persons who put ""Fight Club"" together certainly did plenty of that.  I'm truly amazed that Fox stood behind this film, didn't change it to something commerically acceptable, and went on to issue a world class DVD.  I believe they will be rewarded.  Twenty years from now when such pale entertainments such as ""Green Mile"" and ""American Beauty"" are all but forgotten, people will still be watching and talking about ""Fight Club"" 	The fact that so many people contributing to these comments feel that ""Fight Club"" is either the best or the worst picture of 1999 says a lot about it.  The first time I saw it, I was overwhelmed with 'too much information' and just thought it was OK.  Went back three days later and liked it more.  Now that I've seen the DVD a few times, I consider it one of the best movies ever made.  Jim Uhls's screenplay from Chuck Palahniuk's novel is brilliant.  Ed Norton, Brad Pitt, and Helena Bonham Carter give performances that are at least the equal of anything they've done previously in their talented and remarkable careers.  And you've never seen Meatloaf like this before and you'll never see him in quite the same way again. Director David Fincher (with considerable help, no doubt) has made a movie that never lets ups in its artistry or craftmanship.  Excellence is evident in every detail of every frame.  Each time you watch it, there's more to see and think about. 	1999 will long be remembered for its original, inventive, and intelligent films coming from the long criticized studio system.  Besides ""Fight Club"" there was ""Being John Malkovich"", ""The Matrix"", and ""Three Kings"". Let's not forget ""Blair Witch"", ""Sixth Sense"", ""South Park"", and ""Tarzan"".   Throw in ""Eyes Wide Shut"" and ""The Talented Mr. Ripley"" and I'm running out of room for ""American Beauty"" to even make my top ten.

815,Gordon_Six_Echo,"A Brilliant, Apocalyptic Vision.......",10,21 February 2000,"""Fight Club"" continues director David Fincher's streak of groundbreaking films that he has created, following 95's ""Seven"", and 97's ""The Game"". This is probably his most riveting effort yet because he displays a vision similar to the dark atmospheres of both ""Seven"" and ""The Game"", but with a nail-biting social commentary on what the male race in society hunger for when they have nowhere else to turn. The Edward Norton character, I think, most of us will be able to relate to, male or female. I, myself, have felt seduced by consumerism much like Norton's character, and occasionally pray for a way out, or an antidode of some sort. For Norton, the antidode is Fight Club, which he creates, along with the help of the eccentric Tyler Durden, played by Brad Pitt in his performance in years.Like Fincher's previous films, ""Fight Club"" will definately surprise you, only this time it will do so on more than one occasion. The 'twist' ending is one of the best ones in recent years, along with ""Arlington Road"". It's a shame that this film didn't get recognized at the oscars, as much as it should've.

Of course it's message is abhorrent and we must never allow ourselves to turn into this, but every now and then, we all need to let our self-destructive side out. This film allows me to do it in a safe environment, that's why it's so brilliant.Part of every man wants to be like Tyler Durden, It should never happen, but it's okay to dream.",Fight Club

Fight club can be said to be a black comedy, in which the humor with the theme of death can be seen everywhere. This dark comedy with a strong David finch color and a theme of death is an anti Hollywood commercial film mode. It is a visual masterpiece with wild images, wild techniques and weird scenes.",Fight Club

824,b1lskirnir,The film of an entire generation... masterpiece,10,12 February 2006,"If someone has told you that ""you need to see this movie,"" then they're not far off. They're probably in their 20s or 30s and lived through that time when Starbucks was the next big thing, companies were starting to ditch dial-up for DSL, Casual Friday was the only motivation they ever had to live through the week, and their parents were too busy getting divorced to force them to go to graduate school.When it comes to periods within these eras of self-reflection, satire movies like Office Space come to mind. However, Fight Club goes a step beyond and then some, taking a look at how this lifestyle obsession invades every aspect of life, sinking into our personal lives, making it impossible to find a woman who doesn't despise your guts outside of the physical side of your relationship, where being clever and funny are the only things you have to keep yourself sane, and where a generation of MTV-raised, Saturday morning cartoons, post-Reagan politics, Hollywood-worshiping, McDonalds and 7-11 Slushees men are being turned into demasculated raving psychotics trying to find any escape from their misery.Fight Club comes along at a time in history where it's perfect. We have our narrator and his miserable insurance salesman life with a job he hates buying all the useless crap he doesn't need to fill his apartment to satisfy himself with what he thinks makes him perfect and socially acceptable. He becomes so sick of himself that he seeks any escape. He finds hope in support groups for men with testicular cancer and starts to regain his sanity, only to have his hopes shattered when he finds another faker in the group... a woman. Things spiral out of control when he finds a strange soap salesman on a business flight and starts to take great interest in his life. He then leads him to a path to hit rock bottom, to live among the dregs of society, redefine his masculinity and prove it to others. What begins as a weekend hobby soon collapses into a downward spiral of complete and utter destruction and a seemingly hopeless struggle to put the pin back in the grenade.The film contains line after line of brilliant writing and takes twists and turns where you least expect. Every character is acted perfectly and not a frame of film is wasted. Some have claimed this as quite possibly the least predictable movie to ever come out of Hollywood. I would completely agree. However, this is not its only strong suit. Fight Club incorporates elements from almost every genre: drama, horror, thriller, action, suspense, mystery, and romance just to name a few. It tackles so many subjects and has so many messages it's really hard to know what to look at first. This is one of those movies where everyone has a favorite scene and no one has the same favorite quote. A film that speaks for an entire generation of men and the future of our lifestyle obsessed society, Fight Club is an all-time favorite for me and I would recommend it to absolutely anyone. Just sit down and watch with an open mind and you will not be disappointed.",Fight Club
825,buseoana,one of the coolest movie and book ever!!,10,27 February 2006,"the book was absolutely genius and of course the movie is too! this movie is so whacked and also so interesting, that you don't know whether to laugh or to cry at the end, and whether the end is disastrous, catastrophic or very pretty! it was an experience watching this one! it actually has a very strange mixture of extremes: a band of stressed people that develop a very very dangerous and strange hobby that turns into a sort of religion, a schizo who is brain damaged and doesn't even know it, the most weird love-hate relationship you have ever seen and the most weird, dubious and scary characters put together in just one movie..but it remains a very original and exciting film to watch...what can i say....if it's Edward Norton, it's bound to be a good movie!",Fight Club

827,valdyr,Fincher's best work,10,20 October 1999,"Fight Club is by far the best thing David Fincher has done... and also one of the best movies of the year.Deliberately subversive, Fight Club is really about suckerpunching its audience, violating taboo after taboo in a way that is at once friendly and menacing.  Subliminal images flicker in and out, the characters chat with the audience and the film only rarely flinches.Better yet, it lingers on the plight of men.  While it overdramatizes the male condition at times, it is at least willing to concede that all is not well in the land of testosterone... something few people are willing to either say or accept.  Its best moments are when it shows what the military (once the proving ground of men) has become... reducing soldiers to nameless programmable drones - ""The first rule of Project Mayhem is that you do not ask questions, sir.""  And when it talks about men, for all its playfulness, hipness and pop psychology, it is dead on more often than its wrong.For all that, it still bows to one convention of Hollywood film - the violence, while containing a fair amount of blood, isn't in the least realistic. (long term consequences are absent)  The grue in this film comes more from the violation of cherished taboos, the same way a good Clive Barker story does.Anyhow, check it out and make sure you do it on the big screen - you'll never notice everything without that assistance!",Fight Club
828,eke826s,"Very Original, Highly Entertaining, A Great Surprise",10,20 October 1999,"Fight Club isn't at all what one might expect it to be.

Who will remember what they did? The destruction of a few buildings and a few people is just a remodeling of the world. Soon the tall buildings will remain meaningless. Personal insanity does not change the world, like a joke.The world is meaningless. What really needs to be changed is people's re-examination of self.

If you are a guy who works hard (God only knows what for) to buy useless s*it and does only things that are considered socially acceptable, than this movie will speak to you, I guess some 1 billion people including (obviously I'm one of them). The first 70 minutes are top class....SPOILERS AHEAD ....even the fact that within few weeks on the base of a simple fighting club a para-military organization is built is just a minor flaw. But then the truth is revealed.....VERY IMPORTANT SPOILER .....Tyler is the Narrator, his alter ego. After initial shock and amazement you ask yourself one question: ""Do I feel lucky?"". Sorry, wrong movie, it should be: ""No, it can't be true, that's stupid, that's f***ing very disappointing!!!!"". It could be a classic but unfortunately it isn't.Well, original idea (based on a book but still original for a movie), great first half (it makes you wanna beat the s*it out of your boss, quit your job and join some anarchist group), really good acting (what did you expect, it's Norton, Pitt and Bonham-Carter) and Fincher is still a good director (though sometimes he gets lost). So the note is....6/10",Fight Club
834,fatehsmann,One of the seminal films of the 90's,10,29 September 2010,"David Fincher is one of the best directors in Hollywood today. This is his finest film.Based on the best selling book of the same name, the movie starts with the narrator,Edward Norton initially a nameless, boring drone leading a shallow, meaningless life as just another cog in the great corporate wheel. He spends his time buying sofa-sets and basically indulging in the huge facade that is today's materialistic and fake society. As he puts it: ""We used to read pornography, now it's the 'Horchow Collection'.""But he isn't satisfied with his life. There's always this nagging feeling, deep-down, a hint of discontent. This manifests into his psyche and he becomes an insomniac. Seeking medication, he discovers therapy groups, and there, on the pretext of a terminal disease or an addiction, he cries. He doesn't really know why he crying. Maybe its about the hollowness, and the utter futility of it all. This daily discharge helps him sleep. Until, that is, chain-smoking, messed-up Marla Singer starts coming to his therapy sessions for a similar purpose. Seeing another 'tourist' there bursts the happy he finds himself in and insomnia creeps back into his life. Then he meets Tyler Durdan and he's drawn, like everyone else, to his magnetic personality. One night, on a whim, Tyler asks the narrator to hit him. He complies, and thus begins fight club. Fight club transformed into a nocturnal activity in a basement where men shed the inhibitions laid down by society, and release themselves. That's all that I'm going to reveal here.But let's talk about Tyler Durdan. For it's not possible to talk about fight club and not talk about Tyler Durdan, a character who was recently named the greatest movie character of all time by a magazine, beating out competition from the likes of Darth Vader, Hannibal Lecter, The Joker, John Rambo etc. Brad Pitt outdoes himself in portraying just about the best example of an alpha-male you'll ever see. Tyler epitomises the saying about Bond (""Man want to be him, Women want to sleep with him"") more than any Bond. The rugged Daniel Craig, the cool suave and sophisticated Brosnan and Connery all fall flat in front of his sheer charisma. His laid-back, casual attitude tells of a man who has not a care in his life. The conviction with which speaks tells of a man who's got it all figured out. His radical thoughts and ideas tell of a fearless man, not afraid to go against society. And the small, condescending smile he occasionally afforded the narrator tells of a man who knows just how superior he is to everyone. Tyler Durdan acts the saviour of the society's repressed men and frees them from its clutches. Edward Norton too, does a brilliant job as the narrator, and his boring drawl as a narrative paradoxically draws you further in the movie. The narrator the quintessential modern man trying to find meaning who is swayed by forceful personality. The dialogues are smart and some of the lines have now achieved cult status and are often quoted to each other by today's hippys. The cinematography is completely in sync with the somewhat non-linear storyline and is so good that it somehow distracts most watching it for the first time (including me) from a very obvious truth which makes you feel really stupid afterwards. Because of this, Fight Club, has, for most of the stupid audience (which constitutes an incredibly large number of us) and also the ones who think they're too smart (the rest of us), a huge twist that leaves you gasping, adding to its excellent plot. In addition to the twist, the plot aptly puts a mirror to society. While the anti-consumerism propagated has been aptly covered by most reviewers, something that they missed was the movie showing how fickle and susceptible to propaganda the human population is, and who easily they get swayed in search of meaning. The film does tickle the fancies of many, despite the film's anarchistic messages being tempered down with wry humour. Fight club preaches about evolving beyond the endless pursuit of perfection by today's superficial society. Fight Club is about showing on your face what other people hide in their closets. Fight Club is about exposing the dirty underbelly that every household inevitably has. But it also preaches against taking its own ideas too extremely. But above all, it entertains. It is more than two hours of intense entertainment. For all those who haven't seen Fight Club, go watch it right now! 9/10",Fight Club
835,rehan_abbasi93,Its brilliance cannot be described by words alone,10,24 February 2012,"After getting tired of the crap that had been coming out of Hollywood for a past year or so,I decided to give old movies a chance. I thoroughly enjoyed the Matrix and Lord of the rings trilogies.Then,I stumbled upon Fight Club.The thought of two men starting a club to help vent male aggression didn't impress me much. After all,what could possibly be special about this to give this movie a rating of 8.8 on IMDb. I dimmed the lights and cranked the volume up.From the beginning,something felt right. There was an indescribable feeling in Edward Norton's voice over that agreed with me. Like his character, I too was tired of the day to day routine,the same crap that we do everyday and the petty things that we are made to run after in everyday life. Like him,I too despised that are minds were controlled through commercials and advertisements by corporations to keep us buying crap that we probably don't ever need. Another thing came poring over through me and that was the supposed significance of having names like Calvin Klein, Armani etc on your garments. A shirt should be a shirt whether it has cK written on it should not make a difference. As the movie progressed, feelings of rebellion grew in me. I wanted to leave everything and fight against the present system. Fighting against these urges ,I controlled myself with great difficulty. I didn't care much about the end, as the film had delivered beyond my wildest expectations This movie made me a fan of David Fincher. Also Brad Pitt,who I thought was successful due to just his pretty face, elevated in respect in my mind. One of the top 3 films as far as I'm concerned",Fight Club

One of the less philosophical thoughts was could this film have been released after September 11 without the censors intervening? I think not.This film is promoted in the wrong way too. It is hardly disturbing compared to films that are even slightly underground. But the point is, all the hype and world events surrounding this film do not change the fact that it is a brilliant film and something I didn't think the mainstream would achieve for a long time.Themes of terrorism, anti-commercialism and identity-crisis are all explored and it has one of the best closing scenes I have ever seen.All in all, not the best movie made or anything, but a mainstream movie worth seeing.",Fight Club

842,dangerhorse,Natural Born Renderers,6,29 December 2001,"I had many people, whose movie opinions I respect, tell me that 'Fight Club' was an excellent movie...a black commentary on the new twentygoingonthirtysomething angst/disaffection/rage.  I see that is in the mid-30's on the IMDB Top 250, so many must agree.  I watched it recently, and have to say that it did not engage me to any degree.  I have no objection to violence, surrealism, plot twists, or dark themes...all of which 'Fight Club' has in abundance.  For example, I enjoy movies like 'Full Metal Jacket', 'Blue Velvet', 'Apocalypse Now', 'Seven', 'Goodfellas', and 'Memento'.  All have violence and/or surrealism and/or plot twists and/or dark themes...in spades.  So I had no predisposition to dislike this movie.But I did.  The individual elements are there, but it didn't work for me. As the movie progressed, I found myself anxiously waiting for it to end. Not to see the end, but for it to just be over.  To give you a frame of reference, this movie very much fits into the 'Usual Suspects/L.A. Confidential' category for me.  I did not like either of those movies, either, even though all evidence/buzz/previews/reviews indicated that I should love them, and disliking them put me in a very small minority.Nonetheless, both Pitt and Norton do some excellent acting, and the direction sets the mood for which it shoots.  It was also refreshing to watch something different from the endless stream of crud being excreted by Hollywood in the last few years.

All I see is a tiresome and unappetizing jerk who turns into a tiresome masochist with bruises.  There is nothing liberating in this piece of trash.  There is only an inauthentic jerk who turns into a more disagreeable inauthentic jerk.Given that it takes a lot of money and a lot of talented people to make a movie like this, it's incomprehensible how this piece of trash like this ever got made, and even more incomprehensible how any sane and intelligent critic could find any redeeming qualities in it.If the movie demonstrates anything, it's that lunacy and tastelessness has taken over.

One thing I have to point out: I accepted the over exaggerated amount of violence spread around the entire movie, but what was it all for? David Fincher manages to deliver an excellent movie for two thirds of its lenght, then, (don't ask my why) things goes horribly wrong and the director simply seems unable to step out of all this mess, serving up an unsatisfactory (happy?) end that leaves the viewer dubious about the entire movie.Has it got any sense? Maybe, but frankly is an obscure one, and anyway not as smart as its characters try to tell us. It's really a pity, because visually the movie is simply superb, the audio department is heavenly and the two male leads give wonderful performances, particularly Brad Pitt in what is maybe his best work to date.In the end, a very strange movie, with a very strange message, that will surely find disciples and adepts among the less discerning members of the audience, but that nevertheless should be seen as a potentially dangerous object from which could eventually be better keep the distance.",Fight Club

The next day Taylor left but the plan didn't seem to stop.He began to look for Taylor's traces, trying to prevent even worse things happening, but Taylor can always take a step earlier than him. The strange thing is that every time he gets off the plane, he feels like the city has come. He decided to surrender himself and found that even the police were part of the fighting club. Helpless, he had to order his subordinates to stop everything.

856,rossaw,"it's a great rant, just ""let go"" and enjoy it",9,8 February 2002,"This movie is too graphically and personally violent (and the violence goes on too long), the squalor is too squalid, the grit too gritty, the plot too twisted, and the message basically retarded. But it's a truly great flick, especially if you can appreciate it for what it is. It's a rant. One doesn't take rants seriously, one appreciates them for style, vigor, angst, and in fact for their very absurdity itself. The spirit of the rant is Quixotic, it's ""we're not going to take this anymore"" when you know perfectly well you're going to take it more and then some. You're leaving rational discussion behind. You're banging your head against the wall to prove you really mean it. It's fantasy, like all good movies. We, the rational and reasonable audience, are allowed to vicariously go over the edge, and we shall be brought back, by some means -- don't worry -- and don't complain (you got back didn't you?). Meanwhile one enjoys the release from reason. ""Just let go!"" Durkin says to the narrator at one point. That's what this movie is all about, the fantasy of letting go. Perhaps some people feel threatened by this, because they're so bottled up they might wonder if they're headed up on some roof somewhere with a telescopic rifle. Don't worry, all of us know somebody we'd like to kill, or, say, punch really hard. Admit it! This movie speaks to that, but don't forget, it's only a movie. Brad Pitt is a consumer product, this movie is a consumer product and a good one. People reacting to the content of the argument miss the point -- a fact iteratively stored within the plot itself.  Fantastic direction especially.",Fight Club

And to take the material of Fight Club and think it'd make a great movie, to me, would seem crazy. But I'm truly grateful they did.I remember when this film came out, at the time it kind of got dismissed by the critics. I guess because it is so different in its approach to, not only the content, but also the way the movie was constructed. Though I also think a lot of people didn't like the concept behind Fight Club, it really goes against the grain and what we deem as acceptable in these modern times. Yet that is the beauty of the film... it leaves you with that unnerving thought of; are you living a life you have been conditioned to live?Today the movie still holds up. It's different take on things is still refreshing and thoughtful. The movie is certainly not for everybody, and it unashamedly knows that. There are no compromises here.",Fight Club

861,amerbajramovic,That mind game...,9,19 June 2017,"I think that one of the most amazing things about this movie is that the movie itself is just as same as his main character. Messed out.I have to be honest, at one point in time, i did not have any idea what to think of this whole plot. I was just like ""lets see what happens at the end"". I didn't know on which side is the truth. And I loved it. That whole confusion that is lived by Lou is transferred to watchers and i consider that among the best qualities of this film. A story that is told is what we feel and it is hard to describe it. It is something you have to experience.I like that revolutionary spirit, that rebel prism we all look through on this movie and that state of mind which is totally broken and that made me think about what is my purpose in this world, in my life, in whole this universe. That freedom of doing a scene that co respond with Lou's (or Tyler's, I still don't know what to think) mental disease and having that true feeling that entire movie is just a picture he sees. I say again, it is so hard to describe.One thing I didn't like, one among the very few, is braking of the barrier between the movie and watchers. Concept was endangered and that, beside some small but pretty lame mistakes like some total coincidences, made me give it 9 instead of 10.A great psychological game with a watcher's mind, well set and done movie plot, great story of a man's mental rise and fall, unusual love story, rebel awakening in viewers, outstanding acting, unexpected twist... This movie has it all. A 'Must watch' type of movie.",Fight Club
862,jakehenry-80471,A Nonsensical story with some highlights,5,12 September 2018,"The film is so highly acclaimed so I thought it would be a good viewing experience but I was wrong.The first act of the film is really strong, Edward Norton gives a terrific performance and it's interesting to watch the characters insomnia play out. I love the subtle hints given towards the final twist of Norton being Tyler Durdon.
Yet Brad Pitt's introduction is where the film becomes dull, First I want to say that Brad Pitt is great in this but his character isnt.
We are expected to believe that Edward Norton assembled a devoted cult by beating himself up, that he has knowledge of explosives despite not having any known explosives background. There is a scene in the film where Edward Norton walks past Brad Pitt and Helena Bonham Carter having sex and since Norton and Pitt are the same person it makes no sense how he can be in two places at once.
The Third act gets better but has some problems, mainly that despite Norton now knowing that he is Tyler Durdon, he still allows himself to beat up himself. Edward Norton even survives the most unrealistic suicide attempt, although I love the very end scene with the building blowing up, mainly because of the song.Overall, this film is given too much credit and acclaim for something that isn't worth it. David Fincher has proven he can do better with his film Se7en, this was more alike to Alien3.",Fight Club
863,leviot,Dark and delirious yet thoughtful and enlightening,9,23 May 2006,"'Fight Club' is a movie of a rare caliber, one that makes its points unrestrainedly, its characters dominate the screen with vivacious personalities. It has a dream-like quality to it, but it is excruciatingly real. A reality that gets uglier and more twisted until its stunning ending. Love it or hate it, it's a movie you will not soon forget.Edward Norton's character, who narrates throughout the film, is a depressed fellow with a dead-beat job, an insomniac who finds his only pleasures in attending support groups for the terminally ill. His life takes an unexpected turn when he meets Marla, a woman who finds herself in similar straits.Enter Tyler Durden (Brad Pitt): A young, clever and energetic guy, an activist who rants against the evils of our consumer-driven society. Their obvious differences notwithstanding, our narrator and Tyler strike up a strange friendship.Things remain on the relatively down-low, until out of the clear blue, Tyler tells his pal 'hit me!'. After they begin brawling randomly to release their natural pent-up aggression, the idea catches on, and they formally found 'Fight Club', a club that lets men be men without the artificial influences of consumerism, or the superficial effects of conformist society.But as 'Fight Club' gains popularity and begins to spread throughout the country, problems begin creeping up, both within Fight Club and in the personal lives of our narrator and his on-and-off girlfriend Marla.I think many critics were too creeped out by the dark and violent aspects of this movie, to give it its deserved due for its thought-provoking and intelligent script. Not to mention, its phenomenal acting, which aside from the great performance we expect out of Ed Norton who seems to thrive in these kind-of 'dark' roles, Brad Pitt establishes himself as a truly good actor (not just a 'pretty boy') and is just so ideal for the character of Tyler Durden.Unless you're extremely averse to dark and violent movies, this is a must-see for its unique and uninhibited storyline and extraordinary characters. It has an ending that matches those of The Sixth Sense and The Usual Suspects. Its thought-provoking ideas and concepts will be further enlightened after multiple viewings. Not to be missed.",Fight Club

In fact I enjoyed it tremendously.  Edward Norton has always been a superb actor who is insufficiently well-known or respected.  In choosing his films Brad Pitt tries very hard to make himself ugly, but he just can't succeed. But in this film he finally shows what I have long suspected - he is a terrific actor.  Meatloaf is also a revelation - I did not recognize him, and he can act too. Tip when you are watching the film - keep an eye on the backgrounds as things are sometimes happening which it would be a pity to miss.  On one occasion they pass a cinema showing ""Seven Years in Tibet"", one of Brad's turkeys, but the letters are falling off the sign.  Who says Americans take themselves too seriously?",Fight Club

It advances certain ideas (that we are all slaves to ""consumerism"" and have no choice but to buy products advertised to us, which we must revolt against by beating people up and exploding buildings), and argues them with images rather then words.

870,karhukissa,Another Columbus,6,4 December 2006,"Oh yes, this film discovered America - or the ""America"" of consumerism which makes the soul and people's dreams die. Real nice. Except it was not the first movie to do so. It sure became more popular than the rest, perhaps because of the spectacular fighting scenes. I agree with others that here fighting is not per se; however, we see way much more of it than needed to bring the message home. No, let's face it: all the fighting scenes (and the half-naked shots of Brad Pitt) were included to sell the movie.There are certainly good things about it - my six stars mainly go to the acting, both Edward Norton and Brad Pitt, but also my rarely-seen favorite Meat Loaf. His character, and in fact the whole beginning of the film is really creative. The problem is, towards the end it gets too creative - the twist of the story is downright stupid, and not exactly credible looking back. To me it feels like they had to find a solution and couldn't think of a better one. It was not even a new idea - Oscar Wilde used it, to mention just one.As for the message of the film: what disturbed me most was its stereotypical, traditional masculinity. The idea that there is some innate violence in men (not women - they are hardly present, except for sex objects or dying cancer patients), and this is supposedly a good thing, a way to escape being controlled by the System. Also, the popular (but false) belief that you can get rid of your tension/aggression by expressing it in, for example, fighting sports (whereas research shows that violence raises adrenalin levels and leads to more aggressivity). It (re?-)creates a myth of masculinity, where ""real"" men are fighters who torture themselves and each other; men who have emotions and even express them are so feminine they even have breasts. I see some danger in this movie becoming a cult film.What I did learn from this film: I think it gives some insight into how people can be recruited to support an oppressive, destructive system, such as in Nazi Germany. The way the terrorist brigade evolving from the Fight Club functions is a pretty credible image of this process. I just dare to hope Fight Club-fans find this, though enlightening, just as scary as I did.",Fight Club

The book by Chuck Palahniuk was perfect for a movie: vivid, powerful, challenging, original, unpredictable. Considering how perfectly formed the book already was, the screenplay would have been a doddle.Some very interesting themes are explored - consumerism, class warfare, multiple-personality disorder, male bonding, terrorism and anarchy - without being judgemental.Direction is spot-on. Perfect cinematography, pacing and editing. The twists and nuances of the book are captured perfectly.Edward Norton and Brad Pitt are perfectly cast as the two lead characters, and deliver in spades. Helena Bonham Carter is a strange selection to take on the role of Marla, as she tends to act in Shakespearean dramas and other period pieces.

Although funded by Hollywood, its one of those films that feel really anti-Hollywood and stick a middle finger up to the people behind it and to other powerful companies of the world. As much as it's about fighting, its about the way we live our daily lives. It's quite philosophical in a way. It discusses consumerism, capitalism, crisis in masculinity and all other themes. It's not just about the fighting but even when it is, it's fairly brutal and excuse the phrase 'kick ass'. But its true. The acting is great, the story is great, and who saw that ending coming? I haven't seen a film give me the same buzz as this. I don't mean a buzz to go out fighting or whatever, but a buzz just sitting and watching the story unfold. It really is a masterpiece and I'm not sure how it could be improved, but hey there are going to be people hating on this film and calling it 'controversial' or in bad taste because of some of the things included in the film but lets just stick a finger up at them!

There is no doubt that the film speaks more than what is presented in its general form. It is a matter of life.
The violence is the inherently rebellious part of the systems of reality, which men aspires to emerge from the patterns of consumption and routine in life. It is an attempt to break time, ideas and habituation. It's a discussion of all the important issues ""consumer life critique, waste of capacity, request for assistance, What does life mean to you?, Do you really live your own life?, defending manhood in a consumer system, defending your beliefs by altering logic .. etc""
David Fincher with Brad Pitt and Edward Norton created an intellectual and revolutionary masterpiece in a time when human became meaningless.

881,finding-something,A High Schooler's Dream,10,13 April 2006,"I saw this movie late one night on HBO my junior year in high school. I bought it the next day and probably saw it 25 times that week. This was the first movie I ever saw that gave me reason to believe movies could be more than entertaining or heart warming. Movies could say something intelligent. Of course, the fact that this is one of the most entertaining movie's EVER only makes the watcher want to listen to what it says all that much more. And despite it's presentation and even content, it does say good things.I won't talk, at least that much, about how amazing Pitt, Norton, and Carter are. I won't focus on the twist that no one ever sees coming and yet makes so much sense. Even without the twist, the movie would have become a classic. I won't talk about the interesting homoerotic themes, and I won't go on about how this is the modern western. Let's talk about the book instead.I'll say it. The movie is better. While the book obviously made the movie possible, the movie is an improvement, a realization. Even Palahniuk says so concerning the end. A difficult story to put on film, but the effort was not in vain. Just as harsh, just as (and I hate this word) unflinching, the book may actually be a bit clumsy, things about beaches and Marla's mother really aren't necessary or even interesting. The grittiness of the movie is superior to anything I could have imagined, and I have an okay imagination.I mean it, that this is a high schooler's dream. Having never even imagined things like Nihilism or self sustained living or even the virtue of pain, this film was eye opening. This movie hits like a brick, and you want it to keep hitting. Oh, and it's super quotable.It's embarrassing to say, but this movie shaped me to some extent.

Edward Norton has proved himself to be one of the best actors ever after making Fight Club and American History X, his acting in Fight Club was just amazing.  Bradd Pitt also proved that he is more than just a body for women to stare at, he can act too.

883,636,Schizophrenia rules.,7,22 October 1999,"This is a comedy. Although the audience did not share my sense of humor, I laughed throughout the movie. The opening visuals set the stage for a surrealistic journey. If you were not a schizophrenic when the movie began then you should be a bit schizophrenic when the movie ends. Do the terms withdrawal, hallucinations, delusions of persecution and omnipotence ring a bell? Brad Pitt gives an amazing performance. I particularly like when his face is covered in a cold sweat and he gives the speech ""You should not be judged...."" with steely conviction. Edward Norton is superb as the main character. He is so convincing that you find the ending mind blowing. In a lot of movies the hero and heroine walk into the sunset. I really liked the ending of this movie because they simply held hands and looked out the window of an office tower. It was one of the most romantic moments in the movies for an anarchist.

884,Lestyr,What's up with this movie?,2,6 August 2001,"I agree completely with the negative critics statements on the inside of the DVD.  This movie's defenders have tried to pass it off as ""cerebral"" and ""psychological"" on this very page, and as a ""profound portrait of how corporations ruin our lives.""  It is none of these.  First of all, what makes people think it's cerebral?  The endless whining?  The laughable ""we're all the middle children of history"" attempts at philosophizing?  The hardly novel idea that men need to have an outlet for their pent-up aggression?  And the leftist idea (which has been out there since at least the time of Marx) that corporations have been destroying our lives and screwing us over?  Praise the movie as cerebral, and you'd better be cerebral yourself to recognize it.  Get yourself a book of Dostoyevsky or Kant and see how you handle real deep thought.  Second off, that it's psychological.  Simple because the main character has a certain mental disorder (I won't be so bad to reveal what it is), is it psychological?  After we see the character's illness in the movie, it seemed to me Norton fighting Pitt was like a bad Candid Camera joke.  I was half-expecting the director to come on after the scene and say, ""You took that scene seriously?  Sucker!""  It's amazing what this movie expects you to believe, particularly after the plot twist which, like the Usual Suspects (to which it has been often compared) is just too clever by a half, and voids entire sections of the movie.  I'm a fan of Ed Norton because I like his work.  I also liked Seven quite a bit, so I can hardly be dismissed as a Fincher-hater.  And I still agree that men in our society are fundamentally demasculinized in a way previous generations never had to deal with.

His truly revolutionary and super-imaginative film techniques make this film memorable. Yet the plot (or lack thereof) couldn't have won over audiences had it not been for how the film looked. Those who take the film as an endorsement for anarchy are missing the point. ""Fight Club"" is almost straightforward comedy- period. The fighting scenes are decent, but certain scenes/special f.x. will blow the viewer away, including a stunning opening credit sequence and a thrilling climax overlooking a city's skyscrapers. I won't say much more than that, because this film is unique in almost every aspect possible.

It is a surprising critique on modern society and a different approach to the alienation between son and father.  It is exceptionally well done and that is part of its uncomfortable nature.

As well as being well acted, with a great script and storyline, it's got a good sense of humour and doesn't take itself too seriously. Perhaps because of this, the serious bits really have a lot of impact. It's a film that men and women will probably enjoy equally, which is too rare in my opinion. Brad Pitt proves again that he's not just a pretty face, and Edward Norton's performance is great. I even managed to get over my usual hatred of Helena Bonham Carter!

I spent the evening I came out from the cinema phoning everyone I knew cheering  that it was an excellent and truly enthralling movie - but then what?  Well, they all wanted to know what it was about; and of course I could say absolutely nothing because the more I thought about how to describe it and the plotline the less sense I could make of it and the more clearly its twists and turns became integral to any description.For anyone out there who has not yet succumbed to the delights of this movie, I'd hate to spoil their fun.

It currently ranks at #33 on the IMDb top 250, so you can understand why my mind was blown when an IMDb user actually called this movie ""underappreciated"".  The truth is that it's OVERappreciated.  ""Fight Club"" is not the groundbreaking, sensational work of genius many fans call it.  There aren't any stagerringly original ideas, apart from Fight Club itself.  The film is pointlessly overlong, with a ridiculous ending that was not at all needed.  So I see no reason why anyone would ever think that this movie was underappreciated.

This film should have been noticed; but once again many critics slept through this one; were too stupid to understand it, or are part of the 'Oh! another chance to hammer Brad Pitt club. I have respect for the critics who saw the same film I saw. It was very bloody. It was very dark and complex. The actors faced real challenges here, and I think they were magnificent. The performances as a whole, were understated, and believable. Sure Jack Nicholson and Anthony Hopkins are powerful performers; but the quality of a film need not rest on some over the top and frequently 'hammy' performance. If this films had been a foreign export, and Brad Pitt had been an unknown; then perhaps many critics would have been more objective. To movie lovers everywhere, there are still great films being made; don't depend on a film critic to lead you to them.Many film critics have forgotten what movies are all about. Too bad for Hollywood and movie lovers, all over the world. The most famous critics, reach their esteemed heights, for their scathing, ego driven reviews. They seem to single out certain performers to ruin. The most attractive performers have to fight an uphill battle to win a decent review. Critics should be reviewed by their employers, on a regular basis.

David Fincher has a unique style that just fits with kind of a movie.In the most basic sence , this movie is a fight against a cruise control life . It mocks the life most of us live , it mocks the society will live in and it is scary just how relatable this movie still is and will be for years to come.However , this movie is still not a 10/10 for me and here is why.This movie succeeds most of the time to deliver the message and make you think about a deeper meaning but sometimes it gets overcomplicated with delivering those magic words. It feels too much like a book and that creates a slow pace with too many words. The movie has some parts that could easily be erased but the twist at the end makes it seem worth it but ...
by the end it gets a little too detached from the basic message and what it is actually trying to say that you quickly lose focus.I think the movie is and wil always be a cult classic masterpiece but the premise of the movie could have been better done like Parasite. It has a deeper meaning and important message like this movie but the delivery is just better made in my opinion.In my opinion Seven is a better Fincher movie.8/10

I understand the message, we live in a consumer driven society and Jack and Tyler set up the ""Fight Club"" in rejection to it. Interesting, but the film's execution is messy and in the end I was less enthralled but more glad that it was over.The film uses excessive violence because it can. It adds little meaning to what's being presented here....and I'm still unsure of what Fincher is trying to present in the first place. In any case the violence does not progress the story, it is unbearable as it is presented as almost having healing qualities.I was indifferent to the character of Jack, as he has no appealing qualities. I was unsure of whether to find the idea of his refuge in cancer and tuberculosis groups interesting or sickening. The audience are expected to accept this, along with the other strange actions of Jack and Tyler. To be fair, they were good performances, though I have severe gripes with the characters.It is safe to say I did not 'get' Fight Club. I do not 'get' how one would consider this a masterpiece of modern cinema. I admit that my enjoyment did suffer to the fact that the twist was ruined for me before I saw it. Still considering this I was underwhelmed. I can't really say skip it as it has a huge fan base and I wonder whether I do not know what I am talking about. You may enjoy it. I did not.",Fight Club

907,elgronko,Missed opportunity,6,21 July 2010,"I've been reading the reviews on this film with interest during a lazy working afternoon, and feel compelled to add the conclusion I have drawn from them. Like many others I loved this movie when I first saw it (at the age of 21) but nine years down the line have grown tired of it, especially its philosophising which skim-reading just a handful of books reveals to be crass and unoriginal. I have been especially irritated and even worried by the people on here who hold this film up as some sort of manifesto for living; some even purport that the violence is realistic, a statement which anyone who has been in a real fight will find laughable.""Fight Club"" is certainly a very entertaining film, and I admire its controversial standpoint; however the thing that dooms it to being the province of immature young men is its ending. Now I've no grumble with the plot holes because after all it is a work of fiction, and its incoherence is part of its appeal. The problem lies in the fact that Tyler Durden is never really defeated. Sure, the Narrator ""kills"" Tyler by shooting himself, but he never repudiates him; even at the end he is this tongue-tied intellectual weakling. He could have destroyed Tyler's very ideology in a few well-chosen sentences about how his ""space monkeys"" have swapped one kind of mindless conformism for another, infinitely more dangerous one - and thus given both mature audiences and frustrated teenage boys a much more even-handed and intelligent discourse on the limits of freedom.Unfortunately this doesn't happen, and all we are left with is a well-acted, beautifully-shot movie that says absolutely nothing meaningful precisely because it is so one-sided that it becomes a piece of propaganda, and therefore worthless. An aside: another film I loved as a teenager and saw again recently was Fincher's ""Seven"". Same problem here too: seen through more mature eyes it just comes across as an empty and vulgar piece of pseudo-intellectualism by someone who doesn't really understand the concepts he is attempting to discuss because he hasn't read enough about them. I really hope I don't come across sounding superior because I'm not that widely-read either; however I am bright enough to recognise my limitations in this regard, and to understand the value of a balanced discourse versus a simple screed.Try Dante's unreachable ""Divine Comedy"" and Isiah Berlin's excellent essay ""Two Concepts Of Liberty"". These are the kind of pieces of work that you should be inviting to shape your perceptions of life, not some self-consciously proselytising Hollywood movie.",Fight Club
908,NoFleshShallBeSpared,"For me, it was an experience!",10,27 August 2003,"Yes, when this movie was released, I remembered going to see it and afterwards leaving the theater, where a good friend and I proceeded to beat the snot out of each other. Onlookers decided that we were both crazy, and we were for the sake of having the sort of sick and twisted fun that people of our generation find too much or no meaning in. I've read into what many people have said for this film, either they didn't get it, they did get some of the many points that this film presents but doesn't necessarily address, or they loved it for it whole parts or were simply disgusted by it. Going back to what someone said about recent politics and the impact on American society that has come of it, I was too, reminded of that by this movie. We all may hate the compliant nature that has been imposed by society upon us (or those who would rather not address this conundrum), but when your numb to certain aspects of yourself or the peoples around you, basal nature starts to dictate your actions, thoughts, etc. But one point I think is sorely missed is the fact that this nature, without one's own sense of identity or critical thought, can easily persuaded and perverted. Even more so, the manipulation of this human nature (which is viewed as one part of what makes an individual unique) can bring about insecurities in the individual being manipulated. It's almost as if this movie had some intention of being an extensive character study. I can say this about this terrific movie, it has something that anyone can take from it, otherwise it's an experience of relatively engrossing subject matter.

909,Aldud7,After the book...,10,14 October 2011,"So I've read Chuck Palahniuk's ""Fight club"" and just wanna say a couple words about it first. This book is written in a very specific way, it's written almost without dialogs, yeah there is lines here and there but there no dialog it's like just a character says something then after a period of time, after some events are described, another or the same characters says something and so on and I loved this writing style. It really stands out and it shows something unique in Palahniuk, something we haven't seen before, something we see in all of his book. Also he puts a lot of great saying in the book that really lives you thinking. The book gives a couple of hints which basically, if you smart enough, unfold the ending long before it. And the last thing - the characters are really well done. So that's all about the book, know the movie. Is the movie following the book, is it as brutal and mind consuming as the book? Well actually yes, yes it is. So as for me the strongest point in the movie is the script, it sticks to the book and its few dialogs but also it brought as much as to Chuck to say that it's an improvement over the book(well actually I don't think so 'cause I prefer the original ending). I mean - how many script writers can do that? All the actors did a great job of making there characters look alive(although I still think that Norton gave his best performers in Primal Fear). Pitt and Carter is also awesome. So yeah the movie is brutal but there were some little, great things in the book that weren't in the movie which is a real bummer. From all two Fincher movies that I watched (Seven is the other) I think this is the best. Oh and yes Fincher did a great job as well. Watch the movie and if I convinced at list one person to read the book than my job is done.",Fight Club

What do you really want out of life? Recognition at the Neanderthal level, or, to be another citified anonymity? The former, of course!!

How do you persevere under such a deranged set of circumstances? Yes!! Boredom constitutes a first rate felony. Fighting to a near death represents an exuberance that has titillated Edward Norton's character to a personal Nirvana!! Dangerously convoluted logic is the ultimate spirituality.

913,eliaaminii,Twist Time,10,30 November 2020,"We are not talking politics here, but Consumerism. On surface, this masterpiece might be recognized as one of the late-90s actions but NO WAY!
Central to the plot is story of a man who is struggling with insomnia and consequently, he joins some clubs in order to get rid of his pent-up feelings. We all know he was just faking all those tears and sympathies and when a woman comes to the clubs and does the same, things go mad.
Having watched it once, you might not completely understand what is going on and to my mind, that's the genius of the plot as it makes us all think about the story and of course, its meaning.
Deep inside the concept of Fight Club, we are dealing with consumerism. This issue has been referred to during the movie directly several times. Like the bar scene when Tylor says ""we are consumers"".
Speaking of the cast, no one would play the roles better than Edward Norton and Brad Pitt. Their spectacular performances is one of the reasons that today's generation enjoys it as same as the others. Actually, that's one of the points that has made this movie a true masterpiece that the movie doesn't really belong to 1999. We can even see the sells have increased gradually after its release. These are proofs to confirm the fact that the movie was ahead of his time.
I really adore Fincher's taste and choices in music. He is a mega mind when it comes to sound and effects. No matter how low-budget the movie is, the outcome would always standout.

I've seen ""fight club"" when it was released in 1999; stunned by that movie i read the novel by Chuck Palahniuk, and i've discovered an incredible writer too. It's too complicated to describe a movie like this. It's a crude, realistic, nihilistic vision of our lives, our crisis, our world filled with clichés, with media that tell you how you must be, how you must act, how you must live. It's not only a fighting movie at all. It's about deconstructions, about pain, about the use of a struggle to feel human again. The acting from Edward Norton and Brad Pitt are great here. Both seems to dive like a fish in their roles, and the character of Tyler Durden (Brad Pitt) is simply flawless. From beginning to the end the movie caught you in an alienated, but incredibly real web of a twisted mind, struggling for freedom, raging against everything. I can't tell anything more 'cause i'll ruin the atmosphere of the flick... The novel it's great too (like all others works by Chuck). The movie is almost identical to the book, apart for the end. In conclusion i consider ""Fight Club"" one of the deepest, darkest and twisting movie of the decade. It's a masterpiece and you must see it at least once, and if you think i must have my head examined, well, you've totally missed the point!!!

Starting from the dramatic opening, followed closely by some excellent dry humour (Ikeaworld), the film follows the disintegration of the finely-wrought defenses of a man whose illusions and reality are untenably in conflict.Edward Norton is brilliant as the narrator.  Picking up from his fine performance in ""American History X"", he is better still in this role, with the gradual deconstruction of a highly-strung mind expressed with glimpses, gestures, hesitations, mutterings and unpredictable outbursts.  Very convincing, very sympathetic and also very scary.Brad Pitt, who I like to discount as an actor (for good reason, generally) was a great and pleasant surprise in the role of alter ego.  Given the chance to play, he shows a lot in this role and earns respect as an actor, not a pretty face.The dark humour leavens the subject matter sufficiently to make it hard for me to understand how critics such as in Entertainment Weakly (sic) rail at the film for being in favour of violence and mayhem.  For goodness sake -- it's a portrayal of characters, not propaganda.  This film is no more a proposal for violence than ""Silence of the Lambs"" promotes cannibalism.I saw this film on consecutive nights and was just as satisfied with its editing, script, cinematography, direction and acting on the second night as on the first.  Rates a 9 out of 10 from me.So far this is turning out to be a fine year for American cinema.  ""Eyes Wide Shut"" (a satire that most people mistook for a story about orgies), ""American Beauty"", ""Bringing Out the Dead"" and ""The Fight Club"", plus the non-American film ""Besieged"" all are worthy of Oscar nominations for Best Film and for Best Director, plus some acting nominations for each.",Fight Club

It's not just about fighting and violence, it's about what we are as humans. It's about materialism and power. It's about insanity and misery. It's just wicked, it's un-believable. SEE IT, you will never see things the same way again.",Fight Club
922,HomieG,Amazingly original film...,9,6 August 2001,"When first released, Fight Club was panned by most critics probably just because it was the safe thing to do.  Fight Club brings up many dangerous thoughts that might actually be true.  The film Fight Club is not only about the title club, it's also about a man's (Edward Norton) plunge into near insanity due to insomnia and can't seem to find a solution.  This was until he met the rebellious Tyler Durden.  Tyler Durden (Brad Pitt) is a man who is against everything that's materialistic and artificial.  This includes big business and models among other things.  Both men decide to come up with a club all men can work out their aggressions bearing the name Fight Club. Director David Fincher paints a dark and gritty film depicting a man's life spiraling out of control and the man who brings his life back into perspective (or so it seems).  The ending cannot be matched in sheer surprise.  Even ""The Sixth Sense"" cannot compare.  This movie requires repeat viewings and IMO is second to only ""The Matrix"" for the year 1999 . 9/10",Fight Club
923,Joe S.,"Relentless, dark, unflinching.... I LOVE IT!!",10,29 November 1999,"Easily the best film of 1999, director David Fincher takes a powerful tour-de-force through society as it stands today.  Almost every line drips with social satire, Norton makes one of the most convincing performances of the decade as a data analyst plunged into a dark underworld by Tyler Durden (Brad Pitt), who opens him up to a new world where there is more than print, colate, and fax.  It's thought-provoking, hilarious, and heart-breaking all at once.  A modern masterpiece by all means.",Fight Club

He has a weasel of a boss and is a chronic insomnic (he never sleeps). He joins discussions of people who are dying or were. At a Testicular Cancer survivors place he meets Bob (Meatloaf, a perfect performance) who due to hormone therapy after having his testicles, has developed b**** tits.On a plane flight back from looking at another car wreck, he meets tyler durden (Pitt). On returning home Norton finds his place in ruins after an explosion (director fincher's realistic show of how this happened is fantastic), so he crashes with durden. after a drink at a bar they are beating each other to a pulp in the parking lot, and create ""fight club"".before long they have many more members including bob. both norton and pitt share a relationship between marla (bonham-carter), in different ways, pitt has a very sexual one, where norton cant stand her, but she seems to like him.only when pitt decides to make ""Project Mahem"" and split on norton, to fend for himself does the film actually make you think...

The ending was the best ending I have experienced in years. Fantastic plot development. Totally enthralling. Most women would probably find the whole plot concept totally sickening but then I'm more than likely wrong here. A lady said to me, ""That men wouldn't like 'Thelma and Louise'"", a movie with a similar statement for women as the 'Fight club' is for men, however I rated it one of my best movies ever- like the 'Fight Club', as the human issues delt with, go far deeper than what is presented on the surface.

I my own personal opinion ""fight club"" is the second best movie of 1999 (right after ""the matrix""), and it even has a very important message that only a few could understand.This movie shows people what they should do in situations like the ones a month ago (the WTC)... ""everything is going to be fine"" that's what Edward Norton's character says when he watches the U.S. economy going down, and I think that's what we should think.Another lesson that I learned with this film, was that we are searching for our enemy in a far place, when maybe, just maybe it's right behind us, maybe is the guy next door (like Tyler). Everyone can be a psycho, that's what I learned.So if you want to take a few life lessons I highly recommend this movie",Fight Club

935,mppullar,"Stunning, faultless cinema",10,28 May 2002,"It is rare that a film so brilliant in every possible aspect comes your way, and even rarer that such a film will receive all the recognition it deserves. Some of the most brilliant pieces of cinema ever made (eg. Mulholland Drive, eXistenZ, Exotica) will be critically acclaimed, but largely ignored, while other films will be hyped to a ludicrous extent, but pale in comparison to some less widely-seen films. There are, however, exceptions. ""Fight Club"" is one such exception.Impossible to fault, David Fincher's apocalyptic satire and social dissection is a masterwork that proved, much to my surprise, to be every bit as brilliant as critics and viewers alike claimed it to be. Edward Norton's acting performance is one feature well and truly worthy of a mention, with his stunning job of the nameless narrator being everything that earlier performances such as ""Primal Fear"" promised. Yet it would be wrong to single Norton out without recognising the sheer brilliance of the entire supporting cast - Brad Pitt proves the immense extent to which he is wasted in most films, Helena Bonham-Carter is faultless, Meat Loaf Aday astonishes, as does Jared Leto. So many mindblowing performances are almost never seen together in the one film - Fincher could not have done a better job of bringing out the acting potential in each and every member of his cast.A fertile and brutally perceptive script goes perfectly alongside Fincher's stunning cinematography, present yet wasted in the apparently disappointing ""Panic Room"" (I have not yet seen it myself). Even the grotesque violence can be forgiven in such a film as this, when acting, direction and scripting are all perfect. I doubt that Hollywood will so brilliantly hit the spot again in the near future - ""Fight Club"" was a work of rare genius and will, I believe, remain extremely high on my list of films for some time yet. 10/10",Fight Club
936,batman6388,This is my favorite movie of all time...,10,30 March 2003,"Fight Club truly was one of my favorite films of the 90's and maybe my favorite film ever.  It's just one of those movies you have to see twice to get it.  This is a perfect example of movie with meaning.  And Pitt was freakin awesome as Tyler Durden(my role model) and Edward Norton was awesome too.  The script was great and Fincher is just one of my favorites with films such as Seven(awesome), The Game(awesome), & Panic Room(Awesome). Fight Club is about an office slave insomniac who is living in a world of IKEA furniture catalogs and Starbucks.  And the only way, he found out, to relieve his insomnia is to go to retreat groups for patients of terminal diseases such as Testicular Cancer, Tuberculosis, Parasites, and more. That's where he meets Marla Singer who is a chain smoking woman who like Norton is faking his diseases to go to groups.  He is then interupted and cannot go to sleep.  He then meets another person, Tyler Durden which h meets on an airplane.  I'm not telling you the rest.  Count on me, this is a great film.  This is also an example of a College Poster Movie(a movie's poster is on a college frat, dorm, etc.)  It's really bad a**.9/10",Fight Club
937,redrum911,"Brilliant, except for the end",8,10 February 2006,"Fight Club is an angry, hilarious, sadistic, satirical, mean spirited and extremely ambitious film. In a sentence or 2, Norton's character struggles with self-worth, meaning and general self-loathing in a culture that has castrated what it is to be a ""man"". That is, until a chance meeting with Pitt's character changes his life, signaling the creation of the violent, male ""becoming"" exercise of Fight Club (a brutal, secret, hand-to-hand combat ritual). This leads to a larger movement of cultural anarchy and revolution. Its a wonder the film got made because it is dark, misogynist, violent and left-leaning (all good in my book). FC is one of those films that can be life changing and get under your skin (particularly for men), with its messages of male self-awareness and identity, rage at the state of the world and vitriolic bashing of the consumerism, materialism, conformity and vanity that some of us see and detest. It is also one of those movies that is ripe for misunderstanding, as some people do not ""get it"" (the fighting, for example, is more a metaphoric exercise, not a call for frat guys to go punch each other silly). Pitt is a revelation, Norton is just as magnetic, and Helena Bonham Carter steals several scenes playing against type. I think the first 3/4 of the movie is brilliant. It falls apart at the end for me on one thing (spoiler warning) - Pitt HAS TO BE A REAL PERSON, not a figment of Norton's imagination - even though they are clearly alter-egos in the metaphoric sense. Though the struggle is clearly Norton's own internal one, it has to be externalized, which it was for the 1st 3/4 (this has been handled much better in much lesser movies- ""Bad Influence"" with James Spader comes to mind). When I learned the Pitt character is ""not real"", it ruined it for me. Kind of like the ""it was all a dream"" ending you see in really bad movies. The attempt to go back at the end & stick Norton in all the scenes that Pitt was in is clunky & doesn't work. Just an opinion - still a fantastic film and an icon-making performance by Pitt.",Fight Club

939,CharlottaG,Screw rule no. 1...,8,16 February 2016,"... this needs to be talked about. I was way too young to enjoy this when it first came out but it has been on my watchlist (both the literal one here on IMDb but also before that on the more abstract one in my head) for a lot of years now since it's such a classic. But it has sadly also been one of those movies you don't think you're ready for yet, like you're saving them for that one perfect day, and so I never went on to actually watching it. Until yesterday.I really enjoyed the whole film and the thing contributing to that matter the most is probably the plot. It's all very intriguing and original from start to finish with lots of twists and turns and interesting character development. I also really like the special effects where the camera kind of zooms in, or goes through things, to a microscopical level, looks really cool. Although it kind of felt like they gave that whole thing up a while into the movie, and I sadly feel like that took some of the built up mystery and feel away. But it's all okay in the end since this masterpiece of a movie came to inspire the makers of many of my other favourite movies and TV-series. It's just worth the watch, you know?",Fight Club

What do u call a movie which has got the perfect acting,perfect plot & perfect direction?I call it Fight Club.Brad Pitt & Norton made every minute count. David Fincher has once again proved himself to be one of the most talented directors of his era,he put up the much needed quality direction making every moment unpredictable and leaving viewers confused. This movie has undoubtedly got one of the most valuable plots important for every man.What made me wonder is the wide range through which the story oscillated throughout the duration!Was that a smart way of dealing with depression or knowing your other side U were never aware of?Or about letting it go?Or about fighting your depression off with your unknown self?Fight Club is something even much more.What I just saw was a rare visual marvel that made me continue to loose track of the reality even minutes later the movie ended.So what are u waiting for?Its not about the fight you know but about something more u don't know.If u haven't seen it yet go for it & get ready to get lost.",Fight Club

A Project Mayhelm is on the run but the protagonist has no idea about it.One of the member working in that project gets shot in head and thats the moment when story takes its turn.

Not because of the violence, but because of how absolutely STUPID it is. I caught on to what little philosophy and plot it had, and I found nothing of interest.They are trying to change society by making the people understand what their idea of society is, but what they (Pitt and Norton) dont realize is that maybe some people dont want to be changed, maybe the people actually like their life, even though their little Fight Club doesnt like it.Why must people always try to change others. People live their life the want to, maybe their not movie stars, but who really wants to be a movie star, it doesnt sound like fun to be on magazines and people taking pictures of you in your own private household. I think Fight Club missed this. It missed that not everyones the same, people are different. This is what keeps society going.This film is so full of ego's that its just sickening. As if anyone really wants to watch two men beat each other to death. This is not fun to watch. Violence can be handled in the right way in such films as Taxi Driver, A Clockwork Orange, or Schindlers List. But Fight Club as none of the qualities of these masterpieces.

People fighting people in their own little ""Fight Club."" So much of the movie is nothing but that (hence the title, I suppose). But it has a deeper meaning, some would say. It fights crass commercialism (while being a film FILLED with that very commercialism). It shows how life is meaningless unless you do something different. WOW! Didn't know that one! Thanks, Fight Club!The movie is a jumbled mess, and the writers and producers are just lucky that people will pay to see practically anything with star power. They're also fortunate that so many people apparently had no idea of the fundamental things the movie so haphazardly tries to demonstrate. Of course, the actual INTENT of the film is kind of debatable. Seeing it without knowing what the writers had in mind, one could come to any number of conclusions, and I'd guess that there could be any number of interpretations. That's the only point of interest of this film. Of course, since that's true of any film, no matter how bad, it's not really a largely redeeming quality.

In ""Crash"", it is absurd to think there are really people who are sexually turned-on by bad car crashes; in ""Fight Club"", it is ridiculous to believe that there are people who enjoy getting pumelled.

But, fight club is another awesome movie. some critics say it promotes violence. yawn. the directing was amazing. i loved those shots. brad pitt, who usually doesn't impress me, is great. edward norton: man o man this guy is going to be one of the best actors ever. he's already on his way with great performances in this and american history x and primal fear. the writing was witty and intellectual and cool. i actually didn't think though that this was a statement about society or middle class America or what have you. i think most people who work in cubicles and pump gas don't hate their lives and their place in society and don't want to go and kick butt to release repressed aggression. in fact it's kind of elitist to assume that these people feel their lives are wasted. anyways though, i don't think that's the point of the film. i think it's really about one man (the narrator) and his dementia and angst. it's a depiction of the demagogue archetype, someone who has anti-social demented thoughts, erroneously assumes others have the same, and yet has the charisma and leadership skills to convince them that they actually do. one problem i have with the movie, and the reason i gave it a 9 instead of a 10 (SPOILER): i actually thought it was a greater movie before the twist where edward norton is tyler durden. for some reason in the last year or two twist endings are in, and even though i still loved the movie i thought it was unnecessary. plus a psychiatrist i know told me the portrayal of the multiple personality disorder is totally unrealistic. in fact experts today still squabble over whether such a disorder really exists.",Fight Club

I strongly recommend it. I really would have liked to give a higher rating but I think that interaction between characters is not right although it is visually very appealing. I prefer not giving details about this to avoid spoilers.,Fight Club
961,banana-83,Find me a better film in it's genre. . .you can't!,9,11 February 2007,"""Azygophrenia"" is a mental condition stemming from living a lonely, single life. It may manifest in different ways. The Fight Club grows from the twisted loneliness of Ed Norton's character. it grows huge, then starts to get out of control. It's a complex, awesome movie showing the explosion than can happen when conformity leads to extreme internalized anger. Hint: Humans are not meant to live in tiny boxes. They do not find fulfillment in furnishing their entire lives with other peoples stuff or living according to a pre-written script.This is a male movie, as far from a chick flick as you can get. Women could benefit from it if they want to understand the kind of frustrations guys feel regarding their egos and finding meaning and excitement in life.",Fight Club
962,FoxGarrison,You are not to talk about Fight Club.,10,18 February 2003,"Imagine a year when the Sopranos were born, when a man goes through a rebirth in American Beauty, when Magnolia is more than just a flower-1999-the year Fight Club was started.I am driven to believe 1999 was a hallmark year for movies and Fight Club was no exception.  Edward Norton and Brad Pitt star in a movie about a bunch of guys living the vida loca in underground street fighting.  At first glance the movie could be passed off as mere tripe hadn't you looked closer.It's taken me a long time to figure out what to write for Fight Club.  I mean it isn't everyday a movie comes out and changes who you are and makes you believe that there is more to life then just the breath away from death that we are.  Indeed, I don't know how to explain it better than to say Fight Club makes you think about who you are and what your purpose in the world is irrespective of the fact that others around you are doing the same thing.  In other words, it brings a sense of awe to life that it reduces you to the common gene pool we all came from at one point in history.  Anyway, that is what I got out of it.The film was shot with a gritty, green filter that renders everything aesthetically street-real.  I can liken the filtering system to that of Hart's War.  If you had seen Hart's War then you would know that it had a blue tinge that gave it a cold dark feel.  In Fight Club the mood is more industrial and grimy, hence the filter.  The film also features classic rebel costumes that are subdued by way of lighting.  In fact much of the clothes are not out on display much like other movies since the clothes either have an unkempt look or are not being worn at all.  This movie's costumes are definitely not the Grease type of clothing.The sound is incredible, from sounds of fists hitting raw meat to blood splattering on the floor.  This movie is not for the faint of heart.  The sounds only enhance the realism of the fights in that if the fights aren't watched they can still be heard adequately to surmise the outcome.The story is what makes this movie special.  As I had mentioned, this movie came out in 1999, a time when the end of the world was at hand.  I'd like to think though that 1999 was a time when movies really had something to say about the society we built for ourselves.  The Sopranos did this by showing the world really was dependent on a sub-culture of humanity that tailored its businesses to human vices.  American Beauty showed that our lives are a pink slip away from true living, true being.  Magnolia's assault on society's morals are shattered by the film's often times relapse to parental affection.  And what of Fight Club?  A film that embraces the idea that there is a life if we lose all that we have to gain all that we can.  Fight Club goes beyond simple movie making by showing us what we can achieve if we step out of ourselves-if we act on the thought-if we live by our dreams.",Fight Club
963,Xcstacy,From Cookie Dough into Carved out Wood,10,18 July 2009,"WOW! - An instant CLASSIC! I may as well stop here; I highly recommend going to watch this movie especially before reading any further or anything about it from anyone.This is a story about Tyler Durden, he looks like we want to look, acts like we want to act, and says what we want to say. He is sexy, smart and strong. He is what all men want to be, carefree and living in the moment without worry of what happens next and the balls to do anything he has ever wanted to do.This unique story for the movie revolves around the notion that we are living for consumer products, and those products are ending up owning us instead of the other way around. Brad Pitt and Edward Norton play incredible roles in this movie that has changed the way we view cinematic movies. This is no pretty boy Brad Pitt either; it is merely another amazing job as an actor that he has done in over a decade. David Fincher did an excellent job in directing and brings us through the lead characters highs and lows and the ability to truly feel empathy for him.After viewing this movie it quickly became in my top movies, and several years later I still enjoy it as the first day that I saw it which assures me it is 1 of my favourites in the past decade. It is smart, insightful, and not only touches on the social economics of humanities own discrepancies but shows us how psychologically tender and lost our minds can truly be.If you have a fragile cookie dough view of the world, watch this movie and you'll come out carved out of wood and see some of what is wrong with this world today.10/10 ~XTC",Fight Club
964,soporific,I nearly didn't watch the movie containing the Scene Of Our Times,9,8 April 2004,"I finally got around to seeing Fight Club last night (on 9 April 2004) - a good 5 years after it came out. You see I've been avoiding watching the film for quite a silly reason ... and now I can't believe how much my first impression of Fight Club was off the mark. You see, we only have one life and I'm certainly not going to spend it watching vehicles for profit-making passed off as art. With Hollywood still kicking around, I don't watch 99% of films made. That makes me soo happy just thinking about it. I see about a dozen movies a year and by golly I make sure all of them are worth it.So, my reason for avoiding 'Fight Club'? it was because I just couldn't think a movie with that title could be any good. That's it. Please hit me, I deserve it.Anyway, bit by bit over the years my desire to see it increased. People kept telling me what a great film it was. I would ask them to rate some other films to check out their critical analysis skills (relative to mine) and sometimes people would have exactly the same movie tastes but they would include 'Fight Club' as one of their all-time favourite movies. So I thought, one day I'm *totally* bored maybe I will ...I watched the film ... what a ride!! Totally thrilling and rich in ideas, the highest quality art in every department, and bravely executed (the last scene is definitely the Scene Of Our Times). My only criticism is from a movie-impact point of view - I don't think the film gives a helpful reflection of how humans really are. Despite the dialogue correctly identifying the source of human alienation (the capitalist system), it seems quite a few people have missed half the message. When people say they are Tyler Durden or that all humans are, and then forget to mention that this is not inevitable or a natural part of our nature but one induced by living inside the system, well this is dangerous. They look at the world going to pieces around them and say 'we're f**ked' and see humans as the source of the world's problems instead of the system. Actually the film's dialogue does repeat this over and over, I just wish more people would understand the difference, especially on this site!!Anyway, this experience has taught me a lesson - if you don't give people a go, or ideas a go, you don't learn anything and if you do, you will. If you only want to experience the good you'll miss out on a lot of it due to inbuilt prejudice. I nearly didn't watch this film - I'm shuddering just thinking about it.So, if you haven't seen Fight Club yet, do yourself a favour - forget the title and any images in conjures up in your mind - there's so much more to the film. I wished I'd seen it at the movies - I would have loved to watch other people's expressions as they came out after seeing that last scene. Again, watch this film - don't make the same mistake I nearly did !!!",Fight Club
965,rishabh-kushawah007,brilliant film that entertains as well as enlightens.,10,13 November 2013,"Tyler Durden (Brad Pitt), a charismatic soap salesman whose straightforward honesty, candor and sleazy lounge-lizard outfits are a breath of fresh air. One night, after the two men have bonded over beers, Tyler asks the narrator to hit him. At first, it seems like an absurd request but after they pound on each other for a bit, a strange feeling overcomes them. They feel a kind of release and satisfaction at inflicting pain on one another. In a world where people are desensitized to everything around them, the physical contact of fighting wakes them up and makes them feel truly alive. Others soon join in and pretty soon Fight Club becomes an underground sensation. However, it becomes readily apparent that Tyler has more elaborate plans than just organizing brawls at the local bar. David Fincher has taken the dark, pessimistic worldview of ""Seven"" and married it with the clever plot twists and turns of ""The Game"" and assembled his strongest effort to date. ""Fight Club"" is a $50+ million studio film that remains true to its anti- consumer, anti-society, anti-everything message -- right up to the last, sneaky subliminal frame. What makes ""Fight Club"" a subversive delight is not only its refreshing anti-corporate message but how it delivers said message. As Fincher has explained in interviews, you don't really watch the film but rather download it. Its structure is extremely playful as it messes around with linear time to an incredible degree. The narrative bounces back and forth all over the place like a novel, or surfing on the Internet -- even making a hilarious dead stop to draw attention to itself in a funny, interesting way that completely works. Yet Norton's deadpanned narration holds everything together and allows the viewer to get a handle on what's happening. This is the way films should be made. Why must we always have to go through the A+B+C formula?",Fight Club
966,SinaAwdijan,Critically acclaimed movie,10,9 May 2021,"In case you haven't watched Fight Club before- shame on you. :-) No, I don't judge but please go ahead and stop reading more reviews- start watching the movie!!!",Fight Club

968,pierrefonds_athlete101,So misunderstood by people around the world,10,16 February 2012,"""Fight Club"" is brutally honest and convincing about the world we live in today. Brad Pitt and Edward Norton do their best to change the world they live in by adopting a lifestyle involving non-consumerism and they do this by getting people they know who are vulnerable to their emotions. And that's what people don't understand when watching this movie for the first time.Behind the scenes there are brands and Pitt was meant to look like a model with a perfect body structure. It's all pure symbolism. Everything in each frame is there for a reason. If people thought this was a film that was just about mindless violence, think again. This film preaches how bad money is and for a movie that is out there just to make a buck, it is brilliant! Fincher has been an all around talented director. His dark use of lighting sets the tone beautifully in a world that is going to destroy itself one day because of obsession, business, modeling etc. A key phrase to remember when watching this movie: ""The things you own end up owning you"". After you watch this movie with a clear understanding, your life is going to change and you'll end up saving more money. Definitely worth the time. ""Fight Club"" definitely has a message worth listening to.",Fight Club
969,swiftyl,"Glowing review, NO SPOILERS!!!!!!!!!,",10,6 October 1999,"The Fight Club is a movie that makes you want to run out of the theatre, drink, smoke a lot, and punch your friends in the face. In a good way.  Big claps to Jim Uhlis for the script, David Fincher for the direction, and the entire cast.  For a movie to begin with extreme tension, tell a rocking good story and then peak beautifully at the end is a rare thing.  If there is a God, this should clean up at the Oscars.  Black, wicked, packed with eminently quotable lines- this is one to see AS SOON AS POSSIBLE, so you're the person who knows what The Fight Club is about, and not the person hearing endless retellings of the best bits.  One Fight Club makes up for Three Thomas Crowne affairs.",Fight Club
970,T-Boy-3,Precious and obvious,1,30 April 2000,"The first half hour or so was pretty entertaining, even if most of it consisted of Edward Norton telling us what we were seeing (you know, God forbid we should use our abilities to surmise what's going on). And since I saw it on video, I could use slo-mo to catch Brad's ""Where's Waldo"" bits. As soon as Norton met Brad, it was all downhill. Even a really fine, insightful actor would have had a hard time making those pretentious lines sound significant, but Brad Pitt's spewing of them was like a nearsighted used car dealer reading cue cards. This movie was so obvious, so pretentious, and such a total con job, right up to the absurd plot twist three-quarters of the way through that completely invalidated everything that came before it. Also, for a movie that was so preachy about consumerism (""You are not your car, your khakis,"" all that hackneyed nonsense), did anyone else notice that all the tired young execs at Fight Club proper seemed to spend alot of time at the gym? Nary a pot belly to be found, save for poor Meat Loaf, who was somehow exempt from the ""no shirt/no shoes"" rule. Large-breasted Meat Loaf fighting shirtless--now that would have been shocking.Everything this movie had to say has been said before, and better. And sometimes just as badly. (See ""Zabriskie Point"" for another example of an overblown, smug rumination on being yourself and getting back to basics vs. evil products like Wonder Bread.) ""Fight Club"" was just a cynical exercise from a self-important director seeing how much he could get away with.",Fight Club
971,Lurch-12,Watched it twice this weekend...,8,14 June 2000,"and it wasn't quite what I expected, but that was okay.  The movie knocked me out of my socks, I felt it was a well acted, well directed story that created real interest in the characters.  Actually I was disappointed when the movie ended, not because of the way it ended just that it did, I wanted it to keep going.  That said there was room for improvement.  The army that was built, and their mission seemed a bit out of place, but did match the left field approach to life that is Tyler's existence, however it didn't really fix.  At least not as the director showed us the story. 
I would recommend seeing this.  The blood and violence, you see it all in the commercials, the story is left to be discovered as you watch the movie. My vote 8/10.  ""Just because you stick feathers up your butt, doesn't mean your a chicken.""",Fight Club
972,dpenny,The defining movie of the NEXT decade,10,12 February 2000,"Fight Club was a box office disappointment perhaps because no one really knew what to make of it.  A lot of people went in to see Brad Pitt and Edward Norton pounding each other, and instead got a subversive satire of consumerism and the cult mentality.The movie may not have been appreciated in 1999, but I'll bet it will quickly become a classic.  The recent protests at the WTO meetings in Seattle showed that a backlash is brewing against rampant consumerism, and while I don't necessarily agree with what many of the anti-WTO demonstrators were saying, I get a feeling this movement is going to build up steam as this new decade proceeds.And Fight Club speaks to that mentality.  Edward Norton plays a recall investigator for a major car company (he decides whether it makes financial sense to announce a recall) who has turned to a life of conspicuous consumption to fill his spiritual void.  (In one astonishing sequence, he literally walks into an IKEA catalog.)  Then he meets Tyler Durden, who introduces him to the underground world of ""Fight Clubs"" - where men who feel emasculated gather to get back to their roots by pounding the tar out of each other.  But as Norton's character is sucked into this exciting new world, his new compatriots decide to expand into society at large - with potentially disastrous consequences.Many have called Fight Club a fascist movie (the debate was eerily similar to what surrounded ""Starship Troopers"" in 1997) and I think this is way off the mark.  Instead, the message is that if society trys to reduce a man to a simple consumer, aimlessly following trends, he will inevitably lash out. This one will be watched, studied and debated long after, say, ""The General's Daughter"" has been forgotten.",Fight Club
973,Duck_of_Death23,An instant cult classic and one of 1999's best pictures.,10,6 August 2000,"""Fight Club"" is unlike any other modern day film.  It ingeniously shows through violence that emotions are not meant to be hidden or suppressed. The film begins with a car company narrator (Edward Norton) who appears to be reluctant of sharing his name with anyone.  Insomnia effects him for several months until his doctor clues him into support meetings of testicular cancer and Tuberculosis.  The meetings allow him relief for an amount of time until another false tourist (Helena Bonham Carter)interferes. He once again becomes cursed with sleepless nights.Our narrator meets Tyler Durden (Brad Pitt) while on a business flight. This leads to a wild downward spiral for the narrator and the things in his life when this soap making sadistic mentor and he begin Fight Club for emotionally scarred and misunderstood men.  I think that this movie was very under appreciated and even revoked by others. I think that you have to understand that the film is not just about violence and senseless therapeutic fighting, it is about human nature and how that can get in the way of our impossible ideals.""Fight Club"" points out that no person is no better than another no matter how rich or famous you are or may become.  The point of the movie is to be happy with who you are and don't ever allow someone to steal your dignity, pride and self-image no matter how much pressure builds upon the idealistic preaching of a perfect world that will never be perfect.  The world will always be imperfect unless you live.I would recommend this picture to movie buffs and people who like black comedies, because it does have hilarious parts which aren't truly things you normally chuckle over, but you find yourself laughing.  The film has a lot of brutal honesty that allows this unprecedented masterpiece to be an unforgettable cinematic experience.",Fight Club
974,abrooke1,Gets better with each viewing!,10,19 February 2002,"When I first saw ""Fight Club"",  had mixed feelings about it. I thought that the ""twist"" in it was preposterous and unbelievable. But having watched the DVD several times now, including all four commentary tracks, I now feel this is one of the most brilliant films I have ever seen - indeed, many people have called this ""the first film of the 21st century"", and they are right.You really do have to see this film several times, ideally on DVD with headphones, to see and hear the many layers and hidden details throughout the film. For example, just before Jack (the Narrator) confronts Marla in a self-help group, you can clearly see a guy walking toward Marla, probably hoping to pick her up, but he turns away as Jack approaches. Another example: as the ""space monkeys"" go upstairs after being handed their homework assignments, you can see Meatloaf in the background breathing from an oxygen tank - apparently he was so hot in his body suit, he needed extra air! In another scene, after the space monkeys threaten the commissioner and are leaving the building, you can see Meatloaf pulling up his pants!The visual effects in this film are spectacular and ground-breaking, but not overdone. They add to the movie, but do not overwhelm it. Almost as amazing as the visuals is the *sound*. Again, DVD with headphones is the best way to pick up on this - the sounds are so real, I often found myself quickly jerking away my headphones thinking that the sound (such as a dog barking or glass breaking) had come from outside. It's no surprise that this film won several awards for sound.This is one of the few films I've seen that made me want to read the book - which I did in only one day. It's fascinating to see where the book and film are similar, and where they diverge. In many respects, the film is actually better than the book. Certain scenes are changed, often for the better. For example, in the car crash scene, Jack is talking with a mechanic - in the film, he talks with Tyler. In the book, it is Jack who confronts the storekeeper, Raymond Hessel - in the film, it is Tyler. The endings are also somewhat different, and I actually preferred the film's ending to the book's.This is definitely not a film for everyone - it is violent, but is about so much more than simply violence. Ultimately, Jack, by rejecting Tyler, rejects violence, and I think this what the film is about - finding that elusive middle ground between being a boring, office consumerized clone and being totally out-of-control.",Fight Club

983,milagro1975,Fascinating piece,9,12 September 2010,"It is quite rare thing that movie may be better than the book it is based on. And Fight Club actually is. I have watched it many times, the shrill still there, while the book gathers dust on a shelf. I read the book in English and in Russian (BTW the translation, at least the one I got in hand, sucks). By its sctucture it is very easy to be turned into a script exactly like it should be POV the narrator; OTOH it's not rich with descriptions, visuals are rather scanty. So I think the director and the cast did a perfect job to make movie pretty close to the book in pace, action and picture, giving the story greater power and subtlety by the means of cinematography; with one caveat - the ending. I know many people like the film ending and Palanniuk himself was quoted to prefer it. But it really doesn't make sense to me and makes the story more surreal and more shallow than one might digest.The acting is superb. Both Pitt and Norton are at their best and though I am not much into Helena Bonham Carter, she is amazing as Marla. Supporting characters are all well done, too. I also always love change of color scheme into sepia once we get into the Paper street world. Many things like that, you just must see it. It's an excellent film that will blow your mind anyway.That said, I am far from thinking this movie (and the book whatever) to be anything of a message. It is indeed thought-provoking but it actually doesn't offer a solution, nor a hint. Quite contrary it shows how much more preferrable the existing system would be comparing to the offered ways to get up at it. This rebellion without a cause, within the system, against its most obscure and superficial features is just a childish tantrum. That will pass and that is sad. BTW I would really like those many posters who state the movie changed their lives, to specify - how exactly? Oh wait I guess. They must have been purchasing Che Guevara t-shirts. Those do look nice with CK briefs.",Fight Club

I have seen his earlier flicks viz. Seven and The Game, and was awed by the gritty & surreal but yet classy direction style of Fincher. This flick too came across as a hard – hitting, in-your-face kind of movie, with an ending that will blow your mind. I especially liked the fighting scenes, accompanied by its thumping music, that immediately put you into the mood to take a blow at someone . So I guess this movie won't be the ideal one to watch (or snuggle to) with your girl friend. Rather watch it with your buddies and have a wild time.This flick is ideally suited for those who want to de-stress from their busy work lives.

985,Style_is_Substance,Misconception Analysis,9,3 June 2016,"While universally praised by all types of people, teenage and young adult audience members in specific tend to gravitate towards Fight Club, hailing it as one of the greatest films of all time and currently placing it at #10. on IMDb's Top 250 films. However, there are plenty of people that deem this film overrated, and while I can't quite agree with that, I would say, much like Pulp Fiction, people tend to consciously praise this film for the wrong reasons and through superficial means. For the fairly shallow reasons people claim to like this film, I would say in that sense, it is overrated. I would argue that this film is quite misinterpreted by common audience members and even by well-known film critics. Edward Norton's narrator character is not named, to serve as a vehicle for the audience to adopt themselves upon. He is a regular American white collar Caucasian male in his thirties. He is a regular person. He is a loser to many as his life is empty. In essence, he is the audience. Tyler Durden represents the other extreme, while being a different side of the same coin. Audiences generally love Tyler Durden, and it makes sense that they do in a way, as he embodies everything they wish to be or wish to have. Tyler Durden is the ideal masculine role, but the Narrator is given the task to redefine that role. Tyler Durden influences the Narrator to give up his dependent and materialistic lifestyle and embrace life for what it is; in essence all that matters is up to the individual. I think the film is also about finding a balance and not going too far in a way. The film is about how people should strive to improve, accept their worth, or lack of, but not give in so far that they lose sense of their individuality.There's an over growing sense that one should not give in too much. The fight clubs and Project Mayhem begin to form a cult with set rules and priorities, embracing a mindless sheep like organized role, which is what they are set out to go against. They ultimately and ironically are fighting against what they are, which gives more insight and meaning to the film's twist. The twist is what audiences tend to focus on, while thinking the film is actually endorsing what the fight clubs and Project Mayhem stand for. The answer is neither 'no' nor 'yes' but rather 'sort of'. As mentioned before, the film argues for balance. The narrator, while ultimately agreeing with Tyler in some ways, feels things are getting out of hand, especially after a man is killed. Once he kills off Tyler, he is then ridding himself of the extremist side of him in a way, though not fully as he is still adopting some of that side. Tyler taught him not to need consumerist products and lifestyle, but he went too far and the narrator realizes he does not need Tyler. The film is about gaining a little bit of both sides. Tyler is not the hero. He is going too far and the audience needs to catch onto the fact that he is not the ideal one should strive for, but rather strive for that of the protagonist at the end. One should be their own individual but strive to improve and not give in and embrace extremes. The film is first about ridding one's self of the materialistic means and ideals society sets forth, including hyper-masculine extremist role models that Tyler embodies. The film is being more like the narrator than Tyler. Despite this, audience members lose sight of this and still view the film of being film as being for Tyler's philosophy and character ideal.",Fight Club
986,TheNihalGursoyOfficial,Rebel but How?,8,11 February 2015,"When looking at the general message of this film, its really saying something. It is a sort of reminder to the middle class that they are being used and have no revolution anymore. But that's it. Its only a reminder and the film is not suggesting what the middle class should do about it because the things done in the film are ridiculous and definitely not a solution. However, this does not make the film a bad one. A film's job is not to show people what to do. At least thats what I think. This film entertains us with its own solution and also surprises us throughout. The acting, filming, and narration are all fit together for the purpose.

The nitty-gritty details are handled and manipulated exceptionally well by him. The performances are top-notch. Brad Pitt as the cheesy soap-dealer is both charming and menacing. Hellena Bonham Carter fits to the T in her unorthodox role. But it is Edward Norton who steals the show with his tremendous true-to-life enactment of The Narrator who represents all those men who are sick of their job and lead a life of submission and slavery. Fight Club is the first and only of its kind blow-my-brain-out thriller.",Fight Club

992,Deckard42,One of the best movies ever made,10,8 October 2007,"Long ago I saw Fight Club for the first time. Back then it was so precisely showing all that I felt about modern society, and a lot more, it just seemed like a divine revelation. I can hardly say how much and what it gave to me, but the closest word to describe it would be ""hope"".Usually as time goes by, your point of few changes, you get into other roles in life and tend to distance yourself from turbulent times in the past. But looking back today, I have to realize, that although many things have changed, Fight Club is still what it was:Not only can I still identify with its extreme criticism, not only is it still a uniquely deep and perfectly done movie, it still stands all alone, more alone then ever perhaps, with all it has said. Brad Pitt playing Tyler Durden has remained one of the best performances ever given - just like Edward Norton as anonymous main character of the movie. Norton portraying the ""normal"", sick life standard of modern societies, contrasting himself to and finding himself in Tyler Durden, the anarchistic mythical creature living in and from the idea of the portrayed life standard itself. (think of the plot at this point)The movie's portrayal of our lifes is at least a strong call for realism towards our roles in a capitalistic world, which - in the terms of globalization for example - has never seemed more unheard. And this is exactly what makes Fight Club's devastating, anarchistic point of few so highly legitimate. In the end everything is subject of interpretation, as this subversive masterpiece has put every piece of even itself into a context highly ambivalent - consciously avoiding any constructive criticism.Many have associated this movie with a Generation of people identifying with it. Looking back many years later, this is still true - with one addition: It is clearly going to be more then one generation.",Fight Club

(If I wrote the detailed stuff about the revelation it would be a spoiler.) Then how did the director trick us? I think the way how dialogues are written works the most. It is of course meant to be held between 2 people and this is why we call it dialogue. SO this is our instant/general assumption; there are two ""different"" people in the screen and they talk to each other. 
I think the director used this general way to think to trick us, and us being tricked is essential because there is the revelation moment and this is the powerful punchline in this movie.

This movie peaked about an hour and a half into it then for me it went downhill.  I loved the first part so much and I did like the movie as a whole but it had that Falling Down effect on me where it just got too way out.

The convincing performances by Pitt and especially by Norton allow you to lose yourself in the story. If you haven't read the book, you should. It is only about 200-some pages but is just as compelling as the movie. Another thing I love about this movie is how quotable it is. The sharp narration and dialogue is derived mostly from the book, but some was not and the presentation of it is simply superb. Norton should have won an Oscar for his performance. If you haven't seen him in Primal Fear and American History X, definitely do so. Pitt is also extremely witty in what is his best role to date. His sex-symbol status aside, the guy can really act!

But we still can't easily define its nature, and the nature of the minds of the people involved.

1008,jonnaharkenson,Movie is pretty good but not the best movie ever,7,25 June 2021,"Pros:-Interesting film overall, lots of symbolism in the story
-Anti-capitalism and anti-consumerism theme
-Psychological thriller aspect, plot twists
-Lots of high octane underground fighting
-Great lead actorsCons:-Scenes can be too random sometimes, attention grabbing for no reason
-The hyper masculinity and toxic masculinity aspect, and encourages predatory behavior
-Encouragement of toxic relationships
-Can get a little too violent sometimes for no reason
-Pushing the idea of terrorism and cultism
-Ending just wasn't satisfying or made much senseThe movie started off very interesting and there was a good build up but the movie starts to drag somewhere halfway through the film and the ending just wasn't satisfying to me. I think the movie has some good symbolism and meanings to it (such as the anti capitalism theme, making you think outside the box and realize our lives are shaped by rich men and politicians in suits, and that there is more meaning to life than working your 9-5 job, and that you should live without fears or worries), but I also think there were some bad meanings (encourages toxic masculinity and hyper masculinity, giving the idea to be a real man you have to be ruthless and violent, and it can encourage domestic terrorism).I think most of the people giving the movie 10/10 are mostly men, it is indeed the type of movie most men love (kind of like Kill Bill, lots of meaningless violence and has a cult classic aspect to it with a lot of catchy phrases). I think the movie is pretty good and interesting to watch, and it makes me think more about life and think outside the box more.. but I feel the movie is indeed overhyped as ""the best movie ever"", and I just think the story kind of doesn't go anywhere halfway through the film and there's too much unnecessary hyper masculinity which I think can send a wrong message. I'm not trying to be ""woke"", I just don't think this movie is a perfect 10/10, so I give it 7/10 because it I enjoyed it but I wouldn't rewatch it more than twice, story just didn't go anywhere. I could see why it's a cult classic, it does appeal to certain people. Just like Kill Bill, it's fun to watch but I don't think it's the best movie ever, but some people love it and it's a Hollywood cult classic.",Fight Club
1009,pmforster,"Mad, bad and dangerous to know",7,23 March 2003,"Fight Club is a movie of two halves. The first half establishes Edward Norton's character as dissatisfied with his life and his small job in a large organization. His initial response is to participate in support groups, which provide the emotional support lacking in the rest of his life. After a fire damages his home, however, rather than looking to any of the people he met in those groups, he seeks out Brad Pitt, whom he previously met only briefly, but who offers a more satisfying way out of the drab pettiness of his life. It is from the interactions between Norton and Pitt that the Fight Club develops. The tangible contact of fighting and feeling pain revitalizes Norton's life, and gives it a meaning previously lacking.Although it is extremely violent and includes graphic portrayals of the effects of the fights, I enjoyed the movie to this point. It explores a theme that Pitt's character makes explicit when he talks about fighting as a means of recovering a masculine identity in a culture in which young men are brought up and feminised by, and also implicitly betrayed by, overexposure to women as mothers and teachers. The reduction of Norton to a weak, needy consumer is the outcome of that process. I was looking forward to the development of that theme when the film began its shift into the main feature of the second half - the exploration of individual psychopathology. I am being deliberately vague here because I don't want to give away detail that will spoil the film for some, but I found this aspect of the film less satisfying. This was partly because it is not a particularly good account of a dissociative disorder, but also because I was enjoying the themes of the first part of the film and wanted to see them given prominence.However, there was still much that I enjoyed about the whole movie. I thought that all performances were very well done - not just the main characters, but some of the minor characters such as Norton's boss. Finally, the cinematography and direction help sustain dramatic tension throughout the movie. 7 / 10.",Fight Club

1011,uhmartinez-phd,A Pretty Looking Nightmare,5,5 December 2007,"David Fincher is terrific with his camera. Visually his films are a wonder. Unfortunately the contents are so thin that the interiors of his tale vanish very quickly. What remains is ""the look"" and the promise, no matter how unfulfilled the promise remains. Edward Norton is sensational, especially in the first 20 minutes of the movie. Brad Pitt, already a film icon, does his thing, and that, of course, is a plus. Helena Bonham Carter surprised me big time with a facade I had never seen. The slow motion of the smoke coming out of her mouth as Fincher introduces her to us is a work of art in itself but, and that ""but"" is a real problem, nothing remains because deep down there is nothing there but a fantastic eye for and to startle and amaze.

1013,al_gd,Primal Fear meets 12 Monkeys,5,28 September 2002,"All I can say, is that if anyone who watches this, and finds some meaning to it, or meaning to their life, or inspiration somehow, your lives must be pretty shytty. Some of the scenes are just pure BS, Norton's fight with himself, getting dragged through the parking lot, the final scene, what the freak was that. Yes, some serious questions are raised about the decay of our society, the meaningless of our lives (well at least some of our lives), the quirky group support scenes are funny, and even touching in a strange way, but the whole creation and coming together or divergence of Norton's personalities is just too unbelievable. What was also freaky was Norton playing the Primal fear role, and Brad Pitt doing his 12 monkeys thing, too much deja vu there for me. If you were impressed by Norton beating himself up in front of his boss, then you need to see the old 'Class of '84' , where a punk teen does the same thing with similar effect. If you want to see a great movie, an indictment on today's society, something which may touch you, and maybe make you look a lot deeper at yourself, check out 'Falling Down' starring Michael Douglas.On the plus side, this is a great performance by Edward Norton.

1016,maverick-29364,"I don't care what IMDb says, one of the worst A list movies I have ever seen.",3,24 February 2020,"Before I begin, I should clarify. I am not giving it three stars because I think it's overrated, but because I genuinely believe that on a scale from Lord of The Rings to Garbage Pail Kids, this movie falls closer to Garbage Pail. And yes I have seen both.To give this movie praise where it's deserved, the movie is high budget with no technological set backs. I can also appreciate the originality of the story. I hate it, but I have never seen anything quite like it before. Also no actor did a bad job. I like Brad Pitt reasonably well, and I love Helena Bonham Carter. The characters they portray are awful, but I do like the actors. The cinematography is sometimes okay. That pretty much wraps up everything positive I have to say about the movie, now lets get to the more interesting part.It's about an insomniac who struggles to find his place in life before he starts joining community groups with various ailments that he pretends to have. My first issue, why does he pretend to have problems? If you go to a community group and say, ""I don't have this issue, but I'm here to support all of you."" are people going to start throwing things and force you to leave? As we jump into the movie, the problems of this guy are presented, and he is so close to resolving them instantaneously. However he starts to lose it, when he discovers, a woman named Marla who is faking it just like him. Does this guy realize his ugly reflection in the mirror when he witnesses someone doing the same thing? Nope, but he still can't stand her for 'reasons', and proposes that the two of them split up groups so they don't have to see each other.The movie then switches gears when our narrator meets a fascinating stranger on an airplane. Tyler is ultra reckless and has a very uncivil approach to life. When the narrator arrives at his home, he comes to find out that his apartment caught fire, and asks to move in with Tyler. Tyler agrees, but before the narrator moves in, Tyler asks him to punch him as hard as he can. This leads to a pretty intense fight, even though they're friends now, they enjoy a hard fight. This leads a bunch of passers by to join in the fight. They all have so much fun with it that they decide to start a fight club. What??? I realize that I'm pretty pacifistic, but don't you fight when you hate someone??? Even if you enjoy beating the crap out of someone, don't you regret dealing with the scratches and scars??? I realize that some things just aren't for me, but I can't understand why it's fun to beat up your friends.As the movie continues, the narrator crosses paths with Marla again. Tyler and Marla basically lose their pants immediately after meeting. Then we get to one of the most annoying scenes I have ever seen. We hear Tyler and Marla moaning in a super dragged out scene that lasts five minutes, while the narrator who still can't stand her, struggles to find a quiet place on the other side of the hall, or downstairs, or in the furthest corner in the basement. I think this scene is supposed to be comedic, but I find it just as annoying as our narrator. I guess I can understand how this might be funny for a twelve year old, while I'm on it, I should just say this entire comedy-drama is not funny.As the movie progresses, the Fight Club gets bigger, more intense, and more dangerous. Also the characters go from bad people,  of the earth. They begin to provoke fights with people outside the club. When the narrator is about to be fired from his job for good reasons, the narrator starts threatening his boss. When the turmoil with his boss gets worse the narrator beats himself up, and blames his injuries on his uninjured boss.Eventually we come to a point where our narrator struggles to find Tyler, so he starts digging up a ton of airplane tickets, and comes to find out that Tyler has traveled all around America, and started fight clubs in every major city. At this point, I had been waiting for two hours for karma to catch up with these people, or for somebody to get a redemption arc, but instead the movie decides to give us a good contender for the worst plot twist ever made. It turns out that our narrator has split personality disorder, and Tyler doesn't really exist!So let me get this straight, When Tyler, and the narrator got into a fight in the beginning, which grabbed the attention, of numerous people on the street, it was really just the narrator beating himself up? When Tyler and Carla have sex, and the narrator is struggling to get away from the noise, it's really just the narrator having sex with Carla and making up crap about what the other him is doing? And the narrator totally blanked on many months, if not years of his life that he would spend traveling from city to city, starting up Fight Clubs throughout America?Well that's what the movie is running with, so I guess I'm supposed to run with it. Every movie that I have seen with a twist relies on an oversight on the viewers part. It adds clarity to things that didn't make sense before. This twist however, makes the entire movie make far less sense. And instead of providing clarity, I feel lied to. You know all that stuff that happened before this twist, a ton of it didn't really happen, we appreciate your understanding for our gaps in logic, yours truly, 20th Century Fox.I hear all the time in movies like this that you need to watch it a second time and notice all the hints you missed the first time. I only saw this movie once, and I'm not seeing it again, but looking back at the hints, the two of them bought the same exact suit case, and they both have insomnia issues. Well don't I feel like an idiot for thinking that coincidences happen, obviously I should have realized that it's far more likely that this character really doesn't exist, what great foreshadowing. The only thing I take away from that, is that the writers looked over the script a second time before making this movie. Am I supposed to be impressed? This plot twist literally makes just as much sense as Han Solo being a figment of Luke Skywalker's imagination. In fact every movie that involves two or more characters could have done the same twist. What a great way to ruin all your favorite movies.Anyways the narrator realizes that he's a victim of the dumbest twist in cinema, and the movie becomes a struggle of him ridding himself of his inner Tyler. The narrator and Tyler get into another fight when the narrator tries to stop a bomb that Tyler planted. Of course this fight is just the narrator beating himself up again. The narrator eventually realizes the only way to kill Tyler is to kill himself. So he turns his own gun to his head, and fires killing Tyler, but as luck would have it sparing the parts of his brain that made him the no name narrator that I can't stand.As I'm writing this, Fight Club is the 11th best movie on IMDb, and in a list of 250 movies this isn't falling off anytime soon. What the hell? The Shawshank Redemption is rated number one. While I think it's only okay, it does have some excellent moments, and I can understand why it would be rated number one. I cannot understand why this movie is so highly rated. I really can't understand how this could get mediocre ratings, it's just bad. Every character is unlikeable, and unpleasant. This leads to the entire movie being unpleasant. When the movie decides to give it's unpleasantness a break, it reverts to sheer stupidity. By the end of the movie, the narrator is in a worse spot then where he began. Also this being one of the greatest movies ever, I fear that people who over analyze it will get the message, 'If I'm having mental issues, then I should shoot myself in the head, then maybe I'll feel better.' I do not endorse this movie to anybody whatsoever.",Fight Club

Of course the anarchist in your face plot and the anti-hero's cool demeanor make this a hugely popular film, especially among young disillusioned men. The film itself is brilliantly paced, reeking of humor and brilliantly shot. The acting is top notch. Ed Norton is relatable as the narrator and Brad Pitt shows why he was so popular back in the 90s- he owns the scenes.

1019,arthurwade-18694,(A masterclass in nihilism and anarchism).,8,4 October 2018,Fight Club is David Fincher through and through. From the underlying dark nature to the visual outlook this is the work of a master at the height of his talent. Fight Club has been analysed and interpreted since its release and yet every time you see something new. A take on blatant consumerism with each passing year this movie becomes all the more relevant. There is a Tyler Durden hiding inside all of us and the anarchist outlook has inspired many a men. Brad Pitt and Ed Norton are in amazing form here. Just watch this film if you have not already.,Fight Club
1020,lordsbehemoth,One of my favorite films growing up,10,21 July 2018,"Man after this film me and my friends started a fight club LOL. We were young and dumb. But this was one of my first films that I really fell in love with. As the story was so crazy, what was going on in the story was so amazing. Later on I found out the little tricks they put in the camera. From little still frames of Brad Pits character. It was a game changer for the cinematography industry, I think it was a time when it really changed how people like me started viewing films.",Fight Club

I was so wrong. If I could go back in time I'd beat the f*ck out of myself for saying so. Fight Club is one of Edward Norton's best roles since American History X, and personally it's one of my favorite movies as of now. Don't let your conscience tell you that it's just some movie about guys fighting in the basement of a night club. F*ck em! This damn movie is so cool.One, the special effects used were pretty damn sweet. I loved the usage of Subliminal Messaging throughout the film. THis movie is gold. I can't really explain much about it, but if you get the chance to see it, do it! YOu'll regret waiting so long to see it if you take too long. SO come on, what the f*ck are you waiting for?!

1023,Straff,Blood and Guts with a load of Sofistication.,10,25 November 1999,"Brilliant. Entertaining. Funny. Witty. Exciting. Can you see where I'm going with this?? This film is one of the few that I would class as having a bit of everything thrown in, most in large quantities. Maybe Hollywood is beginning to realise that the public wants something different, this year would certainly suggest that with films like South Park, The Blair Witch Project and The Fight Club. Anyway, back to the film.Fight Club is about the life of an everyday man in the good old US of A. He has a fairly typical job, investigating why cars blow up, burn. That sort of thing. But he can't sleep and has very bad insomnia. He goes to counselling groups to realise something inside and get some well deserved nap time. This makes him content and he plods along for a while longer. On a chance meeting on a plane he meets a man who is the exact opposite to him in so many ways, the fun begins.After his apartment blows up they set up a fight club as a way of releasing their inner angers at the corporate world that they have become slaves to. But as with all good things, they snowball and carry on esculating in size an effect. Then from one fight club springs up a mini-malitia group raging war on the ways of the nineties.From this point on you can't say to much without ruining the film for those that havn't seen it. But it has a wicked twist that doesn't annoy you and kind of fits tot he scheme of the film.This is a great original piece of film making. You are forced into trying to out-think the director as you watch, you want to guess what will happen. You think about what you'd do in that situation. The performances of everyone in the film is perfect for their characters. It's a real pleasure to sit there and watch. It obviously won't cater to all tastes. Don't go and see it if you don't like to think about things as you go. You have to pay attention or you won't get it.Definately in the top five films of the year. Go and see this film.",Fight Club
1024,Chris-18-2,fantastic movie,10,28 November 1999,"Fight Club is amazing, brilliant, shocking, original, provocative, and entertaining.  I loved it!  I've said it before, David Fincher is a GENIUS...plain and simple.  Enough said.  The script of this movie is brilliant, his direction is incredible, the acting is amazing, Brad Pitt is incredible, as is Ed Norton of course.  So is Helena Bonham Carter, the only other film I have seen her in was ""room with a view"", so yeah, there's a slight difference!The layers of meaning to this movie are so deep, I saw it twice and it still leaves me thinking hard about all the little things in it.  The way it is filmed is pure eye candy, truely brilliant, typical Fincher actually.  The music by the Dust Brothers is great also.  I won't say much about the story because it's probably been described enough in the other reviews and I don't want to say much to ruin it either.  It is simply an original and fascinating piece of cinema.  One of the best films of the year.10/10",Fight Club
1025,wperkins,"""Full of sound and fury...",3,1 May 2000,"...signifying nothing.""  Nah, it wasn't that bad, just terrifically disappointing.  The movie's first half hour does a great job exploring the hollow nature of modern life, such as the scene where Norton's living room is gradually ""furnished"" with items right out of the catalog, complete with their price and description.  Yes, we've seen it before, but Norton's performance in the first part of the film brings the script to life.  And then along comes a solid dose of Hollywood machismo, wrapped up in a buff, Brad Pitt package.  Now here's what I have a real problem with: all these young men find salvation through beating each other senseless. Okay, athletic competition has long served that purpose; remember varsity football? But it only goes so far...and the movie's only half over.  What does that leave: a paramilitary organization (!?!?), a weak ending, and an attempt to turn bonding-through-brutality into a way of life. No doubt, it sells tickets, but it defeats its own purpose. Norton's character has been destroyed by modern life; it's a shame that all that's left him is destroying others' bodies. And apartments. And credit ratings. Ho hum.",Fight Club
1026,Yossarian-,Quite a fine way to cap off the century...,10,22 March 2000,"I saw 'Fight Club' with no preconceptions of what I was going to be in for, except maybe that it was going to be violent. As all of you who have seen and enjoyed the movie will understand, I ended up enjoying 'Fight Club' immensely.It is dark, small sections are violent, though in no way manipulatively (ie. Woo films), but it is uplifting. And no, Hitler wouldn't have loved it, he would have hated it. You see, the way I saw it 'Fight Club' was a movie with a progressive liberal stance. In fact, I'd go as far as saying it was socialist (and I'd appreciate it if the neo-McCarthyism could be stowed where it belongs, in the 50's). The tale was one of two (one?) guys who were disillusioned about the American Way of Life, one knew this to start off with, one learnt it along the way. They had had enough of material possessions replacing substance. They did something about it and it would seem that a large part of working-class (proletariat) American followed. The climactic conclusion of 'Fight Club' was their answer to corporate control of every single aspect of everyone's lives (what car you drive, what job you take, what you watch, read, hear, speak, think, etc etc). True, there was a strong anarchistic element in there too, but on the whole it was an act of empowerment for the proletariat. So in that way it is truly a Christian movie. Jesus condemned those that placed material pursuits above being individuals (ie. all of us).
'Fight Club', and in a similar way 'American Beauty', gave me hope for a better Australia. Things aren't too bad here now, but they could be a whole heap better. Oh, and by the way, the movie is fantastic.",Fight Club
1027,sisyphus-8,First rule of Fight Club...,10,24 October 1999,"...Go see this movie. While ""Alien³"" and ""The Game"" were merely above average, Fincher did impress me considerably with ""Seven,"" which I consider to be a masterpiece in its own right. ""Fight Club"" is every bit as good as ""Seven,"" perhaps better. On the surface, it seems pretentious and adolescent (which it is to an extent...but that's to be expected in a movie about guys beating the c**p out of each other). But once you get beyond the shocks his is a movie with a lot to say that pulls out all the stops in saying it.Although I haven't read the novel (yet), I must say that Uhls' script is amazingly well-crafted, considering the convoluted nature of the story. As the angry, enigmatic Tyler Durden, Pitt once again proves that he's at his best as a psycho (like in another favorite of mine, ""12 Monkeys""), and the chameleon-like Norton delivers another charged, convincing performance. Even though Carter also gives a good performance  the entire character seems to disrupt the flow of the story in parts, which is the only real weak point in the movie.When the smoke clears, ""Fight Club"" functions as a scathing satire on pretty much everything status quo. This is more than Kafka for the (post-)MTV generation, though...it's a genuinely thought-provoking film that is as darkly funny as it is disturbing.",Fight Club
1028,Gio-11,Arguably the best movie of 1999.,10,16 November 1999,"It was great to see true satire up on the screen after all those films proclaiming themselves as ""black comedies"" and failing to deliver.  This movie was brash, acerbic, gritty and caustic - a comment on our white bread society and all its ""Ikea boys"".  This is arguably the best film to come out of a major studio in 1999.  David Fincher is a brave director who plays with the iconography of film to reinvent the language of film.  True, the themes of alienation and despair are not new but Fincher takes a new slant on these problems and delivers a metaphysical, brooding tale on the nature of existence, death and one's place in the grand scheme of things.  From the production design to the flawless acting, this is a must see - more than once to pick up all the movie references and the symbols.  Fincher keeps reminding us that we are watching a film - at one point he shows us the sprocket holes - here, the ideas are important to knock us out of our comfortable seats in the dark.  Brad Pitt delivers as does Edward Norton who is fast becoming an actor of discernment and skill.  Helena Bonham-Carter finally rips her bodice and throws it away to play the vacuous fantasy toy of the disillusioned male.  I loved this film because it does not give easy answers - the Ayn Rand solution rings hollow but Fincher is forcing us to think out our predicament by an assault on our comfortable viewing practices bred by years of films with no vision.",Fight Club
1029,JoElin,"You know it's violent when you consider ""Seven"" as light compared to it",7,17 October 1999,"This film was well acted, well directed, and well written. But I could barely sit through it. I found it to be so brutal and violent that much of the time I shut my ears and closed my eyes. Helena Bonham Carter is great (and completely different as we've ever seen her) as Marla, a slightly disturbed woman.

It is surely not about mindless violence as most viewers would lead you to think, but the best of what I will call a sub-genre of 'male angst' like the likes of American Beauty and Scorcese's Bringing Out The Dead.  The acting is spot on, thanks to the magnificent Edward Norton together with Brad Pitt.  The camera techniques, frame for frame are very cleverly put together and the excellent cinematography give great depths to the characters struggle and confusion.  David Fincher, known for his moody and disheartening films has created a true and clever social commentary on how far our so-called 'modern day' living can take us.  Great work!",Fight Club

It is actually three separate movies.One movie is a dark adventure story (testosterone opera) very engaging in its own way.  An unhappy fellow living in an empty world tries to master his fate.One movie is a gripping psychological study of personality disintegration. Edward Nortons' character is searching, ever searching for something unaware that it is his own identity being sought after.One movie is an Anarchist Tract: A Call To Arms! Remember If?  In this movie we see an implementation of the idea that for a new, better order to exist the old one must be destroyed.  Look for a happy face in an unexpected place.  The thing that is missing in this movie is the Anarchist vision of the better world to come (Utopia).Aside from the intellectual side Fight Club has tremendous energy.  It will carry you away.

1035,oveets,"A dark, atmospheric, crazy film.",9,25 November 2000,"Fight club is mind blowing the first time you watch it.  Walking out of the cinema after watching it was a strange experience, a comedown to reality. And watching it for the second time brings across the cleverness of the film.  The first viewing is emotionally stimulating and further viewings are intellectually stimulating in my view.  Here's why:
The film has a great atmosphere-this comes across fromi-the dark locations filmed inii-the excellent soundtrack which is deep and unintrusive, almost subliminal.iii-the central place given to the 'darker' sides of human nature.In this context however, the darker sides of human nature are one result of our consumption driven society, stereotyped in the film.  It is necessary to experience these sides of our nature to escape from this to a future free of inclinations created solely from our environment.  Or this is how the film comes across to me.The film's message is powerful but I can't help thinking that it goes too far the other way in its exploration of a cliche.  It has similarities to American Psycho.  (Bret Easton Ellis praised the book if I remember rightly) But in both these films/book the characterisation of a material possessio n frenzy seems over the top, although it is more of a satire in American Psycho.The film is effective in portraying how we are, to an extent, a product of our society and its conventions and our possessions but I take the view with films that they also bring us away from reality.  Films form part of the experiences we are constructed of and we need to look critically at what the film is trying to make us feel.The film is amazing on the second viewing because its cleverness really comes across.  Without giving anything away, I thought it wouldn't be coherent when watching it again after knowing the ending.  However it does work, requiring only a fairly small amount of suspension of disbelief.

1041,Moviemaniacgirl-1,Beyond all Belief,10,25 February 2012,"I rarely start off with a quote but here we go, ""It's only after we've lost everything that we're free to do anything."" In my opinion this is one of the most powerful quotes ever uttered in a movie, and luckily for Fightclub, most of the other powerful quotes take their residence in the movie as well. "" People are always asking me if I know Tyler Durden."" And so starts the phenomenally acted, breath taking action movie Fight Club. Once you begin the movie you are on the edge of your seat taking in every shot, every line, every movement of Edward Norton and Brad Pitt. Fightclub inhabits your body, it becomes an addiction, a need. WIthout Fightclubs presence you feel empty. After watching Fightclub I felt empty, but most important I felt full. I had to watch the movie again to relieve the emptiness, and once it was over the second time I began to take the fullness and think. Fightclub is a movie that makes you think about what you've done with your life, about everything, and especially society and mediocrity. Be prepared to realize that, as Tyler Durden says, ""We are all part of the same compost heap."" Firstly there is no actor that can ever compare to Edward Norton. Norton has a calm intensity that is riveting. Edward Nortons narration of the film made it at least ninety times better than any other movie I've ever seen. Listening to his voice is soothing and it adds a stage presence to anything he is speaking of. Edward Norton's character was like his other half, it felt natural, even Norton's body suggested his character traits. Without Edward Norton their would be no Fightclub. If anyone tells you that FightClub stars Brad Pitt, you can just look at them and inform them that they obviously haven't seen Fightclub. Brad Pitt, though not the star of FightClub, adds so much character to the movie through his role of Tyler Durden. Brad Pitt's laugh was one of the most intense and maniacal laughs I've ever heard in any movie, no matter what genre. Tyler Durden was a character that was vital to the film that if he had been cast wrong the movie wouldn't be half of what it is today, and it's IMDb's 14th Most Popular Movie Ever Made. Luckily for Brad PItt he has a tendency to be perfect at these types of films. ""We just had a near life experience"", as Tyler would say.Helena Bonham Carter has a darkness about her, it's extremely eye catching and well-done, it's almost an art-form. She continues to amaze me through her depressed, but loving characters who have such a violent range of emotions that you can barely follow her, but you have fun trying too. I love Marla and her role in the movie. Meat Loaf, and Jared Leto add to the story through their humorous interpretations of what could be heart-breaking characters. Both perform amazingly and add relativity to the film in their own special-little ways.The story was written so perfectly that I couldn't find a single flaw in it. Every moment of the movie made me more attentive to the plot. The ending, and twists were constructed so effortlessly that you barely realized they were happening. Every moment, and every cut of the movie to a different moment in Tyler or The Narrartor's life added infinitely to the film. It was well made off of the novel and in the moments of deviation from Palahnuick's work it was only an addition to the watchability, or the possibilities of movies. It was a great shrine to the novel's excellence. David Fincher was fifty percent of what the film is. Every time the camera angle, or scene changes he adds something that surprises or informs the plot. Adding in the intricate detailed moments and flashes of image or sound controlled the movie's knowledge of anarchy, and Tyler. Fincher's shots made the movie first-rate, insightful, original, clever, and thought-provoking, not to mention kick-ass. Fightclub is power, and makes you think twice about life and society, definitely worth a watch no matter who you are, or what your beliefs are. Remember the first and second rules of Fightclub ""do not talk about Fightclub."" (It'll definitely be hard for you to follow those rules)",Fight Club
1042,shreejithindia,Undoubtedly..... one of the best mystery thrillers i have EVER seen !!!!,10,30 September 2010,"Fight club... the most intelligent work of the director David Fincher till date. The main cast include Edward Norton, Brad Pitt and Helena Bonham Carter... all well suited to their roles.After watching the American History X (1998) i understood that Edward Norton is an actor who can handle any sort of role exceptionally well. he proved the same here as well. But the one who completely surprised me in Fight Club was Brad Pitt. His character was so cleverly plotted that it bears the entire base of the movie over its shoulders. i doesn't want to go much deeper into this character otherwise it will ruin the entire excitement of the viewer.There are only two mystery thrillers that i personally believe can compete with Fight Club. One is the Usual Suspects (1995) and the second is Reservoir Dogs(1992).If you haven't watched this film till date then don't wait further and watch this film now.

1043,moviemajesty,Just Gets Better and Better With Multiple Viewings,9,23 December 2011,"Edward Norton plays a white-collar worker whose condominium has just burned down. Having no friends, he is forced to move in with Tyler Durden, a crazy soap salesman that he just met on a plane. Together they form an underground cult where men fight each other just for the heck of it. There is a lot more to the story, and this film is full of twists and turns, so I don't want to say anything more to avoid spoiling this fantastic movie.This film has garnered a reputation for being very violent, but I don't think that is fair. Obviously there is quite a bit of violence, but it is necessary and, in my opinion, not overdone. What makes this film so good is its original story, excellent dialog, and the little things put in it to make it a very re-watchable movie. The story is great and unlike any other I have ever known. It creates an opportunity for a great atmosphere and wonderful acting performances, both of which are capitalized on in the film. The dialog is brilliant and contains the perfect amount of black comedy, particularly in the narration. I'd be hard-pressed to find my favorite line in the film. Finally, this being the third time I have watched this movie, every scene contains little lines or little references to the twist at the end. I never even noticed them the first time I watched the film, yet it seems to obvious when you go back and re-watch it. With every viewing I notice something new, and I cannot wait to watch it again.",Fight Club
1044,Catrician,Misunderstood by many,8,11 April 2013,"What's the first rule of Fight Club again? Ask this question at almost any workplace, high school, or public environment in America and you're sure to get a response. ""The first rule of Fight Club is you do not talk about Fight Club"". It's every teen's favourite film, and contains their favourite quote. Yet many people seem to overlook the discreet charm of Fight Club.The film basically follows like this: an average, stereotypical working- class man finds that his average, everyday life goes through a series of changes after meeting several characters throughout the movie. The first of these characters is Bob, a man with testicular cancer who gives Norton's character the desire to try and help, as he becomes addicted to the feeling of not being judged. Norton's character then notices an oddity in these groups, a fellow ""poser"". This is Marla Singer, who he feels is stopping him from truly feeling this euphoria he felt earlier. Over time, he and Marla arrange a schedule in which they will each meet at different therapy sessions so they don't have to confront each other, which satisfies Norton's character.But then he meets the infamous Tyler Durden, who literally embodies everyone we want to be. Did you ever want to make that racist joke in a meeting that would have provoked laughs from anyone and everyone, but were afraid to? Don't worry, Tyler made it. And he's happy he did.Tyler, as a character, is symbolic of a man's dream life. While we generally cling to our own safety, all of us, at one point or another, want to do something big, something crazy, and be free for once in life. Tyler is this freedom.The rest of the film shows the progression of Norton's character slowly turning into a character more and more similar to Tyler as the two of them work together to produce a massive crime empire known as Project Mayhem, after, that is, they set up underground fight clubs all over the local area. Tyler and Marla become friends with benefits, although without the friends part. Bob ends up being shot after a prank involving a giant globe and a coffee shop goes wrong. Norton's character questions life and death, and what his life really means. But these are all just plot points to progress and add to the film's parallelism, which is, in essence, that we all strive for freedom even though we live our lives in safety. Fight Club is unique in that it doesn't make a true and to-the-point statement. It just forces you to ask questions about life. ""This is your life, and it's ending one minute at a time,"" Norton's character famously cites. ""Is what I'm doing right now contributing to making my life the best it can be?"" Maybe that's the question Fight Club demands its viewers to ask.But, like Van Sant's ""Elephant"", Fincher's Fight Club will never have a definitive answer. We will never know everything about the film, about its obscure ideas, nor what it really wants the viewer to think of or do. It sets up plot points and abandons them, and although it seems to have a clearly set narrative, it doesn't seem to concern itself with a plot. It simply moves on ahead, not concerned with its infinite plot inconsistencies. Although the films seem about as different as they come, you could make quite an interesting comparison to this and ""Elephant"". They both bring up interesting and sometimes dark questions, and the truth is that we as an audience will never fully understand them, and one guess is as good as the other. Is Norton's character schizophrenic? Is it all a surreal dream, as is Lynch's ""Mulholland Dr.""? Who knows?Rating: 9/10",Fight Club

1046,larseirikf,I am Jack's sense of awe,9,2 July 2013,"I saw this one with a friend some time ago. I've seen it a couple of times more, because I notice more and more ingenious little details and you understand it better and better. It has become my second favorite movie of ALL TIME (1st being Shawshank Redemption). And I'm pretty picky.*ONLY READ IF YOU HAVE SEEN IT!* You hear ""Fight Club"". Then it's sure to be a movie stuffed with raw action and brutal fight scenes? You're a bit off the hook. So we start by seeing the narrator held at gunpoint, and then everything leading up to it is being told to us by said narrator. He suffers from insomnia, and his addiction with getting close to people in support groups for various deceases sets a moody opening-feel. It sounds absurd, but it works so well, and it even throws in elements of the darkest humor I've ever heard. And I absolutely loved it. Along comes a woman who disturbs the supports groups, named Marla Singer. She is one of Helena Bonham Carter's career highlights (my opinion). Marla's eccentric personality is Carter's specialty as an actress. Anyway, the real good stuff begins when the narrator's apartment is set on fire, and he has to live with a soap-maker named Tyler Durden. He and the narrator starts an underground fight club after realizing how good you feel after fighting someone. At a point, Marla comes between them when she becomes Tyler's lover, to the narrator's great annoyance, him hating Marla. As more and more members join in, it evolves out of the basement and is reborn in public as Project Mayhem. The narrator feels it has all gotten out of control, and tries to stop Tyler before he goes too far. But he eventually finds out that Tyler is a person invented by himself as a ""back-up"" when he thinks he is asleep. It escalates to the point where the Tyler-side gets shot and killed by the narrator-side, but by then it's too late to stop Project Mayhem's final purpose. The narrator is Edward Norton, which pretty much guaranties you that there will be quality. But Brad Pitt does his best performance ever as Tyler Durden. The fight scenes are brutal (especially one where a blond man has his face beaten to complete dis-figuration), as the rest of the movie is uncompromising. It will hit you pretty hard (pun intended) the first time you see it. And the second. And so on. It raises a LOT of existential questions and will force you to think about how you are living your life. It's a two and a half hour long barrage of amazing acting, mind-blowing storyline and special moments that makes Fight Club impossible to overlook or forget. A nifty detail I liked is how we get to know that Tyler works with connecting movie reels at cinemas, and how he uses ""artistic freedom"" to make it an exciting job. We are treated to Tyler's pranks while watching this movie. There is a flash image of a penis right before the end credits starts to roll, and four short ""blink-and-you-miss-it"" stills where an image of Tyler is put into the support groups. Brilliant xD. It's the kind of movie that you want to watch again the second it has ended. Unfortunately I'm limited to 1000 words, so I can't continue forever, so I will just finish it now.Fight Club is, to me, modern-day classic",Fight Club
1047,Imaginist,Fight Club (3/5 stars),7,21 March 2005,"For those who are picky this could have spoilers. So if you don't want an in depth look at the details then move on.Synopsis: ""Fight Club"" is a movie that reminds me of a beautiful train heading for an unbeknownst yet impending doom. It starts off promising, everyone is excited about the journey that lies ahead, and the train's grace and splendor is so inviting (a.k.a the witty dialogue and Norton's narration has set us up for quite a ride). Then with out warning the engineer (a.k.a the writer) picks up the train's speed and it continues to accelerate down the track until a marvelous crash, which leaves us wondering as to what happened? The problem with ""Fight Club"", as in so many movies, is not the first half but the last half; in fact, the first part of the movie excellent. Edward Norton is a down and out guy so upset with his life that his only perk (and only way to sleep) is to go to different support groups (i.e. ""Smoker's Anonymous,"" ""Men With Testicular Cancer,"" etc.) and wallow in other people's misery. Unfortunately for Ed's character, a very strange woman, Marla, comes along and ruins his fun, for she is doing the same exact thing he is. In an amusing scene, Ed's character and Marla decide to split up the support groups so that they do not have to cross each other's paths. Well, after this bit all seems well for Ed until he meets a very strange, machoistic, and aggressive guy named Tyler (Brad Pitt). Eventually Ed's character befriends Tyler and the two of them start a fight club to get there aggression out on each other and anyone else who would like to join. This is where the movie begins to deteriorate. Ed's character and Tyler start the club so that they can get their lives back on track (or at least this is true for Ed's character), and it works--everything seems a-OK after a few brawls with the locals. Now what does this tell us? That violence will make everything alright? It seems to me that the latter is the message, and I have a problem with that because violence never solves anything. Well anyway, after Tyler and Ed's character start the club they begin ""Project Mayhem"" which is an underground terrorist group made up of working class guys who want to attack consumerism. This is where our train has gone off the tracks. When I was watching the film I felt like the writer suddenly had no where else to go with his original ideas except to create a bunch of terrorists, which looking back on it, is quite laughable. The end of the movie is rather good except for a few spots, but I will not go into that because it would spoil some big secrets. I guess the real problem I had with this movie was the ""why?"" Why the hell did a writer sit down one day and decide to write a story condoning violence yet denouncing consumerism? You see, the problem is that this movie becomes a bit of a paradox; it tells us to not buy into materialism because it is superficial and unneeded (which by the way I agree with), but at the same time it tells us to use fist fights and terrorism as a means to achieve our goals (which is just so much more logical then buying into materialism--our we honestly suppose to believe this junk?). It seems to me that the writer was just another crazed radical who so happened to have some good ideas for a movie. Don't get me wrong, ""Fight Club"" is a fairly good movie filled with originality, but it just really doesn't have a worthwhile point. For the above reasons I am giving ""Fight Club"": 3 out of 5 stars.NOTE: 1/5 stars = bad 2/5 stars = OK 3/5 stars = good 4/5 stars = great 5/5 stars = classic",Fight Club

Of course the anarchist in your face plot and the anti-hero's cool demeanor make this a hugely popular film, especially among young disillusioned men. The film itself is brilliantly paced, reeking of humor and brilliantly shot. The acting is top notch. Ed Norton is relatable as the narrator and Brad Pitt shows why he was so popular back in the 90s- he owns the scenes. Ladies get a strong character in Helena Bonham Carter's Marla Singer, though quirky and psychotic. But then everyone is that way to some extent in this stylish film.

1055,Hotwyre6,"Nothing Poignant to Say, Just Loved it",10,24 June 2006,"Most films that use voice over narration are sophomoric efforts at best, mainly because voice over tends to be used as compensation for lack of good storytelling tools. That is, one of the first rules of fiction being ""show, don't tell"", a film ought to be able to convey its intent without directly telling the audience anything.However the film makers pulled it off, Fight Club's narration actually works as an enhancement to a film. Perhaps it is because the narrator never actually gives any information; perhaps because Norton's commentary is sardonically amusing. The fact is, it manages to succeed where thousands of films leave the viewer gritting their teeth in irritation.But this doesn't explain why Fight Club is worthy of the big 10/10. In addition to sharp directing, entertaining dialog, and talented cast, Fight Club wipes away the paper thin veneer of weak civility that replaces the raw, honest reactions so sadly lacking in contemporary culture. It is a refreshing breath of fetid air, so free of the insultingly cheap perfume of imitation sympathy and courtesy, that the viewer is made glad to experience the visceral, id-inspired attitudes of the characters on the screen. However immature and reprehensible the thoughts expressed may be, at least they are not patronizing themselves and others by pasting a Spackle of uninspired, new age crocodile tears many find themselves pressured to display.Perhaps that is what is most personal in this case. This is only a fraction of what Fight Club has to offer, as it not only tears at the materialization and feminization of modern culture, but stylistically renders a vivid portrayal of a madness that is itself a cure for a greater madness. This madness is that which is experienced by those who have been subtly told through constant media reinforcement how to mold into the ideal human being; an ideal that is never held by those who adopt it, but is given them by advertisement and the weak minded who won't bring themselves to spew out a foul tasting wad of mucous for fear of offending somebody they will never meet, about whom they truly care nothing.If this review appears relatively vague, it is deliberately so. It is not intended as an attempt to intellectualize the film because the language is just meant to convey what is interpreted as theme. Fight Club is one movie that should never be spoiled by a review. There are no specifics given here because every rendition done by anybody other than the actors involved (or Chuck Palahniuk himself) has always fallen short of the memorable manner in which the film delivers. The pseudo-intellectual psychobabble of this review is simply an amateurish attempt to create meaning without trespassing into the sacred experience that is Fight Club.Whether the above review hits a mark or sounds like chicken scratch, Fight Club ought to have a liberating effect of some kind on almost any viewer. Almost seven years after its release, Fight Club still hits with bone shattering inspiration and head splitting satisfaction.Watch with reckless abandon.",Fight Club

The ideas presented in this work are not just some testosterone induced fantasy - they are very real prospects presented via rather radical means.  Our world is in trouble today, and Fight Club does an astounding job of shedding light on these issues.  The acting, the dialogue, the direction, they were all fantastic.  The action was good, but it is not what made this movie what it was - the brains behind the story are what bring it up into the shining light that is good film production.  If any of you reading this are all happy about the BMW you drive, the Armani you wear, or the four story mansion you live in, see Fight Club and learn a lesson.

Not because it's too intellectual, but because many people will turn a blind eye to the truths expressed in it.  It is comparable to American Beauty in the way it puts our society under a microscope.  Kevin Spacey and Edward Norton's characters are very similar in their character arcs.  Fight Club is not really about fighting, so leave all your expectations at home and experience a masterpiece that is both visually exciting and profoundly thought-provoking.",Fight Club

It might wake you up and make you face huMAN nature. Do you want that to happen? No. Do you need that to happen? I say Yes. You must face it: Violence is in the human nature. Don't get me wrong, there is almost no free violence in that movie. They, the member of Fight Club, fight to feel alive--just some number in the drone chain of american(capitalism) society. While our narrator fights his biggest problem with modern life.The movie is narrated by the Edward Norton's character. (Best Actor oscar for him; he's already accepting it :) ) That character feels he is losing his life and there is something wrong with the world around him, so he can't sleep. One night, on a business plane trip he meets Tyler Durden. Tyler is exacly what the narrator is not. They click, then the fight club(s) begin(s). But Marla, is she a threat like Tyler says? GO FIND OUT! Because this is my interpretation of the movie, and in my humble opinion, you'll be seeing, if you dare, a very stylished film and THE best one yet this year. The movie tagets a male audience.It's an open call for revolution. Let Project Mayhem begins. ""You are not a special snowflake..""P.S. By the way, Brad Pitt plays Tyler Durden, but that's just a small detail, right?The Direction: Mtv-ish at it's best. David Fincher is a master! The Acting: Brad Pitt is great.

1067,Shrike-10,The last great black comedy of the millennium,10,13 November 1999,"Fight Club is the most hilarious, profound p***-take of a film I have ever seen.  The film relentlessly lampoons the manner in which ordinary men create alter egos in their minds to fulfill their dreams of transcendence, while simultaneously pointing up the puerile nature of the teenage Ayn Rand rhetoric of rebellion.  Finally someone has made a film that points out that extreme experiences do not bring some mystic wisdom, that the superficially rebellious are often the most unoriginal and conformist, and that an asshole with big ideas is just an even bigger asshole.The sensational twist, which I will not reveal here, is not the unnecessary piece of cleverness that some allege.  Instead, all I will say is that it is absolutely pivotal to the film's true message.  Moreover, Marsha is *meant* to be an undercharacterised stereotype - she's exactly the kind of sexually perverse screw-up that men whose lives lack excitement fantasise of meeting.",Fight Club

Most high-schoolers leave this film only remembering the insane ramblings of the god-like Brad Pitt character Tyler Durden. In that sense, this film contradicts itself. Also, I did not find this film enjoyable. Not the first time a watched it, not the second time and not the third time. Sure, I laughed a couple times and some of the fight scenes were cool, but those aspects did not make up for this cluttered picture.

1071,Lorenzo H.,"""Being Tyler Durden"" --- Beware of blind devotion to this film.",5,5 February 2000,"Not many of the young men praying at this movies alter seem to realize that the film's ending totally derails its entire philosophy up to that point. Till then, this somewhat intoxicating rant against consumer society and the emasculation of the modern male had at least been consistent.  The 'surprise' twist and 'happy' ending seem to negate everything that had come before and make it nothing more than a succession of stunningly filmed images surrounded by the character study of a psychotic.  The protagonist is basically a loner who needs not only society's recognition, but also the love of a woman.  When he can't get these, he turns to violence.  TAXI DRIVER explored this theme much better.  He also has the need to be someone else, see through others eyes, -- role-play a little.  That aspect is explored much better in BEING JOHN MALKOVICH.  In the end, though FIGHT CLUB looks great and has some great moments it just does not work well as a film. Many have called this movie the ""CLOCKWORK ORANGE of the 90's"".  Not a chance.  In twenty years Stanley Kubrick's film will still be viewed as a classic.  FIGHT CLUB will by then be nothing but a distant memory.  Final rating, a disappointing 5 out of 10.Another thought.  For over two hours (before the quick-fix happy ending), this movie advocates violence as a way that men can re-establish their place in society.  Don't get me wrong, there are a lot of things that could stand improvement in this world and even American society.  There's certainly room for change.  But not this way.  This film's message is a dangerous one that might be taken to heart by many angry and impressionable young men everywhere.  Think about it, ---what makes Ed Norton's character here any different than the skinhead he played in AMERICAN HISTORY X?  At least in that film his conversion into a tolerant and decent human being was far more gradual and believable.  Those who have blindly embraced FIGHT CLUB's philosophy without seeing these underlying faults and contradictions should view it again from this new perspective.  It will give you food for thought.Lastly, I'd like to point out that I'm perplexed regarding the very high ratings this film seems to be getting from female voters.  This is somewhat surprising considering that it is quite anti-female and condescending to women.  Perhaps this has something to do with the magnetic presence of Brad Pitt.  But then again, that's 'another' form of blinding oneself isn't it.",Fight Club

1073,dogg01,This is your life. And it's ending one minute at a time.,9,15 December 2000,"FIGHT CLUB IS THE GREATEST FILM OF 1999! But wait, let me start at the beginning. Contrary to popular belief, FIGHT CLUB is not a ""depraved film about a bunch of guys who beat each other up, which will turn all men into Space Monkeys."" It is the deepest, most intelligent and stylish film for ages.     We start in the Narrator's (Edward Norton) brain and we stay there for the rest of the film. We go out of his brain, through his nostril's and down the barrel of a gun in a beginning sequence to rival Se7en's. Then we see that Tyler Durden (Brad Pitt) is holding the gun. Then we swoop down the building and into a van, where there are explosives which are going to be used to destroy all the major credit card company's buildings. ""I know this,"" tells the Narrator, ""because Tyler knows this."" You won't know what any of this means until the final credits.    We go back a little, to the days of the Narrator's insomnia, which is only cured by going to cancer support groups. Everything is fine for the Narrator until a woman named Marla Singer (Helen Bonham Carter) starts 'visiting' the support groups too. They work out squedules and Narrator can sleep again. Then he meets Tyler Durden on a plane and it all hits the fan.   They start up a Fight Club for all of those who are like the Narrator, which soon leads to terrorist attacks on consumerism. Oh yeah, there's also a killer twist thrown in for good measure.   What makes Fight Club the best film for ages is that the script itself is superb, and the direction by David Fincher is his most darkest and stylish yet. The lighting is lowkey, there is some Matrixy camerawork, there are subliminal messages (which are pointed out on the DVD commentry) and Fincher sometimes wobbles the fabric of the film itself.   All in all, a first class package, superb performances, direction, oh, and let's not forget the perfect music from the Dust Brothers. A first class film, and a wake-up call for the Generation Xers.

1076,ArthvrPendrag0n,We should actually talk about the Fight Club,10,17 November 2019,"Fight Club is one of those movies that hits the spot without missing an inch of it. The nameless narrator (Edward Norton) is an insomniac office worker who lives a materialistic life. From the very beginning the movie comments on the capitalist nature of society by portraying how consumerism moves the world, but is unable to give relief in the end. Flipping through catalogues of new furniture for his apartment is the narrator's only personality trait. To fight against his insomnia he starts attending to support groups. By lying to people, pretending he has conditions he does not have, the narrator finds relief - the emotional acceptance he finds in the support groups is enough to allow him to sleep at night. The emotional complexity of the character is nothing unrealistic. David Fincher makes a subtle, yet clear, comment on the nature of materialist societies where no one really listens to each other nor care about each other. The system doesn't care about anyone, the distance between people - especially enhanced by how they function in the capitalist world - is a major plot point. However, when the narrator is finds someone who's a faker just like him he loses his emotional escape - "" Her lie reflected my lie. Suddenly, I felt nothing. I couldn't cry, so once again I couldn't sleep"".Shortly after Tyler Durden (Brad Pitt) is introduced into the story, the main character loses everything he valued. Deprived of his possessions he seeks solace in the company of a man who is the polar opposite of what he is. If the narrator is a worker who's way too worried about his condo and his job, Tyler is a freewheeling soapmaker who couldn't care less about all those things. The contrast between them is clear; Tyler refuses any consumerist logic from the narrator whilst making he see how futile is the lifestyle he was leading - ""Right. We are consumers. We're the by-products of a lifestyle obsession."" The characters portrayed here are so different because one of them is free, while the other is not. Tyler, in a nihilistic way, helps the narrator realize that his existence is meaningless enough - something that is clearly displayed in the capitalist world - that all they can do is giving up everything. The self-destruction promoted by the Fight Club is ironically what allows the narrator - as well as many other frustrated men - to find solace in their mundane life. Little by little the narrator is stripping himself off his previous beliefs about job, about behavior and the value of things. It's interesting to note that the narrator doesn't quit his job immediately, picturing how hard it is actually to cut ties with the system - he eventually does though.Many subtopics are discussed through the movie. We see the narrator and Tyler, now living together, talking about many things. They talk about how both had an absent father, how both lacked a sense of direction in life at some point and were told to follow the common sense - ""He says, 'get a job'. So, I'm 25, I call again and say, 'now what?' He says, 'I dunno. Get married"". The nature of the system we live in tells us what to do since the moment we're born, while both of them agree on that, they also agree that this is all a great waste of time. It's important to notice though that both them had no significant connections with other people, especially with women as Tyler comments - ""We're a generation of men raised by women. I'm wondering if another woman is really the answer we need"".As the club grows the movie delves even deeper in those reflections about what really matters in life - ""Advertising has us chasing cars and clothes, working jobs we hate so we can buy s**t we don't need"". Tyler becomes the source of inspiration for everyone who attends to the fight club; everyone is much more like the narrator, but they're striving to be more like him. At some point, Tyler decides that the club is meant to be something bigger - what he would call Project Mayhem. While the original Fight Club was something kept like a secret idealized to give some sort of freedom, through self-destruction, to its members, Project Mayhem is about declaring a fight against the system. The frustrated collective consciousness was the straw that broke the camel's back - ""We've all been raised on television to believe that one day we'd all be millionaires, and movie gods, and rock stars. But we won't. And we're slowly learning that fact. And we're very, very pi**ed off"". However, the narrator starts to slowly go against what Tyler was meaning to do - kinda of recalling a bit of his past self and a sort of respect for the authority of society - and when this happen it's the moment the movie reaches its climax.The genius of the movie is displayed when we discover that Tyler Durden and the narrator are the same person, they have always been the same person. Due to his declining mental health and his rather meaningless life, he created an alter-ego - someone capable of manifesting everything he wasn't as a system abiding person. The contrast created by Tyler's different personalities is amazing to watch as the truth unfolds; and the ambivalence created when we discover the truth about Tyler Durden is even more marvelous. This movie portraits very well how a person can reach the extremes of their mind in a system that overlooks the relevance of your very existence - when you become just a number, just a braindead member of society, having your hopes and wishes constantly ignored. In the end Tyler recovers his sanity only to see that his actions can't be reverted - so he only stands by and watches. The final scene is beautiful; what could be bettar than watching the system crumbling before your eyes while ""Where is my Mind"" plays? This movie is a masterpiece and it is so entrancing because of how real it is - in the end the movie shows many things we know and think but tend to keep hidden. It is provocative, funny and thrilling and most importantly: It is so damn real. The plot aged perfectly and I don't think it is going to get old so soon - this movie is a must watch.",Fight Club
1077,spotatoes,Classic? Are You Sure?,7,28 November 2017,"David Fincher is a great director, Alex McDowell is a truly innovative production designer and Chuck Palahniuk is a good writer, so, when the two came together, we knew that there was no way that the product of their collaboration would be bad. In fact, it seems most people are of the opinion that it is very nearly a work of genius, and, while it's true that, in places, Fight Club does occupy that territory, it's not genius in its entirety. Let me explain. Fight Club starts off well as a well- observed satire on masculinity and machismo, but, then, in its last third, for some strange reason, any sense of humour is abandoned and the film starts to advocate what it was taking a swipe at. This change of tone and unevenness is unfortunately too distracting for me and, consequently, I'm afraid I can't see Fight Club as an absolute classic.",Fight Club

1080,darth-chico,Fincher is out of control.,1,4 October 2001,"David Fincher. I think his career might have been a tragedy if he actually made some good early films. He had alot of promise but is now sucked into the world of the fanboy where he reins as their god. This world is made up of angry youth, most of whom like computers, violence, and sex, though they are underexperienced with it in actuality. No more evident is this than in Fight Club. If you need proof read one of the hundred claims that this is the pinnacle of filmmaking. Since these people are cultish and do not listen to reasonable argument, I will waste so much time as to actually give the entire argument against this film, as I see it.I think Fincher actually had a message, however he has no control over his own abilities. I think using logic his film is about the value of the individual. This is extremely ironic, since his film has inspired homogenous worshipers. The first third of the film is a damnation of the working environment. The last third is, I'm guessing, supposed to be a damnation of the second third. The second third is the escape from the working class through a violent cult. This is only the most logical explanation, for me anyway. I think many people fail to see the last third as a damnation of the second third because Fincher creates it as such a paradise juxtaposed next to the working week. Fincher is too seduced by his own tricks that he can't convey his own message, and we as viewers are left with the remnants of a very negative film with no purpose for it's violent, destructive nature and no redeeming values at all. So maybe it isn't what the film is about. Most of it's fans would gladly join up with the cult and follow Tyler into chaos. The message of the film is really quite hollow. And the way it is done is just silly. 3/10",Fight Club
1081,booyatom,Great Films Club for Fight Club.,7,15 October 2006,"If we're all just ""polishing the brass on the titanic"", and everything is going down anyway, what's the point? You get up in the morning, you go to school, study and succeed with the hope of one day becoming a doctor, a lawyer or a whatever. But if we know as we do that humanity will cease to exist in the near future, what with global warming and all, why do we bother improving existence? Shouldn't we give in to the beast we all know exists inside man? For the little time we have left, isn't a better idea to destroy, fight and kill? Anarchy seems to be the best thing to abide by in these dark times. Of course, David Fincher's Fight Club doesn't advocate these ideas; it brings them up in order for us, the viewers, to think of reasons why they are wrong. With recourse to the everyman, Edward Norton's character, only known as the Narrator, Fight Club involves us in the film. We are the Narrator. We are the ones who need every piece of furniture in Ikea catalogues for our homes in order to feel whole. However, the everyman in the film happens to have a day only seen in the movies, but we still identify with him: His luggage is lost at the airport, his house blows up and all his possessions, even the furniture, are gone. As a direct result, he is no longer a person because his possessions have been destroyed.Now he meets a guy, Tyler Durden, who tells him he could be more than his possessions, he could be free of the superficial society which creates the needs he does not (""in the hunter-gatherer sense"") actually have. He could be, that is, if he hits his friend as hard as he can. Our Narrator does; he likes it. Soon enough, other young men begin to like it too. These young men are also tired of mindless work which consists of helping a society that just enslaves them more as they make it more powerful. What's the point? So they all listen to Tyler, a fervent leader of men who initiates a club in which, every night, these young men can pound on each other. As they experience real freedom through pain and domination, Tyler, the giver of this wonderful experience, hands out homework assignments. His minions happily execute.This is how anarchy begins: A fervent and relentless leader with the wrong idea. I will not divulge any more, because of the many surprises this film has near the end. Any film with these ideas can just as easily fail. Fight Club does not. It is masterfully wrapped in a package of light, sound and images by David Fincher. The film looks good and has the smarts to back it up. Proponents of classic films see modern day cinema as being all style and no substance. Scenes are cut too fast to even get a feel for them, a little gift, they say, from television. Well I say look at Fight Club. What we have isn't so bad. It makes us think as well as being entertained. Edward Norton gives us many performances in one: he is an insomniac who knows there's a void in his life but doesn't have the will power to fill it, preferring to merely go through the motions of a life headed nowhere. Then he becomes ""enlightened"", finds meaning. Then he discovers what his life really is... Brad Pitt is a charismatic leader able to subdue any lost soul. Helena Bonham-Carter has fun with her intermediary character. Great acting and great directing have always been essential to great films. So has being thought provoking, and you know what? For 7 years ever since its release, everyone has been talking about it. It hasn't stopped; even people who hate it love to talk about it. So should we just stop our productive lives? Boys, let's just pound each other because, hey, it's more productive then anything we're doing now. It liberates us, for a given time period, because short term desire satisfaction is more useful than anything else. Somebody please prove that wrong, because that's what the film wants us to do, and I'll be damned if Tyler Durden is right.",Fight Club

This is a movie that fails so remarkably, you almost have to be a genius to come up with such a failure.In the one excellent scene in this movie, Edward Norton, flying on a plane from one of his constant business trips cracks a joke to his neighbour, Brad Pitt (aka Tyler Durden, here).

Thing is, I usually lose my enthusiasm for a film the second time I watch it, cos its all still fresh in my memory, but this wasn't the case at all with Fight Club. The three leads are in my opinion three of the finest film actors on earth, and the director is right up there with two other Davids - Cronenberg and Lynch - as one of the best directors in history, and I can say that confidently after just seeing Se7en, Fight Club and The Game, all of which are brilliant psychological pieces.

1086,vdecaire,Mischief. Mayhem. Soap.,7,26 March 2008,"Following David Fincher's masterpiece ""Seven"", he collaborated with Brad Pitt again to make an adaptation of Chuch Palahiunk's novel ""Fight Club"". The screenplay by Jim Uhls has much to be desired, however what is there is a major exercise in black comedy and sheer anti-social examples of what is making our society as diverse as possible. Some people could agree with the 'Charles Manson' of modern day society (Tyler Durden-Pitt) and say that our world is turning in a direction of which we cannot follow, and that if we cannot find reason to be different or not cater to the white-collars, then we need to pummel each other to take out bottled up anger that is created during a day in our little cubicles, suffocating in the depths of paperwork prescribed by our bosses and many other reasons to punch holes through our cheeks. Edward Norton is the lead, and does the average Joe justice as the insomniac looking for a way to escape from the day to day life that our environment is nurtering. And, after going to self-help groups for men and woman who have cancer, he meets a mysterious woman who could threaten his relief, a woman who he believes has no such cancer. On a plane a short period after, he meets the man who took control of his demeanor and the very way he talked, thinked and judged society. After a nice talk about air travel, they part ways. When Norton's character returns to his condominium (his sanctuary, the place where he devoted his life, money and time, into the decor and very atmosphere where he could live) only to find it blown to pieces by a gas leak. He calls Tyler. They meet, have a beer and talk about the devastation. They walk outside and agree for Norton to stay at Pitt's house on Paper Street. Tyler Durden requests one favor before he can stay with him: he wants Norton to hit him as hard as he can. The way that Norton's character could only feel good in the arms of someone who is truly in pain, made me wonder. When Durden said ""We are all raised to think we will grow up to be rich and famous movie stars,"" that made me think. But when the two started fighting, the plot took a turn for the worst. Now, the story then goes from a club for men attempting fiendishly to channel the aggression they could not before, turns into a movie about vandalism and bleak terrorizer to our society. The first few words in the book is Tyler saying, ""the first step to eternal life is you have to die"". The last words are God whispering ""we need to break up civilization so we can make something better of the world."" Whether or not this is really the case, the thought-provoking sub-text has ample humor, and eventually the story just makes you stop an think, ""is that true? Or have I just gotten used to not thinking about the meaning of things?"" Raw. Scathing. Satirical and hot. Funny.",Fight Club
1087,MovieNewsAndUpdates,One of the best of 90's,10,11 November 2012,"I am really in love with the decade of 90's which gave us such unforgettable masterpieces like Pulp Fiction, matrix, Usual suspects, American History X and many more. But this is definitely the stand out film amongst the many mentioned above.With Impeccable duologue's, amazing performances from all the three central characters, exceptional direction, unforgettable story, the only thing i feel that went wrong with the movie was the title(according to me). Because like few others i started off watching this film expecting it to be an action thriller but i ended up watching a mind boggling art.I had seen a few movies of David Fincher like Seven and Panic Room and frankly, it was not enough for me to become an avid follower of his movies. But since Fight Club he has become one of my favorite director and i have enjoyed his movies and to a certain extent interpreted his way of story telling.Fight Club opens up with a very unique way of story telling with Ed Norton as the Narrator of the film and Brad Pitt as Tyler Durden. As the movie progresses and the audiences begin to believe that it is not just about a fight club but there is much more to the story as it becomes equally confusing as to what exactly the movie is referring to, Is it about fight club or is it about the characters in the film. But above the story and characters it is definitely David Fincher who deserves the major lot of the credit for directing such an engaging story. Fight Club at times can be disturbing but it keeps you stuck to your seats for entire 140 minutes.It was extremely surprising to note that the movie got nominated for best effects and sound effects editing and not for best film, or director or any actor.

1088,jnunes-1,Vastly overrated film,4,16 August 2006,"This movie is so dreary and pretentious it's difficult to sit through, at least for me. Spoiler: I can see that a character could convince himself that he's someone else or that a fictional character could exist in his mind. I find it completely implausible that all the people around him would be fascinated and inspired by his delusion while watching him beat himself up in a parking lot, or that he would be able to inspire these same people to help him cover up his own fictional character's non-existence, and that they would go out and blow up buildings for him. The screenplay asks you to believe this. A friend of mine compared this film to Memento which has a similar belief by the main character, but his self-made reality isn't encouraged by anyone else except in cases where they can exploit him.

One could read the book or watch the movie and still come away with the same twisted sense of confusion that the story about the meaninglessness of life provides. But Fight Club the movie is exemplary of how to use film to enhance story telling, as opposed to simply making a story more appealing to the masses. (Which is the downfall of so many works literature turned to movies) The film makes the viewer aware of only what the man character (played by Edward Norton) is aware of. We see the same illusion's that his insomnia induces. Our perception of reality is comparably distorted.

After meeting a man named Tyler Durden (Brad Pitt) on a business trip, the two men form an underground fight club which is much more than it seems. 'Fight Club' is directed by David Fincher, best known for his works on 'Fight Club' and 'Se7en'. 'Fight Club' stars Edward Norton and Brad Pitt. This is by far Pitt and Norton's best performances of their careers. Each and every scene both actors are flawless and have a very demanding screen presence. You can really feel the power and intensity delivered with each line both Pitt and Norton speak. One of the best cinematic duos of all time.I really need to applaud writer, Jim Uhls on the screenplay. The screenplay is absolutely perfect. Each and every line is so powerful and poetic. As stated before, Pitt and Norton deliver each and every line perfectly and so powerfully. There is no way you could possible see anyone but Pitt and Norton in their roles, because the writing is done so well and they deliver such powerful performances.The cinematography in this film is very well done. The score in this film is done pretty good as well. Costume design was nothing special, but it served its purpose. The editing is done very well in this film. One of the best aspects of this film is the effects. The makeup effects in this film are so realistic and great . This is definitely Fincher's best film of his career, he did a near perfect job directing it.'Fight Club' was surprisingly only nominated for one Academy Award and this nomination being for best effects and sound editing. Sound editing in this film is done perfectly and well as the sound effects. You can really almost feel each punch being delivered. It is truly a disappointment that 'Fight Club' was only nominated for one Academy Award. This could have easily been a best picture contender and Norton with Pitt could have definitely been front runners for best and supporting actor.'Fight Club; is an action-packed film that delivers great punches as well as amazing shockers.

I was expecting a lot considering its 8.8/10 rating on IMDb.Unfortunately I did not enjoy it. Im going to agree with Roger Ebert on this film and say it was trying to be like Seven or Usual Suspects with its dramatic twist, which I unfortunately guessed half way through (it wasn't hard) which took some of the film away from me.Also it had this feel to it like a poor mans film. A film for thick people. I can see massive jock idiots coming from that film saying ""I LOVED THE BIT WHERE HE HIT HIM WITH HIS FIST DURRRRRR"" ""OH YER MAN AND THE TWIST DUDE, WE ARE SO INTULEKTUCAL WATCHING THAT FILM"" (not to say if you like this film your an idiot) The violence is almost pornographic like the saw films are with the horror and the ""meaning"" of the film seems to be violence will help solve the world.Though it has its bad points it has some good. the acting isn't bad and some of the cinematography is excellent, especially in the first half.Also the first part of the film with the narrative and the flip in order of the storyline is good.

I was amazed by how David Fincher was able to capture me with these peoples thoughts and feelings. I loved how Tyler was such a different character but he was actually just like all of us in a way. This is by far Finchers best work but I hope to see even better from him in the future because he is the master at spinning our minds with confusion. Just like in Se7en he will capture you and make you feel as if you are one of the characters because of the depth of this movie.Before I rented this movie I thought it was going to be a bunch of guys beating the crap out of each other until one of them ended up in the hospital. But as soon as I saw it I knew it was much more than just that, of course it contained some brutal fight scenes but it had a sense of depth to it, there was much more going on than what you expected, David Fincher, the man behind such films as the disturbing classic""Se7en"" and the quirky and unusual ""The Game"" and other titles such as ""Panic Room"" and ""Alien 3"". In this movie Fincher again he tells us how each character acts within the first scene we see them in, but they change and adapt to what has been brought upon them and it can either lead to good or bad. Even though Fincher was not the writer of this movie he did write a lot of new stuff for this movie and actually made entirely new scenes to go in with the movie.I own all of Finchers movies I the Special Edition version, except for ""The Game"" but I don't think they one for it yet. My favorite of all of his movies is ""Fight Club"" but the special features are kind of bad, now ""Se7en"" has good features, but I would still buy the special ""Fight Club"" because it is a collectors item and its worth owning.10/10",Fight Club
1096,talexander12599,"Dark, Violent and... Hilarious?",9,5 October 2015,"Fight Club is drama/thriller from 1999. It is directed by David Fincher (Se7en, Gone Girl, The Social Network) and was written by Jim Uhls (Jumper) who adapted it from the Chuck Palinuk (Choke, Romance) novel of the same name. It star Edward Norton (American History X, The Illusionist, The Incredible Hulk), Brad Pitt (Inglorious Bastards, World War Z, The Curious Case of Benjamin Button) and Helena Bonham Carter (The Kings Speech, Sweeny Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street, Alice in Wonderland).Fight Club is about an insomniac (Edward Norton) who starts a fight club with his eccentric friend, Tyler (Brad Pitt). Tyler begins to take the club in a different direction, but all of this is threatened by Marla (Helena Bonham Carter) who has the same problem as Edward Norton.David Fincher's incredible directing cannot go unnoticed. This film is one of those that is perfectly directed. His style is all over it and the darkness and comedy are shown perfectly on screen. His perfect precision and style are evident in this film. It is technically perfect in every way which is also thankful to its cinematographer Jeff Cronenweth (Gone Girl, The Social Network, The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo) and editor: James Haygood (Tron: Legacy, The Game, Panic Room).Another great aspect of this movie is it's writing by Jim Uhls. Now, I haven't read the book Fight Club by Chuck Palinuk but his contribution can't be unnoticed. The plot of this movie is very clever and smart but it is adapted finely by Uhls. He constantly spews out famous line after famous line that this movie is known for. He balances the seriousness and the comedy very well.I have little complaints about Fight Club, perhaps takes itself too seriously when trying to convey a message, almost as if it thinks it is something more when it really isn't. While the message is good, it is impossible to do for most but a step towards it just might be enough.

1097,mik_mik_90,The first rule of fight club is you don't talk about fight club.,10,11 August 2014,"Fight Club earns itself as one of my all-time favorite movies. I don't know where to start but I guess the reason why I love this movie is that I know how a routine could be lethal in your life. For me this movie is beyond entertainment, it's more of a wake up call. Consumerism, Narcissism and having the wrong concept of success; we as human beings craves so much of these that we forget what's the true meaning of life or what it felt to be truly alive or so they say. We became prisoners of these ideas that the only reason we work is just to buy something that we thought would make us happy and in process it's sucking out our life of us.Sometimes I guess we all need a Tyler Durden; of not giving a damn about those propaganda's that the society dictates us to be or says we needed. However,we are still living in a civilized world so it is best to keep your Tyler Durden on leash. We don't want anybody to end up in jail now, do we? and for what's its worth, I think that Fight Club shows us that sometimes our own true enemy is ourselves, it is just a matter of to be or not to be. Moving on, I am also a fan of Edward Norton and Helena Bonham-Carter and I think they're great actors, actually I've been hunting lately their movies to watch.

1099,SandyAren,Classic as it is,10,15 May 2018,"I view movies differently after seeing this movie, because it broke down doors. Then there's the tiny issue of the story of Fight Club, penned by Chuck Palahniuk the story is nothing short of incredible, a pure shock-value social commentary on the state of the world at the end of the century. ""Fight Club"" an aggressive, confrontational, often brutal satire that is quite possibly a brilliant masterpiece. Taking the ""Choose life,"" anti-consumerism rant at the beginning of ""Trainspotting,"" and carrying it to its logical -- albeit extreme -- conclusion this is a big budget, mainstream film that takes a lot of risks by biting the hand that feeds it. ""Fight Club"" is a $50+ million studio film that remains true to its anti-consumer, anti-society, anti-everything message -- right up to the last, sneaky subliminal frame. What makes ""Fight Club"" a subversive delight is not only its refreshing anti-corporate message but how it delivers said message. As Fincher has explained in interviews, you don't really watch the film but rather download it. Its structure is extremely playful as it messes around with linear time to an incredible degree. The narrative bounces back and forth all over the place like a novel, or surfing on the Internet -- even making a hilarious dead stop to draw attention to itself in a funny, interesting way that completely works. The film is a cinematic punch to the head as it challenges the status quo and offers a wakeup call to people immersed in a materialistic world where those who have the most stuff, ""win."" I think that Fincher's film wants us to tear all that down, reject corporate monsters like Starbucks and Blockbuster, and try to figure out what we really want out of life. It's almost as if the film is suggesting salvation through self-destruction. And it is these thought-provoking ideas that makes ""Fight Club"" a dangerously brilliant film that entertains as well as enlightens.10/10",Fight Club

1101,hellocrocodile,One kind of comformity in favor of another,3,1 June 2018,"Like a bro comedy, with less comedy and more bro, bro!I had this film recommended to me (and quoted) so many times, that I'd begun to think it really must contain some life changing pearls of wisdom. I eventually decided to watch it. Well at least forty minutes or so of it.The beginning was very intriguing actually. The cynical observations of the protagonist, regarding himself and the cookie cutter life others like him so often fall into, were an intelligent critique of consumerism and materism, if not stale already by now. Perhaps it was more novel at the time the film was released. David Fincher's directorial style probably had something to do with how it felt like it was going to be a ""cool"" movie. The fact that Brad Pitt was in it promised the same. I started to fall for it, yet things turned downwards not long after Brad Pitt's character was introduced.I felt like I'd been swindled. I feel like people who like this movie have been swindled, like someone snapped their fingers and strobed some lights and said, ""You will now appreciate the following film"". Or maybe ...the things I dislike about the movie are exactly what people like about it. I don't know. It seemed like a joke to me how the movie poses as cerebral and intellectual in the first ""act"" so to speak but then gravitates towards gratuitous testosterone cult indoctrination that can be found in any other random action flick. Except this one has Brad Pitt, oooh, star power! And Brad Pitt's character is no philanthropist. He charms his way into the protagonists life and begins to influence him, acts like he possesses the Tao of life, after revealing to him that some of his antisocial hobbies are: inserting pornographic material in the reels of (non R rated) films while working as a movie projector (scene of little girl's crying reaction to giant cock in movie theater is supposed to be humorous), and urinating/spitting/ejaculating into strangers' food while working in the kitchen of an upscale restaurant. Stuff we should all look up to, for sure. I really hope people watching this don't actually think Brad Pitt's character is someone who they'd like to be, but no doubt, many probably do, because the film makes him into almost a patriarchal, however rebellious, figure. Though it's not a true rebellion, because the world is full of tough guys and cowboys and punks who just don't give a fuck, there is absolutely nothing new about it.So, after criticizing the conformity of men who adopt a life of working in suits and acquiring fancy stuff that advertisements insist they need, the prescription is a new kind of conformity - the old fashion macho male stereotype kind. In other words, don't be a workaholic, don't care about wealth or belongings, care about brute physical strength and drawing some blood! Grrrr, yeah! That's what life is all about! The protoganist forgoes the group therapy he was addicted to previously, in favor of a new group, and a new kind of therapy: he is so desperate to be able to feel something that he needs to get punched in the face, apparently. Sounds like somebody has issues. Good luck with that. I could not bare to sit through the entire thing. It's a pseudo-intellectual, gender-stereotypical, chest-beating outting aimed at an audience of young men who need something a little more than UFC - overanalyzing the mildly philosophical moments so they can pretend they weren't just under hypnosis from the adrenaline rush they get watching fight scenes. After all, it's named fight club, not think club.",Fight Club

1103,Metamorf,Social Satire at it's head-bludgeoning best.,10,17 November 1999,"After a rocky start with his feature debut in 'Alien 3', David Fincher is proving to be a real talent in movieland.  With 'Seven', he showed his seemingly sudden mastery of the crime thriller.  he may have taken a small step backward with 'The Game', but with this one, he has taken a huge leap forward.Satire usually takes one of two forms, humorous (parody) or serious.  This is BOTH.  Edward Norton and Brad Pitt give very fine performances as men disenchanted with the world which has been fashioned for themselves, prompting them to go about turning it on it's ear.Fincher also gives us some wildly kinetic camera moves and EXTREMELY CLOSE close-ups that are a feast for the eyes.There's a great plot twist at the start of the third act that came as a complete surprise to me as did the one in 'The Sixth Sense'.  Now I'm gonna have to see the film again to look for all the clues that led up to it.Two fists up -- 10/10",Fight Club
1104,Homer-43,"You are not your job, you are not the contents of your wallet!",10,30 June 2000,"Once again, after 'American History X', Edward Norton did the movie that's my favorite of the year. But this time, with 'Fight Club', he made my all-time favorite. I've never seen a movie like this before. I think that it was even a bit better than 'American Beauty', and I can't believe that 'Fight Club' wasn't even nominated for Best Movie, Best Director, Best Actor and Best Screenplay. Even Brad Pitt was good enough to get an Oscar nomination. Did they just forget this movie? The plot is perfect, as is the direction, this movie has a statement that's close to 'American Beauty', but 'Fight Club' drives it to the extreme. Do what you like and even if haven't got much money, is a large TV really worth a job you don't like? This is one of the few movies that are really worth 10 out of 10",Fight Club

1106,dr. gonzo,a dangerously brilliant film that entertains as well as enlightens.,10,10 May 2000,"""Fight Club"" an aggressive, confrontational, often brutal satire that is quite possibly a brilliant masterpiece. Taking the ""Choose life,"" anti-consumerism rant at the beginning of ""Trainspotting,"" and carrying it to its logical -- albeit extreme -- conclusion this is a big budget, mainstream film that takes a lot of risks by biting the hand that feeds it. The film's narrator (Edward Norton) is an insignificant cog in the drab, corporate machine, dutifully doing his job and what he's told without question. He's an insomniac slave to his IKEA possessions and only finds joy in going to as many self-help/dealing with terminal diseases sessions as he can. It provides him with an escape from his sleepless nights. That is, until Marla Singer (Helena Bonham Carter), a trashy chain-smoking poser, enters his life and upsets his routine. The narrator also meets Tyler Durden (Brad Pitt), a charismatic soap salesman whose straightforward honesty, candor and sleazy lounge-lizard outfits are a breath of fresh air. One night, after the two men have bonded over beers, Tyler asks the narrator to hit him. At first, it seems like an absurd request but after they pound on each other for a bit, a strange feeling overcomes them. They feel a kind of release and satisfaction at inflicting pain on one another. In a world where people are desensitized to everything around them, the physical contact of fighting wakes them up and makes them feel truly alive. Others soon join in and pretty soon Fight Club becomes an underground sensation. However, it becomes readily apparent that Tyler has more elaborate plans than just organizing brawls at the local bar. David Fincher has taken the dark, pessimistic worldview of ""Seven"" and married it with the clever plot twists and turns of ""The Game"" and assembled his strongest effort to date. ""Fight Club"" is a $50+ million studio film that remains true to its anti-consumer, anti-society, anti-everything message -- right up to the last, sneaky subliminal frame. What makes ""Fight Club"" a subversive delight is not only its refreshing anti-corporate message but how it delivers said message. As Fincher has explained in interviews, you don't really watch the film but rather download it. Its structure is extremely playful as it messes around with linear time to an incredible degree. The narrative bounces back and forth all over the place like a novel, or surfing on the Internet -- even making a hilarious dead stop to draw attention to itself in a funny, interesting way that completely works. Yet Norton's deadpanned narration holds everything together and allows the viewer to get a handle on what's happening. This is the way films should be made. Why must we always have to go through the A+B+C formula? ""Fight Club"" openly rejects this tired, clearly outdated structure in favour of a stylized frenzy of jump cuts, freeze frames, slow motion and every other film technique in the book that only reinforces its anarchistic message. A film like this would have never been greenlighted by a major studio if Brad Pitt had not been attached to the project. Once you see the film, it becomes obvious that he was the only choice for Tyler Durden. Like he did with ""Kalifornia"" and ""Twelve Monkeys"", Pitt grunges himself down and disappears completely into his role to a frighteningly convincing degree. During many of the brutal fight scenes, he is transformed into a bloody, pulpy mess that'll surely have the ""Legends of the Fall"" fans running for the exits. It is an incredible performance -- probably his best -- for the simple fact that he becomes the character so completely. If Pitt has the flashy, gonzo role, Edward Norton is his perfect foil as the seemingly meek yet sardonic narrator. It's a deceptively understated performance as the last third of the film reveals but Norton nails it perfectly. He is clearly our surrogate, our introduction into this strange world and his wry observations on our consumer-obsessed culture are right on the money. They are the perfect setup for Tyler's introduction and his view on the world which is clearly a call to arms of sorts, a manifesto that rejects the notion that we are what we own. And ultimately, that is what ""Fight Club"" tries to do. The film is a cinematic punch to the head as it challenges the status quo and offers a wakeup call to people immersed in a materialistic world where those who have the most stuff, ""win."" I think that Fincher's film wants us to tear all that down, reject corporate monsters like Starbucks and Blockbuster, and try to figure out what we really want out of life.

If you were raised on a steady diet of MTV and cable TV, you'll love the dark images and wild editing.  I'm buying the DVD just to watch it all over again, it looks that good.But the story is what got me.  The plot twist towards the end woke me up and had me freaked out.

Sure, it's a little... different... from ""You Gots Mail"", but at it's heart it's just a simple, funny, quirky little love story. See, it's all about this guy - young guy, thirty or so - and all he wants to do is hang out with his guy pals and never grow up. All along, he's completely denying himself of the one thing he truly needs to get his life on track - the love of a good woman. Guys, I know you'll relate, and gals, I'm sure you've known a fella or two like this. It's an old, old story, but somehow David Fincher and crew seem to breathe new life into it.

From the very beginning we are drawn in by the voice of fed-up-edness (Jack's), who is a voice we may claim to be our own.There are so many ideas/issues brought up in the story, however, that will keep me thinking about it for a while.  'What does being a man mean?' and 'what does it mean in the context of our consumerist society?'  And 'should we (the audience) trust the voice when it comes from a huge money-making machine, known as the film industry?'  It seems a little crazy to cheer on the voice when it is denouncing it's own source.Aside from these ideas, the film is well done--and you will find, upon reflection, that the violence is justified by the story.  The story will stay with you long after the credits have finished rolling.",Fight Club
1111,Master_Yoda,"Seat back, Enjoy the show and exit grown up from the Theater",10,29 November 1999,"Well the first thing I wanted to do after seeing Fight Club for the first was to see it all over again. Cause this movie is simply brillant. It has everything from violence to humour. I wasn't expect to laugh at all before to see it. The trailer is not really good cause it shows all the violent scene and give you a bad general idea of the atmosphere of the movie. But it's impossible to gave you an idea of what the movie is in two minutes. As it's almost impossible to resumate the movie. Anyway I had a lots of good laugh. But the general humour and mood of the movie is kinda cynical and dark. It's also a great cristism of today American Society and American Way to Live. Since I can't resume this movie I just can tell you that you'll feel like smarter after seen this movie and you'll maybe stop buying Smart Mop after seeing it on Infomertials. It might open your eyes too about your way of life and change for ever you vision of the U.S.A . Some might find it all fucked up. But I think it's one of the ten best movie ever made. The only thing I have to tell you is ""Go see it twice for fully understand everything in this movie"" (4 or 5 times would be mendatory for low IQs =) Thanks David Fincher for this brillant movie And aslo thx to every actors (and of course Actresses) for their wonderfull performences !",Fight Club
1112,trudy.keenan,Wow,10,17 July 2000,"This movie just blew me away.  I was not really sure of what the movie was about and whether it would appeal to me.  However, after reading comments from other IMDB users I watched it and what an impressive film!  There are some movies you can watch and quickly forget, but others stay with you for days afterwards and this movie is one of those.  Edward Norton's character, disillusioned with life and suffering from insomnia, becomes addicted to self support groups after he attends one and finding himself able to cry, in turn is able to sleep.  He meets up with another addicted ""tourist"", Marla, played by Helena Bonham Carter, who with this role should quash all ideas that she can only play period dramas. It would appear instant dislike between these two as they are such opposing people.  However, he then has an encounter with Tyler Burden who takes him on a spiral downwards into another whole world.  With a surprising twist at the end, this film is certainly a roller coaster ride of emotions and ""sucks"" you into the whole phenonomen of how one person can influence and have a Svengali effect on groups of people.In my opinion Edward Norton should have got an Oscar for this movie, along with the screenwriter!  A very interesting twist on what can happen to a person when they start disbelieving in life and the ""must have"" dream.",Fight Club
1113,ratpac03,Incredible,10,8 June 2001,"I had actually rented this movie without any real idea as to what it was about. Like many people, I had seen the ads and heard reviews which focused 100% on the violence in the movie, and had assumed that it was a shallow romp about guys beating each other senseless. I was quite wrong.To give an incredibly short summary: Nameless narrator (Norton) suffers from insomnia and an incredibly bland life with no meaning behind it. He goes to support groups for ailments he doesn't have and is okay, but after a woman shows up who is also faking he can no longer go. He meets up with Tyler Durden (Pitt) and they create Fight Club, gaining an extraordinary amount of members, and from there things continue to get more bizarre.Now that doesn't tell nearly anything about the movie, simply an idea of what happens. It is easily the most cerebral movie I have ever seen (possibly tied with Being John Malkovich), and once it starts you can't stop watching. Every aspect of the movie is 100% original and you will find yourself watching it numerous times, because you cannot possibly catch everything the first time through.",Fight Club
1114,ratpac03,"Underrated, one of the best films ever made.",10,16 June 2004,"Yes, I did mean that. And yes, I have seen a LOT of movies.One of the quick complaints to dispel is that it's a ""complain-fest"" as one reviewer-said. No, this is NOT a movie about the middle class white man being held down. It's a movie about responsibility, cause-and-effect, and what happens when you do nothing with your life and just let yourself slide into a hole without even once scraping to get out.That said, as others have mentioned, very little can be said of this movie. The fight scenes are not like most movies, intended to be action sequences as a nice break between plot development, they're as much a part of the story as anything else. Ed Norton is our ""protagonist"" of sorts who finds his life miserable and eventually meets the one and only Tyler Durden.Fight Club, coincidentally enough, gained success much like the following inside the movie itself. The ads for it were terrible, making it look like a mindless action movie. Reviews seemed half-hearted. I didn't know many people who saw it in theaters. But after renting the DVD on a suggestion, I actually felt changed. VERY few movies can alter your perception of the world around you like this one can. By the time the credits were rolling, my heart was pumping furiously.Do not watch this movie unless you can sit down and watch it without interruption. It's not a party movie, nor one to watch with someone who has already seen it unless they stay silent. The beauty of this movie is the shock as the scenes go on. It's a tornado of a movie, where we get to watch the decay of a man. Each scene is more unraveled and chaotic than the one before it. Each shot is done perfectly, the filming style and the color is gorgeous (in its own sick way), the sound and music are a perfect match.

The great acting really made Tyler seem real and the mental break was so convincing, it was an amazing twist and it made sense and I loved how they foreshadowed the twist with frames at the start. I did get lost at some parts of the film but that is at no fault of the film itself!I couldn't find a certain meaning behind the film itself except perhaps the power that our mind has over us? How willpower and our need for something more, something better than the mundane, our usual life can drive us to the extremes. Tyler represented what he dreamed to be like however in the end, he realised that he was better the way he was, we want to break out of our boring day-life but maybe the message is that there is a reason for our day-to-day life? A balance is needed between the usual and the 'brave', too much of either can cause a person to break.I guess that's my take on the film, to explore the unexplored but make sure you stay tethered to reality, be more like Tyler but don't become Tyler.This film also had a great soundtrack!",Fight Club

Edward Norton who takes on the dual role of the narrator and main actor delivers another great performance that rivals his stylish take on American History X. However, the movie finds itself lost in its violence, lost in his constant desire to portray a sexual tension that you cannot connect with since all the characters don't seem to have the chemistry necessary, even it is just a strictly sexual one. Brad Pitt lands another very respectable role, but I'm left again with a bitter taste in my mouth wanting a little more out of his performance. The movie is still very stylish and original, a decent adaptation from the book. The ending is what people talk the most about, so I'm not gonna be the only one NOT to comment on it. I agree with the majority of you who think the twist is surprising and at the same time climatic, but, is it a good surprise? I don't think so. To me, it almost seemed forced, I do know it follows a book, but is still inconsistent with the rest of the movie. Fight Club does keep you interested throughout and also keeps you guessing what will happen next, which makes it an above average attempt but not in the slightest a great accomplishment.",Fight Club

1125,wrsgold,"A stunning, but intellectually flawed film",8,26 July 2002,"The most telling exposition is Pitt's line that we are "". . .two generations of men raised (sic) by women."" This is a notion that one would expect that pudgy, wussie ""moma's boy"" Roger Ebert to fail to get. And Lord, does he fail to get it! (The review is available on the imdb) The notion that the problem is only two generations old is way off base, however. This started when boys ceased to be taught the arts of hunting and war, about the time farming became the mainstay of our economy. However, it became its most insidious when men left home to work and left their sons in the tender, tearful care of their mothers. En fin, the film is saying that we are taught that the world revolves around women and the business/government cabal . . . and that nothing else matters.The film's positions are that: 1. We don't know who we are because we are wired one way (aggressive, testosterone stuff) and taught another way (tender ""no fighting"", conniving manipulation, pretend to love each other stuff). I agree2. This was brought about by the business/government infrastructure who support the structure because it makes it less likely that they will be challanged. I disagree, though, by removing men from the rearing of their sons it has made a bad situation worse. At the very least it has certainly heightened the internal conflict in men. I do agree that business/government are happy with the status quo, for this and other reasons they scarcely understand.3. That the need for this kind of physical outlet for men is so serious that virtual ""violence drones"" can be created. I agree, anyone check the growing membership of right and left-wing militias recently?4. That the solution is the destruction of the economic infrastructure. Brad. . . as much as I like you as an actor, you wouldn't last 5 days in the environment this movie would create.The solution is far more complex and relies on our ability to find a way that will allow boys to be reared as men rather than women in drag (or men who are old well before their time).For provoking these thoughts, and for getting the (always hilarious) wussie response from Ebert and for being well filmed and acted the film is highly recommended.Oh, one more thing. Ebert is also wrong about the injuries incurred in fight club. Bare knuckle fights went on for 50 rounds or more, some one had to be knocked out. And until fighters donned gloves to protect the squeemish from the sight of blood, no one died from a brain injury (a little known fact that was a favourite of James Cagney's and which he would drop whenever people started talking about). There were far fewer broken bones than one would expect, noses and fingers being the most common.",Fight Club

But because of this slightly better than average movie? Wow.Pitt is over the top. He's good but he is a good actor and it's expected. I typically like Norton but he does nothing for me in this picture. The twist at the end is unique but you find yourself asking a lot of questions that can't really be answered realistically about situations that happened previously. So the twist doesn't wash for me.Before that I found the movie rather dull. Yeah, a bunch of guys start a club where they fight and the actions of the club and club um, owner/managers, get progressively more extreme.It's not a terrible movie but it's not in the top 1000 movies of all time either. It's a solid 6 to 7 stars. Maybe 8 if you really like Pitt, Norton, or Helen Bonham Carter. Though she was not particularly noteworthy here either.The movie is well done. Shot nicely. Lighting and general cinematography is why I rated it so high. It's stylish and very effective in that area. But the overall plot, while unique, seems a bit too out there for me.

1127,cake-26,stupid trying to act clever,6,20 March 2009,"I am not impressed by demonstrations of machismo and male aggression or the idea of fighting in general. The excuse for all of the violence is that it's supposed to lead to philosophical enlightenment about existential reality and the nature of self or something, which does interest me, but I don't think this was really developed. Neither am I impressed by this type of storytelling, that deliberately misleads the audience into believing something which turns out not to be true and then fooling you into thinking it's clever when this is revealed. I'm not fooled but I know a lot of people are. I don't know if this was the movie that caused this irritating format to be repeated so many times. The actors are good, but just trying to act cool all the time isn't difficult. most of the people who like this movie probably do that all the time. I don't even fancy Helena Bonham Carter so there wasn't much in it for me except the whole wretched existence vibe which was OK.",Fight Club
1128,kghosh13,2 Hours and 19 Minutes of MAGIC!,10,22 October 2018,"The movie did not do well in the box office. I was gifted a copy of the film and I did not watch it for almost a year as I had not even heard about the name way back in 2003. Then I watched it one day. Then I watched it again the same day. And then I watched it multiple times thereafter. This is not a film, this is a gift for every movie lover.
I had not read the book and I have still not read the book. But if the book was half as good as the movie then the book should be one of the best sellers. This is a psychological thriller, the best yet. Carefully crafted by a superb David Fincher this is a film way way ahead of its time. The film captures your senses from the very beginning with a script that is second to none. Brilliant casting and extremely well acted by both Edward Norton and Brad Pitt and a solid performance by Helena B Carter.
This according to me is the best that Fincher has ever made, the kind of film that grows on you. The unique style of storytelling, the slight movement of the camera to capture every movement of the characters, brilliant use of the computer generated graphics, marvelous cinematography and editing, this movie is 2 hours and 19 minutes of magic.

It was not easy.I know that if one is a movie watcher one should let go of the realistic. I get this lecture all the time when I say something from a movie is just not believable. ""It's a movie, it's not real."" But, for me when something in a movie doesn't make sense, it can be just as bad as a cell phone going off in the theater. I can't just let it go.Here is what bugs the dooty out of me.

I watched it with my best friend and actually fell asleep (not because I was bored, just tired). I woke up when my friend yelled out. I didn't know what he was yelling about, so he had me rewind it. I had missed the part where the Narrator figures out that he is Tyler Durden. I was so impressed that I went out and bought the book, and have since become a huge Chuch Palanhuik fan, and this isn't even his best book, and I think the movie is actually better than the book. But the movie was fantastic. Brad Pitt is incredible in this film, as he usually it. I honestly believe he deserved an Oscar for this role. He hilarious and frightening. Plus the movie never slows down. Fincher is a master (aside from Alien 3, but that was just a terrible script, and he knew it). The man really knows how to work a twist (The Game, Seven). This should have at least been nominated for best picture. Much better than The Social Network, and people praised it like it was the greatest thing ever. I wish someone would make Invisible Monsters into a film as good as this one. It is by far more superior to Fight Club. I love to read and it's the only book I have ever read in one sitting.

1132,hjpog,A complete classic.,10,16 July 2016,"First, for this great masterpiece, I would like to thank David Fincher. The film gives a great message on psychology. But the main purpose is to show what level shambles of today's youth. The film tackles the decline of today's youth in a very hard way. Consumer culture can be said to start with the Starbucks glasses we have seen in the film in many scenes. Consumption in the film can be one of the parts that best describes the society. The Narrator is happiest not in consumption, but in Tyler's punches. It is not a fight against the system, but in the film Fight Club is a rebellious aim. Everyone is alone in the consumer society. Officially something new comes out after today's young people run the thing themselves or dedicate themselves to always search for a leader, this problem offers in a great way the audience. Acting I can say enormous. Formally integrated the roles of the players. Already today, many people have come by Tyler Durden character of history is considered as the best anti-hero. Every part of the film is filled with great criticism about our day. Also great to send on to mention other films. One of the most important elements of the film I'd say the mystery. Indeed, for someone with no knowledge of the subject monitors and film for the first time in a very difficult prediction about the end of the film. Absolutely should for everyone to see, and even to do bedside film is a masterpiece..",Fight Club
1133,XIOMANGER,Movie that changed my life! All time no.1!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,10,26 October 2004,"From the moment the narrator slobbers on Bob's tits I just knew there was going to be something very special about this movie. This movie quite simply embodies everything that a movie is supposed to be. A 2h roller coaster ride of thoughts and emotions. It can quite rightly be regarded as the first movie of the 21st century. To put it simply: This movie is the most intense thing I have ever seen.The idea of the movie seems simple, and if you watch the commercials it will re soundly have the appearance of a conventional film. An ordinary and, more importantly, nameless guy (who narrates the entire film) meets a non-conformist and quite insane Tyler Durden. ""Now let me tell you something about Tyler"". He does night jobs. He works as a waiter at galla dinners and pees in the soup, subsequently suing the catering companies. He works as a projector and splices short, but definitely noticeable, porno clips into children's movies. Last but definitely not least, he scrounges the dumpsters at liposuction clinics for bags of fat, makes soap out of it, and ""sells [the rich ladies] their own fat asses back for a profit"". Out of this soap, he also makes explosives.After having his house blown away for at that point undetermined reasons, the narrator turns to Tyler for a place to stay, which turns out to be one of those wrecks even poverty-stricken squatters would stay away from and in the middle of nowhere. Little by little, Tyler lures the narrator into his ways and makes him question his entire reality. By defining himself through his job and what he buys, he has lost touch with his inner self and his true emotions of loneliness and helplessness. Tyler's solution is to stop trying to control things, to hold on to things one does not need, to be perfect. Tyler's answer is to ""let the chips fly"". To do things just for the heck of it, including experiencing pain. Only when one can loose everything one does not need is one free to go after what truly matters. The entire progression of just how far one can go is evident in the movie. Tyler first cajoles the narrator into having a fight with him with the following words: ""I've never been in a fight either. There is no one watching. Come on, how much can you truly know about yourself if you've never been into a fight"". This duking out turns out to be a pleasurable experience and becomes a regular event. Before you know it, other guys join the fray and the ultimate release in the form of senselessly beating another man and in turn being beaten is institutionalized in the form of ""Fight Club"", lead by Tyler and the narrator. Evidently this movie reeks of testosterone and raw, violent male energy and the movie is unapologetic in this respect to the very end. In some ways ""Fight Club"" is about rediscovering ones masculinity, a force quite vilified and suppressed in recent decades. Converts to ""Fight Club"" include former members of the ""Remaining Men Together"", a club of testicular cancer sufferers, mostly abandoned by their wives now having children with other men, who before ""Fight Club"" knew of nothing better than to cry on each others shoulders (literally) and pathetically embrace each other. Hilariously, one of the key characters and ex-members of this group, played by Meatloaf, is aptly equipped with huge titties. That ""Fight Club"" transforms everyone in it is evident, especially on the narrator, who is no longer content to tolerate the cr** one routinely gets served with in wage-slaving office jobs. He ultimately blackmails his boss into giving him ""a job never to tell anyone"" about the dirty dealings in the company. To seal the deal, the narrator starts ""fighting"" himself and is so violently battered by the time security arrives that his boss has no chance but to comply. In any case, the number of ""Fight Club"" members grows. And they all start listening to what Tyler has to say. Tyler's influence on this large band of people from all walks of life slowly grows and culminates in the so-called ""Project Mayhem"". Rather than being freed, they end up being made instruments of Tyler's will. The narrator is of course mostly kept out of the loop and must find out what is going on before its too late!And then something unexpected happens. And the REAL fun starts!Suffices to say that Fight Club packs more story and ideas than ten times what most movies do. The ideas truly resonated with me. The energy of the movie is at a fever pitch. The violence is gritty and its underlying purposelessness makes it that much more intense. Tyler's charm and charisma are awe-inspiring. Truly all the actors do a superb job.In terms of visually conveying all the ideas, Fight Club is unparalleled. Since the entire movie is narrated, we experience wild and sometimes outrageous cuts between different scenes and time frames. More so, we are treated with astounding visuals, close-ups, slow motion scenes, featuring in one case an explosion happening in slow motion. In line with the ""splicing of porno movies into children's films"", many interesting ""splices"" occur through out the movie itself. The effects are given a gritty 90s-00s feel. Yet they are there only to consistently prop up the story and elevate it to a new high. In short, in terms of visual innovation and effects this is probably the most innovative movie since Annie Hall. What can I say, this movie will undoubtedly be talked about for centuries to come and be the mark of a ""very strange time"" in the life of humanity.10/10SCALE:positive opinion of a movie: 10 MASTERPIECE, 9 Excellent, 8 Good, 7 OKneutral opinion of a movie: 6 Adequate, 5 Fair, 4 Mediocrenegative opinion of a movie: 3 Poor, 2 Bad, 1 HORRIBLE",Fight Club

The Virgin Suicides...And Fight Club.""And suddenly I realize that all of this, the gun, the bombs, the revolution, has got something to do with a girl named Marla Singer.""***SPOILER ALERT***So much has been talked about the rebellious aspects of the film. The fight clubs, the liposuction soap, the subliminal messages, the narrator's insanity, Bob's bitch tits.But I just want to slip on my horn rimmed glassed, pour a glass of scotch whiskey, and talk about something not everybody seems to like, but what makes this movie art, not just entertainment: The deeper meaning.Which, it seems, I gather, seems to say, the correct way to live is neither the soul-numbing safety of a consumer lifestyle, nor a reckless rejection-of-comfort-for-the-sake-of-feeling-alive Anarchy. At the end of the movie, the Narrator chooses his love for Marla over Durden, and decides on the middle road: enough recklessness to fall in love and fight back against the police when he has to, but not to the point of complete Anarchy, which would put Marla's life in danger.There's a famous quote that goes (I think) ""Anarchy is no place to raise a child."" Or maybe I just made it up. I don't know, at the moment I'm feeling rather unreliable. (narrator)The movie is structured like this: everything that happens on screen between the Narrator having a flashback spurred by the thought of Marla, and Marla Singer being dragged up to the top story of the corporate office building by members of Project Mayhem exists completely inside the Narrator's head. It is a blend of memory and imagination. According to literary/film precedence (The Catcher in The Rye, Lolita, Memento) a story can be distorted by the unreliable narrator as long as it is being told by the first person narrator, and not a 3rd person POV. The narrative aspect of the film is what makes the plot twist at the end acceptable to the audience. If the film was not a narrative, if it progressed in a 3rd person POV, it wouldn't have made any sense to show Brad Pitt's character. The narrative aspect also allow the film to move along much more quickly, which is necessary when there is so much material in the narrator's brain. The action of the film spans several years, and is really 3 mini-stories wrapped around the core thread of Marla Singer/The Narrator's love story:Act 1. SUPPORT GROUPS. The Narrator's life changes from an Insomniac/Recall Coordinator/Consumer to an anonymous member of support groups for the dying, until he meets the 'big tourist' Marla Singer.Act 2. FIGHT CLUB. The Narrator creates and imaginary friend (Tyler Durden) who he doesn't realize is imaginary, and then acts out Tyler's destructive impulses: he blows up his apartment, starts fight club, makes soap out of liposuction fat and sells it back to the people, splices single frames of pornography into family films, and has sex with Marla Singer. Act 3. PROJECT MAYHEM. The Narrator's imaginary friend takes the revolt against consumer culture to its polar opposite: Creates Project Mayhem out of Fight Club. Project Mayhem has the subversiveness of Fight Club on a massive scale: its aim is to return human beings to a primitive, earth-based existence through anarchy. The Narrator fears for Marla Singer's life, turns himself in to the police, and finally shoots himself in the face, effectively killing Tyler Durden. (For now.) All for Marla Singer.The narrator is forced to choose between love and destructive impulses, (between Tylar and Marla). He chooses Marla, effectively killing Tyler. The End.Yep. Sorry Guys.

1137,samuliff,Remarkable depiction of humanity.,10,4 May 2008,"Yes, Fight Club is controversial. It is also violent, gory and deliberately cheap.Furthermore, it is one of the most poignant depictions of materialism and human nature in film history.From start to finish, it is loaded with sarcastic remarks on today's society. There are so many visual hooks and catchy thrills that you won't get away with watching it just once.Essentially, Fight Club is a story about consumerism. The main character, brilliantly played by Edward Norton, is a victim of the society's requirement to make a lot of money and then spend it on furniture and other false delights. He cannot sleep and he doesn't have any real friends.Once his material fortune is destroyed by a fire, he has no choice but to turn to Tyler Durden, an alpha-male who lives in a dirty squat and makes soap for living. Tyler is the character Brad Pitt was born to play.Then there's Helena Bonham Carter as the tortured misfit who can't make her mind up on anything.And that's about everything that can ethically be reveal about the plot. You have to see the film yourself and get impressed, time after time.There are no guarantees that you will love Fight Club. A load of people have been angered by it. In my opinion, that's exactly the film's forte. Whatever you think of it, you will think something of it, and you will never forget what you've seen.Some have criticized it for being pro-violence. I have no patience for their point of view. Fight Club is a hugely ironic portrait of human mind taking a wrong turn. If anything, it's strictly against any form of violence, mental or physical.David Fincher has directed revolutionary music videos for Aerosmith and Madonna, among others, as well as some formidable thrillers, such as The Game and Panic Room.

1139,theepurplepanda,Life changing film.,10,11 October 2015,"Horrible movie poster by the way. Seriously, it doesn't even look like he's holding the bar of soap.WATCH THIS MOVIE RIGHT NOW BEFORE READING THIS REVIEW.I knew nothing about Fight Club going in. I'd seen three other Fincher films before this one (this is very different from his other films). I thought it was going to be about a guy in some sort of gang who wants to leave but can't because he'll be killed or something. I was sorta right. Not really. Fight Club is about a guy named Edward Norton who starts a fight club that gets out of hand or about a guy trying to figure out who he is and what his purpose is in life or about a guy with multiple personality disorder. Maybe, all three. It was filmed in 1999 by David Fincher. Apparently, it's based off a 1996 novel of the same name. I'm actually okay with having watched the movie first because I bet it was better than the novel. Edward is a super likable character. Not only do you really care about him but also about his very relatable feelings of unimportance. But the one thing that makes him the most likable is his voice overs. Voice overs make movies so much more fun to watch and really let you understand how the character thinks and observes things. Shawshank and American Psycho are the two best examples I can think of right now. I just realized all those films are based on novels. That's what books have always had over movies. You are in the character's head seeing things through their eyes. You end up bonding with the main character more and you care much more about what happens to them. Voice overs are a great way to bring this aspect into film.I loved how natural the fight club was. If an idiot made this film, the fight club would have been formed in the first ten minutes because of a random sequence of consequential events. Instead, every thing slowly ends up happening. A bunch of small choices and moments led to the fight club being formed. Edward's personality shows why a guy like him would start such a club and because of this everything that happens in the movie feels natural and not forced to make the movie more suspenseful or fun. In Gravity, everything bad that could ever happen ends up happening to Sandra Bullock. This is a cheap and lazy way to keep the movie interesting. Everything in Fight Club just feels more real and it's much harder to not be sucked into the film.It's great that they put the enjoyment of the movie before it's meaning. I felt that instead of shoving a bunch of symbolism and philosophical questions down your throat (looking at you Matrix), it makes sure the movie stays fun and interesting and treats it's meaning like icing on a wonderful cake. Not saying that the film's meaning isn't important but enjoyability should come first. I'm sure I can't be the only one who noticed but it really felt like fight club was a lot like self harm. Literally and metaphorically. They are hurting themselves with intense pain to make everything else more numb. Or smaller things like when in the restaurant, Edward gets offered a smoke and he says he doesn't smoke. Two or three scenes later he's smoking while walking down the street. 10/10 -- Masterpiece.I really can't think of anything wrong with this movie and everyone should watch it at least once. I might have to start watching all of Fincher's other movies and make a best to worst list. Also, the close up scenes were the coolest and I won't forget to mention the awesome Tyler Durden job scene.P.S. I know I didn't mention Tyler Durden.

This movie tries to bury its right-wing message under heaps of strained hip and pretend satire. But watching this movie closely, you'll see, the message is quite clear:Western civilization has been feminized and a violent revolution (led, apparently, by white males) is the only way to turn the clock back to the prehistoric cave times of patriarchy.Ed Norton plays a victim of the consumer society. When the pressures of being completely phony overwhelms him, he invents an alter-ego, played by Brad Pitt. They begin their journey toward liberation from the enlightened, feminist stage of human development, by starting a fight club where men beat each other senseless and find some sort of spiritual release. Some of my feminist friends insist there is latent homoeroticism in this movie, but I wouldn't go so far as to give it that much credit. These men don't love anything, especially each other. No, this is about white men being upset that their day is over and engaging in insanely childish activities in attempt to reclaim their lost power.As a feminist accidentally born with testicles, I can assure you there is no place for movies like this in today's feminist, enlightened society.

The ""Fight Club"" of the title is there and is brutal (W/ make-up by Rob Bottins - good to see his work again) but does not dominate the movie but rather is axiomatic to the Philosophy of the Brad Pitt character as well as the existential confusion/emptiness of the characters surrounding him.There's no reason to go any further other than to say that this is a ""Must see"" for those of you that liked ""Cemetary Man"" and ""Freds Dead Mom"" and other works in the same vein.",Fight Club

1149,Corinthian,Would've worked better as a 4-minute music video.,5,24 December 1999,"**minor spoilers**Sure, the film is visually spectacular, as all Fincher pieces are.  The picture is slick, you've got a couple 21st century icons in Norton and Pitt, a palatable attempt at nihilistic pseudo-social commentary, and the occasional moment of brilliance (ie, ""Slide!"").  Oh yes, and the gratuitous violence.I enjoyed the first act. All the elements were there; Pitt is excellent, and Norton is steady. Bonham-Carter gives her least annoying performance ever. The film is fast-paced, and has its share of innovation.  The messages that it alludes to are more-or-less subtle.  So far, so good.Then comes Project Mayhem. Something about soldiers or what-not. Anarchy disguised as a cause.  An excuse for the audience to enjoy more blatant violence on the screen.  The movie completely loses its direction the moment Fight Club tries to be more than it is-- both the organization in question, and the film itself.  From here on in, we have to endure Pitt's character's constant, irrelevant, and usually flawed, babble.  Example: the convenience store ""hold-up"", and chemical burn scenes.  And don't forget the deeply insightful line, ""Self-improvement is masturbation"".The message of anti-consumerism was already established early on in the film by Norton's character; it was unnecessary for Pitt to ram it down our throats for the rest of the movie.  The radical post-capitalism, year-zero philosophy is also nothing new. Anyone socially and politically aware in the 70's and 80's are familiar with the Cambodian Khmyr-Rouge vision.  This is pretty much irrelevant, though, since Fincher is catering to the teenage North American male.  I suspect that most of the rave reviews for The Fight Club are from this demographic. Who else would buy into the forlorn suburban working-class white male rage bit so easily?  Yes, folks. Your angst will disappear by kicking the hell out of each other.To cap off this deeply flawed movie is another Keyser Soze ending. As unconvincing as its like in Sixth Sense, it seemed more like an effort to get people back in the theatres a second time than a well-thought, intrinsic element of the plot.The Fight Club might have succeeded if it dealt away with its temptation to say something important, and stuck to a collage of pretty shots of men wailing at each other, talking penguins, and Norton covered in human fat.

I hear people talk about its ludicrous, totally unsupported plot twist, and my jaw drops in shock and horror.  THis is a brilliant film, one of the five best ever made, and I am not some knee-jerk, violence loving fanboy.  I have seen this film four times, and it becomes better with every viewing.  First of all, the plot twist.  Without giving it away, I guarantee that if you watch carefully, you will be able to see, in hindsight, how brilliantly and perfectly the twist is set up.  But you have to WATCH the movie.  You cannot simply let the movie wash over you.  This film requires thoughtful, attentive viewing.  Secondly, the movie doesn't even come close to glorifying violence.  The fight clubs are at first a mode for expressing repressed emotionality in the men who attend the fights.  beating each other is the only way they can make themselves feel, so they do it.  It is a symbol for greater things.  The film has three stages.  Ultimately, the extreme philosophy that emerges in the second act of the film is rejected. It does not glorify or encourage fighting or violence.  And this is not even to mention the glorious style of this film, with its atmospheric, nearly expressionistic lighting, its extraordinarily sophisticated and complex use of the camera, and its truly amazing sound mix.  This is, on all levels, a brilliant film.  It has a dark streak which makes it inaccessable and susceptable to the ravings of the naive, those who see a violent act and automatically begin to cry out about irresponsability in filmaking and everything else dangerous to film form.

This is one amazing film, totally misadvertised (although if it *was* advertised differently, it could spoil the film). This is a clever, witty, brilliant film. The direction and casting could not be better, and the script is sheer genius.Throw away your preconceptions of Fight Club, and go and see it - you'll be treated to something rare.",Fight Club

I went to see it expecting a weird but entertaining movie, what I got is a hilarious piece of social commentary injected with just the right amount of humor, gripping dialogue, and the most incredible ending that just leaves you floored! Edward Norton was absolutely fantastic and Brad Pitt definitely added to the movie by using some of his badassness from Seven.  There are many scenes that just amazed me as original yet so compatible to how I think movies should be.  If there is one downfall it is that there is no chance for a sequel.",Fight Club
1153,gomi28,A lot more than its commercials.,10,26 November 2001,"When I saw the commercials for this and even after my brother said it was a better film than he thought it would be, it wasn't until he actually rented it for me that I realized this movie was nothing like its commercials lead on. I was expecting a modernized version of the 70's Kung-fu movies, but with the added ""Go out and stomp some schmuck off the streets"" message to it.I was not expecting it to be a thought out story where someone took the time to hide an actually good moral in the entertainment. Tyler's true intentions are explained when he tells Jack why he sent the convenience store clerk home. If you are reading this, you probably already saw it, but if you have not and are just curious, I say it is definitely worth the time, if you are in for a multi-layered movie that can mix immediate audio and visual stimulus as well as a lasting story line that you can scrutinize over for a long time to come.  And if not for any of these reasons, there are probably more ""Good"" Memorable Quotes in this movie than you could use in a year.",Fight Club
1154,kainaw,Who would want to see this movie?,10,1 May 2005,"Imagine a movie about an anonymous man. A lonely man. A depressed man. A man who doesn't realize how lonely and depressed he is. He doesn't allow himself to realize this, so it takes on a life of its own and keeps him awake night and day. This man is the main character of Fight Club, the anonymous narrator.What would you do to find happiness? This movie examines the pathetic search for happiness in many forms. You will meet people with cancer looking for one last night of company with another person. You will meet supervisors trying to maintain control without putting their own career on the line. You will meet men after testicular cancer getting in touch with their feminine nurturing self. And, you will meet the narrator, wanting nothing more than to sleep.Somewhere in this mess of depressed and sad people, two people emerge. The narrator meets a happy-go-lucky soap salesman who feels that anything and everything is fine if you just know yourself - really know yourself. He also meets a woman who derives her happiness from freeloading off the depression of others. Who should the narrator choose to follow? Through twists and turns, this movie leads you on an unforgettable journey to the truth - not the ultimate truth to happiness. It leads you to the truth about the narrator. That isn't enough for many people.This movie is, therefore, for those who are willing to suffer with the narrator and ask nothing in return. It is one you will watch at least three times if you are into movies. You watch it once for the journey. You watch it again to see what you obviously missed when the truth is revealed. You watch it again when you realize that the tricks go beyond just the story and into the actual subliminal messages visible only by going frame-by-frame through the film.*** A SPOILER FOLLOWS *** ""Nobody should see this movie!"" is what Rosie O'Donnell exclaimed on her talk show. ""Shame on you Brad!"" she added. ""How many people with serious mental problems are going decide that the cure is to shoot themselves in the head!?"" she asked in an apparent rage. Can a person miss the point of a movie any further? This is not a movie about a man with a mental problem who looks for a cure and decides that the best thing to do is shoot himself in the head. In fact, I'm sure that actual plot line went like this: I want to write a book narrated by a crazy man. He shoots himself in the end and dies. But, if he dies, he can't narrate the book. Damn. Maybe he lives by some freak way that the bullet passes through his brain.",Fight Club

Like someone is actively taking my life away from me. If I don't stand up and claim it and DO SOMETHING with it than I might as well be dead. There is no greater love story than this one. A perfect film. The first 30 minutes of the film sets up life as it is. As we accept it. One man tries to find a place in the world. What subjects himself to is no longer living a full, happy, honest life. Tyler, the great savior, shows us the way it ought to be. And what we can become. I asked back in 2000 ""Question this: In 5 years see how many people will be talking about The Sixth Sense and then ask who has ever heard of the genius..........Tyler Durden."" ;) Seriously.

Reading the book as we speak.If you like thought provoking films, like Brazil, 12 Monkeys, The Matrix then you should like this.I won't go into the plot as it deserves to stay secret until you watch it.

1157,tantilion,What a movie should be,10,16 July 2006,"This is probably the best movie ever made. Definitely one of the best. It takes my personal favorite elements of film and storytelling (Depiction of mental deterioration, black humor, Sarcasm, Interesting and ambiguous philosophical messages to ponder, and excellent quotability).One of the best things about it would be the presentation of every situation. Specifically, how everything gets a slightly insane touch that makes sense in a strange way. Everything from the first instance playing tourist at support groups to the time when Tyler threatens to kill a store clerk unless he follow his dream of becoming a veterinarian in six moths is depicted in this way. First with absurdity, then with sense. The entire movie is tied together as one long, insane journey that you will thoroughly enjoy.The other thing about this movie that is good is that you will want to see it several times. They give you a lot to chew on. What appears to be failed continuity turns out to be foreshadowing, finding all the hints and clues to the big twist, and also watching the movie with knowledge of what is truly happening (luxury you won't have your first time through...though this is a good thing), and paying more attention to the various subliminal frames that populate the movie. Oh, and if you are the type of person who must use movie quotes and references continuously, this movie will be something you will watch over and over again.Bottom line, see this movie.",Fight Club

1159,vinniejo,Fantabulous,10,12 December 2007,I wasn't expecting a lot from a movie starring Brad Pitt & Edward Norton. I really thought that it'll be an action movie judging by its name. But I must say that it proved me wrong in a big way because its so much more than an action flick. It has an excellent plot & a brilliant story line. It revolves around the life of Edward Norton who is living a dog's life & doing a worthless job. He enrolls himself in a number of self-help courses to get some thrill in life. In his quest for seeking thrill & adventure in his life he unknowingly creates a fictitious character straight from his imagination played by Brad Pitt. Brad Pitt is everything that Edward Norton is not. He is adventure-seeking & always pushes the limit as far as being eccentric is concerned.Both of them start a fight club where people fight with each other to forget about their mundane lives. The whole thing is an underground affair with its own secret set of rules. It goes on to become a secret society of sorts with its branches all over US. Meanwhile Brad Pitt pushes Edward to new limits of Masochism with new & innovative ways.The last 15 minutes are absolutely mind-blowing where Edward comes to know about Brad Pitt's fictitious existence & tries to undo whatever he had done as him. The editing is extremely crisp & the performances by both leading actors are superb. Its definitely worth watching more than once.,Fight Club
1160,paulinetola,Mesmerizing,10,28 September 2002,"I avoided this movie for a long time, assuming it to be just another Patrick Swayze-'Roadhouse'-type ""chick-flick"": you know, where a bunch of pretty boys with greased chests preen and posture, until the prettiest of them all finally wins the heart of the poor, threatened damsel.Could I possibly have been any more wrong?This is one of the finest examples of intelligent film-making I have ever seen, as well as the most compelling piece of storytelling I can think of.The cast shine brightly, especially Edward Norton, who turns in a near-flawless performance; and what a shock to discover that Brad Pitt *can* act, after-all!Visually beautiful, expertly crafted sound, with a splendid overall ambiance as a result.From a narrative perspective, the plot 'twist' is interesting, but I feel it is of lesser importance than the message which, paradoxically, should repel me the most - that the current generation of western men have been socially and emotionally emasculated by a cartel of too-powerful and domineering women, and unjust laws and privileges bestowed upon females by a society petrified of being branded Politically Incorrect.As a woman, I naturally and instinctively object to such ideas, but as an honest and intelligent person, not yet fully blinded by propaganda and femmo-Nazi mind-control methods, I have to regretfully concede some truth to it. Men ain't what they used to be.And whilst I don't miss the ""women as chattels"" mentality of days of yore, nor the old tendency of authority to turn a blind-eye to the likes of domestic abuse, I can't help but think of the words to a particularly apt song: ""Where Have All The Cowboys Gone""?'Fight Club' gives me some hope that perhaps, somewhere out there, men are thinking about being men again. As a woman, I welcome the concept.'Fight Club' should be viewed, not just as a superlative piece of film-making, nor as a brutal and bloody piece of entertainment, but as a clarion call to all people to discard the fear of the accountants and managers, and learn to be independent individuals once more.10 out of 10.

1161,ndlejester,Absolutely Stunning,10,21 November 2006,"I am commenting on this movie after the second time I've seen it. The first time was about 3 or 4 years ago, and I was old enough to get some of the movie, but not all of it. However, I was old enough to realize I shouldn't watch it again until I was a bit more schooled and now that I'm a senior in college I thought I'd give it a go again. Am I ever glad I did.Fight Club is the journey of our semi-main character, a man who never gives his real name, played by Edward Norton. He is affectionately known as ""the clever guy"" by the other semi-main character, Tyler Durden, played by Brad Pitt. Both of these actors put forth AMAZING performances; quite possibly the best I have ever seen in my short movie-going career.The movie goes on the tell the almost endless list of stories that Norton/Pitt (who are collectively the same person) get themselves (himself) into: from the birth of an underground boxing club (Fight Club), to stealing human fat from a liposuction clinic to make soap (nitro-glycerin actually), to the eventual rise of Project Mayhem and the unfolding of their scheme to clean the slate so to speak. I don't want to say too much about the plot for those who haven't seen it yet. But inside this incredibly convoluted story there is an amazing amount of social commentary and hints of philosophy which makes watching this movie a very rich and potent experience.The world created in Fight Club is just perfect. The lighting, the camera work, the narration, the dialogue between character; all perfect. The soundtrack for this film is absolutely spot on, I had not a single qualm with the music selections. It all flows to create an amazing movie experience.All in all, quite possibly the best movie I have ever seen, and easily one of my favorites. 10/10 for sure.",Fight Club

Call it a 21st-century update. All of the same topics are revisited - consumerism, materialism, job-derived self-identity, the cheapening of humanity, emotional and social impotence, the blurring and blending of reality and imagination.The fight scenes seemed somewhat improbable, but if one views them as figurative rather than literal, the improbability becomes immaterial.A thinking man's film, up there with the best.",Fight Club

A film being able to do this, whilst being entertaining, holding a great and fairly original storyline concept (echoes of a movie which always frustrates me because I can never remember the name even though I love it - it is about terrorists, paranoia, not a happy ending etc. Something beginning with A then street or lane et. al.).Their are scenes which hurt to look at, scenes which you must look at to understand the film's psychology, and scenes which are a mixture of the two. Was there ever a Tyler Durden in reality? When was he created if he ever existed? It is puzzling, but that contributes to the thought provocation part.I may be being fussy but the return of Bob to the house after the shooting reminded me of South Park. Perhaps if they gave Meat Loaf a more 'refined' name? No... Perhaps it is just reflecting the irony over my head.Great performance from Edward Norton who always surprises me when playing roles like these which he just doesn't look right to me for. Not sure how to comment on Brad Pitt's part - is it unusually sensitive for him?Anyway it must-see film - there is profanity, a little sexual explicitness, and I don't exactly need to mention the hordes of violence, but it all contributes to the felling of the horde.

1166,monoqlith,Don't Fret About Plot 'Holes',9,24 June 2001,"Fight Club is a genuinely entertaining and excellently produced flick. Why fret about Plot Holes? I see that many of the reviewers here lack the ability of the suspension of disbelief. This movie most certainly requires a certain suspension of all disbelief and inane, pretentious skepticism. The movie itself does not say something momentus or particularly original about the decadence of shallow American society. In this regard it is a lot like 'The Matrix' - attempting to say something profound about our world while still captivating those short attention span high velocity flick-loving American audiences. Granted both Fight Club and the Matrix accomplish this wonderfully. But also granted, both Fight Club and the Matrix textually say things about society and reality that are at best skin deep, akin to a particularly ambitious article pondering a mainstreamed existence you would find in say 'Seventeen Magazine.' But, don't let that bother you. Fight Club is well made for what it attempts, much better than The Matrix, I think. Don't miss it! 9/10.",Fight Club

In a world where there is no real end goal masculinity wise, the characters in this movie creates purposes for themselves through companionship, but somehow they all are still lost.

1173,ghostlife17,"I may be paranoid, but not an android",9,2 October 2002,"You know, I've resisted honestly commenting on this movie for quite some time, even though it's a favorite of mine. I suppose I wanted to wait out the firestorm to speak. And there's so many wonderful comments here! Guess there's nothing like good old fashioned sex and ultraviolence to bring out the critic in people. Perhaps it's simply the divisive nature of ""Fight Club"" that will prove to be its' greatest contribution to the history of cinema.So where to begin? For sure, it's problematic. To use a cliche that just happens to be true for once, ""Fight Club"" is a multi-layered film that works on a myriad of different levels. Consequently, this makes it somewhat difficult to encapsulate in just a few sentences, much less pigeonhole into a specific genre. In addition, the film is clearly directed at a rather narrow audience. And by ""narrow audience"", perhaps I should say ""willfully invisible"", at least until recently. See, it's important to realize that despite all the controversy surrounding it, ""Fight Club"", and its' inherent yet hidden messages, appeal mainly to a so-called seething core of ""young people"" (blah, blah, blah)that I propose we hereby rename ""the silent generation"". It's a GenX film, kids! High art for latchkeys. And within this restless, hyperaware, ""unsatisfied"" group of individuals, there exists wildly divergent opinions about ""Fight Club"". Yet it really only boils down to one central argument: you either love it or you don't it. And if you love it, odds are it's because you get it, in one way or another. The film as a statement likely seems fairly obvious to you. But on the other hand, if you don't love this film, it's safe to assume that perhaps you might have missed the delivery of its' central themes. ""Fight Club"" is about isolation, desperation, faceless (and helpless) automation, and above all, the endlessly creepy idea of oppressive consumerism as an ideal for living. Truly pathetic. So if this is your kind of movie, it's likely that you not only ""comprehend"" it, but you are also luckily in possession of the black, spastic humor often required of one's self to coexist in harmony with today's modern, modern world. You're awake. You're aware. You're coping. Good for you.I love ""Fight Club"", in case you couldn't guess. Not just the finished product, but the entire project. It's a brilliantly open-ended satire, with first-rate performances from all involved. Palahniuk writes like an angel (exterminating), Fincher directs with a keenly evil eye, and Norton's quickly becoming the finest actor of his generation, bar none. Helena Bonham Carter is great here too, deliciously playing it for all it's worth. Even Mr. Pitt-Aniston out does himself here. So is ""Fight Club"" all about raging, unchecked egos? Sure. Is it about disillusionment and the disenfranchised? You betcha. Is it about fascism? Misogynism? Deadbeat dads? Rampant closeted homosexuality? Any of the stupid names we call ourselves each night? Well...do you want it to be? Like the film says, you determine your own level of involvement here. Get it? There's more than a few kernels of truth floating around in ""Fight Club"" which, as we all know, shall set your a** free.A final note. If you're really into this movie (and you know who you are), I feel confident in saying that you're probably into darker, decidedly more intelligent things as well. You take ""Fight Club"" for what it is, a cleverly executed joke. Which makes dissecting it over and over again, especially with the uninitiated, somewhat redundant. So I apologize for this lengthy diatribe. But may I smugly suggest one final rule? The ninth, if you will. The 9th rule of Fight Club is ""fights will only occur between those evolved enough to handle it"". Thank you.We are the dollars and cents.",Fight Club

No, it must be The Good, The Bad and The Ugly! Or maybe, Citizen Kane...? Or could it be... Casablanca??? Maybe all of the above!Fight Club is scarcely a considerable masterpiece. In some instances, that statement can be extremely biased, but I actually thought the same way after my first viewing of Fight Club, but that was because I had a hard time understanding it. Maybe it is highly recommendable that you give this film a second, third or maybe even ten viewings. Because it is a little challenging for some people to wrap their brain around a film like this, it used to give me a head-ache after every time I watched it. What it is, is that you need to watch it with a psychological view - if you understand basic psychology. It is one complex little film which has a lot to say about itself. What this film does is take you on an amazing journey through a person's mind, this might even concern YOUR mind and it gives you two kinds of resolutions: ""Where to go and when to take action - or; when to slow down and think it over.""That aside, Edward Norton (American History X) and Brad Pitt (Se7en) are both simply groundbreaking in this film, they are perhaps the Humphrey Bogart and James Stewart of our generation! And of course the direction, cinematography and editing are all fabulous. It is in fact one of the most iconic, amusing, entertaining, stylish, brutal and thought-provoking films of our time and arguably of all-time!Give yourself a ""check-up"" on yourself and not only watch this film, but analyze it - in the right way!The other noteworthy classics of our age includes Se7en, The Matrix, The Usual Suspects, The Dark Knight, American Beauty and The Lord of the Rings.",Fight Club

1180,dlgart,139 wasted minutes,1,19 August 2004,"I refuse to give away details of a film. Therefore this commentary is directed at people who have already seen the movie and may be a bit obscure to those who have not.Silly plot, gratuitous violence, way too long and very predictable. (If the mono frame shots of Pitt and the identical baggage clues weren't enough to explain exactly what was happening, then H.B. Carter's reaction scene when Norton asks her what she is doing there the morning after, should have made it crystal clear... for anyone over twelve.) I was shocked by how many previous comments referred to an unexpected ""twist"" at the end.Fight Club is simultaneously homo-erotic and homophobic, I think the overwhelming popularity of this film among 18-25 year old (confused) males unfortunately may be explained by the concept repeatedly expressed throughout the film that it is OK to bond with or even hug other men but only if you also hurt each other.I can only recommend purchasing or renting this DVD to those readers who are BOTH somewhat sadistic AND not very bright.",Fight Club

The insomniac narrator keeps the audiences widely awake along the presentation about how many parts of our lives are actually meaningless.Edward Norton performs convincingly as a guy who screams out of the boredom of his days just to find the exciting new life during his sleepless nights. This new life includes serial visitation to support groups where he meets the disturbingly charming Marla (played disturbingly haunting by Helena Bonham-Carter). While he's wishing that his plane will crash, suddenly the charismatic Tyler Durden (Brad Pitt at his best!) appears, and brings him to a whole new (underground) world.They both invent the fight club, and in this fighting community they struggle for peace and better life. Actually, it is not the story that counts, but the values and twists. Based on the novel of the same title by Chuck Palahniuk, ""Fight Club"" changes the paradigms of everyday life: countering neatly ordered life, blasting consumerism, and glorifying chaos.The dark and compelling ambience is successfully achieved by director David Fincher.

1183,kmcloone96,Arguably the best movie ever made,10,9 August 2013,"The movie was directed by David Fincher, also responsible for the twisted masterpiece Se7en, and revolves around the main character who for all intensive purposes will be called ""The Narrator"", played by one of my favourite actors: Edward Norton. The Narrator meets a man named Tyler Durden (Brad Pitt), who goes on to completely change his outlook on life, opening him up to what is truly his full potential, and encouraging him to leave behind his old monotonous life and ""just let go.""It's difficult to explain why Fight Club is the incredible experience it is without spoiling anything. The main misconception is that the movie focuses on fighting, which is a fair assumption, based upon the name, but it is almost inexcusable to disregard it without delving a little deeper. About one tenth of the film contains fighting, with the remainder telling an unforgettable story of self-discovery and leaving you as the viewer to raise some questions about yourself and precisely where you think your own life is going. It's clichéd with many highly- rated films, but Fight Club really is life changing if you allow it to be. It'd be wrong to review the film without touching on just how exceptional the acting is. Marla, (played by Helena Bonham Carter) is the embodiment of a wasted life, counting down the days till she dies. Her life, like The Narrator's, completely changes when she meets Tyler, providing even the most depressive character in the film a new way of seeing things. Brad Pitt plays Tyler perfectly, not caring at all how people see him and being his own man, something which he encourages The Narrator to do. The true reason Fight Club is so phenomenal as a film however is down to the fact it was made with the sole purpose of being watched again, thanks to the completely mind-blowing twist featured towards the end. I can't put in to words just how shocked I was after the first time I saw the film, leaving me to instantly need to see it again. If there was ever a reason to see Fight Club, the twist alone would be it.",Fight Club

It's a complex and intelligent psychological thriller with a brilliant twist and a great soundtrack. It just keeps getting better and better as the film moves on. This is easily one of the best films, if not the best film I've ever seen in my life. I'm sure enough people have gone into the plot so I won't need to do that, but it's definitely an exciting and thrilling experience as well as making a big impact and goes beyond where most films go. it was on my mind all day the day after I watched it. Whatever you do, watch this film.",Fight Club
1185,bartvanbenthem,One of the best ever made !,10,8 November 2005,"Fight Club is unique Story: First rule of Fight Club is ... You don't talk about Fight Club Jack (Edward Norton) is a bored car recall inspector caught in the middle of mediocrity in a rat race that he cannot get out of. He suffers from chronic insomnia, never knowing where his life is going from one moment to the next in his white collar, materialistic world. Jack begins attending support groups for any disease imaginable, in order to feel needed and part of something. His insomnia disappears and suddenly he feels alive for the first time in years. On a flight he meets Tyler Durden (Brad Pitt). Tyler is a charismatic Soap salesman who has a whole different slant on life that captivates Jack. Jack returns to find his apartment has been destroyed by a gas explosion and as a last resort he asks Tyler for a place to stay. Together they discuss lifes trivialities. They decide that the only way to feel alive is to really live. They form Fight Club. A secret group that meets with the sole purpose of staging fights between its members. Forget the gym, jogging or even sex. This is the way to get that adrenaline rushing, to get fit and make you a stronger, more focused person. The first rule of Fight Club is: Don't Talk about Fight Club. The Second Rule of Fight Club is : Don't talk about fight club !. Welcome to Fight Club.My opinion:Fight club goes further then any movie ever created, it is almost perfect: The acting, Story-line, plot twists, Strange electronic Soundtrack, tense, action and of course the qlimax ending ! Brad pitt did a great job and Edward norton is just showing us one of the best performances ever showed in a movie ( can compete with marlon brando in Godfather and deniro in raging bull and taxidriver) David fincher (not my favorite director) has created one of the Best movies by giving it that dark atmosphere just like he did in se7en.This movie is certainly listed in my top 5 of all time and is probably never going to be replaced, because i like this movie so much and watcht it so many times discovering new things every time.9.8 / 10 One of the best in all ways !",Fight Club
1186,sonumania123,The Perfect Movie!,10,8 January 2017,"Fight club is directed by one of my favorite film directors David Fincher. The film based on the novel written by Chuck Palahniuk. I absolutely adore this film for its philosophy. It's one of those films that I happen to watch once a year. It's close to me and motivates me in my life. Let's get something off first, people whom never seen Fight Club get mistaken to what this film is all about. To those who never seen Fight Club, This is not a movie about guys pounding each other up until there is a winner. No, Fight Club is essentially about particular and Cultural Revolution inside a corporate consumer civilization that abolishes the humanoid life. The film stars, Edward Norton, Brad Pitt, Helena Bonham Carter, and Jared Leto. Story:- This is a story of Tyler Durden. Edward Norton (Narrator) is a public bodily human being who subsists an uninteresting life. He spends money on everything of which he sees an advertisement; however, he realizes that nothing is worth buying. He is jaded of his dull life. On one irregular day his house was caught on fire, which therefore he was depressed on things he paid money for is now all gone. He shared his grievance with Tyler Durden to whom he has just met in an airplane. This was his greatest moment that completely changes the narrator's (Norton) life as a whole. Tyler was clever, energetic and entirety that Norton (narrator) has constantly hopes to be. Tyler was unrestricted from all kind of responsibilities. Norton (Narrator) joins forces with Tyler and starts a club known as Fight Club. Fight Club is the method to break free. It is a club where two people will fight with each other. It is a club with the certain set of rules. Members of fight club are obliged to these rules. Tyler was the guru, persuader and stimulus for the club members, they respect Tyler. This conveyed Tyler and prospect to pledge Project Mayhem. Project Mayhem was all about annihilation; it was all about economic balance. Tyler Durden, played by Brad Pitt is one of the greatest characters in the history of films, and Pitt has brilliantly described the character of Tyler Durden. Pitt has specified a certain style to the character which was needed. Durden was innovative and completely different from characters you'd see on screen. Most of the famous lines in this movie were said by Tyler Durden. In the film itself, he becomes a Godly figure, hence the say, In Tyler We Trust.Edward Norton is an amazing actor; he has the ability to get into the skin of the character. In this film he has plays the storyteller and story was said from his point of view. David Fincher is a great storyteller he had his ways to tell this complex story with such a chic and sophistication. This film is based off a novel; however, Fincher still put his own style in this film. The reason I say this because one of his previous film that came out four years before this Seven had same kind of style. Fincher as well put a lot in- depth detailing in the script alone and as well the characters, which is what made this film what it is. It boils down to this; Fight Club is truly an amazing film. I highly recommend it, and I also recommend the book.",Fight Club
1187,wolverinex2002,"Yes, it is actually the best movie ever made!",10,18 June 2013,"I know that i will disappoint you, but i won;t make an effort to justify the title of this review! I know lots of people that do not seem to be captivated by the specific film,its concept, or it characters. And to be honest, i do not want to persuade them over this!!! I want this movie not to be liked by everyone(like Shawshank Redemption for example). I want this movie for myself!!I consider this movie as one that you will like it for your own unique reasons, and this is its true power. There is no point in giving you reasons for justifying my view, as it may differ from yours.I have read the book after watching the film, and i must say that Fincher made a hell of a job to materialize on screen a book not so easy to be adapted (it is not Dan Brown if you know what i mean). I dare to say that we have here one of those rare occasions that the movie adaptation surpasses the book itself.",Fight Club

You know how the book is usually a billion times better than the movie. Well I think the book is on the same level as the movie. They left out a few things but i guess it's for the best. The movie is probably one of the best examples of great cinema. In my opinion, it's better than the godfather.Fight Club is about Edward Norton's fight against his alter ego. How his life is changed dramatically and how FIGHT CLUBS ARE SO COOL. That is the main plot. The directing is amazing. The plot is amazing. The acting is astounding. The cinematography is flawless.

Fight Club is, without any doubt, an epic movie. There's something in this movie that calls for the animal in all of us.Violence. Raw violence is a strange thing. It frightens most of us, but it plays a major role in the human race. This movie serves as an excellent wakeup call. Most people tend to forget that we, Mankind, are a species for several thousands of years, however, we are a civilized society for just a few hundred. Our primal instincts are still very much alive and there's some comfort, some peace of mind when you return to your most basic needs.This movie puts a new perspective in our everyday life. We work every single day to suppress our most inner feelings and we are gradually becoming nothing more than an ant colony.I won't even dare to say anything about the movie plot. You have to see it for yourself and in the end, you kinda of wish it to be true, although it will shock you most of the times.If you have any sense at all, then rent this movie and see it.

I love this movie so much! Absolutely hilarious! So blunt, so great! So many people who have seen this movie want to start a Fight Club!

1193,munitzs,Watch this movie!,8,7 May 2005,"I've had the DVD lying around for years, and am I sorry I didn't watch it earlier!What a movie! Some exciting camera work early on, excellent direction, solid acting. Norton is superb, as is Pitt. Helena Bonham-Carter delivers a realistic performance - she has come a long way since ""A room with a view"".The story is intriguing and draws one in from the beginning, with never a dull moment. Scripting is competent and never seems contrived.The photography has several surprising and original moments that help to reinforce the dislocation of the central character's mental state.But while it's a brilliant watch, it's not perfect: The most glaring deficiency is the ending. Do yourself a favour and stop watching about 2 minutes before the end. It's lame, a serious let-down. Typically Hollywood and really goes against the grain of the entire movie.There are more than a few inconsistencies in the story - which become highlighted when the ""twist"" is revealed. Far from answering questions, the plot surprise raises them - you'll see for yourself, they are obvious.Also disappointing is the fact that after the fights, the bruises and scars seem to disappear quickly - one day he's black and blue, the next day he's completely unmarked. I recently had a black eye and it took weeks to clear. You'd also expect a few broken bones and some serious dental problems from the continual blows delivered to the mandibles. Not to mention the concussion effects from repeated head injuries.These quibbles aside, WATCH THIS MOVIE!",Fight Club
1194,steffiebaby140,Wildly funny!,10,6 May 2005,"I was skeptical about seeing this movie, wondering if it was going to be merely a bunch of guys beating the crap out of each other. I was pleasantly surprised to find that it spoke deeply about the human psyche and the ease with which it can be manipulated. Fight Club was enormously funny, but in a darker sort of way. Edward Norton and Brad Pitt both do a fantastic job of setting the tone for the whole picture. It has become one of my favorite movies, and that's saying something as I'm not easily impressed!One tip however, do not try and take this movie entirely seriously. It is meant to be a dark comedy and taking it seriously will only ruin it for you. The most frightening part of this movie is that, ridiculous though it seems, it is entirely plausible. The movie examines a cult-like mind set, yet allows one to have a good time as well.",Fight Club
1195,ironlion106,The Perfect Movie,10,19 March 2015,"Movies absolutely do not get any better than this. This is one of the best book-to-movie adaptations of all time, to the point where the author of the novel that it is based off of says that it is an improvement on his book.Fight Club is a uniquely dark (but no tat all depressing) film that immediately pulls you into its world with well written narration that shows you an interesting perspective on the world as we know it. This perspective comes from the main character (no, I'm not going to say his name) who happens to be a narcoleptic, insomniac, middle class man with an OK desk job at a car company. The story takes a turn for the interesting when he befriends a strange yet interesting man names Tyler Durden. The two become great friends and later form ""Fight Club""; a club made up of men who feel enslaved by consumerism and just want a good outlet. And for the sake of spoilers, that is all I can tell you about the story.As far as movie quality, it is spectacular. The movie has extremely well written and well acted characters, with a spectacular cast that fits perfectly into their roles. The dialogue is amazingly well written and it manages to be funny, witty, and non-cliché at the same time. The story is interesting throughout, without a single dull moment (thanks to David Fincher's directing). The musical score is one of the best musical scores ever written, setting the mood perfectly in every scene and making every moment intense- feeling. And even the little details re noticeably good, like the cinematography, special effects, and even the lighting.But of course, what this movie has become most known for is its ending. I will not spoil anything, but this movie has the most beautiful and satisfying ending that, to this day, I have ever seen in a movie.Overall, I would say that if you enjoy good acting, directing, story, dialogue, and etc, DEFINITELY see this film (as long as you aren't a stuck-up b**** who has no taste in movies like Rosie O'Donnell)",Fight Club

From the opening to the end, Fight Club only grew to me as one of the best films I have ever seen.What makes this so good is the Narrator (brilliantly performed by Edward Norton, a very underrated actor who never won anything with this performance) is such a vocal and stylish protagonist, mentally he strikes as something very different, like a Travis Bickle. Is it because of his dead end job? Or how he wants to get off from his depression by buying Swedish furniture, or how he finally snapped? I don't know, but I loved it. And as far as Brad Pitt goes, he gave one of his greatest performances here, ever.

1199,harveybdickens,David Fincher's best movie,9,4 December 2015,"This is the ultimate cult classic movie. For this reason it is hard to believe it is adapted from a book, but it is, and apparently it follows the novel closely (I don't know exactly, because I haven't read the book.) Perhaps for this reason, upon it's release it wasn't highly regarded, as many book to screen adaptations are not.This movie is about a man known only as 'The Narrator.' He is a very average type of office worker. If he was in a large crowd of people, no one would notice him. The most interesting thing about him, is that he suffers from insomnia (inability to sleep.) After his apartment accidentally catches fire, he decides to move out for a while. Soon he meets Tyler Durden, a soap maker, who just doesn't have a care in the world.Tyler is presented as the exact opposite of the narrator, which becomes VERY significant later on. The move into a house together, and every now and then they go to a bar for a few drinks. This is where thy start the fight club, and it grows into much much more. These two men started it, and eventually many people join, and they become almost a mini terrorist organization. This is a far cry from the narrator, who at the start was a simple, almost boring, office worker.Tyler's greatest moment is when he's giving a speech about motivations, about ""how we're brought up to think we're going to be celebrities, or rock stars, but we won't. We're slowly learning that fact"" are the types of things he says to motivate the fight club, in it's early stages.Then he suddenly disappears. The 'fight club' has become a mini terrorist organization, and the narrator no longer wants to be a part of it. He then runs into Tyler. Except no he doesn't, he has a self confession. Tyler Durden isn't a person. He is the narrators alter ego, who he (the narrator) created to feel more powerful in the world around him, rather than just an insomniac office worker.There is of course much more to the movie than this, such as the main female character, who creates complications for the narrator, the members of the fight club risking their lives, and so on and so forth.Fight Club is a cult classic, but it may not be the most appealing movie. It is at times quite dark, and has an interesting ending, one that took me a few watches to completely understand. Nevertheless it is an interesting movie (genre isn't certain but it's pretty much a drama/thriller/crime hybrid and I give it 8/10",Fight Club

The film itself also battles simultaneously with the kind of message it wants to send, and unfortunately it sends a rather anticlimactic one ultimately-we will lose the battle with our rebellious and idealistic selves, and we will continue to follow our Sisyphean path, sadly I have now started finding better movies through www.flickstree.com.

Fight Club possibly has one of the biggest, and most amazingly executed, twists of all time. The Sixth Sense had an amazing twist as well, but it was much easier to see coming. I actually suspected that something was amiss long before it happened and by the reveal I knew it was coming (though I might not have if not for one brief shiver). But this movie actually got me! That is so rare that it deserved the extra star for that alone.That aside this movie is fantastic and is a true gem of a movie.

If many of the critics would look deeper into the movie, they would see how truly wonderful it was. On the surface it is quite stupendous. The acting both by Edward Norton (brilliant) and Brad Pitt (impressive) brings the characters to reality (or at least as far as each character should go into reality.) The visuals are beautiful. The screenplay is probably the greatest feature of them all (because it was based on a great book)- I can't think of any movie that is more quoteable than this. Deeper it carries important messages about materialism and the dangers of life growing too mundane.

The impact of the movie hinges on a ""surprise ending"" that reminds one of The Sixth Sense. Unfortunately, the movie was not crafted well enough for this ending to ""hang together"".

1206,sticky-4,A LESSON IN MODERN ANARCHY,7,19 October 1999,"The movie Fight Club has come under a lot of fire regarding it's violent content, its underlying message of anarchy, and how it correlates to recent shooting violence in our society   It tells the story of Edward Norton's character, a 30-year old insomniac whose life is stuck in a rut.  He meets Brad Pitt's character and they have a few beers, go into the rear parking lot of the bar where Pitt tells him to `Hit me, as hard as you can.'  They get into a fight and afterwards they feel pretty good about it.  They end up doing this on a regular basis and soon other people want to get in on it and inevitably, FIGHT CLUB is born.  But soon it gets more members and grows terribly out of control by including mass vandalism, theft, and destruction. There is a lot of expected violence here and I mean lots of blood.  The overall philosophy of the movie is `Wake up, look at your life, get out of your rut and do something with it before you die.'  It also tries to create a love triangle between Norton, Pitt , Helena Bonham that doesn't work for this movie. It has a major twist towards the end, not unlike The 6th Sense. The ending is ambiguous and unclear but is typical of director David Fincher's mind-flip style of directing.  If I were to rate this movie from a moral perspective I'd say that it has none. If I were to rate from a storytelling perspective, I'd give it a 7 out of 10.",Fight Club

Certainly, it touches a frazzled raw nerve ending among audiences growing up in a brand-name world that fills them with disgust. Just as certainly, it mines cheap shock out of Holocaust ''humor'' and a no-hope posturing that is, finally, as hollowly trendy as any Gap ad.

Sometake it to something very near ballet, like ""The Matrix."" Others skirtthe issue and blur the worst moments, as in the hospital scenesin ""Pearl Harbor.""But the violence in ""Fight Club"" is a different breed - a raw,unadulterated sort that sears at your eyes during some of theintense sequences. It's back-alley stuff: bloodied knuckles andnoses, bruises and lacerations, and all worn like Bronze Stars bythe characters.And mixed in there is a sort of quasi-Nietzche cant, a half-formedphilosophy that's equal parts Machiavelli and Unibomber.I'm not totally convinced by the intellectual end of the film - thereare inconsistencies in the idealogies, though I appreciate the ironyof the highly structured Fight Club made up of a bunch ofanarchists.Roger Ebert makes mention of the ""Keyser Soze syndrome""regarding the conclusion of the film, which has some merit - itdoes seem to unravel everything in a heartbeat, though there aresubtle signs pointing to what's revealed in the closing act. It takesa little (well, perhaps a lot) of insight, but it's there in front of you ifyou're thinking as the movie goes along.Of course, the caveat to that is that the movie, with its torrent ofviolence and mayhem, makes it difficult to do anything but getswept along in the madness.""Fight Club"" warrants a few viewings - it's tough to say you love it orhate it after watching just once.

I want to hire a bus and ferry all my friends to and from screenings so they don't miss out on the biggest cinematic experience of the 90s.All concerned give the best work of their careers to this movie and even with its cargo of irreverence and disgust at our society, it has as much intelligence and class as 1999's best: American Beauty, The Talented Mr. Ripley, Election etc. David Fincher is a genius. Fight Club is 1999's Blade Runner and in ten years time everyone will be claiming to have known it was a masterpiece first time round. Go see it.",Fight Club
1211,waitungh,"Fast, funny, furious and completely funked up.",9,8 December 1999,"From the opening credits I was enraptured with this movie. The throwaway cleverness of the visuals, seen in the time-honored tradition of flashback, lends further cynicism to a film saturated with the nihilistic posturings and ideas from a very twisted and brilliant mind. I loved it - even though I sort of knew what the film was about I was surprised by how sophisticated it was. This is not a Brad Pitt film in the way that I imagine Meet Joe Black to be (never saw it, the trailer was enough). He acts much the same as he always did.Edward Norton is absolutely superb and the ultimate deadpan foil to the fantastic sequences that occur in the film. He rightly takes the lead for most of the movie and his sly, subversive comments are dropped with a poet's precision into each circumstance that our erstwhile anti-hero finds himself in.This is film belongs to the ""coming of age"" genre in that it is a voyage into self-discovery and coming to terms with the world that we live in. It'll change your outlook if nothing else.Must see.",Fight Club
1212,sickboy-11,a surprisingly imaginitive and intelligent film,10,19 October 1999,"I entered the theatre to see fight club with reasonable expectations and expected to get my money's worth, but i didnt really expect more than seeing nothing more than 2 hours of Ed Norton and Brad Pitt fighting (and maybe a few scenes of the incredibly talented and beautiful Helena Bohnam Carter).As the film was over i realized that it had been one of the most profound, imaginative, twisted, funny and entertaining films i have seen in recent (or even otherwise) memory. If you plan to go see it for the fight scenes, you will certainly get your money's worth, but you will likely leave the theatre with much deeper impression than that if you remain open minded throughout the entire film.Once again excellent direction on David Fincher's part, a revelation that will completely change your perception of the film to where a second viewing is almost required, excellent performances by all of the actors, and a not so subtle social commentary make this movie MUCH more than just a fight film. It's a shame that it will generally be overlooked by the more elitist type of critics merely on the violent content. As before mentioned, i entered the film with reasonable expectations that were greatly exceeded, as of now i plan to return for even multiple viewings. (although tempted for a spinal tap reference) on a scale of one to ten, this film EASILY gets a ten. Highly recommended to anyone capable of opening their mind beyond the violence.",Fight Club
1213,live4eva,Too bad about the ending.......,8,17 November 1999,"Fight Club is one of the most original films I have ever seen. The story is excellent, with both Norton and Pitt putting in some very worthy performances.For anybody who has not gone to see Fight Club yet, I highly recommend it, however, the movie takes a wrong turn in the last twenty minutes, and unfortunately for Fight Club, the twist at the end will be compared to another great film from earlier this year.Until the last twenty minutes, I thought I was watching the best movie of the year, however the person I saw it with said it is the greatest film they had ever seen.Anyway, if you liked Trainspotting, The Sixth Sense, The Matrix, and even Taxi Driver, then you will more than likely love this very unique film.9.5 out of ten up to the last twenty minutes. 7 out of ten for the whole movie.",Fight Club
1214,MoviDude,"Brilliant, one of the years best films",9,16 October 1999,"Notice I didn't say 'one of the years best movies.' This isn't a Brad Pitt movie, this is a brilliant piece of work. It isn't for everyone(there were several walk outs at a recent showing I attended) and that can be attributed to the grisly violence that is portrayed. Yes, it is bloody and yes, it is graphic. But, I don't think that is the point that the film is trying to get across. The first hour is rampant with rich, satirical humor, and I admit that I did laugh. By the last half, the tone had shifted to be very, very dark. Edward Norton, I think, is one of the best actors of the 90s--he becomes his characters, shows their weaknesses, etc. Here, he is great as the Narrator. [...]. Brad Pitt, who I don't like much as an actor, finally gives a performance worthy of calling him a thespian. His Tyler Durden is flamboyant, mysterious, self-serving, and, as we learn, very dangerous and vital to the plot. Helena Bonham Carter is fantastic in a very different role--this is far from her British period-piece roles. The film is often brutal in how it is portrayed. One factor that I was disturbed by was the message of the film, which dealt with anarchy and nihilism and that violence is an outlet for frustration. Fight Club is a '90s masterpiece and deserves to join Eyes Wide Shut, The Sixth Sense, Tarzan, October Sky, The Blair Witch Project, and American Beauty as one of the years best films. 4 out of 4 stars.",Fight Club
1215,Mikey-99,The plot twist kills the film.,1,18 October 1999,"This is the first film I have seen in which the plot twist utterly and completely destroys the film. A good contrast is with ""Sixth Sense;"" the twist makes you look back at the film with even more interest. You may even want to see it again.  The plot twist here is so ridiculous, so embarassingly idiotic, that you suddenly feel ashamed to have enjoyed the film up to the point of its revelation. What were they thinking?",Fight Club
1216,podrep,"Magnificent, bold movie",10,30 June 2000,"Magnificent. Bold. Thought-provoking. You either fall in love with a film like this or you hate it. Needless to say I loved it. Just five minutes of FIGHT CLUB -any five minutes- has more heart, soul and invention than any Hollywood blockbuster we will see this summer. The most remarkable thing about this film though is that it got made at all, and by a Hollywood studio at that. The mind boggles that a studio system so dominated by popcorn 'event' movies that are so consistently mindless could also produce a film so witty, non-pc and intelligent. Viewers may not agree with what the film says, but it certainly demands attention. Fincher is some kind of genius.",Fight Club

I found myself smiling for most of the movie, why?  Because it was so smart!  The parts where I wasnt smiling, I was cringing from some of the mind blowing scenes.I loved everything about this movie.  Helena Bonham Carter was amazing, Brad Pitt was in top form, I've always liked him.  But most of all, Edward Norton, this guy is so pure in his acting.  He was terrific and perfectly cast for the nameless narrator.  Him and Kevin Spacey amaze me everytime I watch them.  The ending to me was perfect.  > ! Yep, I will never forget this movie!  It's definitely forever etched in my mind.  Sad thing is, no oscars will come of this movie, and thats shame. Fight Club to me is already a classic!",Fight Club

It did keep me interested in the first half, in fact it was more like I forced myself to watch the 1st half, because the same people told me the movie will not make sense until the end. So I was expecting something very clever, something crazy enough that would make me think for days (The type of intelligent ending that shocks you like the Sixth Sense did). I was very disappointed when I did reach the end though. I thought it was predictable. And the movie was just TOO violent to deliver its message and made my stomach turn many times. The film did get some good reviews, so try it out for yourself if you wish, but be prepared for mindless and an unnecessary amount of violence and bloodshed. And do not expect too much from the ending. While watching, I constructed many ideas and possible endings that could perhaps make it more interesting and I was fairly displeased.",Fight Club
1219,I Am The Cheese,I am Jack's gushing praise,10,5 March 2001,"What we have here is quite possibly the finest use of celluloid in history.This film is just outstanding on so many levels it's shunning by The Academy at The Oscars just goes to show how out of touch and inbred they are.We have Brad Pitt giving the performance of his career, and Edward Norton showing once again his talent, and even Helena Bonham Carter proves there's more to her than Merchant Ivory productions.  The script is witty, fresh, and eminently quotable, the soundtrack a masterpiece (courtesy of The Dust Brothers), and the whole thing looks fantastic.Your life is ending one second at a time, and this better take up (rough estimate) 7860 of them, or Eternal Damnation will be next on the horizon.VIEW/BUY/RENT/STEAL!!!",Fight Club
1220,Thalya,...and you bleed just to know you're alive....,9,1 November 1999,"I'm no real movie critic, but I enjoyed this movie and found some powerful truth in it. Look at the scene where Tyler lets himself be beaten by the bar owner. He's clearly enjoying it. With the consumerist/materialist focus on the self, this is the way in which the self can be denied. There might be the work of id, ego, and super ego going on here (which would necessitate Marla), but I'm not quite sure. Anyway, this is probably the scene that helped me understand the ending, how the two came one by means of such violence. Rather Zen in a way. Amazing how two such philosophical movies (as far as I've seen) that have a great share of violence are made in the same year (this and The Matrix). Perhaps this is saying something about society in this time.",Fight Club

1224,Jedi Clerk,This movie IS amazing even if you dislike Brad Pitt.,10,31 October 2000,"I love this movie. It's not for everyone though. Most people turn away after just glancing the title, believing this to be some sort of 'Rocky' movie which it most certainly is not. This is a subversive commentary about modern-day problems.Consider the fact that SOME of the people on this planet are less-than-satisfied with their 9-5 clockwatching office-cubicle nuclear family type lives. Consider the fact that not everyone who appears to be insane is insane or perhaps that the ""sane"" people are all out of their minds. Consider the fact that although commercialism controls our minds perhaps not everyone is all that thrilled with that. Or let me put it another way... if you are the kind of person who finds they'd like to put a brick through the window of your local Starbucks for some ""unknown"" reason... well then, this is the movie for you! If not, then please go hole up with a 'nice' Julia Roberts or Tommy Lee Jones flick and leave the rest of us alone!This movie has the power to enlighten minds and shatter paradigms. The editing is amazing. The special FX are phenomenal. The camerawork and color is stunning and the scripting and dialog is great! (The book is equally amazing and the film, for the most part, stays true to the original.) The Dust Brothers also produced a simply amazing soundtrack for this film.Not only that, this movie is darkly humorous...as well as extremely violent, but, as i said this movie is NOT for everyone. If you don't get it... well thats too bad. I love it and the ending always makes me cry... hearing the Pixies (from Massachusetts, like me) playing at the end just makes me weep tears of joy that someone would make a movie like this for all of us corporate slaves.Thank you, David Fincher!",Fight Club

The film itself starts out interestingly enough, yet slows down toward the middle and end, until the final 15 minutes, which runs at a frantic rate (which it should, to illustrate the lead characters revelations about himself).  I'm not sure what kind of people to recommend this movie to, it doesn't in my mind belong to any preset genre, and I there fore find it hard to compare to anything.

The social commentaries in this male-driven movie were so true, and as a female, I was not offended nor disgusted by the violent scenes.  What 'Tyler Durden' made me realize is that I am a member of a brainless, superficial, materialistic society. For example, 'Jack' believed himself to be complete because he had a designer wardrobe, nice Scandinavian furniture, and a stable (yet awful) career, yet he could not sleep at night.  At the advice of a sadistic doctor, he starts attending help groups.  I don't want to give too much away, but the ending is wonderful.",Fight Club

This movie is not brilliant, it is not a work of art, it is a train wreck, pure and simple! There were so many interesting ideas introduced in the beginning of this film, but somehow they fizzled along the way.  The idea of a group of men trying to fill the void left by consumer society was interesting.  Then, Project Mayhem, a cult-type operation where none of the members can think for themselves, which seems to contradict the theme set forward by the first hour of the movie.  The movie changes from an intelligent satire to your standard action/suspense flick, with a little psychological suspense and quirky romance thrown in for good measure, Tyler Durden spouting philosophy the whole way through.  This movie did have some very good cinemetography and editing, and it was very quirky and high in shock value, which seems to be enough to get most people to overlook its inherent flaws.  I can only hope that a few years down the road, people will be able to see this movie for what it truly is, a movie that could have been great, but somehow blew it.",Fight Club

On the recommendations of many of my friends, however, I finally broke down and shelled out $2.50 for Fight Club.That was the best damn $2.50 I have ever spent.Fight Club, while not a film that everyone will appreciate, is definitely a unique and amazing experience.  The visual and narrative style are fast, edgy and furious and totally fit the story.Edward Norton, Helena Bonham Carter, and Brad Pitt deliver top notch performances.  Plus, the big revelation (which I won't spoil for anyone who has yet to experience this film for the first time) came totally out of left field and knocked me upside the head.Fight Club isn't your average film, and due to the style and subject matter it might take more than one viewing to truly appreciate it...but it is definitely worth the effort.",Fight Club

It's got everything a great film should have: stunning cinematography, great characters, powerful directing, a plot that twists and turns and leaves you guessing, plus more than I could ever put in this review.This film is for men and about men.  It portrays the deep angst men feel, as well as how to be a 'real' man.  Tyler Durden sums it all up while sitting in the bathtub drinking a beer when he says, ""My old man never went to college, so it was real important that I go.  So I went to college and got my degree.  After graduation I called my old man and said, 'Dad, what should I do now?'  He said, 'get a job.'  So I went out and got a job.  Then I made my annual call, and asked, 'Dad, what should I do now?'  He said, 'I don't know, get married?'  We are a generation of men raised by women.  Somehow I wonder if another woman is really the answer we need?""A stunning observation that hits almost any man in the head with full force. We are a generation of feminized men who were raised by women.  The generations that came before us were raised by our fathers, and this has somehow become lost in our society.  Fight Club provides the male legacy that existed on this planet for thousands and thousands of years before our current generation.  As Durden observes, the answers we seek as men will never come from women, but from other men.If you are a man under the age of 40 and have not seen this film, it is your moral imperative to rent it and watch it immediately.

what a good movie! hilarious at times, wierd at times, but entertaining all through the film.  IT explores themes such as masculinity, corporatism, consumerism, and so on, and the acting is great.  as the film nears a close, though, the plot becomes more and more strange.  The final ending was a bit much for me (*SPOLIERS ABOUT TO BE DIVULGED), especially when he shot himself in the mouth.  Somehow, that shot killed tyler, but didn't kill him.

The shots are just beautiful, showing the world in all its gritty detail and having no qualms about breaking the fourth wall.I am not going to talk about the plot in detail, mainly because it contains so much detail and depth that i would just be doing a disservice. Suffice it to say this is by far the most creative concept I have seen since A Clockwork Orange.I really cannot endorse this film enough..... If you are a guy this is a must see. If you are a woman, see this, and you may grasp some insight into the male psyche. Prepare to be offended, though",Fight Club

You can not explain many things that happen in the film with the final twist on the schizophrenia of the character! And then that stupid final, the way that the main character has to get rid of his alter- ego, that mysterious Tyler Durden, shooting himself in the mouth and to stay alive in spite of everything! And all those skyscrapers collapsing, worse than September 11! But it should be? He ruined the whole movie. A film of social protest and against consumerism, but it does not give up hollywoodianism!

Marla Singer is the sanest, most honest person in the entire piece. Even through all her hypochondria and emotional rollercoasterism, she puts the cracked combination of Tyler Durden and ""Cornelius/Rupert/Everyman"" in its place. Revisiting David Fincher's fascinating post-modern masterwork Fight Club on Blu-ray for its 10th anniversary reveals a wealth of these kinds of previously undiscovered gems. What about Chloe, the dying woman so desperate for a last act roll in the hay that she advertises her various pleasure devices during her support group? There's Raymond K. Hessel, the freaked out liquor store clerk who becomes Tyler's first (of supposedly many) ""human sacrifices"" and, Lou, the faux Mafioso who gets a 'mouthful' of Fight Club's foul purpose. And of course, there's Robert Paulson, the big softy with ""bitch tits"" who ends up representing the most powerful of Project Mayhem's many ubiquitous symbols.Far beyond Edward Norton and Brad Pitt, who play the rebel yell yin yang of a split personality with revolutionary leanings better than any single actor ever could, and a director so in tune with the material that it seems to be flowing directly out of his own Id, it's great to see this adaptation of Chuck Palahniuk's perturbing novel get the afterthought critical respect it so richly deserved (and yet missed) the first time. Yes, Messageboard Nation loves to rewrite the history books on all their favorite films, and to read their various rants on the subject, you'd swear this was 1999's most heavily praised and commercially successful film. In truth, the controversial nature of Fight Club's material - which many saw as a celebration of mindless violence and individual brutality - saw it as one of the decade's most divisive efforts. Only in hindsight did it become the black-eyed Mona Lisa.",Fight Club

Yes, not a soldier stifled under Washington as he pummeled himself while crossing the Delaware. The Rumble in the Jungle, except the Jungle manifested as a convoluted and nonsensical plot. The movie can be summed up with having Walter Mitty go through a traumatic childhood, and now lives out violent fantasies. Except the movie has no humor, no semblance of calculated dialog, a plot filled with more holes than a road sign off a southern highway. And that would have been bearable... If the movie wasn't so entrenched in pretense and a faux philosophical atmosphere. If Inception were Camus, then Fight Club is Eco. When Norton rolled down the stairs I expected his notes from Philosophy 101 to fly out of his pockets like a pinata from Goodwill. Boring movie, pretentious movie, garbage movie.

1254,The_paranoid_android,A film desperately trying to justify itself without succeeding,9,4 January 2006,"As you watch the film from the beginning, there is a chance for a deep film that goes inside the mind of the narrator (Edward Norton) and his counter-part Tyler Durden (Brad Pitt), and mostly the film succeeds for showing the slow transformation of the narrator into Tyler through the creation of an underground fight club. The premise works, however, there are too many times where the movie switches from the surreal to the utmost impossible. Though the film builds up in the first 2/3 the last is disappointing with just an idiotic ending plot along with an incoherent story. Though the narrator goes into a mode of ""self-discovery"" and the idea of man vs. himself in the end, which works, it isn't enough to save the film from keeling over from the abomination known as the human thirst for quick sell-outs for which the book version tries to state to all.

It tries to make the viewer understand the drama that the society plays and how each of us blindly plays our role in it, living the way society tells us and blindly assuming that it's the best way to live. The movie asks the viewer to question the society and it's various elements.

1259,RichardRowell328,The Best Movie Ever Made,10,6 January 2005,"As soon as I watched Fight Club at a friends house sometime in the year 2000, after it was released, I was amazed and fascinated by it. Fight Club is truly a film of the 21st century, revealing all the flaws in modern day society and bluntly verifying, challenging, and exhibiting philosophical ideas while enlightening all who watch it.Undoubtely, this movie faced much criticism in-part because it challenged the structure of society itself. The concept of giving up all hope is freedom is one of the best, and all extra subtle philosophies offered, and the experience of the movie itself is just truly a masterpiece. Fight Club was based on the novel by Chuck Palahniuk, who is the best modern novelist in the world. With no positive answers for anyone, this movie offers an inner satisfaction of destructive concepts.The collaboration which is perfect for the development of this film was great because it had superb acting from both Brad Pitt, Helena Bonham Carter, and especially Edward Norton (Edward Norton who enjoys making dysfunctional films). The film had a great connection between director David Fincher who incorporated his fantastic CGI abilities to the film along with the genius of novelist Chuck Palahniuk. Chuck Palahniuk who should be equally praised as well, writes in 1st-person narrative, with short-sentences and sentences contrasting with detail, pin-pointing perfection, Palahniuk expresses his dark (very unique) 1st-person experience in his book.Fight Club is a film that will be misunderstood by many, but from those who do understand it, will get too experience a contemporary masterpiece that reveals a true evolution in all ideas the lie in the destructive side of humanitarian spectrum.10/10",Fight Club

Coming out of this, I had respect for Brad Pitt, as an actor, I thought Edward Norton was one of the most cunningly funny guys out there, and Fight Club was/is the best movie of '99.  Although the movie may be very brutal ( in fact the overall gore is low, it's just how honest the film makers made it), foremost it is a dark comedy.  The film had me laughing at times that normally I wouldn't think is proper, but that is the point of this film.  The narrator wants you to see how everything means nothing, and nothing is to be taken seriously.  One point in this movie either loses you, or totally draws you in.  Personally, when the plot got crazier, I drooled for even more.  This movie is made to offend, engross, and enlighten.  If it does at least two of those, then it accomplishes what it set out to do.

On another level, as a film - as art, it fails miserably.This is the kind of movie you should watch with a relative detachment, because there's no reason to actually delve into the philosophy.  The point of the movie (if there is one) is simply to entertain the audience.  If the director/screenwriter/producer/cast meant it to be deeper, it got lost in the parody.I will admit that I was very entertained by the performances of all the leads, and even Meat Loaf was fun to watch in his small role.  However, this does not make up for the fact that Fight Club tries to play with your mind and give a new spin on random subjects like mass media, masculinity/violence, and society when in fact it spreads itself too thin and through the conclusion of the movie completely sullies whatever decent arguments it had.Bottom line: Watch it for pure fun, no more.

A real sign of the times, it's kind of like an ultra-violent schizophrenic version of 'Office Space' and even with all this mayhem it maintains a steady flow of comedy as well. The acting cannot be flawed with Edward Norton stealing the show but this is not to say Brad Pitt was not on form - he was brilliant as well. It was also nice to see Helena Bonham Carter taking on such a rough 90's role as opposed to the period dramas where she is normally cast. The social commentary presented via the narrator is absolutely venomous towards our times and spits out against corporate greed, consumerism and 90's apathy like nothing else I have ever seen. It's a film that you think about long after you have left the cinema - it's still lingering with me two days on.

The storyline is great, a little confusing, but not so much that you'll miss stuff as long as you pay attention to the movie.  The acting was great, Edward Norton reached the usual high standards that he has set from other fine performances.

Never have I seen a film which dazzled me so much visually and teased me mentally. Me and my friends are still discussing it now even though we watched it last week.I heard all the pre film hype before watching it and went in with an open mind and thought it was brilliant. The performances in the film are outstanding and Norton is rapidly becoming one of the most talented actors around. His performance in fight club is excellent and I was also personally amazed by Meat Loafs performance. I didn't think Fincher could make a film that would better Seven but I'd say Fight Club is now his most accomplished piece of work. You really have to admire David Finchers ability to use his undeniable talent to tell a story. Some of the visuals in this film simply ooze with originality, the Ikea catalogue walk through scene is pure and simply brilliant.     The one aspect that surprised me about Fight Club was not the corkscrew finale but how funny it was. At times especially in the opening third it had me and most of the audience in stitches.Movie making does not get any better than this, Fight Club is a thought provoking film.

There are simply too many different ideas vying for the viewers attention. Intellectuals have found acres and acres of meaning, which David Fincher wanted them too, although he knows that he has simply made an extremely pretentious and boring mess.

It's Jack's complete sense of the self-indulgence. That said, even the thinking man enjoys a bit of self-indulgence. And this is the greatest and most enjoyable example of a cognitive narcissism since Nietzsche. Mis-shapes, mistakes, misfits. Fight Club is a black comedy, a social satire and a clear statement appertaining to the pointlessness of your existence. So what if nihilism suffers from the cognitivity paradox, Pyrrhonism doesn't!

1278,lina-9,good idea to make this film,7,17 April 2000,"Fight Club  8/10 I had read the book before I saw the film. The book was very interesting but I can say I will not be a fan of this type of literature. David Fincher had good idea shooting a film from this book. The plot of the film followed the book's, and the view was good. But I have enough fantasy to imagine that is written in the book. I was shocked by each page of the book, yet I went on reading. The view of the film was not so frightened as I expected (I was thinking if I wanted to see this movie while I was reading the book), and there was a few things missed from the film. So the atmosphere, message of the book was not let in to the light during the film well.But I think the film can impress on somebody: somebody stand up and leave the movietheatre, somebody think about it. The cast was good. Edward Norton is one of my favourite actor, he did a perfect job here too.He is not muscular, but the force is with him.  He has charisma. I think the reason why Brad Pitt  wanted to do this film that he always wants audience not to see him like a nice guy. He did OK job, but for me he will never be Edward Norton. Yet I gave seven point to this film, because it is not an average action film, it has got a deeper message, can made people think, and cast was good. I think it is worth seeing, but I wouldn't recommend it to my parents.",Fight Club

We all have our own idiosyncrasies that colour how we view art and I respect other's views enough to know that nothing is categorical terrible (or brilliant) for every member of the audience.But, for me...I think Fight Club had something to say, but to me it didn't seem very original or subtle.  Among other themes in other films, I've seen the two identities thing done much better in David Lynch's Lost Highway and feel American Psycho did the male alienation in corporate America thing in a subtler (and funnier) way. Fight Club seemed so straightforward and obvious that I felt like the director was 'dumbing it down' for me, almost insulting my intelligence...I don't know, maybe it's just my taste.I'm glad so many people did get so much out of it though, that is one of the most important criteria for a film to have to be considered great, so I guess this is a great film.",Fight Club
1280,GilraenEstel,Extreme Violence or Just Plain Fun?,10,1 November 2000,"I must admit, when I first heard about Fight Club I thought it was just another Brad Pitt film which would have no depth or storyline.  Then when I discovered it co-starred the wonderful and extremely talented Edward Norton AND directed by David Fincher (the man who gave us Se7en), I just had to see it.Fight Club left me dumbfounded.  Never before have I walked out of a cinema feeling that I have to sit through a film all over again.The sheer brilliance of the plot, the acting, the script and the direction (not to mention the twists) makes Fight Club probably the best film of 1999 and one of the top ten films of the 1990's (we must not forget the brilliance of the Shawshank Redemption, Gods and Monsters and Leon).
Brad Pitt was wonderful as Tyler - I must admit I was surprised by how well he did.  Edward Norton was perfect as the Narrator, he was so sarcastic and so very convincing.  I cannot believe that the Academy didn't nominate him for a third time - his performance in Fight Club equaled that of American History X and was almost on par with Primal Fear.  I must admit, I'm not Helena Bonham Carter's biggest fan, but she did bring something to Marla's character that was truly amazing.As Tyler says - ""The first rule of Fight Club is that you don't talk about Fight Club"".  To be truthful, it's the only thing I COULD talk about and I reckon it will be the same for anybody.",Fight Club
1281,Tallgent,"All Pretension, No Punch",4,5 March 2000,"Arguably, nihilism in films is best personified by David Fincher, who in only three films has already set his stamp on filmmaking.  Of course, we didn't realize this until his second film which is the now classic ""Seven."" But in retrospect ""Seven "" was as bleak and despairing as anything done in mainstream cinema, and it was a Hollywood thriller no less.  Then came ""The Game,"" a disappointment, but with the intriguing premise of a bottled-up and unemotional man who in the course of his nightmarish ""game"" learns to live again.  ""Carpe Diem"" a la Kafka.  This same premise is put into a societal point of view with ""Fight Club.""This is also Fincher's first literary adaptation.  ""Fight Club"" comes to us via the novel written by Chuck Palahniuk.  The film relates the story of a successful, yet depressed young man (Edward Norton) who has become an insomniac.  He has a swanky apartment, catalog-ordered furniture, and a respectable position in a firm, yet he feels like he is missing out on life. He can't feel emotion anymore.  On a whim, he visits a cancer-crisis group and bonds with Bob, played by Meatloaf, who now has breasts because of a rare cancer (insert laughter here).  This bonding and emotional intimacy leads to catharsis and release, especially when he weeps between Bob's ample breasts.  Not surprisingly, Norton sleeps well.Things are moving along great.  Never mind that he's using these victims as emotional pumps, the point is he feels again.  Then comes an uninvited femme fatale played with unabashed scuzziness by Helena Bonham-Carter...and she used to do Merchant-Ivory?Because of this fellow emotional sponge, Norton must look elsewhere. Enter Tyler Durden (Brad Pitt): Soap salesman and excrement chef who urinates in his customers' soups.  These two bond by beating the crap out of each other. ""I want you to hit me as hard as you can, "" Durden says.  Norton obliges by punching his ear.Soon though, a friendship is formed and Norton loses his pad thanks to a freak fire.  Norton stays with Durden and the two continue to pummel each other.  Naturallly, other men gravitate.  Finally, a club is established in which white-collar, civil, and cultured gentlemen become primal gladiators in a self-imposed ring.  The object:  Fight so one can feel masculine again.As with anything purely physical (and make no mistake that is exactly what it is) Durden decides to up the ante a tad and create a full-fledged urban terrorism group.  Nihilism by way of Fascism.  You see, ""Fight Club"" is about destroying the modern spineless society so that men can go back to what they truly are, hunters.  Only problem is where does one draw the line?First off, the positive.  ""Fight Club"" is technically brilliant. Audacious and stylistic, Fincher plays with our tale being told by Norton's narrator. So Norton talks directly to the camera, stops the film for a bit of background information on characters, and lets other characters comment as well.  Durden explaining his story is hilarious and twisted.  The camera swoops into Norton's brain at one point and we take a stroll around his pad even seeing the price for each item.  The energy is infectious and the acting by all the principles, especially Norton and Carter are top-notch.Is there any negative?  Yep.I felt dirty watching this film.  I felt the same way when watching ""Natural Born Killers.""  Yes, it was satire as I'm sure ""Fight Club"" is as well. But the satire seems to be unfocused.  What  exactly is the point of seeing guys pummel each other and pick fights with innocents?  Does Fincher support the premise of violence to save souls or are they all doomed anyway?  And I must be getting soft, but there were scenes that grossed me out, specifically the human fat scene (Don't ask).  Satire does not work by exaggeration alone; there needs to be purpose.  That's something ""A Clockwork Orange"" had. Yes, it was violent and disturbing.  But there was a point to the film. Science cannot curb man's morality nor should it.  What does ""Fight Club"" say, let's all revert back to cavemen?  Sorry, not interested.The ending is just plain dumb.  I will not reveal anything, but be prepared for pretension deluxe.A friend of mine compared this film to ""American Beauty"" saying that both films dealt with changing one's humdrum existence into a life full of meaning.  But ""Beauty"" had something that ""Fight Club"" lacked.  Humanity. At the end of ""Beauty"", Lester Burnham thinks he has found purpose in enjoying life again, but he realizes that his life had purpose all along because of his family.  Burnham comes full circle.  We never get that kind of revelation in ""Club.""  The selfishness in achieving nirvana through nihilism remains and a hollowness remains at the film's center.Fincher's movies are disturbing, that's just a given.  But their saving grace, especially in the case of ""Seven,"" is their imagination and story. ""Fight Club"" has its imagination as well.  However, because of its trite story, I can't say it was a saving anything.",Fight Club

I really came to appreciate the movie after my second viewing. What I came to realize is that this movie had something to offer that wasn't for everyone: the blatent and underlying truths. The movie is very true, all of the things about life, the world, people. Don't get caught up in the violence, if you dislike it understand why you do so.  If only for the violence watch it again for the content.  It is a great movie with something real to say, a rarity in this age.",Fight Club

1284,caseychief,"Interesting, but overrated",6,3 June 2001,"Yes, Fight Club has an amazing twist in it, and that twist did blow me away. It also starts out strong with Edward Norton, who is one of my favorite actors, in a therapy group meeting some interesting people.However, as the plot kept rolling, it became too over-the-top for its own good.  The movie was supposed to be about finding out who the true you is, but yet all of the ""followers"" had no personality at all.  They were just drones, and I didn't buy into the fact that so many people would be involved in this ""Project Mayhem"", without somebody getting a conscience and blowing the lid off of it.  I call this the ""JFK"" syndrome, where everybody and their dog is involved with the conspiracy.  Completely unrealistic, and movie gets really bogged down with it.The plot twist and the excellent performances by Norton and Pitt were enough for me to recommend you watch this once.  But in my opinion, this movie was not nearly good enough to be rated in the top 250 of all time.  Highly overrated. 6/10",Fight Club
1285,munrod13,"In a word, a ""revolutionary"" film. (slight spoiler, nothing big)",10,15 October 2006,"No amount of twists, turns, or spirals in any movie that came out previous or since this movie could amount to the level of trickery played on the audiences of this movie. This is mind bending mystery, combined with great action sequences, a little neo-post-hip romantic tragedy, avante-guard narration and dialog, and political agenda that is not used to smack you in the face for effect but to subtly guide the plot, at its best. The single greatest thing about this movie is it's well-roundedness. True it's a man's man's movie, with all the brutal bare knuckle fight scenes, but there is something there for the man (and woman) with an intelligence quotient above 100, as well. It's about a man who suffers from schizophrenia/split personality disorder, whose hallucinations have blown the top off his sanity in the biggest way. Actually I should say hallucination, cause there's only one. This character conflict alone, is the basis for all the on screen antics and groundbreaking narrative style, which highlight poor mental health as the central theme. Of course, in the trailers and even for some, the first viewing, this is not made obvious. Not only is this not obvious but neither is the fact that the main character is schizophrenic.There's only one line that really let's you in on that fact, and it is for all practical purposes a mere innuendo, barely spoken, certainly not blatant, and is almost superfluous to the overlying action plot, so much so that it is not even spoken of at length for the until the end of the movie, where it is made clearly obvious in a very nonreal way. To play down the pronunciation of this little fact is pure genius since the whole movie revolves around the understanding of that bit of information, on an intellectual level. Even if you don't pick up on this data the movie still stands up without the realization. I mean, we don't even find out till we're more than three fourths through the film, so the plot has no problem building speed and tension until this point, and even after we are supposedly in on the gig and missed it, it still has a huge narrative value going for it because the crescendo is just around the corner and we are simply awaiting the moment when all the other characters, some of which are in the realm of sanity and some of which are not (although each character's sanity is a matter of opinion and up for debate), come crashing into the detonation point and go through a ripple in reality known as their fate.Other points which make this one of the best films ever made: 1. The acting, although a little tongue in cheek at times, is phenomenal. 2. This is a movie that is played out to be extremely fun and comedic, which makes the movie great simply because it is not blatantly trying to be some huge profound reflection on life, and despite of this fact the movie is; 3. very serious at its core. By this I mean it's themes, namely insanity and the harsh realities for members of the lower-middle to low class males trying to have a life worth living, and the ways that these two closely related subjects (as in the way that they both entail a poverty in aspects of each of the spheres which many would assume are standard, i.e. the basic necessities of life like food, clothing, and shelter, and the basic necessities of thought, i.e. clarity and lack of hallucinations) interact on a moral plane (is it wrong to judge someone because they suffer from either poverty of the mind or poverty of possessions). 4. The coloring and photography is totally awesome. and 5. It is a film with a lot of integrity and truth through out, in spite of and at the same time because of, its humor which is 'darkly lit' at times. Like I said 'revolutionary' and one of the best films ever made. A must see for any movie fanatic!",Fight Club

1288,johnblox,Worst Ad Campaign for best film in History?,10,30 October 2001,"Like other Hollywood Haters, I avoided this film on the basis of the ad campaigns. When I finally rented the DVD, I watched it once then again, then babysat others through it and ended up watching it about 6 times in a month. Why I kept watching It I dunno I was mesmerized like a rubbernecker at a motorway death circus. I know the story, how it begins, how it ends and yet still feel the need to look just one last time to confirm that I haven't missed anything. I had an argument with a friends wife who proclaimed that he hadn't seen it as he didn't like that sort of film. I asked her did she not enjoy it then, finally after a few minutes it dawned on me that the stupid American b**** hadn't even seen the film, yet KNEW he wouldn't like it? She took offence saying ""how dare I say she doesn't know her husband"", now where did that come from? I laughed at the arrogance of one who can proscribe the film intake of another when they haven't even partaken of it themselves.We live in the era of the Super Disinformation Highway, so it is hardly surprising. Maybe the ad campaign was deliberately miss-run in order that the film would end up in cultsville which it deserves to. It seemed symptomatic of the times, ""Hey its a new millennium and who really gives a S**k (which is it s*** or f***? maybe 'SHUK' a new hybrid from some LA Project... Yawn!!!). No one buys into the lies of the work ethic any longer, we all know its a necessary evil, we all hate it, we all entertain fantasies of surviving world war three, out with the old in with the new. Well this movie is that great thing that captures the mood of the western world circa 2000. Science has explained it all, we all know the truth, there is no god, no purposeful future but must carry on and carry on pretending as there is no more worthwhile alternative. We can all live out our destructive fantasies suppressed by years of evolution and training. Then again its only a movie.Summing up - you MUST watch this film, there's only about 5 films ever made that are worth watching more than once (Naked?, Withnail...), this is one of them. After watching it, I did genuinely make some life changing decisions. I'm only here at IMDB cos I came looking for other Edward Norton stuff - he rocks hardcore. The new DeNiro, great to see them together in 'The Score'. I just hope Norton picks good scripts and doesn't blow his cool. PS - Anyone know where I can get a Tyler-Durdan Jacket from?",Fight Club
1289,kentuckyfriedpanda42,This film changed my life.,10,23 April 2008,"Where to start? It's been nearly ten years since ""Fight Club"" was released. I saw it for the first time in about four years yesterday. I still find it both truly inspired and truly inspiring. Some of the themes and concepts that the film explores have become even more relevant in this day and age.Why? This is the film that crystallized a great deal of pain, rage and emotion with a great deal of viewers, including myself. When I first saw this, I worked a job I hated for a phenomenally racist and homophobic person, I'm not gay, but I'm semi-intelligent, speak politely, like foreign films and alternative bands. Therefore, people with small minds judge me as a result.""Fight Club"" taught me to be true to myself. It was also one of the first building stones that lead to me quitting the profession in which I worked. Not probably the normal reaction, but the scene where Tyler says to the bodega worker that if he comes back and sees him working the same job made me start crying.This film and Darren Aronofsky's masterpiece ""Requiem For A Dream"" helped me to find the courage to change my life in so many different ways and to embrace this life and live it to the fullest.For that, I say thank you.",Fight Club
1290,Beachwood,Over Rated,4,31 December 2002,"Fight Club, by David Fincher, is the story of a man who comes to grip with the daily monotony that is his everyday life, by starting a club in which friends beat each other senselessly in hopes of having a good time.  This movie had all the right ingredients to be a great film.  With the help of superlative performances and brilliant photography, Fight Club is quite a picture.  However, the dark aspects of the film and preposterous climax make it hard for one to watch without cringing or laughing in the wrong spots. Fight Club takes many turns that are completely nonsensical in hopes of making a political statement about United States economic culture. Nevertheless it is hard for one to listen to statements such as these without questioning where the money came from to make such a film.  Fight Club is defiantly an inventive film but in the end like the Portland Trailblazers, it just doesn't `click.'",Fight Club

1293,rwtmoore,Another Emperor's New Clothes,2,26 March 2009,"It's amazing that anyone thought this was watch-able, never mind brilliant. The acting, camera work and music are all good, but the story is so absurd, it had me laughing out loud. I can understand that a fight club could come to be, but this story has it wrapped up in anti-consumerism  and other heady subjects. It just doesn't fly. Show me one backyard boxing enthusiast with these intellectual ideals. They're in it for the fighting. At least show me how the first fight club member was inducted. Two guys start it and the next thing you know there are a hundred members willing to die for their leader. When did that and happen and how? These are huge unanswered questions and without the answers it makes the whole thing seem so implausible that I could not suspend my disbelief.The thing about the body organs was shoe-horned in to give some novel-like cohesiveness, but when they transferred it using statements like, ""This is Jack's complete lack of surprise,"" it became a ridiculous sophomoric device. The attempts at humor were embarrassing. It's good to add some humor to lighten the tension, but here the gags seemed to be dropped in from a Farrelly Brothers movie and were so out-of-place that it seemed that the movie had an identity crisis. Also, the gags were childish and weren't funny. Helena Bonham Carter's character was not only completely unbelievable, but also superfluous. The character could be removed and the overall story would not change one bit. So, why is this character here? I found all the characters to be unbelievable and absurd. Their motivations and dialog made little or no sense at all. Sometimes the dialog and narration seemed to be selected just to make a character say something provocative, even if it made no sense. The scenes where Ed Norton was beating himself up was like watching a MST3K episode, only I was filling in the commentary. And near the end we get a bizarre twist that's really just a cheap trick by the filmmaker. I felt cheated because I was led down a path without enough information to put together the reality. In ""The Sixth Sense"" or ""A Beautiful Mind"", they left the door open, so at the end you realize all the info was there. In ""Fight Club"" you are summarily duped. Overall, this film seems like the work of an edgy high school student  all style, no substance and a bunch of quirky, edgy characters that couldn't possibly exist.",Fight Club

Against the system, it grabs your intention from the beginning. You wont expect what the story brings you until you reach the end. I really hope to watch something like this again.

Fight Club is the Best Movie of All Time. Holy cow, so why?This is a story about an ordinary guy.  You can relate to this guy.  He could be the guy you sit next to on the bus.  He could be the guy you work with.  He could be your closest friend.  He could be you, or me.  An ordinary guy, a guy you know.  A guy you can relate to and feel involved with.  Now what possibly could happen to an ordinary guy that's so interesting that some anonymous person on the Internet says it's the best movie of all time...Well, many things I guess.  There are lots of movies about ordinary guys that have interesting stuff happen to them.  So why is this one so good?It's cool.  Ed Norton is cool.  Brad Pitt is cool.  Helena Bonna Carter is cool.  Hey, I never thought I'd say this but even Meat Loaf is cool.  If they were your friends, you'd be the coolest kid in school.  No question. You feel cool just watching this movie.  The story is a little out there, but hey, that's all part of the fun.
The Dust Brothers are the pulse behind the action that sets the momentum for the film.  From the opening credits we are into the action and from there it doesn't stop.  It doesn't slow down; it just takes you on a ride, which if you let it, will take you to a place worth visiting over and over again.Although a great movie, it is not for everyone.  So don't kid yourself. If you don't like violence in movies you won't like this movie.  If you don't like being confronted you won't like this movie. Some seemingly misunderstand the message behind the film, or take it too literally.  If you're not sure, and you're going to view this movie I urge you to keep an open mind.Ed Norton & Brad Pitt both give their best performances to date.  They are cast so well and are believable in their rolls.  But you know the best thing about this movie?  Well, I cannot tell you.  Can I suggest you stop reading the user comments now or some idiot will spoil it for you.  Just see it. Take the ride. 10/10",Fight Club

After few years I watched it again, and this time I ended up speechless. The depth of the characters the minute details and of course the dialog's all were perfect, not to mention the score and the opening scene. The chemistry between Edward Norton and Brad Pitt is perfect. I recommend everyone to watch this masterpiece. The movie deals with materialism, social norms and the machine life that we all are living. A dark twisted yet humorous at time, Fight Club proved that it will forever stand the test of time.",Fight Club
1298,DonnyMovieMan,It Had Some Major Problems For Me,8,16 January 2014,"So I re-watched Fight Club for the first time in a few years, having liked it very much the first time. David Fincher is a fantastic director and the directing in this movie is pretty fantastic. The editing and other elements are also of highest order, as Fincher's films usually are. My problems with the film lie within the script, which seems to get totally lost in itself. Fight Club's themes of consumerism and materialism and existentialism are obvious, since they are in the foreground, not tying to hide in the background for interpretation. If you think you're a movie buff for understanding this, you're not. It's simple to understand but is at the same time thought provoking, since the movie is about big ideas. Free yourself from society. Accept that your life is meaningless. Destroy yourself to find out who you really are. You are capable of more than you think. Fight Club states these ideas as blatantly as I just did. It shows the main characters being freed and we root for them, but really, do we see a whole lot of benefit to this lifestyle? The film seems to suggest that there is an extent to which this lifestyle becomes dangerous and is unhealthy, yet the film still glorifies it, suggesting no middle ground as to how far we should carry out its philosophies, other than going insane and causing an apocalypse. Another problem I felt was that the ""space monkeys"" in the film are all freeing themselves from being slaves to their possessions and society, yet they act like drones when embracing Tyler's philosophies. They become just as much victims to fight club and project mayhem as they were to their societies rules.Is the point of the movie to lose yourself in these ideas? To become a slave to new philosophies in exchange for being a slave to society? The last few minutes seems to suggest that Norton's character regrets his actions and that he has gone too far, but where, does the film suggest, is the middle ground? Despite all this, Fight Club is electrifying and hyper throughout in a way that few movies are and for that it is worth seeing. The ideas are good, but lose track of themselves. Only fanboys think this is one of the best films of all time. It's not, you only like it cause it's cool and you think you're a member of a cult.",Fight Club

This film shows the danger of a society in which you are judged by your possessions alone, and what happens to people who feel they don't have a voice are organised by a charismatic leader. The fight club itself is a clever male bonding device to draw in new recruits and toughen them up before the revolution. Great camera tricks only add to the plot, Pitt Norton and Carter are great, nice cameo by Meatloaf great directing by Fincher.",Fight Club
1300,esandfor,I am Jack's favorite movie of all time,10,15 October 2003,"*** Possible Spoilers ***I've watched this movie at least 10 times, and never get bored with it. It's fast paced, well acted, and perfectly cast.  Edward Norton is dynamite as the sardonic narrator, and Brad Pitt puts in what may be his best performance ever, as the enigmatic and charismatic Tyler Durden.  Strong supporting roles from Meatloaf and Helena Bonham Carter help to round out a memorable group of characters.This is a tale about a 30-something middle class white American man who has lost his soul.  He's had his human spirit beaten out of him by his pointless job, and by the values forced upon society by the mass marketing efforts of large corporations.  His dispair causes him to suffer from insomnia, and the only relief he can get comes from attending support groups for diseases he does not have.Norton, who plays this young man, credited only as ""Narrator"", has a chance meeting with Tyler Durden (Pitt), and through a series of circumstances, they come to live together.  Tyler shows him another way to live, letting go of his attachment to material possessions, and working his way toward ""hitting bottom"".  This new lifestyle offers a new freedom, and a new inspiration for him, but as Tyler keeps raising the stakes, he finds it harder and harder to cope.Carter plays Marla, a down and out, eccentric woman who Norton meets at his support groups.  She goes to these groups for the entertainment they offer, and for the free coffee.  Norton is in love with Marla, although he won't admit it to himself, and a strange love triangle develops when Marla ends up sleeping with Tyler.Norton is the poster child for a generation of lost souls like himself, and ultimately finds out that he is not alone. When he and Tyler begin to hold regular fights with each other outside of a sleazy bar late at night, others are attracted to the action.  They ask to join in.  Tyler organizes them into ""Fight Club"" which becomes a type of therapy for these young men who share Norton's disillusionment with life.Fight Club is only the beginning.  Tyler proves to be a natural leader, and soon turns the club into something so much more than what it was at first. Norton becomes frightened by the escalations, and fights to keep control of his life.  If you've never seen the film before, you're in for a surprise that will leave you wanting to watch it again, seeing it through the eyes of one who is ""in the know.""Be warned, if you hate to watch violence, this may not be the film for you. Reviewers defend the film, saying there is more violence in the first 10 minutes of the critically acclaimed ""Saving Private Ryan"" than there is in this entire move.  This may be true, but Fight Club's violence is more personal.  It's an in your face type of violence which forces you to sit up and take notice.  If you can handle a few broken teeth and black eyes without getting squeamish, then you're in for a treat.This movie can be disturbing at times.  It is nihilistic, provocative, insensitive, and violent, but it is extremely well done.  For me, it was fresh and unpredictable.  You may not like it, but you won't be bored by it. I give it 4 stars, two thumbs up, and a bar of soap.",Fight Club

Is this the extent of self-proclaimed victimization that is taking over American culture? Disturbingly to any intellectuals, this movie's amorality passes itself off under the guise of reason -- as if the central character has a logic to his rage and subsequent violent decisions -- as if the poor young white businessman who's been educated well and raised in an upper middle class lifestyle with all the benefits really is some sort of victim of retail stores. Is it really proving a coherent point to blow something up? It's even more upsetting to think about this after seeing 9-11 take this film's logic into reality...is the point of this movie to say that American commercial freedom SHOULD be attacked? With all the sexification and glamorizing of violence, and its poor-me ranting against consumer products (rather than taking responsibility for one's own commercialism or participation in it), it's hard to find a redeemable net-sum to this movie. Ed Norton is, as always, terrific. Brad Pitt very good in this role too. And I very much appreciate the filmmaker's talent, but I wish he would use it for something that was thoughtful.",Fight Club

David Fincher's dark, gritty style of filming along with Jeff Cronenweth's superb cinematography give Fight Club a visual style that makes you feel dirty just watching it.  Jim Uhls' adaptation of Chuck Palahniuk's novel is faithful to both the book's original story, anti-society based themes and nihilistic attitude, and after reading and watching both, it's hard to say which I like more.Despite my distaste for him as an actor, Brad Pitt was EXCELLENT as Tyler Durden, though at times (very rarely), I did feel as if he didn't really believe in what he was saying.  Edward Norton, one of today's most underrated, tallented and versatile actors, stands out as The Narrator, subservient office sheep one second, nihilistic underground terrorist the next.  And Helena Bonham Carter is surprisingly good as Marla Singer, the perpetual thorn in The Narrator's side.All in all, 10 out of 10, 100%; an EXCELLENT piece of cinematic history.",Fight Club
1304,marvalyz,What you can accomplish if you lose your morals,5,3 January 2013,"Let me get this out & clear that I LOVE ""Reservoir Dogs"" and am NOT against violence in movies OR in for ""Stories with Morals"". BUT I am also the average ""Joe"" portrayed by Ed Norton, and I will NOT set my Condo on fire to ""get out"" of the rut that is my life as I am sure any average Joe wouldn't do. We, after all, don't get the title to wreck it, right? The movie is not bad in that it's terribly impossible to miss. Now if the plot flies three feet above your head is something different but hold judgment as there definitely is a very specific plot.First , the movie comes out at a time of relative peace and financial stability , then it talks about war , terrorism , corporations and yes buildings being bombed. Yes , that happens too , all before it happens in real life. Average Joes are lured into fights , then oppression, then vandalism and we the audience are told that ""Fights"" are a way to fight, forgive me , Cancer? Brad Pitt looks as good as the devil himself. He also, encompasses the part of our mind that is ""trapped"" behind morals.The same part that we are taught to ""keep in check"". He tells us we need to ""lose control"". Before he takes in Ed Norton , he asks him to ""Hit me"" and there they go. Watching the movie unfold is like watching McDonald's sell their latest ""Spicy"" burger against the tight resolves of someone trying to cut weight.Overall my insides cringe at the aftermath of ""Fight Club"". The violence, gore, subliminal messages, the timing and some tight and neat slaps on the face of faith make this movie the best advertisement of a very well thought agenda. For setting the stage for a perpetual violence that has engulfed our world in the last 11 years or so since it's release and for selling violence and hate dressed as the irresistible Mr.Pitt, and for admitting sexuality is ingrained in the minds of children through subliminal messages, I also term it as the A-rated porn produced by Hollywood, which would force you to strip off your common sense and good judgment, rather than your clothes. And that has already happened! Let's not forget that a big majority of audiences DO NOT remember that good defeated evil in a movie.They only remember how powerful or slick or funny or smart the evil was. Or they would only remember the character that had those traits in the movie. And in a movie like ""Fight Club"" even the good guy doesn't remember if he is the good guy or if he is the bad guy. All he remembers , over and over again is ""Tyler Durden"" this name is repeated more than Ed's own name and as I write this , I have also forgotten what was the name of Ed Nortorn's character? So what are the odds people would remember the good from bad,the terrorists from Cancer patients, the average Joe from Tyler Durden?If you don't wanna go in that direction, the ""MOVIE"" as a product is awesome.

This movie is a philosophical movie that reveals the flaws of the modern human society. The entire movie is bordered on fiction and reality that interplay each other and the vehicle of the plot that moves the needle seem to be the brief lapses in the thinking of a person who begins to muse on his life. The flow of story is told through the eyes of a person who tries to break free from that materialistic life of consumerism by engaging in a taboo, breaking free from that commercial lifestyle of 9-5 and the subsequent desire to purchase and consume products. Edward Norton portrays the protagonist who gradually realizes the flaws of the consumer culture, and begins to untether himself as he fights his way to enlightenment to find a deeper meaning in life. there is so much philosophical underlinings that are abstruse but can be deciphered by the audience through reflecting on the reality and the delusions presented in form of Tyler Durden and his club. In some sense, there is a Tyler Durden (Brad Pitt) in all of us, a better us that wants us to break free from our slumber in a lethargic loop of constant gratification of our material desire for things that give us the momentary happiness. This movie seems to use Edward Norton as the pariah who joins the Fight Club that revolts against materials and promotes individualism and self-empowerment through gaining knowledge of the true human potential for self-awareness and greatness. This is one of those rare movies that is suspended in a delirium that crosses between fact and fact, and it is has a surfeit philosophical treasures glimmering beneath the surface, waiting to be extracted by those who are willing to dig them out by joining the Fight Club and finding their inner Tyler Durden.",Fight Club

After a few minutes of film, comes into play Brad Pitt with his unique and personal style, from this moment we can't stop the film anymore.After the merge of the great performances of Brad Pitt and Norton, the film becomes a full madness, insanity at every scene, and the most fun is that at the end of the film we discover that all that madness is actually alive within each one of us!",Fight Club

You will enjoy every second. But put for your note: this movie is made especially for young male audience. It is humorous in a very smart way I'm surprised it didn't even get nominated for best screenplay. Oh the acting was amazing. Brad Pitt and Edward Norton made great performances in this movie. The sound and music makes it all better. Just brilliant! The movie was surprisingly ambitious. It changed many things in my life and I'm very thankful to David Fincher and all the terrific cast. However bored you are, if you start watching this movie you won't fall asleep. It has the effect of caffeine, although it tastes a bit better than coffee. Whoo! What a movie!",Fight Club

However, I couldn't agree less.While I enjoyed the style, editing and overall creativity the story left me with an empty feeling. It takes way too long to finally take off and I can't help but feel like this movie shouldn't have been any longer than around 1 hour and 30 minutes.The ending disappointed me, It felt like a 2 hour wait in line for a rollercoaster ride that never really leaves the station. After the first 30 minutes I could've already guessed it would end like this.Don't get me wrong, I get why people like this film and I understand the appeal. But, should this film be in the top 250 on iMDB and is it one of the best films ever made? I don't think so. It's scores points on creativity and originality but I've seen better films that don't get the recognition this one gets. However, I do think this is a must watch!",Fight Club

It engages the watcher with nonlinear story that moves faster than the speed of a thought. It deals with modern issues of society and ages very well. It has an unbeatable plot and great acting. Fight Club has the watcher flinching constantly and it is amazing how this holds true. It is not surprising at all how this movie is still considered good 17 years later. Brad Pitt and Edward Norton fit their roles perfectly. The narrative infuses the author's voice into the movie and the character. If you enjoy great movies you will enjoy this one.",Fight Club
1312,cornerstorebitch,A visually stunning movie which is gayer than you think it is,8,11 December 2015,"Something that surprises me pretty consistently is how popular this movie is among heterosexual dudebro types. It's not that I don't respect their ability to recognize a good movie, you know, sometimes, but usually they pick something a little less... homoerotic. And if this movie is anything, it's homoerotic.That said! This movie is visually stunning with an incredible and memorable soundtrack. The editing and cinematography work well together to create a full picture that is haunting, and nihilistic without being overbearingly so as other movies tend to unfortunately sway into. It managed to maintain a sallow overall coloring but used enough vivid color to emphasize just enough (the soap and the human fat, which are both florescent shades are good examples of this)that the otherwise toned down coloring doesn't become boring.It possess emotional depth which manages to stick with you after you watch it, and fulfills my ultimate requirement of ""Say Something"" movies in that it posses questions for the viewer to ponder but, at least in my opinion, doesn't really give you the answer to them.Brad Pitt, Edward Norton, and Helena Bonham Carter all give impressive performances and I maintain that this is one of Brad Pitt's better performances by far.Also did I mention that this movie is like really gay because. It's really gay you guys. The fact that it's really gay makes it a better movie. It's so gay it pains me.Overall my only complaints are that sometimes the character writing for Marla could get a little cringe worthy and borderline misogynistic in my humble opinion and the story could get a little clunky in parts toward the end of the 2nd act/beginning of the 3rd, but otherwise, very very good movie.",Fight Club
1313,jbaur-98503,"Fight Club: fights, terror and soap",10,10 January 2016,"The first rule about Fight Club is ""you don't talk about Fight Club."" Guess I have to break that rule. In this Fincher classic based on the Chuck Palahniuk novel of the same name the viewer accompanies the nameless protagonist on a spectacular journey. This is my favorite movie of all time, and I don't have much to criticize about. This is a movie everybody should have seen. Let me tell you why.At the beginning of the film the Narrator works a car company and has insomnia. A chain of events leads to the introduction of Tyler Durden, a soap producer and bohemian. Together the two start a fight club. Men participate for different reasons; the Narrator does this to be able to sleep, Tyler, to upset the basic societal structure. I don't want to tell more about the story. It's a thrilling experience everyone has to take in on his own. The story is absolutely mind blowing and fascinating. Edward Norton is one of my favorite actors of modern time, and while his performance in American History X certainly competes with the one as the Narrator here, I think this is his best performance to date, because you can really sympathize with him. Brad Pitt and Helena Bonham Carter both play very extravagant, crazy characters. They both play these characters very well, especially Pitt's Tyler Durden is one of the most iconic movie characters of the 90's if not even movie history. Jared Leto (Angeleyes), Meat Loaf (Bob) and Zach Greiner (The Narrator's Boss) also contribute to the quality of this movie.Some critics say the message of Fight Club is pure anarchy. I say it goes a lot deeper, but I can't say how without spoiling it. Fight Club also has a special look. Most of the film is dark, either due to night or weak lighting. This works in harmony with the overall dark tone of the plot. Single scenes also have there uniqueness due to cool dialog, memorable quotes and some very dark humor. The soundtrack is composed by the Dust Brothers and consists mainly of electronic music. Personally, not my type of music, but it fits the film and I quite enjoy the tracks ""Stealing Fat"" and ""Jack's Smirking Revenge"". And, off course, there is ""Where is my Mind"", performed by the Pixies. I love the song very much. The song ""Going Out West"" by Tom Waits is almost just as awesome.So, Fight Club is a film with gripping story, interesting characters, quotable dialog, amazing acting performances, unique style, a political message, humor and fitting soundtrack. in short: the perfect movie. 10/10",Fight Club

Fight Club (1999):
The greatest psychological thriller I have seen. Recommended to me by my cousin, the movie talks about philosophy of pain and change. It will shatter your beliefs about life and death. It will take you to the journey to explore how powerful human mind can be. The stoicism is the main philosophy highlighted in the movie. You will feel numb after finishing the movie. I recommend you this video to understand the deep philosophy and psychology as shown in the movie. It is inevitable that after finishing the movie and video, you will take a moment to reflect and introspect your own life.",Fight Club

1321,theo47,You are not ready for Fight Club,10,14 October 1999,"Fight Club. I'd read the book (twice), but it still didn't prepare me for seeing it. It's brilliant, jarring, amazing -- and I can't recommend it to anyone. Put simply, you are not ready for Fight Club. These are images and ideas that you are not ready to handle. Where's the choreographed fights, the romantic subplot, the happy ending? Not here. I counted three or four walkouts at the preview screening I attended. Upset that you paid $9 for the cinematic equivalent of a punch to the gut? Sorry. This movie is disturbing in the best sense of the word. And funny as hell. Can't figure out that knawing feeling? The discontentment, the anger, the insanity of day-to-day life? Fight Club will show you, even if it has to beat it out of you. Want a nice night out at the movies? Don't go. Want more? Do you need more? Then put up your dukes and join in.",Fight Club
1322,trimbo,"Good, not great [8/10]",10,17 October 1999,"Like all David Fincher movies, Fight Club is very pretty.  Seven demanded that it be seen on film at least once.  I think Fight Club, which also looks like it was processed with ENR, is in the same category.  There are some incredible, unexpected effects in this movie as well.  Definitely check out the super-macro-lens effects.About halfway through, I thought Fight Club would be a 10/10 -- and then it suddenly grinds to a halt.  Almost all movies are too long and this is no exception.  I would bet that about half-an-hour could be easily cut from this movie.  The end result is interesting, but it just didn't seem to work. It may that things didn't translate well from the book... I'll have to read it to find out.I think that Fincher has learned a lot with respect to directing actors.  I walked out of Seven asking myself if that was really Morgan Freeman on the screen or some impostor.  The Game was saved by the overwhelming talent/personality of Sean Penn and Michael Douglas, especially Penn, who is a genius.  In Fight Club, Pitt was good and his comic timing was definitely on.  But, I'm convinced that Pitt's best role will always be the stoner in True Romance.  Norton, whose performance in Primal Fear blew me away, was just kind of blah here.  Meat Loaf played a really nice character.Anyway, do see it.  You'll either like it or hate it, which is usually a sign of a good movie.",Fight Club
1323,Luvfilms-2,Not What You Expect,8,5 June 2000,"I agreed with my husband to rent this movie if he would also rent a ""chick flick"" for me! I was very pleasantly surprized by this movie. Edward Norton is wonderful as always, spinning his character's web around the viewer until Wham...he gets you! Helena Bonham Carter was outrageous! I think of her in period pieces like Room With A View, Howard's End or Twelfth Night. She is the perfect anti-social, bi-polar, opinionated, cheap chic urban wench. Brad Pitt was ""over the top"" (even his clothes are oddly in your face) as the fight club co-founder -which was exactly the right portrayal. Meatloaf was also notable as Bob.The final minutes of the film, you begin to put it all together along with Norton and wonder why you never saw it before! I usually can spot a plot twist a mile off but this was superbly done. Don't miss this movie because you think it will be just another testosterone flood.",Fight Club

The plot, the book, the music, and, certainly, the two main actors ( Norton and Pitt) play at they best. In my country, it was a short time on the cinemas, but whoever saw it had the best comments on it. I won´t say the plot - it is already summarized - you have to EXPERIENCE it to know  how this movie is at the very top of the 250 top movies.

1326,Dean Snow,Best film of 1999,10,17 December 1999,"Fight Club was produced by a major Hollywood studio.  It had a budget of $60 million+.  It is not your average big-budgeted studio film.  In fact, it has very few qualities of a big-budgeted studio film.  At it's least, it is raw, provocative, original (although a lot of Tyler Durden's philosophy is very Neitzsche-esque), idiosyncratic, and entertaining.  It is commentary on consumerism, materialism, trends, addictions, office work, indentity crisis, blind faith, sheep, capitalism and everything else that makes up modern society in America (Americana). The basic outline is about a worker-bee fed up with is daily routine and doing something about it.**** out of ****.

Dark, hell practically black, humor woven with realistic brutal violence mark this movie as one of my favorites.  And yes, a girl can like this movie.  Although most of the audience were males between the ages of 18-26 by my guess.  David Fincher who directed Seven, also with Pitt, and The Game follows his style with the dark atmosphere and strange coloring. The disoriented and manic scenes almost made you feel as if you'd been in a fight.  At times when the fighting got intense, a humorous scene or line (usually by Brad Pitt) followed, breaking up the somewhat harshness.  Don't be afraid to like this movie, because if you are... I'll break your arm:)",Fight Club

I had theluxury of watching it in a home theater system with a very goodsurround sound setup, but I can tell it will still be incredible in anyenvironment because of the absolute depth of the acting and story. Ibelieve that there have been several good overviews of the story, sowill not delve into that, I will merely state that after watching it twice, I'm desparate to own the DVD, and I don't even have a player yet!

1331,uniVerse-4,Punching through the fog of alienation in the land of packaged meat is no small challenge.,10,13 November 1999,"The talent that came together in this movie succeeds in delivering a powerful gut-punch that is both disturbing and affirming. Pitt and Norton are excellent as archetypes of a push/pull many of us feel- between comfortably numb and the stark reality of existence with all its terror and tender sweetness. What didn't come through enough, perhaps (delivered in a number of lines by Pitt but not shown as experience) was just how amplified the sweetness is once we embrace and accept the terror. A movie worth seeing twice, talking about, mulling over and, ultimately, acting on. But how to do that in an urban landscape, without the extremes of fight club, is a puzzle left to sort out alone. Blowing up buildings, of course, is a symptom of, not at solution to alienation. We must embrace our mortality - someone said you must die in some sense to understand your true self.",Fight Club

The only yuppie in the film is the character played by Edward Norton.Visually, the film is exquisite if you like films that create their own visual world--it ranks up there with Blade Runner.  The editing is exciting. The script is, frankly, very biting and hilarious, and the depiction of consumerism and the corporate workplace is right on.The audience I saw it with enjoyed the humor and applauded at the end.  I didn't see anyone walk out.  Afterwards, I heard comments that some people were confused, but most enjoyed it a lot.The acting is quite good, too.  One expects wonders from Norton, and at least some excitement from Pitt, but Meat Loaf's performance was quite touching.  That blew my mind!I told my husband about the movie, and although he felt he would like the humor and the themes, he couldn't take the violence.  So be forewarned, if you're a tough cookie and enjoy critiques of the economy, satires on group therapy, and films that take real risks, see this movie.  Otherwise, avoid it.",Fight Club

Although Edward Norton is by far my favorite actor I thought it looked like a typical movie about underground fighting.Then when my sister rented this due to her fixation with Brad Pitt I figured it was my chance to finally see it, and I am so very glad I did. This movie has now become my favorite movie. Edward Norton provides yet another great performance in this movie. Brad Pitt and the rest of the cast do a pretty good job acting as well. While this movie may seemed far fetched the way people come to bash each others brains out, it really isn't, this part of society is very real.

The movie started off amazingly and I was loving everything about it.  It was clever, had great acting and was suprisingly funny.  Then about three quarters through I lost it,  couldn't follow where it was going, then I figured it out and just when I was about to stand and applaud a great picture I lost it again.  Now though I've never claimed to be the smartest guy in the world I don't think I missed the point because I'm stupid.  I think in trying to be too clever the point was lost and the story confused.

The plot twists are incredible, and Norton gives the performance of the year!  It is arguable better than the one given in American History X, and deserves to be nominated for another Oscar this year.  Norton and Pitt's performances are reason enough to see this film.I went into the movie expecting a repeat of what I saw on the previews. What I got was a movie that delves into the minds of twisted, complex characters.  Fincher does such a wonderful job laying out the story... there is never a point in the movie where I thought that time was wasted.  What I really loved about the movie was its look.  It had dark imagery all through the film, which the soundtrack contributed to.  Besides from that, the visual effects were utterly convincing, and I'm sure they will leave many viewers squeamish.  They were so convincing, in fact, that many viewers will be unable to look past the violence and see the genius in this film.Fight Club was well worth the ticket price.",Fight Club

I was not expecting such a dark, psychological drama with such intelligence, wit and an ending to make it all seem worthwhile.I haven't seen a film that has kept me awake at night for some time now, but this one did that and more.Good acting, direction and all that kind of thing, but most importantly, what an inspired script.",Fight Club

The best complement I can give it is: ""It is better than the book.""  How many movies can you say are better than the book it's based on?  I can count them on one hand. 
If anything, you must see the opening credits -- by far the greatest first 3 minutes of any movie ever!  And if you've seen the movie, how can you ever forget the first line of the movie: ""People are always asking me if I know Tyler Durden.""  It's certainly not a movie for everyone -- only those who truly wish to explore the reasons behind the disillusionment of modern society, and ESPECIALLY how the role of the domesticated male fits in.Easily David Fincher's best movie -- although I'm also a huge fan of the equally underrated ""The Game"" with Michael Douglas.",Fight Club

1340,sxediscipline,I am Jacks complete lack of suprise...,10,29 June 2000,"Pure genius, apocalyptic, and brilliant.  David Fincher succeeds yet again with another amazing movie, and better than his previous two, and combining both is some aspects.  He takes the darkness of The Game, and the erie feeling of Seven, and puts them both into Fight Club, and of course, comes out with yet another vibrant film. Fight Club shows the world what we all want to be.  It shows the sides that we don't want to see, that society cannot grasp in public, but dreams about when they are alone.  It depicts the life we wish we had.  Simple, violent, and anarchistict(heh).   This movie repels the people who criticize it.  All the ones who look at it as just violence, and only that.  Chuck Palahinuk has written one of the best novels(which is also exceptionally good).  Pitt puts on the best performance of his career since 12 Monkeys.  Norton shows us that he is made out for people like ""Jack"" and ""Derek Vinyard""(American History X) and not people like ""father Brian Finn""(Keeping the Faith).It was a shame that this movie was so underrated, because it really shows great movie making, and it shows us reality(in a sense).  All put aside, this filming in this movie is beautiful, dark and suspenseful.  David Fincher has put out one of the best, a real movie that shows what everyone wants to be.  Fight Club IS what it is, it is not the Academy Awards, it isn't what you want it to be, it is what we are afraid to be.  Go see this movie.  ***** out of *****",Fight Club

That's how I felt for most of this film which essentially steals its premise from the 1987 film ""Angel Heart"".  The performances of the lead actors all top notch, but the execution of the story is almost painful to watch.  Sure, there's plenty of commentary on our current socio/economic state, but does that necessarily make it insightful or brilliant? If lots of bare knuckle fighting and bleeding really pops your cork, then this is the film for you.

Seeing Fight Club is an experience totally new for everybody, there is no other movie like it and there will never be, not until i´m guessing 10 years more. Because thats the time it´s gonna take (i hope) to people to understand the movie and really understand it. If students of film making are now studying Kubrick i´m sure they will study David Fincher in the future. Fight Club has great speed, in dialogues and actions, it has a great cast (even Meat Loaf was good) and most important it was deep, so deep that nobody notice it was deep because the deepiness of Fight Club is beyond tears and silences like the usual deep movies.

Fincher has done this before, in the fascist ""Seven"".  ""Memento"" is not fascist, and is more intelligent, but uses the same trick.  Ok, people, c'mon, we can do better than this.

He then meets Tyler Durden (Brad Pitt) and he introduces the insomniac to a new way of life. But this only the beginning to what I think is the best film ever made!. I have now seen it over 10 times and it just gets better and better. This is a film that is better the second time you see than the first because you feel different towards the characters. The film is very original and is very funny. It is also pure genius. I won't say much more but just look out for things on repeated viewings. I didn't think there was that much violence and it is really only one fight that is really bad.The acting is superb, the two male leads Brad Pitt (Seven) and Edward Norton (American History X)really are spectacular! The direction from David Fincher (The Game) is great and the twist at the end I didn't see coming at all. Just watch this film. Some of my friends didn't like the first time but loved it the second time. If you have a DVD player you should check out the excellent 2 disc set. This film will remain in your head for along time because it is so clever and funny. Watch it now and you won't regret it! 10/10",Fight Club

I think I didn't expect much because of the following this film has from filmbros, but it's safe to say I was proven wrong. This film is very intelligent and one of the best explorations of for lack of a better term ""toxic masculinity"" I have ever seen, and frankly, all the people who idolize Tyler Durden must have not paid attention because this film is not subtle at all with its analysis of the sorts of things Tyler represents. Tyler strikes me rather like a modern-day identitarian, and the film is very ahead of its time in showing how hypocritical and self-serving people like that are.

1350,SuperCoop,Inventive and Daring,10,29 January 2001,"The Movie Fight Club is an example of one of those very dark and risky movie that is for some reason made into a movie even though it might not do financially well.  The first time I heard of Fight Club was when I saw an article about it in a magazine and how it kept being pushed back on its release date due to it's violent nature and the situation the country was currently in.  When it finally came out in October I had seen a string of disappointing films and didn't feel like seeing this one.  A while after I had nothing to do so I went and saw it.  When I left the theater I couldn't absorb the entire movie but I did know that it was a rare film and one I had never seen before.  What puts Fight Club above other films is how it's message isn't cut and dry.  It says dangerous things that aren't questioned often.  This film questions are lifestyles, belongings, and ideas.  The most appealing thing about Fight Club is that it takes you away to a different place with characters that you have never seen before, this film goes right alongside The Talented Mr. Ripley as the best of 1999.",Fight Club

I have to break the first rule.I cannot and I must say that I cannot forget this movie or even stop talking about it after 20 years. Just straight up, this movie is ahead of its time.The story is a non-stop grandeur development.I can't spoil any bits of this masterpiece. Can only say: this movie is about a man. That's IT. I CAN'T SAY ANYTHING MORE. Or else, I'm gonna break the 2nd rule.When I first watched Fight Club in the 2nd year of university, I felt really skeptical. I was scratching my head throughout the whole movie's set up like why the hell is this even in the top 10 IMDB list.And I gotta admit, Fight Club is weird. It's complicated and it might feel like it's going nowhere. I could almost say that I was losing interest in the first act of the movie.But as things build up and just keep building up, I saw the beauty. For the first time in my life, I felt enlightened. I felt something more than just a movie. I was laughing throughout the middle act and then, I got hit really hard in the most disturbing and oddly satisfying way.A movie that can always provoke your thoughts the moment you start watching it again. Fight Club is vulgar, intense and so damn emotional.I would always say that this is neither an action movie nor a thriller movie. But it is Fight Club. It shows me the craziest life journey of a man, being portrayed on a movie screen. The movie editing level is surprisingly movie magic.Too many people are breaking the first rule these days, this is not good.",Fight Club

When I first heard of it I just imagined it would be just another action packed brain less flick, until I realized the director was David Fincher. That was the reason I saw it. As I saw the movie I felt something that I had never felt when watching a movie: I felt that it could be a critic to my own life. The film is a critic to today's emotion less society, where all is single serving and where vacuum cleaners are worth more than human lives. Some may say that it may influence negatively people, in my opinion its a wake up call, a serious one. I wont comment on the excellent performances by Edward Norton and Brad Pitt, on the flawless direction by Fincher and on the extraordinary script, I will just say: WATCH THIS MOVIE because you might be asleep and don't even know it. On a more technical note, I think this movie proves that visual effects have a space on movies not as fireworks but as narrative tools, you will know what I mean when you watch it.",Fight Club
1355,JerusalemFace,The title is deceiving,9,18 January 2002,"***SPOILERS***   ***SPOILERS*** Slick, witty and thought-provoking; Fight Club breathes a breath of fresh air into films.  It's anti-consumerism message and controversial ideas are never force-fed to the viewer and are stylishly decorated in lavish camera-work and cleverly interwoven plot twists.Based on the Chuck Palahniuk novel, the title 'Fight Club' doesn't really do the film justice.  There is fighting in Fight Club and a lot of it.  Some, extremely gut-wrenching.  But this isn't what the film is really about. It's about one 30 year old man's journey of self-discovery.  The secret, basement-based group, known as 'fight club' just happens to be an enlightening experience for him.  It also has more of an impact on his life than he might have originally anticipated. The title ""Fight Club"" makes this film sound like it will only appeal to 14 year old boys who love to watch blood flying everywhere as grown adults pummel each other into the ground. And it WILL appeal to this client group for the aforementioned reason. However, the premise of the film is a lot deeper than it sounds.Basic premise: a group of young men nearing thirty-something rebel against Marcuse's borgeousie consumer society, no longer allowing themselves to be slaves to possessions, nor to the romantic lies perpetrated by the media-rich collective consciousness. The solution to modern ennui is violence, aggression, vandalism, and self-abnegation, abject nihilism.  To say fight club is more brawn than brains, is a clear sign of misinterpretation of the very demanding, thought-provoking ideas expressed within the film.The film begins as the camera sweeps through a computer generated intricate maze of what we later discover is the Narrator's (Edward Norton) brain. The opening sequence alone - the music, the feel and the atmosphere - immediately altered my preconception of the film. This was certainly no shabby slug-fest of a film, which was created in the hope that Brad Pitt and the big-budget alone, would carry it. Neither, for that matter, was it to be a naturalistic and grim portrayal of modern life.The fact is, while the acting in Fight Club is fairly natural and realistic, the film borrows more from the stylistic method of movie-making and even has a surreal feel about it. The main character, who is throughout unnamed also narrates the film. Fight Club is essentially about this man and follows his characters movements almost constantly and, by narration, we are shown a glimpse of the motivations for his actions and reasoning. However, narration is by no means a rarity in a film. In fact, some of the most highly acclaimed films of all time have relied on this style of conveying the thoughts of the character to the viewer; one of the most successful films of 1999, ""American Beauty"" also uses narration, as does ""The Shawshank Redemption"" and ""Blade Runner"". It seems that narration in a movie works well. And Fight Club is no exception.As the film centres around this one character, we obviously learn a lot about him as a person and this is the soul of the plot.  Edward Norton puts in a disturbingly convincing performance and suits the part to a tee as a very normal 30 year old who has spent his life trying to climb the corporate ladder.  After only six films, Norton has already been nominated for two academy awards for 'best actor', after his fantastic performances in Primal Fear and American History X.  David Fincher, the director of Fight Club, strongly believes that nobody else could have played the part as well as Edward Norton, who's method acting ways and perfect timing complement the almost poetic script written by the award winning, Jim Uhls.His character is stuck in a dead-end job and he isn't going anywhere. Fast. He spends his life trying to improve his condominium, buying furniture and clothes he 'doesn't even need'.  He seeks perfection, he was almost there, almost 'complete' in a Martha Stuart-type way.  He's become a slave to the Ikea nesting instinct and is trying to fulfil his life with materialistic possessions.  He'd often flick through pages in a catalogue and wonder `what sort of a dining set defines me as a person?'  But as he later discovers, 'self-improvement is masturbation - self-destruction'.To make things worse, he has insomnia.  Norton is brilliant at emulating the pain and anguish he's going through, desperate to sleep.  He had sunk so low, that he sometimes prayed for a mid-air collision on one of his many flights across America, which his job demands of him.  `This is my life, and it's ending one minute at a time,' he eloquently puts it. After being denied attention from his doctor who rather insensitively tells him to 'lighten up', he finds refuge in support groups.  He becomes 'addicted'; testicular cancer, brain parasites, blood parasites, he attends as many as he can. Where else is he offered comfort, love and warmth that only dying people receive?His insomnia ceases, for the meantime at least, but when another 'faker', Marla Singer (Helena Bonham Carter), starts attending all of the same groups as well, his insomnia recommences.  Her lie reflects his lie and therefore he can't sleep again.. It isn't until he meets Tyler Durden (played by Brad Pitt) on a business trip that his life makes a positive turn-around.  Tyler's laid back and easy going attitude fascinates him and a strong friendship develops, bonded by their contrary ideas and philosophy of life.  Together they form 'fight club' as a way of releasing their pent-up aggression and defying the consensus of society.  But what originally begins as a (playful) get together at weekends, gradually gets out of hand as Tyler's charismatic personality and influential ideas lead to the construction of a powerful organisation which believes in letting that which does not matter, truly slide.The director, David Fincher (made famous for his darkly sinister direction of Se7en), uses an almost surreal approach. Every gimmick is utilised by this slightly self-consciously clever flick, which may begin to grate on some people's nerves.  The spontaneity of the film's direction is a device used to sustain the interest of the viewer and in my case it worked well. At one point, the camera swoops around the room, as if it were a page in a catalogue, with items of furniture appearing and the price and details materialising on the landscape as he walks through the room. This is an example of the imagination and creativity of the film's direction which really is unique.In terms of plot, the plausibility of underground pugilistic endeavours working therapeutic wonders is almost nil, but the film only thrives to engage the viewer on a serious level in it's ideas, not in it's presentation of them.The brutally violent nature of certain parts of the film can only add to the desired impact, but obviously some viewers will definitely be offended by the constant barrage of punches to the completely bruised and cracked face of Jared Leto, who makes a small appearance in the film.  The violence is not wholly justified by the subject matter, but herein lies the result of the characters' aggression and frustrations.With some fantastic acting from all the leads in the film (Edward Norton, Brad Pitt and Helen Bonham Carter, especially), bold direction from David Fincher and a controversial issue that certainly demands attention, Fight Club oozes both bravery and originality and is absolutely worth seeing.Fight Club's flaws are few and minor and furthermore neither are they even unconditional: it ends slightly unresolved and there is ambiguity over how serious it is meant to be taken practically.  Aspects which in themselves can be discussed, considered and analysed.In short, well worth seeing, but not for those who are easily offended""If you wake up in different places at different times, is it possible that you could wake up as a different person?""Oh yes, and there's a twist too.",Fight Club
1356,dkfriend,Disturbingly excellent!,9,8 March 2002,"""Fight Club"" by David Fincher is really the first movie since American Psycho to deal with ""generation X"" (in lack of a better name). And as the book by Bret Easton Ellis (American Psycho) was so very provocative and too violent for its time, so is Fight Club.The two main characters, ""I"" (later known as ""Jack"") and ""Tyler Durden"" are portrayed by Edward Norton and Brad Pitt. Both actors become their characters, and they're very convincing as the fragile, generation x insomniac (Norton) and the cool, easy-going, care-less, soap-making Tyler Durden (Pitt). But it is really Helene Bonham-Carter who steals the limelight with her role as Marla Singer, who just as ""Jack"" has nothing really to live for, and who manages to stay alive only by going to cancer-groups and such for dying people. See the irony?
Much can be said of the movie (and it certainly has been!), but as I see it, it is able to open the eyes of an entire generation who goes through life thinking materialism is the way to live. If it does not open your eyes, you may just think this movie is about violence, when, in fact, only one person dies in the film. The movie is not about violence at all. The violence is a way of escaping the life the characters are leading - a life which is so empty and only based on stuff...things we don't need to be happy.The ending sees everything coming together for the audience - and everything falling apart for the main character.

Maybe it's Ed Norton, maybe it's David Fincher, maybe it's all of it. If you are a much too average person like myself, this movie will hit you like a ton of bricks, if you let it.After seeing this movie, I felt content with being myself.

We all work jobs we hate for sh*t we don't need, hell, I still do it even after seeing the movie (although I cut down dramatically). Now, rather than wishing I was Brad Pitt, I wish I was Tyler Durden.From what I hear I am of the minority of people who watched this movie and fully understood it the first time, but even then, I watch it over and over again. If you have not seen this movie, go see it; NOW! Just remember, it is a movie, and it is there to entertain. Don't go joining a fight club and blowing up buildings.

1362,cecilparks,As empty as the society it condemns,6,23 December 2001,"***SPOILERS***""You are not the car you drive. You are not the contents of your wallet.""I agree. But I also think a movie is not its special effects, its flashy violence or its tacked-on incoherent twist ending. Let's be fair, this movie was probably THE thrill ride of 1999. But after repeated viewings, its flaws become painfully apparent.A lot of users on this board talk about the movie's message. What exactly is the message? That materialism is bad? This movie is as materialistic as they come. This movie is all about looking good, talking cool and dressing sharp. It's a quote mine, it tries to be a Tarantino movie minus the actual storytelling. The visuals are astounding and the acting is compelling, but the plot is totally incoherent. For example: if Tyler and the Narrator are the same person, what exactly happens right before the car accident? Is Tyler talking to himself? He has to be talking out loud since the two ""soldiers"" on the back seat answer his questions. That scene simply doesn't work. There is also the problem of the Narrator's name. Is he Tyler Durden? No one calls him by his name until the last minutes of the movie. Even the cop calling about the explosion in the condo doesn't call him by his name. On top of that, Tyler's decrepit house was bought ""under (the Narrator's) name"". I get the feeling that's an area the film-makers intentionally left grey so they wouldn't have to worry about it spoiling their ""great twist ending"".The movie would have been better if Tyler and the Narrator had not been the same person. But if they hadn't been, young male viewers wouldn't have left the theaters whispering ""Woah, that movie was f**ked up!"". I'm guessing that's the market and the reaction they were going for. (F.Y.I., I'm a 27 year old white male)To its credit, Fight Club makes you think. Unfortunately, if you think about it long enough, the movie caves in and falls apart.

1364,hund2110,The most important film of the nineties,10,2 August 2002,"It's a shame that Fight Club premiered shortly after the various shootings in American High Schools, and therefore received a lot of criticism for its violence. many critics were afraid to praise the movie or maybe didn't care to dwell beneath the exterior casing of this film. And that's a shame, because Fight is, and should be, the landmark movie of the generation X'ers. The movie is a cry out against consumerism, and promotes self-destruction as a way to rebuild you life. A life without the slavery of material and commodities. Fight Club offers a hole new way to think, and is provoking.Jack (Edward Norton) is an average American guy, working a job he hates, trying desperately to fit the description of the ideal nineties single successful male. He has his Ikea furniture and other import necessities to fill the void where his existence as a happy man is questionable. Then he meets Tyler Durden (Brad Pitt). Tyler turns Jacks life upside down and introduces Jack to his life philosophy: It is only after you have lost everything, that you are free to do anything. Tyler believes in physical pain as a mean to break down the illusions modern day society has brought upon us. Fight Club is started.Edward Norton gives his best performance ever in this film, and Brad Pitts interpretation of Tyler is brilliant! Also great performances by Helena Bonham Carter as Marla Singer and Jared Leto as Angel Face. Also this movie is perfectly directed by David Fincher (Seven, The Game, Panic Room), and has one of the best plot twists ever seen on film.

First, there are those who think it's just an excuse for mindless violence on celluloid, who have failed to look past the flashy violence to the story that tries so hard to hit you in the face. Then, there are those who love the movie, but love it for it's violence and the message that, if you aren't paying attention, seems to be screaming at you from the mouth of Tyler Durden. In fact, the movie is a fantastic psychological introspective the likes of which has never been attempted. It's as misunderstood as Kubrick's classic ""A Clockwork Orange"" which goes down in history haunted by the violent fans who loved it for all the wrong reasons. It's a cult favorite of our own lost generation without the intellegence to understand it's true nature.

1370,Watchalot,Fabulous in every way,9,30 October 2005,"I have just watched Fight Club for about the 10th time with the director/cast commentary and felt compelled to write about how much I love this film.Whilst most films don't bear a second viewing, the joy of Fight Club is that with each viewing another incredible detail is uncovered. There is just so much happening in every scene that one viewing is not enough - and you will miss many of the hilarious references in the dialogue if you don't go back for a second look. Any film that is critical of Martha Stewart can't be bad.I'm not going to bother with recapping the plot - too many writers on this site have already done that job for me. All I will say is that those people who were upset about the violence in Fight Club when it was released totally missed the point and probably shouldn't be seeing this sort of film anyway.... Oh, and I'm female so the explicit violence is not just for men.All the performances were fabulous (and I have to comment on how incredibly hot Mr Pitt looked) and the bleak and at times strangely lit vision of David Fincher served the story brilliantly.Probably the best film of its year and criminally overlooked during awards season, there is so much to enjoy about Fight Club. I recommend this film highly to those discerning viewers who go to see films to be challenged and to have a really good laugh because Fight Club is genuinely funny. I promise you won't be disappointed.9/10 from me.",Fight Club
1371,dirtydan1,not what one would expect,10,4 May 2005,"i remember seeing previews for fight club and thinking that it looked like a cool movie about guys who fight a lot. i did not see it at first, but when i did, i was very pleasantly surprised. Not only is this movie about guys who like to fight, it is the story of a nameless-insomniac-narrator who finds refuge by going to meetings for disease stricken people. When Marla Singer ruins that, he meets a man named tyler durden that changes his life forever. they start an underground fight club and tyler takes him for the ride of his life, having the narrator discover who he really is. this movie is a dark thrill ride that ventures to question many of the staples in today's society. Based on the first novel by chuck palahniuk (who by the way is the best writer going, if you haven't yet, read more of his books i.e. choke and survivor etc.), this movie is easily my favorite ever and is a piece of art put together by the best minds in the business. i give David fincher the thumbs up for his excellent adaptation of a classic novel.",Fight Club
1372,gusdanjaq,Fincher's masterpiece,9,11 March 2010,"I really like the work of David Fincher. I think Seven is one of the most beautifully crafted psychological thrillers in movie history. However i think Fight Club qualifies to be put in a whole different league than traditional movies. A movie like Fight Club, that manages to find and maintain it's coherence while dealing with profound subjects like existentialism and nihilism with dark humor and pretty violent action scenes (some fight scenes are very violent and bloody), is really hard to find. In fact for this reason is that i think that it should be qualified in a whole new perspective, because there are very few movies it could be compared to. The movie is about a guy who is really bored with his yuppie bureaucratic lifestyle but finds relieve when he meets Tyler Durden (Brad Pitt), who teaches him valuable life lessons. The fun of the movie is that this lessons are little by little unraveled while them (and later in the movie, their followers too) engage in brutal fist fights as a way of dealing with their issues with modern society. This fist fights then start becoming other activities increasingly more self-destructive. The beauty of the movie is that everything is extremely well done, from the cinematography (dark scenarios, surreal and practically dream-like sequences) to the soundtrack (great choice of music that enhance the dark feel of the movie) and the script (the dialog is great, conversations between the characters feel real and energetic: such a great dialog is hard to find in modern movies). And let's not forget about the performances, Ed Norton gives a great performance about a man whose boredom in life is so powerful that the only way he feels alive is by engaging in brutal fights with other desperate males. Brad Pitt gives what i think is the best performance of his career, playing the energetic but increasingly self-destructive and anarchistic Tyler Durden- Great Performances, Great Movie",Fight Club
1373,C_pa_cool,"Gentlemen, welcome to Fight Club!",9,29 June 2014,"Fight Club came out in 1999 and is directed by David Fincher. In another gender, it reminded me of a previous D. Fincher's movie, Seven. Both of these movies stars Brad Pitt, and both shows a very dark and pessimistic aspect of our world and lead the viewers to a complex psychological experience.Fight Club evolves around the character of Edward Norton, the Narrator, whose name is only revealed at the end of the movie. The Narrator lives a lonely, sad life. He's insomniac, lives, eats, sleeps alone. But, the monotony of his life will change after meeting Tyler Durden played by Brad Pitt, with whom he decides to form an underground Fight Club... This is the starting point of a crazy, psycho adventure brilliantly well-thought.I really enjoyed Fight Club, the ending is more than perfect and lights up all of the first confusions, mysteries around The Narrator. The rhythm is really well put, the viewer don't have time to catch up their breath, it could have been another 30 min longer that I wouldn't have mind. Helena Bonham Carter plays here the love interest of the main character and as usual, she is brilliant playing a crazy, weird and trashy poser who will disturb a great deal the routine of The Narrator. And no need to mention that Edward Norton and Brad Pitt are both perfect in their own role.All in all, Fight Club is, for so many reasons, a must-watch movie. It was a pretty big deal when it first came out, so many of you have probably already seen it, but this is the perfect movie to watch and re-watch again and again.",Fight Club
1374,dairylanddon,"3 Good Things, 1 Bad Thing about... Fight Club",10,8 October 2008,"ONE GOOD THING: David Fincher's ""Fight Club"" is arguably a perfectly directed movie. The film is highly watchable on the first viewing or the 1000th, even the insert shots of buildings and coffee cups are fascinating. One of the first movies to properly use CGI without abusing it, it also cleverly incorporates an original score by the (electronic music inspired) Dust Brothers. And most of all, ""Fight Club"" manages to be highly stylized without being overly distracting from the story.ANOTHER GOOD THING: ""Fight Club"" is cast without flaw. Edward Norton's ""Narrator"" is a prime example of the pre-9/11 every man, disillusioned by the ideals and confusions of an entire generation of bored consumers. Brad Pitt's ""Tyler Durden"" not only steals every scene he is in, but later fits the exact description (because of his real-life persona) of why the character acts the way he acts, and looks the way he looks; all simply because the role is being played by Pitt. Helena Bonham Carter plays her part in an amazing dual fashion; managing to be both grating and unlikeable on the first viewing, yet sympathetic and endearing upon all subsequent watchings. Even Jared Leto's ""Angel Face"" and Meatloaf's ""Bob Paulson"" are ideal for their roles, once the viewer learns those characters' fates.EVEN ANOTHER GOOD THING: Chuck Palahniuk's novel was expertly crafted into a screen play by Andrew Kevin Walker (Se7en and 8 Millimeter). Much as the story, and the characters' roles in it, evolve upon multiple viewings, so does the overall message and tone of the film. ""Fight Club"" manages to transform itself from dark action/thriller to the silliest of comedies in about 3 viewings; with every line of dialogue managing to be social satire while still furthering the story. ONE BAD THING: The only bad thing I could come up with, for a movie this expertly crafted was... the fighting. Even though the violence and self destruction of the characters is integral to the story being told, it is the by far the most misunderstood thing about the film. The studio's marketing department originally advertised this film as a type of Jean Claude Van Damme vehicle, with the main character being Brad Pitt's abs, causing many perspective viewers who would never watch such garbage to miss out. The violence of the movie has also inspired many real-life ""fight clubs,"" full of confused young men on the same journey of self discovery as Edward Norton's character. However, none of them seem to grasp that their hero's anarchistic manifesto is revealed to be the ramblings of an insane schizophrenic whose best friend is imaginary.OVERALL GRADE: A+OTHER ENJOYABLE MOVIES FROM DIRECTOR FINCHER: Se7en (1995), The Game (1997), Panic Room (2002), Zodiac (2007)",Fight Club
1375,dprb23,who we are and who we want to be,10,19 November 2003,"This is personally one of the most unbelievable film experiences I've had. The impact was so great that the few flaws are meaningless.  Fincher is currently one of the top few directors to watch.  The movie starts with taking you through the gun barrel and shows you Norton and Pitt's ending confrontation. We find out that Norton is the narrator who takes us back in time to tell us the story which explains the final scene. You the viewer get to watch Norton's story and you unknowingly watch:  1. Norton play his usual passive self         2. Norton play his imagined self         3. Norton watching his imagined self (Pitt). Everything runs against short term expectations and for the first 100 minutes the camera shows a confusing yet so engaging story.Next, we have significant sub-plots that even intelligent people seem to forget: Society cannot function without low-middle class workers.
Everyone strives to have the nicest material possessions which mean nothing for our survival. We have this obsession with climbing an institutional societal pole and its our way of comparing ourselves to others. It's a big reason for low self-confidence and stress. Fight Club shows how ridiculous that notion is.
Men naturally have an itch to fight (usually mentally). What a great setting for the story to move around. Most humans are two beings, who they are and who they want to be: as we find out later, Tyler Durden has the rare courage to run with who he wants to be. Pitt, Carter, and especially Norton were unreal. Norton was truly multidimensional and Pitt was so cool he didn't even seem real. Fincher's translation transported me into his world and I love the lighting in his movies. I have never been hit so hard with a twist that I almost watched the movie twice in a row.4 out of 4.

This is a must see for any human, tho rated R for the strong language, sex scenes and other, it delivers a strong message at the same time.

It also contains a portrait of a kind of fascism that is quite reminiscent of the followers of Mussolini, with their anti-rationalism and their cult of action and virility. The movie has a sense of humor on occasion, and a central puzzle that keeps the viewer scrambling to put the pieces together.On the other hand, it also glorifies the culture of violence that it purports to critique. The commentary track on the DVD shows that the filmmakers are blind to this: did they ask themselves whether their scathing attack on ""frat boys who take themselves too seriously and shave their heads"" was actually presented in such a way as to appeal to said frat boys? Are the endless scenes of men beating each other up necessary to make a point? I quickly started to find them tedious, and began to wonder for whose benefit they were being offered.",Fight Club

1380,TobinTelleran,Sheer brilliance.,10,7 January 2004,This film gives a glimpse at what great character based film making can be. Edward Norton is perfect for the role of Jack and Brad Pitt as Tyler is great along side.The movie follows the degradation of Jack's life as step by step we see him give up is job and start the revolutionary underground group: fight club.The film offers un-biased insight into western Americanized culture. Through Jack and Tyler's eyes we see the world in which we live and the lives we lead. The dirty underbelly of the city portrayed in fight club allows us to see how corrupt the corporations and high fliers that spurned this culture truly are.Coupled with true to life dialogue and a magnificently well concealed twist leads to a fantastic film which you have to watch at least twice.The film is splendidly shot with subtle but brilliant lighting effects. Claudio Miranda and Jeff Cronenweth should be commended.Copyright January 2003.,Fight Club

1382,Aurdreyen,A wonderful combination of Brad Pitt and Edward Norton,10,31 December 2011,"Fight Club will leave you beaten and bloodied at the end of the climatic twist ending, and wondering ""How did I get here?"" Fight Club(1999) is a very rare movie, not many movies are like this one. Hollywood Directors now days like ""Action"" and ""guns"" to entertain their viewers, in other words, simple movies for a simple audience. This is a very complex movie. I rate my movies in 4 categories; Cintemography,Film making,Acting and the overall experience.Cintemography: I have never seen Cintemography quite like this. The picture is very rare, Fincher made the characters look ""Shiny"" when they are around Tyler, to show how he makes an impact on the film, and everything is bland when he isn't there. Everything looks beautiful. Fincher has used specific things to make the movie more enjoyable, like overtones. (Now I wont say anything because it may spoil it) He has used many visual techniques to make this film more enjoyable, and in a sense, more pretty. 25/25Film making: The camera angles, the direction in this is just right, brilliant. He has everything timed out correctly, nothing out of sync, to make full effect of conversations and fight scenes. The choreography in the fight scenes are very realistic, the fight co-coordinator for the film watched many boxing matches and took martial arts lessons to get this right, and so it payed off really well. 25/25Acting: The Acting is one of the major parts about the film. This has got to be the best acting I have ever see, Pitt plays an evil and sinister, yet intelligent and charismatic soap salesman, where as Edward Norton plays a depressed unnamed social worker who satisfies himself with support groups. There are many more who are just as good, like Helena Bonham Carter and Meat Loaf. 25/25Overall Experience: This movie, as long as you have an out-of-the-box mind and a wild imagination, will never bore you, how many times you have watched it. Its a very complex movie that touches you very deeply , and it has a very good meaning. 25/25Overall score: 100/100",Fight Club

1385,sboulama,"A very smart and useful movie(waring, readers! spoilers ahead!)",9,30 October 2014,"I knew this movie for years before i watched it recently, and i can't help but thinking about it to motivate myself, since this movie is especially about the true power of mind and body. The story of a man who discovers that there is no cure to his insomnia. One thing after the other, he will meet dangerous people and will do bad things, he will learn about himself and become someone else, someone he always wanted to become. when his flat burns out, he asks his new friend for some help. This one accepts, but only at one condition: he must hit him. Fighting in front of a bar, two guys see them and, together, they create the Fight Club, which fights occurs in the basement of the bar. t It's smart, funny, and, sometimes, so clever and well-thought, you forget the rawness of the whole movie, and you just follow the story that goes very, very far...! Edward Norton is so great, so entertaining, and Brad Pitt is also so, so truly a legendary actor! And even though i've found, i think, some mistakes in the movie, it doesn't prevent me from loving it and saying to the people around me that Fight Club is one of the best film ever made.

1386,paragz,Thumbs way up!!,9,8 September 2005,"Welcome to the masterpice of the new age. Get ready for some great lines by Tyler Durden like, ""the first step to eternal life is you have to die."" The story gives us insight into the life of the insomniac played by the brilliant Edward Norton, who encounters Tyler Durden aka Bradd Pitt who changes his life. The movie features some mind bending moments and exceptionally brilliant lines.Bradd Pitt plays the character to remember for a lifetime. People who have read this book and not seen the movie will be surprised at the tact with which the director has handled this subject and tried to include every detail about the characters on the screen. The movie would certainly have easily been a disaster if it hadn't been exactly directed the way it is. David Fincher definitely has a winner on his hands here.",Fight Club
1387,Fandango137,Breaking Away From the Maternal and Material,8,28 July 2020,"Jack's plight throughout the film is the journey of a boy who has grown up without a father. Throughout Fight Club, Jack searches for an authority figure to show him the path towards manhood, what's worth striving for, and how to get there. We hear him repeat, ""what's next?"", implying that the main character has not yet found what it means to be a man. While Jack may have had a father in the conventional sense, his father was absent, likely also a product of feminine upbringing.Jack's life is filled with the traditions passed on to him, where the path to drown out who you are and forget about your existential problems lies in the structure of schooling, work, and marriage. This is the goal that Jack has been taught to strive towards, and his journey is a spiritual journey, as he discovers that it is the path to nowhere. Jack, despite being 30, is still seen symbolically as living under the maternal influence. The way he sleeps is symbolic of a boy sucking on his thumb. His surroundings are a symbolic gesture of maternal comfort; his symbolic father is his boss; the firm he works for is the family that feeds him; and his house, which he furnishes with feminine accoutrements, is the womb. Jack is lonely, as he realizes that the material objects which he has been taught to place the most value on, are unable to replace the void of relationships and his own masculine inadequacy.His discontentment with life manifests in the form of suicidal ideation and insomnia. As a product of society whose ultimate goal is to maximize happiness and minimize pain, Jack seeks a prescription to stop feeling the way he does, hoping to stunt any potential for growth which requires pain. Bob's breasts are further symbolic of Jack's inability to break away from the maternal tether holding him back. The film makes allusions to castration, with the basketballs around Jack during his meeting attendance, the scene where Tyler threatens to castrate the man, as well as Jack's own encounter with the detectives. This indicates to the audience that Jack does not see himself as a man, but as a boy (""I am six years old again,"" and ""I can never get married."").Upon Tyler's arrival, Jack goes through a ritual, transitioning from a state of boyhood entering manhood. This is symbolized as his apartment blows up, removing him from the comfort of the material and maternal. His plight now is to become a man without a father, which he attempts to due through Tyler, his alternate ego. Jack begins to hate his father, as Tyler tells Jack that he saw his father as a God, but that his God rejected him, and he likely never loved him. He then begins to attribute the pain he feels as being caused by those around him, eventually believing the world is the cause of this pain (terrorist organization).Marla, also a product of Jack's imagination, is the mother figure, with Tyler serving as the father figure. The relationship between the three presents the audience with a family dynamic, where the child hates one sex and admires the other. Marla (mother) has chosen Tyler (father), and as a result, discards Jack (son). This is why in the second half of the film, Jack turns against Tyler, his father, and ends up killing him.Jack's path in the film may be seen as one of the many paths boys take in order to discover what it means to be men. As the traditional values of yesterday are dead, boys don't know how to be men. Their fathers, products of this same dissolution, are unable to teach their boys how to be men, as they themselves aren't.",Fight Club
1388,bane_13,material possession,7,28 March 2005,"i love the movie. can say that it is the best movie ever.most of us ( including me ) work for material possessions or try to be people that are considered 'right' by the 'jury'. no matter what you own it does not make you a better person.the movie gives the idea that you are free only if you have nothing to lose, which is 100% true in my opinion. most of us don't do things we want because we're bound to something ( a family, materials... ) but if we don't have anything then we can do everything...also my favorite about the movie is the car scene where tyler leaves the wheel and sees what happens. most ppl that don't feel good about their lives would work hard not to lose it knowing that it won't get any better.",Fight Club

Fight Club shows what we do with our mind.We fight him.But your enemy never dies until you die.And the fight is over when you're dead.This fight is called life.I don't suggest -13 year old guys to watch this movie .It's pretty violent and is so difficult to be understood.",Fight Club
1390,urface958,My all time favourite film,10,4 March 2015,"Now most people get stuck on the title 'Fight Club' and automatically assume that it's a movie about boxing clubs, but it is not. I mean there are some fight scenes but it's not all about the Fight Club. It's about the transformation of a man who took crap from everyone so he created an alter ego that he didn't know existed (Tyler) and Tyler taught him how to be a man and stop taking crap from people. They found out that by fighting they released anger and found relief and it turned out more men felt this way as well so they created Fight Club. After Fight Club blew up into a huge thing people started doing other stuff like vandalism and scaring people into becoming who they wanted to be. They called it Project Mayhem. But they started taking it too far and ended up becoming a terrorist organization and the narrator that has no name but it often referred to as Jack realized he was taking it too far. So tried to stop it but along the way ended up finding out him and Tyler were the same person. This was a huge twist that left me with my jaw dropped. Along with the cool fight scene where Jack threw himself down the stairs, the incredible dialogue and life lessons, and awesome music by the dust brothers it became my mist favourite movie of all time. In Tyler I trusted...",Fight Club
1391,amber_maishment,Pure Fincher Talent.,9,8 March 2014,"""You cannot be told what Fight Club is; you have to see it for yourself. But only if you think you're hard enough.""Fight Club, directed by David Fincher already had an established fan-base before it hit theatres in 1999 due to the cult novel it was adapted from by Chuck Palahniuk. It is very clear from Fincher's previous work such as Seven (1995), that he has a talented knack for capturing the murkier side of life. He is one of the most alluring visual stylists in cinema who has a very shadowy vision of human nature. These visualisations are portrayed through his narratives which are usually violent and very distinctive; mostly dark, stylish thrillers where every single frame has been calculated to push us closer to the edge as the films progress. Fincher has shown this very effectively in Fight Club, as this movie is no less dark or disturbing than his other work.Fight Club is a dark comic drama, which takes you on a wild ride, luring you in before turning you upside down with a brutal, shocking and frequently unpleasant story; but it is also one of the most brilliant films I have ever seen. It is certainly not a movie that deserved to flop massively on its original release. Some of this negativity could be down to the social context of the time; including the horrific 1999 Columbine shootings. A fraction of the public saw the use of guns and violence in the movie inappropriate for what was happening during this period, which evidently dented the box-office revenue.Edward Norton gives the performance of his career, playing the narrator; there is an on-going debate about whether his name is Jack (the name he refers to during the movie), or Joe (the name he refers to in the book), or whether neither of these are really his nameso we'll stick with calling him the narrator for now. The narrator is a 30-year-old single, nerdy, insomniac, with a highly unsatisfactory white-collar job, which he gets nothing from. He starts searching for some form of emotion in his soulless world by attending support groups for illnesses, such as testicular cancer. Before long, this becomes a weighty addiction. Finding comfort in these sessions, the narrator comes across a trampy but sexy, sceptical, free spirit junkie, Marla, played by the forever-amazing Helena Bonham-Carter. Doing what she does best; Carter is playing her fearless yet dark roles, which are also later shown in the very successful Harry Potter series and Burton's Sweeny Todd (2007). As Marla invades more and more of his gatherings, the narrator is feeling uncomfortable and is in need of a change.His stimulus and motivation arrives with Tyler Durden. Once again in Fincher's hands, Brad Pitt is at the top of his game and at the heart of this black comic picture, not afraid of getting his pretty little face dirty. As Fincher throws us more twists and turns on his narrative roller-coaster ride, the narrator's apartment explodes and he has nobody else to call upon but Durden. So they share a beer and indulge in a bizarre fist-up in a car park. Although he is black and blue, the narrator has never felt so alive and before we know it, they have routed their aggression into a shocking form of therapy; beating each other up. This initiates pain not only for each other, but for the viewer also, causing our stomachs and guts to turn and flip; however we simply cannot look away.Brad Pitt is a great choice and memorable actor to play the very anti-consumerist Durden, who is fed up of the material world that we live in, where ""the things you own end up owning you"". He plans to abolish this nature of society by creating Project Mayhem. Project Mayhem follows Marxism, where in this society the rich upper class that owns the means of production exploits the labour of the lower class. Also anarchy, in the remarkable final scene of the movie where Durden blows up the sky-scraping incorporate businesses and credit card companies, results in the erasing of all debt and making all people in society equal. Fincher develops the narrative by using the occasional freeze-frames to punctuate the action and the subliminal flashes are added for humour. The light comedy contrasts the dark atmosphere and mood of the film and its violence. Although it is violent and funny, it is also a very psychological and complex film to follow.There is an amazing choice of actors who all ensemble together creating worthy and very plausible chemistry on screen. Pitt has highly dangerous yet completely fearless behaviour, presented in the shocking chemical hand-burn scene. He plays his role with such intensity but is also very comical. Norton demonstrates his talent, giving a very unique performance, which cannot be as easy as he makes it look. Bonham-Carter plays the femme fatal manic- depressive character, although somehow still portrays her mysterious and sexy side very successfully.Every aspect of this amazingly directed and performed movie has been worked at until perfect, comparable with all of Fincher's work, from the music, cinematography, screenplay, lighting and pace. Fight Club is one of the few films that I can bear to watch more than once or twice. However, since watching this adrenaline rush of a movie, I have watched it maybe 6 or 7 times at the very least. It is a film that you can watch over and over again without getting bored, but still finds new things to love and enjoy every single time you see it. It's a film you can continuously laugh and cringe at. You can attempt to close your eyes at the extreme violence but continuously fail at doing, wanting to witness more of this incredible picture.

As a result, the film loses all credibility and you're just left feeling cheated! Whereas with other promising bad films, the problem is usually that the basic idea for the plot is good and they are simply badly executed (like The Sixth Sense) - here the main idea is absurd and is also executed badly! The only good things in this film are the acting and the camera-work, which is admittedly good. But for a good film you need a good plot! Not a ridiculous one!

1394,citizentenbears,A film to change your life?,9,29 November 2015,"I give this film 9 out of 10, and your only question should be ""why should it lose a mark, why not 10 out of 10?"" and that is indeed a fair question.The lost mark is because when I watched the film for the first time I had no idea how amazing it was going to be, and the slightly slow build up risked me changing channel. I see the same reaction when I try to get other people to watch the film, as their interest wanes I have to say ""no, stick with it!"". And 'stick with it' you should.This film literally changed my life. A share a lot of the views of the lead character and to see this expressed on the big screen is comforting, fun, scary, weird, exciting, eye-opening.This is the only film that I had to watch for a second time immediately and it was like being immersed in a whole new story.I was very fortunate knowing nothing about the film when I first watched it so I wasn't looking out for a twist, so the twist got me hook line and sinker. If you haven't seen the film yet, don't try to guess the twist, let it hit you at the appropriate time.A superb film worthy of its high ranking.",Fight Club
1395,Azizenberg,Life-changing masterpiece,10,12 October 2019,"I am, unfortunately, not one of the faithful Chuck Palahniuk readers who had read the book BEFORE they saw the movie. I, however, couldn't wait to read the book after seeing this film.Simply put, this movie changed my life. Not just on a personal level (on which I will not comment here except to say I'm now a major Palahniuk fan) but also as a movie-watcher. I view movies differently after seeing this movie, because it broke down doors.This movie is literally the first time I ever came upon something that, at first sight seemed incredibly stylish, sophisticated and entertaining. The plot lured you in before turning you upside down, the acting was nothing short of perfect (has there ever been a more memorable character than Brad Pitt as Tyler Durden?), the music, the screenplay (based on what is now my all-time favorite book), the lighting, the pacing, the everything! Virtually everything about this movie took my by surprise, save for one man.David Fincher, director, was probably the only reason I went to see this movie in the first place. His work on 'Seven' and 'The Game' had me excited to see what he would do next, but I came to this movie expecting a stylish flick that offered a good plot and hopefully some good acting but what I got was so much, much more.Honestly, how many times have you seen a movie that, with every viewing, gets even more complicated yet so simple that you can't help but laugh. Every time I watch this movie I notice something new about it, such is the depth of what is on the screen. Then there's the tiny issue of the story of Fight Club, penned by Chuck Palahniuk (who has one of the most fertile imaginations around. Don't believe me? Read 'Survivor' and weep!) the story is nothing short of incredible, a pure shock-value social commentary on the state of the world at the end of the century. You'll cry, you'll laugh, you'll do all the cliches but most importantly you'll identify with every single thing on the screen.This movie rates as one of my all-time favorite movies and, simply put, if you haven't seen it yet then quit wasting your time On Line and get to the nearest video store!",Fight Club

1397,fayaz-19146,Slow and dull. Not sure why it gets high praise,4,4 February 2021,This movie is all over the place. I like the concept and have no issues with the subject matter. I just feel like the characters didn't pull me in. I didn't care to really know what was going to happen. I had to power myself through to finish it as I kept hoping it would get better but sadly it did not. Way too many illogical scenarios and plot holes. Example: how is it possible for one person who has no control over himself able to fly all around the world and setup new organizations all the while in the entire movie being confined to one place. It's just dumb,Fight Club
1398,jacotinto,Simply awesome.,9,31 January 2016,"The message contained is pretty much the same of Trainspotting. It's a strong critic to today's society. What makes it different is the answer that the protagonists gives to the problem. While Trainspotting's druggies escape the problem by... doing drugs, Fight Club's protagonist handle it in a totally different manners. This movie made me think a lot, but it also made me laugh a couple of times. The fight are way better than the ones we see nowadays, and even if the movie have been criticized for being violent, we must admit that this may have been a violent film in 1999, but now, in 2016, it's pretty much normal. Maybe the only thing i didn't like was how the movie ended, and with that i mean how Tyler was killed.",Fight Club
1399,jacksragingbileduct99,A Must-See,10,10 August 2005,"Fight Club is about Jack (Edward Norton). An insomniac young man in a 'white shirt and neck tie' desk job who is looking for a way to change his life. Until he meets Tyler Durden (Brad Pitt) who is everything that Jack wants to be. Together they seek revolution in mankind and form a terrorist organization known as Fight Club.Not only did I love this film, but I just can't get enough of it. Fight Club is a great achievement in film-making a must-see for film-lovers. The whole atmosphere of it just drew me in and I couldn't look away I was seriously that intrigued.The performances are tops particularly Edward Norton. He was just stunning, coming across as the confused, delinquent, insane young man who is desperate for a change of life, and who could be better for this role than Brad Pitt. I'm not a great fan of Brad Pitt but he seemed like the best actor for this kind of role.The relationship between Jack and Marla (Helena Bonham Carter) is also very interesting. Sometimes he wants her and sometimes she wants him, but they can't fit the mold and causes dilemma between the characters.The film also is very similar to the novel 'Fight Club' by Chuck Palahnuik, with the exception of a few parts and in a different order.This is a film like no other",Fight Club
1400,daltonphone,Disappointing to me,6,26 November 2019,"I know my critic is unpopular, but this film has a lot of inconsistencies in the plot. Firstly, how the club becomes so popular that office workers, policemen, bus drivers, taxi drivers, etc. participate in it...? it sounds like nonsense, doesn't it? Secondly, they become so powerful that they change into a sort of terrorist army that destroys official buildings in a fight against materialism... if they're so powerful, why do they need to destroy buildings? Thirdly, the film reaches in its final part a pretended twist-in-the-end in which the main character suffers a double personality syndrome; apart that this has been yet treated in films like Psycho, in the film it's something more than a psychriatic disturbance; it's like a 'ghostly syndrome', since the main character seems to be hit by a ghost as can be seen in the vigilance cameras' images, and he finally shots himself in his mouth and doesn't die. You can build a brainy interpretation about everything, and say it's an allegory about the problems in modern society and the like, but for me it's not that profound. Also, the comic moments -like the man with the big breasts'- are for me tasteless. And the extreme violence unnecessary. I'll give it a 6 out of 10, and I think I'm being generous with my rating.",Fight Club

1405,primate45,Is it even real? Or just a dream.... -- SPOILER,8,19 April 2006,"An action film that makes an effort, like every movie should, at giving a life message. Brad Pitt does a nice job of playing an inhibition-to-the-winds bad boy who sports leather and sunglasses at night, and looks like a champion even when bleeding profusely while getting his face punched in. He takes the character played by Edward Norton away from his menial office job, and starts a life in which Norton can take out his frustrations, and live on the edge by beating the daylights out of other similarly hopeless men. The trouble comes when Pitt starts giving homework to the fighters. The group starts to become more of a criminal organization. Pitt then begins a program called Project Mayhem, recruiting members of the Fight Club, making them even more tough than the beat-downs of the Fight Club had made them, and initiates a program of urban terrorism. Pitt's repeated mantra is that he and his gathered army are the lowest of the low. They have lost all hope, do not fear death, and are stronger for it. The real twist comes when (ready? Here it comes) Pitt and Norton turn out to be the same person. This poses a very interesting situation, as Tyler (the character's name) struggles with himself to figure himself out, and to prevent the mass terror Pitt has planned. The climax comes when Norton shoots himself in the head, and kills Pitt. Miraculously Norton survives, and watches ten credit card buildings downed by homemade explosives. That's everything that is apparent to the viewer. With that in mind, I found the scenes where Pitt fought Norton to be ruined, as I realized that Norton was actually kicking his own butt. However this got me thinking about the reality of the entire film. The film was so fantastical and unreal that it is in fact possible that it was not a film about urban terror, and beating the stuffing out of others, but was about the internal struggle of one man. A man plagued by insomnia, and living in a world in which he could not tell reality from dreams.It's a movie about personal struggles. Struggling with fear, self-loathing and desire. It was such an intense choice of theme, that it was often times difficult to figure out. However a couple things were clear. One was that those who have lost all hope are the strongest of all, because they have nothing left to fear. Another was that fear is a burden on all of us. It is what keeps us from doing what we truly want to do. And it's true. Fear of something is the ultimate impediment in our lives. The key is to let ourselves go, and to embrace pain as a learning experience. Then we can be who we want, and do what we want. Similarly, fear should be embraced, and should be used as a driving force. At one point Pitt points a gun to convenience store clerk's head, and orders him to become a veterinarian (like he had wanted to be in his youth) or else Pitt would kill him. This was one of those action movies that was fun to watch, albeit gruesome at times. It was visually exciting and a tickling comedy as well. It wasn't cinematographically amazing, but it wasn't boring in that sense. When is comes to a message, it got it done also. It knew what its main message was from the start, and it got it out there as well. However the crowning jewel of this film was the way the intricate and bizarre plot was worked flawlessly into the main idea, to create a seamless film. If this film leaves you with a raised eyebrow, and an inquiring mind, it did its job. But give it a chance. And remember, if it doesn't make you think, it's not worth your time. -Michael",Fight Club

1410,stoned_bunnies,"Entertaining, haunting & and an instant classic.",10,10 June 2006,"The first rule of Fight Club: Don't talk about Fight Club. Well, I'm going to.Edward Norton plays the main character, a confused, depressed and insomniac man of routine, with nothing to live for but all his stuff (as in the things he buys). His life is so boring and meaningless that he begins attending support groups to listen to people talk about how they're battling cancer or any other disease they may have. He himself doesn't have cancer or any other disease of the sort, but he finds peace and people he likes in these meetings. All of that changes, though, when he meets Marla (Helena Bonham Carter). She is a woman who is also faking her way through the groups. Because of Marla, Norton's character sinks back into depression and insomnia. His life is for an even worse surprise, though, when he meets Tyler Durden (Brad Pitt) on a plane trip. Tyler takes everything that is of value from the protagonist (Norton). Tyler and the protagonist then start a new trend that helps them deal with their stress. They fight. They fight each other constantly, and attract other people to join what later becomes ""Fight Club"". The story goes back and forth from the Fight Club phenomenon to Marla and her a insane affair with Tyler, and things gradually spin out of control. Fight Club grows and spreads and our protagonist here finds himself deteriorating as the movie goes on. There is then more to the story but I can't say much without giving the pleasure of watching it away.So I think it's needless to say that Edward Norton is simply a godly actor, right? Everyone must know it already. Brad Pitt did alright, I suppose, but he didn't do much for me. He always plays the same type of character in almost every movie he's in and, irritatingly, never has any facial expressions. The fact that he is good-looking is a bonus to the film itself and his character is a riot, but I can't say that he evoked anything in me through his performance. Same with Bonham-Carter, as much as she has been praised for her role in this film.The cinematography, though, was insanely great as was everything else about the movie. I'm glad I discovered David Fincher (the director), and even after having seen his other movies, like ""Se7en"" and ""Panic Room"", I would have to say that ""Fight Club"" is by very far is best.9/10 if not more.",Fight Club

Right from the opening credits, the extremely competent direction of David Fincher smashes the viewer with his bloody violence and fast paced camera angles.The acting is superb, Brad Pitt's twisted portrayal of Tyler Durden was great, and almost over shadowed Edward Norton role as the unknown character. Helena Bonham Carter was great and Meatloaf, well.... he was different.Another brilliant aspect of fight club was the music by the Dust Brothers.

The plot summary by anonymous is accurate, but does not convey what the film is actually about (and, thankfully, doesn't give away any of the major plot twists).This film is darkly humorous - in both meanings of the term! - as well as violent, but if you live in an apartment and work in a cube like I do, you will rapidly start to sympathize with Jack and Tyler.

If you saw Double Jeopardy and marveled at the wit and intelligence of the screenplay (SARCASM ALERT) then this film is not for you.Personally, I loved Fight Club and I thought it is the best film of the year, so far.The plot, which can't be revealed in any great detail so as not to spoil the surprises of the movie, is basically about a character (referred to in the credits as the Narrator) played by Edward Norton, who has had it with the corporate Single Serving life and finds a new thing with Brad Pitt, who plays Tyler Durden.This movie is violent, but not senselessly so.  Each scene has a point, or as my drama teacher used to say, ""Each scene turns a corner.""  The corners this movie turns are pretty remarkable.  If this film doesn't have you questioning your life, you must be extremely rich and successful.  For those of us who are not (99%), this is a breath of fresh air.This and Iron Giant give me hope abut Hollywood again.  And this year isn't over yet...we still have The Messenger, Dogma, Being John Malkovich, The Insider, Sleepy Hollow, The Green Mile, etc. to look forward to.

Its integration of digital effects is noticeable but hard to point out which adds to the movie.  The dialogue is humorous and smooth, combined with really good ""fight"" scenes,no pun intended,which make this movie a teen or young adult ""got to see"" film.

1422,Verbal-39,Very dark satire on life.,10,24 May 2000,"Fight Club is truely an electric film. From the amazing intro right up to the end, there is no denying that Fight Club is like no other film you have ever seen. Shot with Fincher's scorching style, be amazed wit the floating cameras, hopping reels, zooming microscopic lens, fake reel dots, subliminal images and set pieces moving so fast, if you blink you might miss it. The story itself is slightly disturbing, but it is shot in a sort of  sarcastic, satirical way (helped greatly by Norton's brilliant narration). Fight Club is at times dark, disturbing and horrible and of course, without any doubt - controversial. Our narrator (Jack) is a clinically diagnosed insomniac and narcaleptic who seeking some way of escaping his pain, finds comfort in going along to support groups for men with testicular cancer, tuberculosis or brain parastites. All goes well untill he meets his match, Marla Simmons. But things go well again after he meets Tyler Durden, who he sets up a Fighting Club with. Things go awry after a while though when Tyler's ambitions rise above that of a Fighting Club and he goes for Project Mayham and begins building an army. The film explores many dark subjects. It is impossible to look at the film as just one subject, it is more like a lot bunched in together. It explores man himself. As in much of the great Stanley Kubrick's films, Fight Club explores the messed-up head of our narrator and tries to find means behind his madness (namely his chronic insomnia). The film  explores the eye of an insomniac, schizophrenic, narcaleptic madman and the way he sees his life. The most memorable scenes are towards the begining where Jack tries to explain what it's like not to have slept in 6 months. ""Everything is just a copy of a copy of a copy ... everything else gets the volume turned down."" These words of wisdom are accompanied by neat visuals, such as close ups of the copier moving back and forward and of his boss chatting with him with (you guessed it) no sound. And one of the most impressive scenes where Jack is staring blankly into his waste bucket at work, soaring majestically through the names of Starbucks, McDonalds .. etc. This is where his hatred of corporations first pops up and is one of many hints to the unpredictable outcome of the film. It's one hell of a film, played out to perfection by the leads (notably Norton) and shot in a scorching style that only Fincher could pull off and with one hell of a background tracking by the Dust Brothers. Sir Fincher, we salute you.",Fight Club

I do know I enjoyed both mediums tremendously.  And sometimes maybe it's best just to get a feeling and not be able to put it into words.  This is a story in which a reviewer cannot go wrong because it deals with what he/she feels and perceives; a movie in which you will have to decide for yourself whether you liked it or not.  And then history will be the ultimate judge of whether or not this will be a story to be remembered . . . One thing that will be remembered: the acting is superb and no reviewer can deny that. This is one in which you'll have to see it to believe it.",Fight Club

Lots of subliminal stuff, but then again ~ it was a very subliminal movie.  Brad Pitt pulled off a great charactor, and the other dude (Arge! I hate when I forget names!)

1429,tyler.td,Probably the best movie of the decade,10,29 November 1999,After watching this movie I was totally filled with enthusiasm. Fight Club is definitly Fincher's best movie even better than se7en. It's not only the story but the optics which fascinated me. When I had seen it for the second time I could see this movie with the knowledge of the conclusion which is really fascinating as you'll see Fight Club in a totally different perspective. Also great about Fight Club is its soundtrack performed by the Dust Brothers and especially the song 'Where is my mind' by the Pixies which really fit to the end of the movie. Unfortunately Fight Club didn't have much success in Germany but anyway the movie got best reviews of the German press. I also have to mention the brilliance of Ed Norton and Brad Pitt who plays best in roles in which he performs the villain. But it's quiet amazing what Edward Norton is able to do - he is just overwhelming. For that role he has to get the oscar.,Fight Club
1430,appell,bizarre equals brilliant,8,27 April 2000,"Fight Club is bizarre, yet perfectly normal.  It is a movie that's climax is everything to the plot, the characters, and the many subtle themes that permeate the film.  This climax is somewhat confusing and unquestionably strange, but despite its peculiarity, it has the effect of normalizing the film.  Edward Norton and Brad Pitt play two young firebrands disillusioned by the norms of society who start an organization of men like themselves. It is a club of men who fight each other barehanded and without protection for recreation.  However, although the fighting is not fueled by hate, it is very impassioned and as David Fincher's direction presents, extremely graphic.  While this fight club serves as the center of the film, there are so many other intricate themes in the movie which in the end, prove to be much more important than the organization.  The complexity of this movie was just so engrossing that I had to pause it several times just to ponder how the themes of the movie were forming.  Edward Norton's character was extremely complex but entirely believable, despite the peculiarity of his personality.  Fight Club is a film about how one man searches for freedom from the norms of his life, how he is alienated by the firm that employs him and corporate society in general, how he longs to join or form organizations to better his life, and how he realizes how he really enjoys something that initially disconcerted him greatly. This laundry list of themes are only a microcosm of this brilliant film, which as mentioned in the beginning, is able to blend all of these motifs with a bizarre climax that normalizes the characters and the point of the movie.  It is so difficult to describe this movie, and the mental effort that I put into dissecting the actual story and ending almost makes me forget how great Norton, Pitt, and Helen Bonham Carter's (Pitt's girlfriend in the movie) acting and Fincher's direction is.  You will never see this type of movie of again because it is magnificent.  Four stars out of four.",Fight Club
1431,gregory.mitchell,"settle down, boys . . .",8,21 September 2000,"Listen: for all it's virtues (amazing direction, great acting performances), FIGHT CLUB suffers greatly from it's simple-minded sheep in wolf's clothing story.FIGHT CLUB is *not* visionary, folks - it's reactionary, and that belies any of the strengths all you passive aggressive dirtbags attribute to this cool-looking but ultimately sophomoric w**k-job of a movie.Maybe I'm going soft, but I like REAL sincerity, sentiment and meaning in movies - not self-referential, reactionist bulls**t (""OOH, Starbucks is evil! IKEA is satan's furniture store! McDonald's serves Beezelebub's breakfast!"").Oh, and the reason(s) FIGHT CLUB got shuffled along on it's merry way in 1999?

1432,rabbitfist,Can you distinguish right from wrong?,10,4 May 2000,"Its amazing how varied peoples take on what this films message is. Some take it at its simplest face value, ""consumer culture bad, violence good, duh!"". A lot of people (though know one I know personally) think its pretentious. Over all to say that this film implies that any one thing (consumerism, violence, conformity, mob mentality) is good or bad is a very shallow interpretation. Real art usually doesn't carry a obvious message like ""making fun of people with cancer is bad"" or ""over coming fear is good"". Life is more complex than that so what could a film that made such obtuse statements have to offer. There are all kinds of interesting things going on. Some may think it pretentious, but I enjoyed scenes like the one in which Pitt whispers to Norton from the basement ""this conversation is over"".This film seems to have many levels. The ""consumerism bad"" level seems obvious (though done well) but its a set up for the next level and so on. The protagonist pitiful consumer, worker drone existence leaves him spiritually bankrupt. This leaves him ripe for the attractive (somewhat Buddhist in a way) philosophy espoused by Pitts rock star like uber man. Its justification for the Id run wild. Of course it is ultimately destructive when taken to extreme but at the same time their are some undeniable truths in the things Tyler says.  Fight Club explores many themes but it does not take any stands on what is right or what is wrong. That's up to the viewer and that is why people have such different takes on it. To me that's good film. In some scenes the violence is disturbing and you want it to leave the screen, in others it is beautiful and glorified. This leaves the responsibility of interpretation to viewer. Ideas are dangerous in irresponsible hands but because some lack  the capability to distinguish between hypothetical ruminations on the nature of violence and a call to blow up their high school, does that mean that movies have to always clearly state that murder is wrong.If you can't figure out that you shouldn't be watching.",Fight Club
1433,writ74,A waste of good talent,5,11 May 2000,"The great acting of Pitt and Norton and the top-notch visual stylings of director David Fincher cannot overcome the juvenile and absurd story of FIGHT CLUB.  Fincher has remarked that his film is anti-violent, and there is certainly some validity to that.  However, he seems to be having too much fun filming this overwrought film of two men trying to return to their masculine roots by having a series of fistfights with neighboring men. Some of the first half is fairly interesting and definitely puts a spotlight on the sadness of men who  find they may have lost an aspect of their soul. However when the whole thing starts this cult-like following of epic-proportions and an idiotic last 45 minutes keeps you scratching your head, the film simply ends up being ridiculous.  Want to see director Fincher really shine rent THE GAME with Michael Douglas or SEVEN with Pitt and Morgan Freeman.  Also want to see this same story told much better rent Kubrick's A CLOCKWORK ORANGE.",Fight Club
1434,Simi Valley Swinger,Seven.....On Steroids,10,13 November 2001,"It's difficult to rank the best movies of all time in a precise order. For instance, if I was forced to rank mine, Pulp Fiction would probably be #1, although I couldn't for the life of me explain why I liked it better then Clockwork Orange or Reservoir Dogs, which would be 2 and 3 on my list if I had to make one. All 3 are fantastic and not deserving of being ranked below the other. All you can really do is group movies into groups, those that are great, those that are good, those that are bad, and those that are horrible. The first and last group should be a very select group, with only a few members in each. Those 3 movies listed above would be in the first group for me. On that short list would be Seven and yes, Fight Club.
Fight Club is amazing, funny as it is serious, thought-provoking as it is graphic, it's genius in my opinion. I've read all the naysayers, and there's a place for everyone's opinion ( I won't say where that place is for some), but this movie is great (although still a notch below Seven). After a decent yet disappointing try with the Game, Fincher delivers another masterpiece here. Norton is great, Pitt (a true hit or miss guy if I've ever seen one) is excellent, the direction perfect, the story enthralling, dialogue clever. I could go on forever. But rather then bore you with my opinions any further, how about I just sum it up with this:If you haven't seen it, make it your next rental. Or purchase.

And the second time around that you watch it; it's a totally different film. If you havn't seen this film dont listen to all the politically correct moaners who seem to have really missed the plot, or probably havn't even seen the film, Fightclub is not theme-wise about fighting/violance etc The real themes are very complex and very relevent, I couldn't hope to explain them enough to do this film justice, so you will just have to watch the film yourself, just keep an open mind.

1439,archyon,It doesn't get any better then this.,10,13 October 2000,"David Fincher has marked himself as one of the most original directors in the field after the brilliant Se7en and the intriguing The Game. I must admit that I see Fincher, not Tarantino as the young Stanley Kubrick. This is not to imply that I dislike Tarantino - he stands fourth in my list of ten favorite directors, beating Fincher by three places. But Fincher's dark style, his obsession with the darkest areas of society and psychology place him inside the field of the brilliant Kubrick (who takes #1 in my favorite directors list, by the way).But enough on the directors - on to the movie Fight Club. The true best movie of 1999 (not the weak, overblown, pseudo-intelligent movie like American Beauty), it features energetic performances by Brad Pitt, who may yet redeem himself of his ""pretty boy"" days (he he did it once with Se7en; now I truly consider him to be a talented actor), and of course, one of the best American actors, and the best of the young American actors, Edward Norton. Norton is still not Pacino or De Niro, but give him time to become 40 - with such great movies in his pack as Primal Fear and American History X, and now this masterpiece, he still has a great future ahead. And last Helena Boham Carter - except Fight Club, I haven't seen a single movie with her, and as I understood it, I haven't missed much. She may not give such an outstanding performance such as Norton or Pitt, but in the role of Marla she while not amazing, but definetely satifying.The movie starts off with an original credits sequence, designed as a brain fly-through (you have to see it to appreciate) and jumps, head first, into what is Fight Club. As of right now, I WARN YOU:SPOILERS!!! THE FOLLOWING SECTION OF THE REVIEW IS ONLY FOR THOSE WHO HAVE SEEN THE MOVIE OR FOR THOSE WHO WOULD SPOIL THE MOVIE FOR THEMSELVES (BIGGEST MISTAKE OF THEIR LIVES, BY THE WAY)I have not read Palahniunk's (I think I mispelled his name, but what the heck) novel, so I will comment on the script. The script does excellent job, especially with those little details that become much more obvious when we learn that Tyler does not exist and is only the fruit of Jack's insanity. For example, once we see, in Jack's revelation scene, how he was fighting himself in the parking lot, we understand such a line as ""For some reason, I though of my first fight with Tyler"" in the scene where Jack beats himself up in the boss's office (as he crashes on the cabinet). Or why Marla was upset at Jack when he ignored her at the first scene when she comes to his house.This movie is definetely worth a second view (at least). Of course, this movie is not recommended for those of you who are weak of stomach (don't like to see close-ups of a man gets his face re-organized), or for those who are afraid to discover something new and unpleasant about themselves. I have recommended this movie to all of my friends, to my entire class in fact, and only a few have liked it. Why? Because most are afraid of the dark message this movie gives us. About the necessity of confronting our own demons before they grow to consume us. About our ignorant, blind-at-will, consumer society. About us. About the things we don't want to know.
For you worried parents: if you are so worried that your child will see blood and gore, then please understand that he must see this movie. The movie that truly will cause him to think about the true essence of blind violence. Trust me on the fact that it is less gory then (pathetic) movies like ""Scream"", simply because of the deep thought that lies behind the bare knuckles.",Fight Club

Fight Club is an outstandingly written, directed and acted movie, which will force anyone who sees it to take a harder line in self-examination. Edward Norton gives an outstanding performance as the Narrator (wrongly billed as ""Jack"" by some, Jack is the name of the character in the book he reads)Pitt provides some cracking fireworks as Tyler Durden, the man who turns the narrator's life upside-down.

1443,Future_War_Fan,Extreme-ly good,10,3 March 2001,"After 1997 and 1998 my hope for seeing a breakthrough in modern cinema, or at least a stream of really good movies seemed hopelessly doomed. Just like the narrator of Fight Club, I should have been prepared for a surprise. In 1999 there was Being John Malcovich, American Beauty, the Sixth Sense and best of all, Fight Club. Too bad the year 2000 saw a lot of the same, old boring junk come out again.I understand how some people feel repulsed by this movie. Yes, the violence is graphic, much different from the clean, movie-cut violence from your standard action movie. Violence has consequences on you... you don't just get punched in the face and then you're back to normal after 20 minutes. Yes, it's unsettling, but nothing is gratuitous.Much less I understand how some ""big people"" deliberately missed the point by calling this movie dangerous or fascist. The revolution we see in the movie is much closer to the anarchist sabotages during the 18-hundreds, and the reasons are the same. They movie doesn't tell you that sabotages are right, but it shows you the reasons that led to that kind of behaviour. What we see here is criticism at our society's faults, and the film hardly advocates terrorism; yes, unlike American Beauty, it is stretched to extreme consequences, and that's exactly the point: we HAVE to avoid a society ruled only by capitalism and money, because in such a place we are bound to lose our soul. You can think of American Beauty a hand that points a finger at our society's cr*p from the distance, and you can think of Fight Club as a hand that makes you see the cr*ap by smashing your face in it. And you will be blown away when you understand that the hand is YOUR hand. By the way, am I the only one that sees a parallelism between The Narrator and Pirandello's One, No One, and One Hundred Thousands? Although the latter is less anarchist, both the characters think about who they really are, and how they've become a tool. Both end up so frustrated they literally lose their identity.Fight Club deals with problems without being formulaic and preachy. And it manages it be entertaining, visually incredible, and funny. I can't recommend this movie to everyone, as I understand some will feel too unsettled by it (it rocks your world in every possible way). As for me... I don't think I could ask more from a movie...10/10",Fight Club

However, cracks appear in the relationship as Tyler cops off with a Goth bizarro (Bonham Carter) and his pranks go from subversive to near-homicidal.Fight Club is one movie that exactly caught the pre-millennial tension.

1449,AgentSD,My favorite movie of all time.,10,5 February 2002,"I'm now going to try to explain to everyone why this is easily the best movie of the past decade.There is no question that this movie is DEEP.  I can't stand people who think that this movie is just about a bunch of guys fighting and blowing stuff up.  This movie is at the very least, a great comment on society's current state.  It is adapted from Chuck Palahniuk's novel and preserves most of the themes of that novel.  The screenplay, by Jim Uhls, is fantastic and David Fincher's direction is brilliant.  Watching this film, the viewer is hit hard with messages about nihilism and modern consumerism.  It may take a couple viewings to get the full message.Anyway, onto the story itself.  The plot grabs hold of you and doesn't let go until the last credit has rolled.  The film tells the story of your average Joe Schmoe, a 28 year old man, who after losing all of his possessions in a fire, develops a friendship with an interesting character he meets on a plane, Tyler Durden.  After some drinks, Tyler asks our unnamed protagonist to hit him...as hard as he can.  After some hesitation, he does, and from here an underground fight club where similar men come to get out their anger emerges.  I don't want to give anything else away but let's just say that there is a lot more to the movie than that.  The plot stands alone as a work of art, but other elements of the film join it to create the best movie of the decade.First off, you've got your direction by David Fincher.  It's beautiful. Look at the damn movie.  The opening sequence alone is visually magnificent. The fight scenes are all extremely intense.  The airport scenes, the ikea furniture catalog; it's all amazing.  There is no doubt about that.Moving on to the acting, we see Edward Norton playing our protagonist, in the finest performance of his career.  His narration is so grim that we really get a sense of what the character is going through.  Other than that, his chemistry with Brad Pitt is amazing and stands out extremely well. Pitt gives one of the best performances of his career as Tyler Durden.  He really plays the maniacal genius well.  Joining Pitt and Norton is Helena Bonham Carter, who plays the dark Marla Singer, the love interest of Tyler and the protagonist.  She plays her role perfectly.  Watch this movie a couple of times and check out her reactions to certain things and you'll know exactly what I mean.One last thing I'd like to point out is the score for this movie, done by the Dust Brothers.  I'm not a fan of techno music but I must say that they did a really nice job here.  The music fits the events of the film perfectly and just adds to the movie's brilliance.This is a movie that I have seen probably 30 times.  Each time I watch it, it gets better.  In fact, I would say that this is a movie that NEEDS to be watched at least 2 times to be fully enjoyed.  Those who have done so know what I'm talking about.  I honestly do believe that this is the best movie of the past decade for no other movie presents us with such a well done mix of plot and theme.  Everything about this movie is great.  Buy it on DVD. Buy the book.  This is one of the greatest stories ever told.",Fight Club
1450,willa2puddy,Great Fight with Insomnia,8,1 May 2002,"The writers and director of this film definitely express a distinct genius for film making. The story line is consistent, as are the characters.  The suspension of disbelief is carried right up to the brink of climax. This story has a unique perspective, if not a factual one when it comes to insomnia, as I know from experience. Staying awake for days at a time is exactly what this movie brings to life.  Ed Norton is the consummate geek looking for that ultimate professional yuppie rush, and having met Brad Pitt, he is playing himself with an exciting twist.

This movie is about anti-consumerism in the way of fighting against being human drones manipulated by corporate commercials. The style and mood of Fight Club make it a masterpiece, something unique without being pretentious. The genius of this movie is how it crafted the seeming nerdy Edward Norton matched with the edgy Brad Pitt and toss in a big case of schizophrenia. OK This is not totally a new premise Psycho, A Beautiful Mind, American Psycho to name a few but this movie takes this story to bazaar journey into the mind of a man who feels like he is just consumer zombie. The fight scenes are a little off-putting and unconventional but this is a symbolic way of showing if you got hit in the face that aggressive action would really allow you to fully understand living. Fear is the motivating factor in this movie in how you deal with it and over coming also displayed in another good movie Defending your Life.

1454,The_Double-Thinker,"110 Minutes of Pure Greatness, but alas...",7,3 February 2007,"Fight Club is one of the greatest movies movies of all time... through the first 110 minutes. The film is about a man who has become a corporate slave, he sees no value or meaning in his life anymore. Because of this he goes to support groups in hopes that the pain of others will enable him to feel something, anything at all. The movie lays out a story that is entirely believable, considering people's tendencies of overworking, and the isolation many people feel in this modern world. Perhaps in the not-so-distant future people will feel the need to beat the hell out of each other to feel alive and connected. So far, in the film, you have grown attached to the characters and are immersed in the reality of what could be. The ending, ah the ending. The first 110 minutes of this movie are rated a 10/10 in my book, the last half hour or so brings the final rating down three points. The ending fit perfectly into a movie that was science fiction based. However this doesn't work. This movie bases its entire story around the idea that this kind of thing could really happen. The ending throws everything out the window. By the time this movie is over you might feel cheated, and rightfully so. To have science fiction like ending to this movie is almost as bad as making an entire movie a dream, you cannot do it! Salpping that ending onto this movie makes the entire thing feel pretentious and phony. Many will tell you that this is not the case, and that I just don't appreciate the twist at the end.

This is actually unfair to say because I've never seen a Bruce Lee film.  Anyway, this movie actually turned out to be heavy intelligent material with twists not obvious to the whole world.

Well, finally saw it and was totally amazed with everything. The direction, th acting, everything.The Acting- The eye candy doesn't get much better than this. (sorry if I come across as shallow)Brad Pitt gives a great performance, being scary, sexy, mysterious and downright awesome with no spots in between. Not to mention he was very, very attractive. Edward Norton, who I couldn't get over at how fast he slimmed down for this gave an unforgettable performance. Everything came off right, the narration, the beating himself up (best part ever). And for last Helena Bonham Carter, her acting was amazing, she was playing such a sleazy character but she did it without overacting at all.The Direction- Perfect, the shots, the small uses of effects everything.The Script- Perfect & logical. With the right mix of seriousness and humor.All in all: 10/10 great movie, good acting, attractive men, fist-fighting. Don't get much better. :) -Hannah S.",Fight Club
1462,jmt-18,The most underrated film of 1999,8,20 May 2002,"The one word to describe my emotions at the end of watching Fight Club was breathless. A wonderful cinematic experience and a movie that worked on so many levels. While the director David Fincher was famously called by Roger Ebert `a visual virtuoso'(which is correct), this film stretches much farther than clever camera shots and sharp editing. It tells a story that strikes a stunning resonant chord with anyone who is dissatisfied with their station in life (about 90% of the world's population). The story of a supressed American society is one that could have failed miserably but succeeded perfectly because of the superb quality of the acting.Ed Norton was blind robbed of an Oscar nomination for his portrayal of Jack, the protagonist, or antagonist, depending how you view the film. His initial disillusionment which leads to his eventual violent acts is so credible and he switches his emotions with ease. Brad Pitt was equally effective as Tyler Durden, who awakes Jack from his slumber from society. I am not Pitt's biggest fan but he shines in these types of roles. As he showed in `Ocean's Eleven' Pitt is Hollywood's best sidekick. Helena Bonham Carter should also be commended in her performance as Marla Singer as she doesn't simply represent a banal love interest and (despite her dreadful Scottish accent in `Women Talking Dirty') gives a convincing American accent.What makes this movie one of the best I have ever seen is its accessibility. Despite the fact I am an 18 year old from South London even I could relate in ways to both Jack and Tyler. Fight Club represents a slap in the face to capatalist society as a whole, while Jack's and Tyler's actions at the end of the film are unlikely to be replicated, the feeling of incontentment is a theme rife throughout the Western world. If only more films like Fincher's masterpiece were made then something might be done about it.",Fight Club

I remember in my youth/young adulthood I just remember loving the movie. I would have gave it a 9-10 all day. Now that I'm older I realize I may have been overrating it a bit. Yes, the movie is good with solid acting, good plot, and great shots. However, it is just missing something for me now. I'm not sure what it is. Maybe it is the last 30 minutes or so.

I won't tell anything spescific, but the suprise in the end makes the movie even better to watch the second time. Just like in the Sixth Sense, the movie leaves clues behind, and looking back and spotting them was the most fun I'd had watching a movie in a long time.

1468,francisco-bacigalupo,Fight Club: an Aristotelian look,10,25 June 2010,"There's no doubt that Fight Club is one of my favorite movies. Its attractive and original style, its trapping story, its performances, its ending and its message turn this sequence of images with sound into an authentic masterpiece. I consider this film to be one of the best of all times. Fincher tells us the story of an unnamed character (the narrator) who has entirely devoted to his job and whose life completely lacks of meaning. This guy, who is very well interpreted by Edward Norton, suffers from insomnia and can't find the solution to his problem. He becomes addicted to attending support groups and pretending to be a victim, which at first seems to be the cure to his sleeping disorder, but the presence of another impostor named Marla Singer (Helena Bonham Carter) ruins everything; Norton starts feeling uncomfortable. The narrator meets the man who is going to help him solve his problem, Tyler Durden (Brad Pitt). Durden will try to open Edward's eyes; he will teach him how to leave everything behind, how to forget about the material stuff in order to discover the meaning of his life. They will co-found an underground club known as Fight Club. This film is the story of us, the story of everyone. This is a love tale that, camouflaged by a critic to capitalism and consumerism, talks about the pursuit of happiness, talks about finding the right person, the person that takes out our best selves. It is a story that strengthens values such us compromise, conviction, devotion, determination and love. Ten out of ten",Fight Club

But then again I was only 9 years old back then and I don't think I would have had the same kind of excitement, understanding and amount of entertainment as now.. right now I'm grateful to my parents for not exposing me for such a totally brilliant violent movie! :D The history!

1471,austrumubanka,My most favorite movie,10,28 May 2008,"almost 10 years have passed and I have not seen better movie than this. Many people are mistaken when they think that this film is all about fighting and nothing more. The truth is that it contains the most interesting and useful moral as you can learn in any other movie. In a few words the moral is that a man can obtain freedom (and therefore happiness) only when he/she has given up his needs and fears, that most of us are living according to society standards, living according to the style that we hate and in front of which we are actually made ourselves dependant. I have seen it more than 10 times and always noticed new ideas which are worth to think about, and most of viewers, who watch this movie many times, have said that they experience the same experience. I have also read Fight Club book and honestly and liked the movie better - this doesn't happen often - David Fincher did excellent job - the film has very unique and accordant style without exaggerations and the crew was very successfully build, actor play is faultless, there is nothing you would want to change.",Fight Club
1472,pygmydynamo,One of the best movies I have ever seen.,9,23 February 2011,"I loved everything about this movie. It makes you question your priorities, what it is you're working away for at your 9 to 5 job, and it challenges all the little invisible barriers commonly accepted by society.Best of all, it is the story of a functioning schizophrenic told from his own perspective. Realistically and accessibly told. But it doesn't feel like an after school special at all... it feels like a joyride! What a brilliant revelation this movie is. There are very few movies that have tackled mental illness from such a point of view, and none that do it in such a breathtaking and enjoyable fashion.I saw this movie again on cable TV the other night, and I noticed the ranking was 2 stars out of 4. It also described it as ""Edward Norton and Brad Pitt duke it out..."" Are you kidding me? This is one of the best movies of my life time. A must-see for anyone and everyone, and a bit of a wake up call to our society.",Fight Club

I saw nothing in this movie in the end it just is very confusing. I mean the isn't Tyler Durton but he is!!! I mean that ending just destroyed this movie for me and if I were you I really would not waste 2 and 7 minutes watching this movie. The only reason why I gave this movie a 4 is the fight scence and the sex scence that is it.

1474,ranjeet-jha-vv,"I am addicted to this film, in a way it motivates me; therefore whenever I feel low I choose to watch this film.",10,13 June 2013,"Fight club is made by one of my favorite film-maker David Fincher. It is based on the novel written by Chuck Palahniuk. Edward Norton & Brad Pitt have acted in this film.I love this film because of its philosophy. Probably this is one film which is very close to my heart. I am addicted to this film, in a way it motivates me; therefore whenever I feel low I choose to watch this film.I also love this film for its motivational quotes, its unconventional characters, stylized treatment, and dripping background scoresHowever, I don't think that any conscious reason will justify my explanation behind taking this film as a topic for film analysis; hence I will only say that this is my kind of cinema. Story:- Fight Club is a fascinating story of an Edward Norton and his world, his inner as well as outer world. This is a story of Tyler Durden. Edward Norton is a social animal who lives a monotonous life. He buys everything of which he sees an advertisement, however at the end of the day he also knows that nothing is worth buying. He is bored of his routine and flat life. He is bored of his falsehood, the artificiality in him have created all the complication in the story. On one not so fine day his fully furnished and occupied complex caught fire, he felt so lost and depressed. He just wanted to share his grief to anybody, hence he called Tyler Durden to whom he has recently met in an airplane and with whom he has also exchanged a number. This was his greatest mistake. Tyler was smart, dynamic and everything that Edward Norton has always aspires to be. Tyler was free from all kind of obligation and responsibilities. Edward Norton collaborated with Tyler and starts a club known as Fight Club. Fight Club is the way to break free. It is a club where two people will fight with each other. It is a club with the certain set of rules. Members of fight club are obliged to these rules. Tyler was the mentor, motivator and inspiration for the club member, they respect Tyler. This brought Tyler an opportunity to initiate project ""Mayhem"" (I am not going to disclose the details of Project Mayhem as it will be spoiler). However I will like to tell that Project Mayhem was all about destruction, it was all about economic equilibrium. Edward Norton didn't want this to happen as it will create havoc, and thus he fought against Project Mayhem, he fought against Tyler. But how can you defeat the animal within? Fight Club is a social film which deals with metaphysical plot.""Tyler Durden"" is one of my favorite characters in the history of cinema, and Brad Pitt has excellently portrayed the character of Tyler Durden. I don't think that any other Actor other than Brad Pitt would have done justice to this character. Brad Pitt has given style to the character which was needed. I think Brad Pitt was most appropriate for the role of Tyler Durden however I will also say that the character of Tyler Durden was such a well written character half the job of the actor was done while writing it.Edward Norton is a fantastic actor, he have a capability to get into the skin of the character. In this film he has played a narrator and story was said from his point of view. I will say that Edward Norton have done a great job, as his character was recognized even after the presence of the strong character of Tyler Durden.David Fincher is a great storyteller he had courage to tell this complicated story with such a style and elegance. I have watched this film hundreds of time, and after watching and re-watching this film again and again I can say that this may be one of flawless film that I have watched. I respect the director for his detailing on the script, on his characters. I respect him for the style that he put in the film. I respect him for the subject of the film. Dialogues is also one of the most important part of this film, every time Tyler Durden speaks his words punches the viewer on their face. This film is full of quote and I will like to mention some of it over here.""Things that you own ends up owning you""""You are not the content of the wallet, You are not your job, You are not the car that you own, You are all the singing and dancing crab of this world""And many moreHypnotic background score and cinematography have done its job.

1475,nirax,Drivers of Fascism,9,25 October 2008,"One of the most thought provoking movies I have seen. It aims to shed some light on the originators of fascist movements taking root all over the world. Everywhere someone - some twisted mind - is out there to take control of emotionally vulnerable people and then channelize it to their own end. To make the connection with fascism clear, in one of the memorable scenes Tyler asks its recruits whether they have black shirts/jackets/etc - recall the Blackshirts of Mussolini URL = http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blackshirts . Take the Al-Qaeda, Lashkar or Hitler, Stalin all seem to have a basic lack of respect for human life and they all are like Tyler ... the only difference being Tyler (I mean Norton) tries to redeem himself in the end. Sure as hell we know rest of the Hitlers and his ilk never knew what they were doing ...And why just fascists ... even religious preachers, communists or just about anybody who is fanatic enough to convert others to his point of view with a crusaders zeal (to the point of trying to eliminate people if they do not convert) all come under the scanner in this brilliant movie.On a different note, for a long time I was under the impression that this movie is one of ""Fast and furious"" varieties ... am happy that ultimately I overcame my inhibition to see this masterpiece.",Fight Club

Whether we like this or not it is real in some areas, with some people. I wondered whether or not the writes actually experienced this also. Director David Fincher takes it to the next level with an accomplished handle on the material. He gets pretty good performances out of his actors.Actors, Edward Norton, Brad Pitt and Helena Bonham Carter lead the cast which includes Meat Loaf, Zach Grenier, Richmond Arquette and David Andrews.

The film consists of a psychological and beautifully twisted plot, which captures your attention from the very first line. The characters are portrayed remarkably, and the main actors gave brilliant performances. The movie is quite difficult to grasp at first glance and you may need to watch it a few times to fully understand. However, this may just be my judgement. The film gives a different and more complex outlook on life, and how even the average human being can be haunted and controlled by the obscurity that is our mind.

This movie went to the lengths it needed to and shied away from NOTHING that was portrayed within the books. Bravo to everyone involved in this film.

After the fantastic Se7en and the less good The Game,Fincher proves once again that he is one on the best director Hollywood has got.Within a couple of years,he has offered highly stylised entertainment,but it seems that he is not getting the respect he is due.It must not be forgotten that 27 scenes were cut from his very personnal version of Alien,and that he was just recently kicked from the MI-3 project by Tom Cruise. Is he comdemned,like Tim Burton,to follow the studio's rules by directing movies like Panic Room?I hope that he is going to bring more movies that will prove to everybody that he is one of the best.But for now,Fight Club remains THE ultimate reference of his filmography. *****/5",Fight Club
1487,gpurin,Mind Blowing Punches,10,17 March 2004,"Fight Club is one of those movies that starts kind of slow, but with each frame the speed goes in crecendo, so when half the movie is past, the narration got such amount of momentum, that you can´t stop watching it until it blows you at the end, getting you mind dumb for a couple of minutes thinking what just happened.The story line is simple, a man that doesn´t like his life the way it is, starts searching for new kicks. In the middle of this search he meets a unique person, the Carpe Diem Carpe Noctem spirit, that makes him part of a club, the fight club. At this point is when the movie starts its rampage speed. In the Fight Club everyone is welcome, everyone that is not satisfied with his life or the status quo of society, but for there surprise they are not a minority, the rest you must see it for your self.Brat Pit performance in this movie is just great, just as great as his characters in Seven, 12 Monkeys or Snatch (please erase from your memories his acting in the Mexican); Eduard Norton is also great; the both of them makes a great lead duo.To fully understand and enjoy the movie, you must have an open mind and be aware of all the cultural references you would see in this movie, from beatnik expressions to the most consumpcionist neo yuppie ones.To wrap this up, is one of the best movies I´ve ever seen it got a surprising ending (just like usual suspects), a lot of action and fights (like a High quality Bronson/Van Damme movie), and a great and original script (like American Beauty) for me this is a new Classical film, it gets 9 and a half stars from 10.",Fight Club

1489,treeroot,Keep your Tyler alive,9,11 April 2004,"Coarse, repulsive though it appears, Fight Club has its beauty-- savage beauty-- lie in its audacity to dig into a human soul, scoop out a thing hidden deep there and set it loose. Unshackled, it ran amok, did whatever it saw fit, and stunned everyone by its frightful, reckless ideas and acts. Undoubtedly, it twisted many stomachs by blowing up a nice condo with all the chic stuff inside, attacking people merely for the fun of it, and messing about without apparent reasons. And yet not everything it did came out of sheer vandalism. Didn't it make sense having a pair of miserable men, under restricted conditions, go beating each other black and blue and forget their woes for a while? Wasn't the idea of demolishing financial bases a dream for those who sank deep in debt to get their credit records erased and their lives started anew? Here is it, the thing we fear and love, and it is called Tyler Durden -- a spirit of a mortal¡¯s second self, smart, rebellious, powerful, and altogether dangerous. And that Tyler lives in you, too, my friend, as it does in nearly everyone else. Though the version of it may vary -- yours does not have to be that shaggy, oddly dressed, chain-smoking, villain-like figure, the nature of it remains just the same. You need it, can't live without it, for it is probably the only thing that knows you through and through, inspires you with ideas and plans, and always stays with you, regardless of who you are and whatever you will become. However, you may want to be cautious not to render it too much license, for it would probably run wild, flat out, dragging you all the way to jail (if not getting you killed halfway through), where you two might end up having nothing but the iron bars to nibble at for a change. And yet, even if, for some reason, you just let it go, and, deservedly, wound up in a sticky situation, you still should keep that Tyler of yours, guilty or not guilty, alive. If you did him in through anger or stupidity, you would be left without a soul, would become a pathetic living corpse, fumbling around, hating yourself. So the point is not whether you should have it--you've got to have it--but how to. It¡¯s a matter of who controls who. So make sure you hold it in leash most of the time, so that both of you could stay alive and go on riding in your one-way journey in this world.
Alas, Fight Club, despite everything it showed with boldness, got frightened at last by its own daring. The fact that it had Tyler killed saddened those who had just been enlightened by it. I rate it 9 out of 10.",Fight Club
1490,treeroot,Understanding the words,9,15 May 2004,"I feel somewhat compelled to throw a few thoughts to the remarks popping up in Fight Club that have stirred so many minds. ""The things you own end up owning you."" This could be true in a materialized environment where everyone is selling something for a living and at the same time doing some purchase and being a consumer himself, where the desire to have more would easily grow out of control and deluge a soul from inside. However, it ought not to be understood that it has to be the case for all who have obtained some kind of property within the easy reach of their pockets, and that one would be better off without having anything in his possession. A few nice pieces of furniture from IKEA would not make one feel being possessed (or enslaved), but a craving for everything clever probably would. So the issue may not be a simple matter of to have or not to have, but rather a delicate business of finding a balance between what one can comfortably earn and what one really needs for survival. The dividing line might get so fine that one more step could make difference. ""It's only after we've lost everything that we're free to do anything."" A very inspiring theory for those who know what they are up to when freed(or,to be on the safe side, BEFORE taking the plunge). Indeed, men can give up things they own and endure a much-reduced living condition if only they know there are better things for them to fight for. Burning a condo full of nice stuff might sound exciting. But if you don't belong to that clever bunch, don't do it. ""How much can you know about yourself if you've never been in a fight?"" This is perhaps the most interesting saying in the whole Fight Club thing. Yet different interpretation of it could result in very different scenarios. Taking it literally means you've got to exchange blows with someone and see if you can conquer him (or, if not, what will be left of you after that), so as to give yourself an assessment. However, this concept can be as glorious as it is perilous. It would be fine for you, if you happened to be a powerfully built man apt at one-two stuff. But what if you were not the type, but the smirking guy paired up with you was, and you knew, by a mere glance of his mean face, that, three minutes into it, you would surely be punched into a nasty squash of pulp? How are you going to make a fair evaluation of your precious self in a situation like that, eh? However, taking the saying beyond its surface and assuming it implying the meaning that one could fight with whatever one is strong on, the whole theory would be of great significance to many. Indeed, with that idea in place, nearly every sort of being can fight. For instance, if you had a head much more decent than the trunk beneath, you could go fight with your brainpower¡ª outwitting a mind could be as thrill (if not thriller) as thumping a body into submission. And even if you were a God-forgotten child, having a head and a form with qualities way below the average, and a down-and-out life with no one there to care for you but an old lame dog, you could still fight the world with all the defiance and burden-free calmness that only you could possibly have, walking on the street with your head held high and your dog at your heels, daring anyone who has everything to take anything with them when the time comes. In the end we are all equal, aren't we?",Fight Club
1491,llsabathia,mind-blowing...literally,10,13 May 2016,"In terms of uniqueness, Fight Club stands alone in its own perfectly crafted category. The cinematography of rapid and slowed down scenes of large and small scale gives this film a distinguishable edge over all other films. Finchers use of slow-motion fits into each and every sequence and the distribution of the blood adds a certain realistic feature. Of course, since this film is highly acclaimed and frequently talked about, its hard not to hear rumors and gossip about the plot. However, I deliberately stayed away from this film until I was able to sit down and see it and my motives didn't disappoint. The plot twist hit me hard and had me skimming earlier parts of the film to test its consistency. It is one of the best plot twists of all time, other than the 6th sense, and will continue to keep this movie amongst the greats.",Fight Club

It's about the tension between instinct and culture. And Konrad Lorenz's On Aggression, mostly derivative of Freud's little book, does some useful updating.Dogs are aggressive, ready to fight at the slightest sense of threat. Pet dogs do a pretty good job of subsuming their aggressions. But they have one hell of a pack instinct to help them out. With presumably equally strong aggressive instincts but no pack instinct to speak of, what do humans do with their aggressions in order to stay out of jail and in social good graces?",Fight Club

I'd rather watch a pokemon fight then those two weak fruity actors fight (but Brad was OK in Ocean 11 and 12 monkeys). Plus the whole plot is just way over the top. It tries to appeal to a smart audience, but I think it can only appeal to a dumb one. This film total insults Capitalism and America. It tries to make some political statements, but it is just a 2 hour piece of garbage. I should have known better than to rent this weak movie. The movie cover simply has a picture of a bar of pink soap! That should have told me not to watch it, but since the reviews were kind of good, I rented it anyway.

1494,john-1666,A brief commentary on my personal opinion of the movie fight club.,10,25 October 2004,"Never have I seen a movie that begins to touch viewers on as many levels as Fight Club does. The movie gives a very in-depth look at people's perception of reality and just how confused and innate humans can become. The movie itself is amazingly executed and well balanced. I can't think of any way to improve upon the cinematography of the movie, and the plot was far from lacking. When I started my quest to watch all of the best movies ever created, Fight Club was high on the list of 'must sees', and it did indeed live up to my expectations. Not only does the movie provide quite a warped and bizarre look at humanity and reality, but also provides the view with well rounded, solid violence in a none excessive way. I would defiantly say this is one of the most amazing movies of all time, if you want to watch a movie that will make you think, Fight Club is for you.",Fight Club
1495,Mneo,"It's not a changeover, it's a deus ex machina that's spelled R-E-F-U-N-D",3,29 November 2013,"After all the discrete, awful, painful, sequences with too much blood and gore, and real buzz-kill sheet scenes where Brad Pitt, wearing boxing gloves, or surgical gloves, humping the washed-up chain-smoker. I thought there must be something more than a deus ex machina in the end, something thrilling and enlightening that somehow makes the movie worthy of the suffering.But no. Brace yourself for the catastrophic collapses near the end, it's basically the routine deus ex machina that explains everything by startling the protagonist out of reverie, things went awry when the narrator and Brad Pitt merged into one, a most implausible schizophrenic, who contradicts almost the whole plot line before this ham-fisted twist. Then this eerie double personality talked directly to the audience from David Fincher's perspective -- now it's a holy trinity of them -- ""It's called a changeover, the movie goes on and nobody in the audience has any idea.""I'd have hurled myself at the screen if I had been old enough to go and see and understand it in a cinema.Besides, I have little idea what the novel by Chuck Palahniuk is about, I tried to give it a whirl but it kinda strengthened my belief that stream of consciousness should be solidified before written down, the ill-punctuated text rendered me brain damaged.",Fight Club
1496,Christoph-Matiss,"A radical, dark film presenting new standards in narration",9,3 March 2005,"No doubt, Fight Club is one of the best films of the decade and it deserves its overwhelming good reputation. Edward Norton plays his second-best role after his terrific performance in American History X and Brad Pitt does best in dark and bizarre films so he is absolutely right in Fincher's masterpiece. From the beginning it becomes clear that this is no film for people who just want to relax in their seat with some popcorn and a cola trying to spend a smooth evening. You really have to think and this is what makes it a good film. A man is frustrated about his life and searches for something completely different. Honestly, that's not a very new idea but Fincher is able to give it a new direction. He radicalizes his characters and shows brutality in a direct and uncovered way. The perversion of society gets a face in Tyler Durden and the ones who follow his ""new way"". The narration is what impressed me most. Who are absolutely shocked when you have to realize that Tyler is not the one he seems to be... To give a conclusion: Not my favourite, but a very, very good film!",Fight Club
1497,harry_smyth,Overrated,3,3 March 2007,"In my opinion, Fight Club is probably the most overrated movie in the IMDb top 30 list. The plot is unsatisfactory and the graphic violence displayed is particularly disturbing and difficult to watch. The cinematography is dark throughout and although this was obviously intended by the makers of the movie, i find it another unappealing aspect. In fact, i'm surprised that an actor of Brad Pitt's calibre chose to star in it. He is without doubt one of the best actors of his generation and has certainly done better work in his career. I always think he is at his best in more entertaining movies like Ocean's Eleven where he is superb. Definitely would not recommend this movie although i think i'm in the minority judging by the its present lofty position on the top 250 list.",Fight Club

The film has those moments of mystery and sense of curiosity that will keep you at the edge of your seats until the mind blowing finale. And even after that , you might wanna watch the movie again or even thrice , because of the numerous clues hidden by Fincher in the movie. The movie is filled with thought provoking quotes and the score also does a fine job to give an overall chilled vibe.

This movie is about a guy that narrates his life story through out the movie. What makes it interesting is while he is narrating he doesn't realize his illusions and just narrates what he thinks is real. The movie starts out with a sad entrance and kind of dramatic about an average American person with a job that makes good money and in the process he discovers his Brutal side. Now, what made him violent is that he met a guy on a plane who he admired and happened to turn out to be his friend after he found out his apartment was on fire and he needed a place to crash. His friend made opened his eyes about how his life is boring and needs to change. They start by fighting and than starting a fight club. So far, the movie is just dramatic, sad, and brutal.

1502,thdude44,Surprisingly smart and stylish,9,19 June 2005,"Two of the best actors out there, Brad Pitt(12 Monkeys) and Edward Norton(American History X), star in this fast paced and brutal look on men who hate what they do. It focuses on one main man(of whom we never know the real name of), Edward Norton, he's an insomniac and hasn't slept for six months. He finds out that by letting out his feelings and crying let him sleep like a baby, but when his plans are disrupted by an addicted smoker Marla(Carter), he goes right back to sleep deprivation. Norton works for a major car company whose cars aren't exactly the safest in the world. His job is to travel around the country and investigate the problems the cars are having. On one of his flights, he meets a very interesting soap salesman named Tyler Durden(Pitt). The two become friends and end up living together in a rundown old house on Paper street. To get out their anger and just let loose, they have boxing matches every week, they find it exciting. But their fun starts to attract more and more working stiffs like themselves, and soon enough, they end up having a club in an underground basement of a bar every night of the week. The club soon becomes a cult of rage, brutality, self-destruction, and mischief. Pitt gives a strong, odd, and highly charismatic performance. He makes it just that much more fun to watch. Norton gives a very solid performance as the everyday man turned insane loose cannon. Director David Fincher's style with his movies are exquisite. His trademark cinematography and the cool, sleek music make his films fun. Ed Norton always seems to give an absolutely awesome performance in whatever he does, I believe he is one of the greatest actors out there right now. Although if it wasn't for Pitt, this film probably would have been more of an independent other than a blockbuster. All in all, 'Fight Club' is a disturbingly brutal, smart, violent, darkly funny, cool flick. It's flawless performances, swift music, cinematography, and deeply smart story make this movie a classic in my mind.",Fight Club

While the blurb of the movie gives clear indications of what the movie is about, the progression of the movie warrants that you watch the movie. And what a movie it is indeed - From the inception of Fight Club (not revealing anything about it), to the ending scene, it is a narrative stroke of genius, with a tinge of insanity, awesomeness, and balls-- to-the-wall fun which is rare to find to be honest. People can make the argument that such insanity is commonplace in movies (""Psycho"", ""Clockwork Orange"", ""Rock n Rolla"", ""Dementia"", ""Batman: The Dark Knight"", ""Apocalypse Now"", ""Shutter Island"") but here, it is unique because of the setting, the way the acting balances the plot as well as uses the environment rather than allow a static transition from one scene to the next. Here, I'll only mention good humor being one example of how this balance is achieved between the environment and the characters. In conclusion, this is a good movie. A definitive watch – well, at least once anyway.",Fight Club
1506,Chris_Lacon,"Fincher's caustic satire, whist slightly losing its potency upon repeat viewings, still remains a powerful piece of counter consumerist art.",8,2 August 2010,"In the closing months of 1999, two films were released depicting modern man in crisis. The first was ""American Beauty"" directed by Sam Medes and depicting a middle aged man suffering a midlife crisis. ""Fight Club"" directed by David Fincher and released two weeks later was its angrier, much more cynical counterpart. Adapted from Chuck Palenhuick's 1996 bestseller, ""Fight Club"" swaggered into cinemas to a lukewarm reception from critics, who found the film polarising and its violence gratuitous, exacerbated by the studio poorly thought out marketing campaign. Since then however, the film's reputation has gradually grown in esteem and is now regarded as one of the greatest films of the 90's. The film's themes still resonate today and I feel that it fares well when compared to its competitor, which seems soapy and melodramatic by comparison Whist I would agree that the film is a unique one, featuring stellar performances from Norton, Bonham Carter and Pitt and slick direction from Fincher, the film loses some of its acerbic potency slightly upon repeat viewings. Nevertheless it's more than apparent ""Fight Club"" will go down as one of the best movies of the late 20th Century and a landmark depiction of masculinity on film.Pitt's performance as Tyler Durden is undoubtedly the highlight of the film. Boasting an air of dangerous virility and later mocking, contemptuous threat, Durden will likely go down as one of cinema's most iconic male characters, up there with Eastwood's Blondie, De Niro's Travis Bickle and Pacino's Michael Corleone. Coming at the end of a seminal streak in the 1990's, Pitt delivers a powerhouse performance, playing the anarchic Tyler with rebellious aplomb. His chemistry with both Norton and Boham Carter are excellent, with Durden as the perfectly extroverted yin to Norton's much more introverted yang and his scenes with Carter crackling with sexual tension. Without a doubt, Durden is the films charismatic heart of darkness and Pitt deliver's in a truly exceptional performance. Norton's role as the anonymous, insomniac narrator is far more subdued compared to Pitt's but Norton's white collar everyman appeal gives the character a relatable appeal. Whist at times, the characters narration can seem dour and neurotic, Norton's anonymous nature makes him a more relatable protagonist then Kevin Spacey's Lester Burnham, and more sympathetic that Michael Douglas in ""Falling Down"". If anything, Norton's character feels more like Generation X's equivalent of Dustin Hoffman's Benjamin Braddock in ""The Graduate"" than Spacey's disillusioned baby boomer or Douglas's psychotic vigilante. If Pitt's anarchist soap salesman is the films dark heart, then Norton is its audience surrogate and ultimately the moral core.Among the supporting cast, the two undeniable stand outs are Helena Boham Carter as the nymphomaniac, destitute Marla Singer and Meat Loaf as Robert ""Bob"" Paulson, rather unfortunately endowed with a pair of ""bitch tits"". Here, Boham Carter plays a character a million miles removed from the quirky but increasingly stale characters she's played recently. A foul mouthed, nymphomaniac ""tourist"", Singer comes across as a interesting and unique love interest and yet, when at the end of the film she displays more typical romantic lead aspects, it feels true to character as opposed to suddenly jarring. Meat Loaf gives the role of Bob, a sense of humour and likability, in a role that could have easily lapsed into parody, which makes his eventual demise and martyr-fication by Project Mayhem all the more tragic.Fincher's past experience making stylish thrillers such as ""Se7en"" and ""The Game"" is clearly on display in ""Fight Club"". The fight scenes are brutal and gratuitous, not shying away from blood, sweat and disfigurement, but there's logic and reason behind them, as opposed to just being sequences designed to shock or disgust its audience. I feel that if the films fight scenes had not been as visceral as they are, then the films themes would have felt less effective and the film would have been criticised for not developing or exploring them enough. The film is shot through with a glossy sheen, which doesn't detract from the grittiness and brutality of the fight scenes .The more stylised sequences that are in the film however, are handled competently, sequences testament to Fincher's early experience directing music videos, with the film boasting several uniquely stylish and occasionally surreal sequences, from the title sequence depicting a brain's neural network in which the thought processes are initiated by the Narrator's fear impulse, to a disorienting, slow motion sex scene. On the downside, several of the more stylised, CGI heavy sequences now look dated, especially the latter. Whist the films themes may be timeless, evidently the CGI isn't. Thematically, ""Fight Club"" is not the first film to explore the ""modern man in crisis"" theme. Throughout the 1990's, we had several movies exploring that and similar themes, usually with sardonic observations on society and commercialism peppered throughout. ""Falling Down"" had sly observations on commercialism and advertising and Oliver Stone's ""Natural Born Killers"" explored the relationship between sensationalist media and violent serial killers. ""Fight Club"" tackles much of the same themes and whist it does it successfully, at times the films themes and messages tend to overwhelm the plot and frequently feel heavy handed. I felt the bar scene where Pitt explains his philosophy and views on commercialism to Norton was a subtler way of getting the films message across. Overall I would say ""Fight Club"" is certainly a unique film with a cynical, acerbic take on consumerist culture. Undoubtedly one of the best films of the late 20th Century and with an enduring male icon in the shape of Pitt's Tyler Durden, the film admittedly does lose some of its satirical bite upon multiple viewings with its message coming across as heavy handed. The films non linear plot line and cutaways can also feel repetitive after a while. The pro's however far outweigh the cons of Fincher's searing satire.",Fight Club

1508,cadburypg,Time releasing mix of wisdom and action,10,28 August 2017,"This movie had been in my WatchList for a while and due to being a Brad Pitt starrer with a tell tale name I imagined it to be a hardcore action movie. Nothing could be farther than that notion.The Narrator (Norton) is a Recall specialist of cars. His job is formulaic to him and he is doing well there. He is a compulsive shopper and suffers from insomnia. He cannot sleep and tries ways and means to get sleep.As fate would have it he meets Tyler Durden in a flight on his way back from a business trip. Tyler who makes soaps and tells him there are ways to make explosives at home and unlike Narrator believes in a non materialistic life. As a twist of fate ( or is it) these two become housemates and start fist fights as mode of recreation. This sport becomes popular enough to be a structured club and makes Tyler a cult leader.This is such a clever movie and hides so much wisdom between its layers. The crux for the movie is how the young generation of today is having it all and yet so shallow and empty within. We try to fight our depressions and troughs in mood by retail therapy. We become the donkey with the carrot dangling in front of it. The corporate giants convince us that the secret to our happiness is the new anti wrinkle cream or owning the latest fashion or technology will ensure us the perfect soulmate and yet here we are doomed to strive on for the proverbial carrot. A generation slave to consumerism and driven by credit card companies. A generation whose pearly white smile doesn't sprout from the soul. Men who are members of the FightClub do fist fighting as recreation sans any ego or getting personal . These men could be anyone from a hot shot manager of a firm to your delivery truck guy. They invest their time after work in an active sport rather than drinking at the bar or playing video game in their room. While ideas and philosophies can be great but who knows when a philosophy becomes radical and an act of enlightenment becomes that of extremism. The line is so thin and it resides right within us. Even if you have firm faith on your leader should you not ask questions? When and how gradually does an avid anti materialistic movement becomes a militant group and what is that line that differentiates a degenerate from a guru? This movie reminded me of American Psycho and helped me better understand it too. FIGHTCLUB is stylish and punchlines to remember for life. Acting wise its a powerhouse with Edward Norton (Narrator) , Helena Bonham Carter (Marla Singer) and Brad Pitt (Tyler Durden) giving amazing performances.

1511,Wulfus,Stunning...,10,23 January 2006,"This is my all time favorite movie. And let me tell you tell you why: It hits close to home. The Narrator (Jack) speaks of things that we can all relate to in our daily lives and when you think about them for even just a tiny little second, you nod your head in agreement and say to yourself ""Yeah, that's true."" In the summer of 2004, I had insomnia, I saw that on amazon everyone's favorite movie was FIGHT CLUB, and I didn't know why, so I decided to go out and rent it one night and I was up all night watching it over, and over, and over. It will make you laugh, cry and cringe at yourself. There's violence, yes, but it's directed at the machine. And really when you think about all the machine does is promote violence so what better to do than shove it back in they're conservative Pentecostal faces, right? Right. If you haven't seen this movie, go out now to the nearest video store, rent it, buy it, watch it over and over and over again. It's worth your money, I assure you that. This is something the late Stanley Kubrick would have adored. If you will, compare the ending (I wont reveal it) to the ending of (I wont reveal that either) A Clockwork Orange.

1515,dakshramchandani,Why is this movie so highly regarded?,1,15 October 2019,The biggest problems with this movie is that it is not interesting in a pseudo-intellectual sort of way and that it does not impart the viewer with anything.,Fight Club

1517,eliasbass,A masterpiece,9,25 February 2019,I really loved this movie. The actors and the plot was amazing. The ending was mind blowing. I recommend this to anyone who want to see a movie that they will concern a lot,Fight Club
1518,Digital Apathy,One Complaint (w/Spoiler!),8,18 June 2000,"*S P O I L E R*  The only major criticism I had of this otherwise fine film, was the sequence towards the end when we see Narrator fighting himself via the security camera.  Wasn't this pandering to the audience?  Aren't we smart enough to figure out what's going on here?  More importantly, couldn't Fight Club be more ambiguous with the reality of Narrator and Tyler? Perhaps something along the lines of; Is Deckard a Replicant (Blade Runner)?",Fight Club
1519,Paul-91,"David Fincher - overrated, or just not talented?",1,16 October 1999,"What a pretentious and loathsome movie! Cultural anthropologists are surely having a good laugh at this film's notion that men are only true to their nature when they are violent. The fact that this trash will make money is a sad comment on our society. As pitiful and horrifying as the ""Tough Man"" contests are, THEY are more entertaining than this dreck! In addition, Brad Pitt is a real stiff, and why was he wearing Ratso Rizzo's clothing?",Fight Club
1520,God-13,"A clever piece of Art, don't miss it!",10,26 August 2000,"'one of the most disturbing films ever' according to critics. 'This film will do harm to young people'. People who believe these quotes are the right indication of this movie, are wrong. This film isn't about fighting or violence, it's about a clever man, who thinks he's getting better, but is really getting worse...Director David Fincher, creator of films such as 'Alien3', 'Seven' and most recently 'The Game' has come with a new shocking film, 'Fight Club'...A film with great acting(never seen Brad so good), brilliant story(as good as 'The Usual Suspects'), superb soundtrack(Dust-brothers ultimate skills) and even a taste of history...Digging deep in the roots of history, you can see the similaritys between Fight Club and historical events. The force of the national socialism(Project Mayhem), people being very sick and think they are healthy(Hitler) and all other kinds.........This darkned and very rare Piece of Art is one of a kind. It's unbelieveable how they can make movies like this one. This is as good as it get's people.You must see this film!!!!",Fight Club
1521,Koth-3,"The ""end-all-be-all"" of script and story!",10,4 May 2002,"Do not rent this movie unless you have the whole weekend!  I guarantee you that it will be necessary.  Fight club it one of those films that the more you watch it, the more you want to watch it.  The intricacy of the story, combined with the hidden truth and the sarcastic humor make this in the list of my to ten films of all time.  But don't take my word for it.  See it today, just schedule accordingly!",Fight Club
1522,Austin Bindlestiff-2,Kicks all kinds of ass,8,4 July 2000,"This is one of those movies that, for me, suggest that there is a lot that is going on that if I don't get, it is my fault and not the movie's. I have a few friends who saw this and were just basically p***ed off by their lack of understanding.  I was intrigued, excited, and felt like I oughta buy the DVD someday to try it again.  Which I will do soon.",Fight Club
1523,smots,Why are you still behind your computer? GO SEE THIS FILM!,10,31 October 1999,"Fincher has done it again. After ""SE7EN"" and ""THE GAME"" he has created a true cinematographical tour the force that will set your head reeling, commenting on consumerism, post-modernism, society's infatuation with violence and modern society, to name a few.....Do NOT visit this film expecting to view some tough action flick about guys beating eachother to a pulp. This is one hell of a multi-layered, intense movie.LOVED IT.",Fight Club
1524,MaNiC-6,Absolutely Brilliant,10,6 December 1999,"I love this movie. I love the actors, the direction (Fincher RULES!) and I love the story. Something everyone should see.Don't look to hard at it either. Just understand it and like it. Don't try and analyse it too much. Why do that when you could be watching another movie.",Fight Club
1525,Kyser,So Far the best film of 1999,10,17 October 1999,"1999. Last year before the new century.  Lots of film.  Lots of good film, such as ""Eyes Wide Shut"", ""American Beauty"", ""Summer of Sam"", ""Election"", ""Run, Lola, Run"", etc.  But I think that the best of the year is ""The Fight Club"".Directed by a great director (Seven, The Game), the Fight Club is like ""Clock Work Orange"".  There's not a lot of people who's gonna like it.  But, for those who knows what a real film is (great story, really good development, excellent cast, nice music, etc.), the Fight Club is a film to see.I won't waste my time to tell you the story, but if you want a psychological drama, this is your film.  Personnaly, I don't like Brad Pitt, but  he is so great ... and Ed Norton too.There's not a lot of movies in my life that I gave the note of 10/10, but this is one of it.  Enjoy it !!!Before I forgot, if you have seen ""The Sixth Sense"" and you thought that it was a great film, this comment is not for you ...",Fight Club
1526,lfzi,The best movie of the year to date (October 1999),10,12 November 1999,"Just a few films (2001:A space odyssey or A Clockwork Orange, for instance), let each viewer make his own opinion about the film, and each opinion is completly different of each other. I saw this film twice, and I still ask: How many ideas are hidden in a movie that gets deeper on every viewing?. Have you think, for example, that most of people use to have the same criteria about self-realization (a career, good job, family, and enough money for the ""necessary"" material posessions), and that makes self-realization a hard thing to get? The movie could be asking you: Wouldn't be easier to get self-realization doing things that aren´t the conventional ""keys of success""? Things like... forming a ""fight club"", and become a leader for a group of men who are discovering their basic instinct. None ""normal person"" likes to be beaten, but it's easy to get beaten, don't you think? So, if my self-realization would depend of that, I would be very close to become a succesful man.It's unbelievable, but this is just one of a ton of thoughts that this movie generates on my mind. In my very personal opinion, this unforgettable film is one of the best movies ever made.",Fight Club
1527,emarone,Hot Damn!,10,13 January 2000,"I went into Fight Club already more or less aware of the plot and outcome, but that didn't stop me from getting sucked right into it, and by the time the climax rolled around, I'd forgotten everything I thought I knew beforehand.If you only saw some pretty graphic barefisted fighting, and didn't leave the theater with a new way to look at life, you need to sit down and watch it again.  What a marvelous study of the human psyche and statement about modern living!",Fight Club
1528,Rich1980,And the Oscar goes to.....,10,26 October 1999,"...the Green Mile...probably. Because of all the issues brought up by Fight Club, the movie of the year will not be voted movie of the year.  The acting was top notch, most notably, Edward Norton.  David Fincher has put together a movie that deserves more business than it's getting.  The ending was probably the most unpredictable event in cinema this year.  I wasn't that surprised since Arlington Road, >",Fight Club
1529,Rich1980,"It's not too late,......",10,30 November 1999,"so, go see it.  I saw Fight Club for the fourth time and the only people there were myself and my girlfriend, who had seen it once before, with me. Why was this movie neglected like it was.  It is everything you could want. I can't wait until May when it comes out on DVD, so I can watch it over and over again. If you find yourself at home with nothing to do, instead of masturbating, jump in your car and go see Fight Club.  Being John Malkovich also kicks ass.  These two should both be nominated for Oscars, or at least a friggin Golden Globe.",Fight Club
1530,DrStrangelove114,The only movie that has captured Generation X,9,30 April 2000,"FIGHT CLUB is the only movie that has really caught the essence of what Generation X is all about. Also it is an excellent film.Firstly, the production design of the film is excellent in every aspect, visually realizing the book in a way I thought could not be done. The thing that really stands out is the film's editing between the CGI and reality, to really get a sense of the narrator's confusion.Second, the script is top notch, with amazing dialogue and a wonderful narration that is somehow a mix between A CHRISTMAS STORY's and A CLOCKWORK ORANGE's.Third, the performances are great all around. Meat Loaf's Big Bob is a highlight, as is Edward Norton's narrator (Jack) who goes from materialistic yuppi to synic to philosipher to... you'll see. Helena Bonham Carter and Brad Pitt are also at their best here.Fourth, the film's understanding of Generation X, The Lost Generation, is so on target, because of the interaction between the narrator and Tyler, and the narration itself. It explains how our dads were of starting new families leaving us to have Nick at Nite as a father, how we are materialistic, and how we don't know ourselves because we don't let other people know us.FIGHT CLUB is the first film in a long time that has explained a generation so well like EASY RIDER.FIGHT CLUB was one of my favorite films the second I walked out of the theater, and will continue to be for a long time.",Fight Club
1531,JessicaLouise,Nothing Better,10,16 April 2001,"Although I am only seventeen years of age, I have seen more movies than almost everyone I know.  I try to watch one every day.  A while ago, I decided that I need to compile a Top 20 list.  After weeks of serious thought, Fight Club came out on top.  There is no other movie like it.  I get a severe case of hurt feelings whenever someone talks badly about this movie.  All the actors (yes, even Meatloaf) are outstanding.  The violence can be a bit much for some, but I'm rather desensitized anyway and it does not bother me.  If you have not yet seen this film, you are truly missing out on a quality work of art.  Yes, I said ""work of art.""  Corny?  Yes.  So what?  To me, that is what this movie is.  Everything weaves together perfectly, and each time I watch it I catch something new.  When my friend gave it to me for my birthday, I ditched everyone at my party and watched it immediately.  Yes, I admit to being obsessed.  It is simply that I have never seen such a wonderful, funderful movie.",Fight Club
1532,Erik Mæhlum,The first movie of the 21st century,10,15 March 2001,"Fight Club is what it's all about. To make a film that sends out a message that won't leave you alone if you are consumed by its brilliance. It's a fact that this movie is the first of the 21st century, meaning that it's a movie that gives you the truth.Why the hell does everybody complain about the violence. I bet if the movie was called Chess club, and still contain the same content, it would have been applauded. But I love every word that has anything to do with this movie. The way it's displayed, the way the twist is presented to us, makes this movie so incredibly genious! Brad Pitt plays an award winning role as the counter part of a time bomb insomniac, portrayed by Edward Norton.And they find a way to channel male aggression onto a form of therapy, in the form of underground boxing clubs. This is a great image of us men, 'cause we are violent by nature. And I know the film would've had more glowing critics if it had another name. But try to understand, this is how we men can be. I identified like hell in this movie. Why do people like you and me have to know what a duvet is? Is it REALLY essential to our survival? NO, what are we then?  ....That's right. It couldn't be said better.The most insane thing I've heard is that people call it fascist and dangerous. If there are people that actually get inspired by the fighting in this film, then Chuck Pahlaniuk has made a point, and I don't cheer about it. But if others get provoked by the idea behind Norton's character praying for a different life, than I respect you. Jesus, all of you who do not understand this, what is the problem? Are you happy living your life? Wouldn't you feel free if you had the ability to let that which does matter, truly slide? I know I would. In fact I think I will give up my condo life and stop polishing my scandinavian furnicure. I lived my entire life with IKEA. And I don't feel enlightened, I don't feel that my kitchen set defines me as a person.I won't spend more time tryin' to reform you who don't love this movie. I just want to stand in the line of those who understand this movie. Why don't we all try to stop controlling everything and just let go? Because we've tried everything except that, and I don't think we are that special, or unique snowflakes for that matter.Rating : A punchline for excellence. That's how good.",Fight Club
1533,Erik Mæhlum,To those of you that are blinded,10,8 April 2001,"I'm speaking to you who calls this movie thrash, and non meaningful. This especially goes out to Michael Lindberg and with his comment...You got it all wrong Mike.. Just read through your comment, and then my previous and Mega-Mike's comments. And then I hope you will understand.Fight Club is the main reason to cut your hair short or trim fingernails. Why not? This I ask you to look into...Are we really desired by God? Do we really have to know what a duvet is, in the hunter-gatherer sense of word? No.The so-called Academy Awards overlooked this film, and gave all its glory to American Beauty, which in my opinion is just as dark and satiric as Fight Club. And Brad Pitt's has his best perfomance, even better than 12 monkeys. Edwrd has his second best, beaten by American History X. ..by a nose.The awards Fight Club should've been NOMINATED to is : Best actor, Best supporting actor(Pitt should've won too), Best actress, Best direction, Best adapted screenplay,Best score.And a final answer to you who thinks Fight Club rivals or has adapted the idea for the final twist..You are wrong. I can just say that Fight Club came out first...so anyway you put it...Either way the end kicks ass. See the damn movie.Be clever. It will work out for you.",Fight Club
1534,Erik Mæhlum,My God...Has anyone seen ANY better??,10,7 March 2000,"My opinion in this movie is simple..JESUS! This is the the greatest, most intelligent, most convincing acting I've EVER seen. It's genious, man! It's brilliant. My great impression came first after the film, so I watched it again. From the ""rememberable"" line : ""People often ask me if I know Tyler Durden"". It's also a kick-back for David Fincher. I've always liked the guy, but who don't now? This movie is about a man who suffers from a divided personality. And this movie tells it so excellent. Vote 10 for this movie. Because this is the kind of title we want on the #1 place in the top 250. Just see the damn movie, it will make you go places you've never been!",Fight Club
1535,hazzah-2,"Interesting, very much so...",8,4 June 2000,"There is so much right and potential within this movie.  Edward Norton, wonderful in ""Primal Fear"" and ""American History X.""  Brad Pitt, awesome in ""Seven"" amongst other films.  And David Fincher, a modern day genius of film.The photography and overall theme, and tone of this story is nothing less than fascinating, and at the same time, intruiging.It's the words that are said by Edward Norton and Brad Pitt make you stop and think.  The violence this film exudes makes you wonder and shake your head.That said, there's one big flaw in this film, the pacing and that's why I gave it only an 8 out of 10",Fight Club
1536,judochop_,"Hated it first, but forced to watch again to pursue love affair with edward",10,3 August 2000,"Yes, i did hate this movie very much when i first watched it. i wanted to kill everyone. i hate movies with stupid masses!! but since i love mr. norton and all of his work (and i didn't want to be a hypocrite) i forced myself to watch it again, by myself just in case i got the urge. to my happiness, i grew to love the movie as i'm sure you will if you've never seen it or do if you have.",Fight Club
1537,hagai.gurevitz,what the f@#$% was that !!,10,26 December 1999,"what a rush. DAVID FINCHER has done it again. i haven't had that kind of feeling after a movie for a long time. FINCHER had successfully created the ultimate had rush for those who can handle the task. it is by far one of the most interesting, violent, weird, and disgusting movie i have ever seen. EDWARD NORTON and BRAD PITT are excellent as the founders of the fight club, a club that offer his members more then a saturday night recreation and begin for them an altornetive way of life, life on the brim of society where the normal behavior and standard no longer exist. BUT DONT kid yourself, the movie is a lot more then the fights themself, a whole set of event, some unbelievable some plane loony, lead to the unavoidable end, maybe the end of us all. GO AND SEE.",Fight Club
1538,Jonny Russell,"Genius, pure unadulterated genius.",10,22 September 2000,"Once again the public have chosen to ignore a great film,maybe it's me maybe I'm somekind of jinx because every (well there are exceptions) one of my favourate films is either panned by the critics, ignored by the public or both.Fight Club is a film which is good on so many level's I can't even begin to fathom how it won not ONE oscar when in all honesty it deserved every single one applicable.David Fincher is without a doubt one of the best directors in Hollywood today, every film he has made (bar Alien 3) has been a masterpiece. From the opening shot (following the camera from the interior of a human brain through to the gun barrel in Ed Norton's mouth) you know your going to be in for something special. The movie moves at such a pace I have to double check that it was two and a half hours long after my first (of many) viewings, but don't be put off by the run time this is a film you'll want/have to see over, and over, and over again.Ed Norton and Brad Pitt are the best they've ever been in their career's. Just when you thought Norton couldn't improve any more he just keeps getting better and better, Pitt on the other hand managed to prove that Meet Joe Black was just a blip on his track record by turning in a charismatic turn as the No Sh*t taking Tyler Durdin.This is one film you have to see but do not's pick it up if your expecting a non-stop action film, or you really will be dissapointed. Instead expect to see a highly intelligent, black comedy that will have you laughing more times than you'd expect, with some extremely violent scenes thrown in for good measure 5 out of 5",Fight Club
1539,chofflin,A serious contender for movie of the decade,10,27 January 2000,I wasn't a huge fan of David Fincher's 'Seven' but this effort is a truly clever piece of work that makes sense at various levels of comprehension. A nice blend of intellectual musings about what makes a man a man in a career and material oriented society and the emotion of desperately unhappy man trying to break out of this monotonous existence. A rare balance delivered at a good pace.,Fight Club
1540,rmic,One of the best films in the last two decades,10,9 April 2001,"Fight club is noted to be filled with senseless violence, however, having been in fights myself, there is nothing unrealistic about these brawls. The violence in this films makes half of the statement.Fight club is a movie that makes a very bold statement of modern times, society, commercialism, and how people no longer think for themselves. People who can not recognize this film for the genius of portraying our modern times are stuck in exactly what this film criticizesThe movie starts with the narrator(who remains nameless)speaking of how he is fed up with society.  He then encounters a character tyler durden who teaches him to start living and thinking for himself.  THe mvoie demostrates in very direct manners on how we as a society depend on the media and society to dictate what we think.  A way for these men, in this case, to break free from these barriers is to fight senselessly with each other for no reason, to tap the pre-commercialism man and bring it out upon the forefront of your character.As this goes on, the fight clubs get larger and larger, and the narrator starts to become self centered in the sense that the fight club evolves from something that benefits him, to something that no longer benefits himself, but all around him.  The film is soaked with irony  in that it demonstrates that there are leaders and followers, and it is a part of mankind, and that some people are inherently weaker willed and weaker minded then others, the weaker willed and weaker minded are the folks who will not get this film.",Fight Club
1541,rmic,Generally positive comments,10,15 February 2000,"This film, is basically, at least in my opinion, one of the greatest films ever, period.  I read the book afterwards, and equally enjoyed the book. The film is definitely for younger people, the critics of films, in general are older, so they cannot appreciate this film.  The film defines the younger generation, only younger people can relate to it, however, older people(middle aged+) can appreciate the art of the film, the beauty of the camera work, as well as the excellent acting.  The film, in every aspect is fantastic, it begins with a rather humorous narration, from a person we grow to know as, ""narrator"".  It goes about to show how he lives, and his way of life.  In these scenes alone, movie lines that will go down in history are said, and it's only the first twenty minutes.  The film tends to progress faster and faster as the film continues.  We delve into the narrators psyche, and find that he is not unlike most people in this world, he has a tendency to say to people what they want to hear, even if it is not the truth in it's entirety.  Almost all folks can relate to the main character, and he feels to be a real human, not a character in a story.  This, is partially due to the excellent directing, as well as book, but it is mostly due to the fantastic performance by Edward Norton. It, in my opinion is an Oscar performance.  Bradd Pitt gives his best performance to date, he is definitely an excellent coworker with David Fincher, they seem to share a common thread when it comes to film making I suppose.  I have full intention of purchasing this film when it is released on VHS and DVD.  Do yourself a favour, see this film, if that is not an option, at least read the book.  If you are younger and feel unrest with society, this is the film.",Fight Club
1542,satellite79,Promising philosophical flick that trips on its own pretension,5,1 April 2002,"The early stages of David Fincher's Fight Club make great promise to a movie that deserves more than what is unwound. Edward Norton and Brad Pitt both show their acting gumption, but it is lost on a convoluted message around halfway through and ultimately wasted during an ending that does no less than insult the viewer's intelligence. I've seen movies featuring giant bunny rabbits forecasting the end of the world that have more relevant things to say than what's presented here.Grade A for those that are able to have nonsensical plot threads, piled in a messy heap, served to them with a shovel. Watch the first half hour and turn it off.",Fight Club

1544,fallout-ag,An ingenious look into our psyches.,10,9 May 2000,"Bravo for Fight Club.  This movie, backed by an excellent novel, was the perfect glimpse into the psyche of all Americans.  I think everyone can relate to something about Edward Norton's character.  Many people may think this movie is about fighting and testosterone, but that is just an overlying plot element that rather cleverly disguises the true meaning of the film. Every person has things they wish they were, and everyone has a breaking point.  This film is about how the narrator manifests his.  I would recommend this film for anyone, especially the Brad Pitt or David Fincher fan.  These two make magic together.",Fight Club
1545,ProudestMonkE,Just Isn't Right,5,6 June 2000,"Something about this film just doesn't fit.  **MAY ALLUDE TO SPOILER**  It was a very nice story, and a nice try, but it just didn't fit.  I had figured out the secret about halfway through, but I still can't figure out how I got there.  It just doesn't piece together.Another problem with this film, is that the characters were so unbelievable, so disgusting, that I could not relate to a single one of them, therefore missing out on the very important Protagonist/Antagonist concept of filmmaking.  I also could not understand how the concept of men beating the life out of one another, then standing up shaking hands, then coming back the next day for more was even remotely believable.However, what I did like about this film was the filming and production itself.  I thought that the shots were outstanding, and the use of light vs. dark techniques were beautifully shot.  The overall production was the basis for my giving this film a 5.  Other than that, the story just doesn't cut it.",Fight Club

1550,nettojoh,Almost a great movie,8,17 August 2000,"This was one of the best movies I've seen all year, but it fell short of being as good as it could have been.  I thought the acting by the two important cast members was excellent; I was especially impressed with the development of Ed Norton's character.  The movie didn't try and be too deep and wasn't afraid to use humor to keep the story interesting.  The characters were somewhat comical, but lent to the story well without being one dimensional and silly.There were some flaws with this film though.  The movie tends to drag at times when they just reinforce an aspect of the movie to make sure you get it.  ""Tyler's anti-mainstream we get it, move on please""; "" ""okay. they fight move on please"".  There are about three long dead spaces like this in the movie.  Unfortunately, from the big twist in the story to the end is the worst of these dead times. The movie should have ended right after the twist.  The big finale seems irrelevant to the story and forced into the plot.  The end seemed like an add-on that was not well explained or had any importance.  I can imagine the writers sitting around saying we need to end big, but I don't know how.  Just blow something up.The reason I bring out the negative points is because the Hollywood laziness that plagues the film industry reduced this movie from being a classic to being a really good movie.  They had a good story, great acting, and a moment in history for which the message was relevant, but they cut the rope short filled the movie with some dead space and threw together an ending.In summary it was one of the best movies of the year, but fell short of what it could have been.",Fight Club
1551,movie-madness,This Is Your Life and It's Ending One Minute at a Time!!!,10,8 September 2000,"Fight Club is one of the most amazing Films of Modern Cinema, It has an original narrative, great acting and superb direction. Fight club is not for everyone and I would recommend viewers should be at least 16 to appreciate the level of depth this film has to offer as well as the violence being a bit to gracious for younger viewers. Many critics and audience members have complained about the level of violence in The film and how it can have an effect on viewers. However I believe that the this film has something to say and that is not carry out the messages in the film, it isn't saying start a Fight Club yourself and beat your friends to a pulp, it's simply a metaphor for young people to do something with their lives, don't just sit around becoming a couch potato and let yourself become another Jack.
This film works on so many levels, First off as a Black comedy, then as a Thriller mixed with action and strong conventions of a drama genre. The acting in this one is just incredible, Edward Norton has been robbed twice before at the Oscars and once again being Robbed by not even being Nominated. Brad Pitt has also again proved that he is a very talented actor (One of the most underrated actors around).In my opinion David Fincher is one of the best directors of all time and quite possibly the best around at the moment. I love the dark, harsh lighting he brings to his films, He uses a wide range of different techniques in the film, to help and confuse the audience. I love the CGI shots he uses through out the film.  This is one of those Films where the CG shots actually add to the film rather than just there to make it look visually good.Fight Club is very well scripted and although different form the book is just as good, Which is quite a compliment considering books are usually much better. There are some very good One liners as well as excellent scenes of dialogue.The Twist at the end of the film is very interesting and many people have complained that it takes something-away form the rest of the film however I feel that it adds to the twisted narrative. In my opinion this is the best film that I have ever seen for so many different reasons. This film actually has you thinking for a time after seeing it, which hardly any Hollywood productions do these days.This film definitely deserves a 10 out of 10, which I have only given to one other film before. Go out and see this one if you haven't already.",Fight Club
1552,ed-305,WOWEEEE!!!!,10,7 October 2000,"Fight Club is one of the most original films that I have ever seen, directed by David Fincher (directed Severn, Alien3 and The Game) it has been turned into a work of art. The film is based on Jack (Edward Norton), a car company representative who suffers from a bad case of insomnia. While on a plane (and the plane seen is one of the best scenes of the film) he meets Tylor Durden (Brad Pitt) when he returns home and finds that his apartment has been blown up he calls Tylor and asks if he can stay with him for a while. While standing at the back of a deserted car park Tylor asks Jack to hit him telling Jack he will never know what he is if he's never been in a fight. This is seen by some people, slowly the word spreads and fight club is formed. From this start Project Mayhem - a strike against the world - arises and Jack is no longer sure what Tylor is planning. I wont say anything else in case someone hasn't seen it yet but the ending is superb and I can not wait to watch it again. This is a great film and with so much action and quirks in it you will definately need to see it more than once to find all the small jokes Fincher has put in.",Fight Club

I also think, for a movie that's not really considered a comedy, it's one of the funniest too. Having read the book, I also feel it's one of the few movies out there that is actually better than it's written counterpart. This will be one of those movies that will be heavily referenced, quoted, and even copied in the comming years.

1558,torbenmunzel,I don't get it,8,3 May 2020,"I saw the movie like three days ago and it left me weird.
I have since read many reviews and essays on it online, but still don't get the ending (and I could not find much about its Interpretation).From what I've picked up on, the movie is mainly about critique on the destruction of individualism, manliness and the consumer-based society of todays world as well as the fact that fascism (The Fight Club) is just the other side of the same coin as kapitalism, not providing any helpful solution.
But that is like the first half of that movie.
After that the movie still starts with Project Mayham and that entire haluzination-thingy.
I don't see a real connection from that to the main topic of the first half.
I mean, the narrator does conclude that stuff by shooting himself and accepting Marla as his girlfriend, but why and how?
And doesn't that haluzination-thingy (Marla is probably surreal as well, just as the entire world, read the essays on jackdurden) make the entire thing kind of pointless and destroy the realism of the first half?
Is it just me or would it be a better movie if you just cut the second half and make the third act an exaggeration to tylers world-view and Fight-Club mentally nearly breaking the narrator and then (somewhat similar to that first boxing scene) realizing that this is not the way either. (ending, I don't know maybe even with a depressing ending of him realizing that there is no fulfillment for him, whatever)I mean the acting, camerawork etc. on this movie is great and it even left me wondering how real my life really was (quite an achievement); heck I really loved the first half, but I just don't get the point of that ending...P.S.: Please tell me if there is something I don't see here.",Fight Club
1559,thekeeperscages,Great Movie,10,6 January 2007,"This is a brilliant movie, it really goes deep inside the decay of society as Tyler Durden or the people of the U.S. sees it. Every word he says in his speech about we as middle age men or young adults, have no great war or no great depression, all of it is true, every word. We as people living in America right now, we have nothing to look forward to, maybe somebody's birth day or Christmas, but what do we really have. The government has us so tightly bound it is ridiculous, trying to control everything from wearing seat-belts and the video games we play to the control of other governments in other countries. This movie is almost a way to run your life with the whole ""its only after we've lost everything that we are free to do anything."" That is my opinion on this Great movie.",Fight Club

1561,colin_hunt,Worth Watching,10,6 February 2001,"Absolutely brilliant film. Before I borrowed the video, I thought it was  a film about fisty cuffs and head bashing as the title suggest.  However, Edward Nortons chillingly realistic portrayal of a 30's something white collar worker living and working in a modern city environment does bring home parallels to the frustrations most of us feel.  Critics often write of the irresponsible attitude and subversive nature of the film but I only feel it highlights the problems associated with modern lifestyles that most self-appointed morally responsible people would prefer to quietly brush under the carpet.",Fight Club

Be prepared for an awesome twist, and read the book based on it.",Fight Club
1563,mk-2222,One of the best movies ever made?,10,22 May 2008,"The first time I saw Fight Club, I didn't really take it in - I was tired and bored and not in the mood for a dark and depressing film like this. We turned it off halfway through, after about 90 minutes of not paying attention. What a mistake that was.I watched it again several months later when it was being shown on TV. Being only 13, I failed somewhat to absorb the deeper themes and concepts of the film but was highly, highly entertained by the Joe Everyman tale of a person so bored, unhappy and in the need of change in their life (it reminded me very, very much of American Beauty in this regard).Three years on, I watched it for the third time and it absolutely blew me away. Pretty much everything about it is perfect - plot, acting, direction, music - it all combined into a single perfect narrative package.Where do I start? The acting is out of this world. I can't claim to have seen many of Edward Norton's movies (in fact, only this and American History X), but his performance here was brilliant as the aforementioned Joe Everyman who also provides excellent, often deadpan narration that not only propels the story but is entertaining and even funny, a rare feat. As for Brad Pitt, until I saw Fight Club I had dismissed him as another pretty-boy, somewhat-talented actor more suited to romantic comedies than dark dramas. How wrong I was. His acting abilities are in full flight as the suave and confident antagonist of the story, Tyler Durden. Helena Bonham Carter is also great as usual, playing the leading lady (of sorts), Marla Singer.Or the story, based on the book by Chuck Palahniuk. While it essentially retains a simple three-act plot, it constantly twists and turns as to never let the viewer remove their eyes from the screen for even a second. This is NOT a movie about fighting. The overwhelming theme of the film is of anti-consumerism and challenging the values systems that have been put in place through advertising. The fighting itself serves as a way for the characters to escape from their repetitive, depressing, boring and most importantly sterile lives and experience feeling that the material objects deemed so important by their values system cannot give them.Director David Fincher produces one of the finest directorial efforts of recent times. The mise-en-scene he generates is terrific - harsh, sterile, postmodern - and there are several scenes that showcase his mastery of some unusual camera techniques. His directing here is strange in the best possible way. One particular short fantasy scene on a plane especially stands out.Fincher was concerned that traditional film music bands wouldn't be able to tie all the film's themes together, so he recruited the Dust Brothers, an electronica duo who had never recorded for a movie before. What a contribution they make. The score is postmodern, sterile, and artificial-sounding, perfectly in keeping with the ideas in the film. It also manages to create a mood without usually being noticeable, a difficult trick to pull off correctly.While loved and hated by equal numbers of critics, Fight Club is undeniably one of the greatest films for many years, probably the best of the 90's. Go and see it - you won't regret the experience, even if you don't think it's 'your kind' of film.",Fight Club

1570,silverlynx-79590,Overrated.,6,15 July 2020,"This was a decent film, but nowhere near the high praise it seems to get. The portrayal of Durden as an alter-ego was interesting, but fell short of being spectacular or the 8.8 it's currently sitting at.My biggest gripe with it was all the incredulity that stems from him being an alter-ego. It was already a stretch to think that dozens, then hundreds, then thousands of men would join a fight club because... lack of fulfillment. It's impossible to think that someone going through a psychological breakdown could orchestrate a mass bombing and underground terror ring with the support of hundreds of unwavering followers amidst apparently feeble police.And some of the direction later in the film was questionable. Like the scene in the car park showing Norton being thrown across the floor by Pitt, but CCTV showing him being flung by invisible forces, not just punching himself. I know this is trying to symbolise and not be taken literally, but it's a strange choice, as it leaves you questioning the physical implications of Durden being imaginary in other scenes.Besides that, the opening was really good, lots of great direction and it showed the monotony of modern office workers really well.

1573,krispatmo,Define the 90's,10,27 September 2002,"I would like to illustrate the meaning of Fight Club in my opinion together with another work of art from the last decade.Fight Club and OK Computer (Music Album) by Radiohead are THE masterpieces of the 90's.They completely define the society of that period(*). The shallowness of ""normal life"". Fight Club: ""I am Jack's complete lack of surprise"" Radiohead: ""No alarms and no surprises""The way that women have taken a different position in society which leaves men inconfident and unsure of the role they should or can fullfill.The lost generation with nothing to fight for, post-cold war. (*I deliberately wrote ""that period"" and not ""today"" for we all know that this decade has gotten a very different taste since about 1 year ago...)The consumer-society driven by the media telling everybody what to buy and how much.I could go on for ages with themes the movie covers, but won't because I don't have the time and you should probably figure them out for yourself.
If you can ofcourse that is, because I have read some terrible negative reviews here about this movie that really want to make me fight those who wrote them. I mean, sure the movie wasn't flawless, but how come it is that when people write negative reviews they never seem to have valid arguments.I've read things like:'It was boring''Action movie with an infantile, rubbish plot''Actual film has hardly anything to do with its title''Shallow characters''Bad acting''The ""twist"" is just plain stupid''A very average movie completely lacking in the ""meaning""'Arguments that are either pathetic and inconcievably dumb or just untrue. It makes me sad.If you lack the intelligence to understand a movie like this, just shut up. Don't watch this stuff, go rent The Gladiator or Pearl Harbor, those movies were made specially for you.Thank you.P.S. if you DID like the topic of this movie I would like to suggest watching A Clockwork Orange and American Psycho, which movies are absolutely not the same as Fight Club, but are somewhat related.",Fight Club
1574,heverett-10426,Gripping satire on capitalism and toxic masculinity,10,20 August 2020,"Fight Club was directed by David Fincher and stars Brad Pitt and Edward Norton. An insomniac office-worker and a soap-maker starts an underground fight club, which soon morphs into an anti-capitalist revolution. There is an un-ending controversy over the movies message, but there are many things that Fincher and his team do right. First, the cinematography, direction and production values are amazing. The film has a gritty, grubby feel, especially during the scenes in Tyler's house. There are lots of great shots in the movie including the reverse-tracking shot inside a trash can and the sex scene shot with bullet-time. The editing is also superb, perfectly depicting the monotony of the narrator's life. The acting is also superb. Norton, Pitt and Helena Bonham Carter all give career-best performances. This movie also has one of the best twists of all time, though some think that it's unecessary. Fincher leaves subtle clues throughout the movie.Finally, I can get to the message. Everyone seems to agree that the movie has an anti-capitalist message. The first third of the movie shows that the need for efficiency in a capitalist society leads to a highly optimized and monotonous style of living. The narrator fills his life with expensive products, but has no real emotional connections. This leads to the second major theme in the movie, masculinity. The narrator, like many others who join fight club, feel that their masculinity is being eroded by their repetitious consumer lifestyles. According to them, the only way to regain their lost masculinity is to beat the pulp out of each other. This form of hyper-masculinity is taken to the next level, when members of fight club start to organize terror attacks on capitalist symbols. Their anti-capitalist rhetoric becomes anarchism and fight club is transformed into a cult. Members are known only by their numbers and blindly follow orders. They soon become the very thing they were rebelling against; drones who live monotonous lives. This is just my interpretation. Many critics believe that the movie is advocating toxic masculinity and anarchism, instead of critiquing it.",Fight Club
1575,ictrw,Greatest Film Ever Made,10,18 September 2020,"It had me at, ""When there's a gun in your mouth, you can only talk in vowels."" When I discuss this to those who've never seen it, I don't know where to start, and when I talk to those that have and they say ""it was okay"" or ""I didn't get it"" they make me want to grab them like the narrator wanted to grab Marla. Simply put, it's flawless. From the way it's adapted through the writing, to the way it's shot, Fincher's choice of music, editing, and of course performances. It's pacing should be studied in every film school and it's style is simply organic and original. The character development is uncanny and it's subliminal yet outward messages of a primal world is like heroin for the soul searching self-help enthusiast. I can go on and on, I actually love that this film is so often overlooked and has since been deemed a contributor to ""toxic masculinity"" because it removes the wannabes and hypebeasts. It's unapologetically truthful and raw, and that's what hits you to the core if you're a true lover of this film (if you can't tell this is my favorite film of all time already).

What there is of a plot is all over the place, the lines are beyond cringe-worthy, it's way too preachy, and the 'plot twist' at the end manages to veer off way past the range of strange into the range of bat**** crazy.The secret longing of men is to beat each other up in basements and blow up buildings? Who knew? Much like the fights, there's no subtlety in the plots. Yeah, yeah, materialism is bad, we're not what we own, blah blah blah. Did we really need that pounded into our skulls for almost 2 hours? If you feel like you're in a rat race and you hate your job, THEN QUIT AND FIND SOMETHING TO DO THAT'S MORE WORTHWHILE TO YOU.I could hardly believe that was Brad Pitt. His performances in 12 Monkeys and Se7en were far superior to this trashy flick.Is Fincher incapable of making a movie that doesn't look like the lenses have been sprayed with Campbell's beef broth?

1590,preslopsky,You too may be a candidate for project chaos,1,4 January 2002,"Let me just get this out of the way right off the bat -- I hated this movie. I think the initial meeting of Jack and Tyler explain how opinions of this movie are divided -- Jack says something about single serving friends, and Tyler disinterestedly dismisses his cleverness.  Unfortunately, my friends, being clever for clever's sake is not entertaining and it is not art.
For those of you who loved this movie, perhaps identifying yourselves with the main character is not appropriate.  The point may be that you are just one of the moronic automatons (do hyper-clever acts of terrorism, like a hyper-clever movie), so the joke's on you.  You might also note that the project chaos morons are not recruited for their propensity for violence, but for their desire to think in complex and sensitive ways.  Much like the fans of this movie.I tend to rate a movie on only two criteria:  Was it entertaining? and, Did I care about the characters?  As both of these answers for Fight Club are definitely ""NO"", what am I left with?  A movie with an unoriginal message, revealed in an unintellible way, full of commercials (Starbucks, Busch beer, Pepsi, to name a few), with decent acting.Yes, the pseudo-intellegentsia are all suckers, easy prey to a little pretentiousness they identify with.

After landing and exchanging words Tyler leaves a card behind describing his job, leaving his phone number for soap information, and address. It was a work card, Tyler Durden makes and sales soap for a living.Later on, after a complete disaster back at the condo, it is found destroyed from a horrible explosion. Nothing is left, and our friend has no one to call... Except a single serving friend named Tyler Durden.This movie goes through a friendship between the two, a madness that must be unleashed within' one, a girl that goes in between a bond, and most importantly... A club Tyler Durden creates, that club is called Fight Club, and Fight Club creates the Gods unwanted Children. Project Mayhem. In other words, complete chaos.This film is full of masterpiece quotes and cleaver ideas. It is a must see and is my second favorite movie. I suggest this movie for anyone, because it is one of the best movies ever made and includes so many things that are going to be remembered. Fight Club isn't just a movie, Fight Club is an inspiration. This movie will not be forgot.Remember, ""Its only after we have lost everything that we are free to do anything.""",Fight Club
1594,s-dubarev,"Worth watching, not sure about revisiting",6,17 February 2019,"I've just finished watching this film for the first time -- almost 20 years after its release, without prior reading of neither any reviews, nor the original book.Cinematography-wise, it's really good. Plot-wise, well... that depends on what you expect. Noticing ""a cult classic"" coming from a big Hollywood studio made me feel suspicious. Half into the film, I felt it was going a bit too far with craziness. Closer to climax, I felt fooled and robbed. An hour later, it all started to fall into place. :-)Upon watching, I've read some of the reviews here, both positive and negative. They gave some food for thought. Some people liked 1/3, 1/2, or 2/3 of the film. Some considered it a work of a genius. Others called it dumb and unrealistic.My opinion is that of course it is not a real-life story that is portrayed. It's more of a pitiful, somewhat infantile fantasy running through the head of, or just a dream of, an average person who is injured, tired, exhausted. And when viewers are engaged into the story, the film suddenly says: ""I have just sold you a ***cheap furniture brand name here*** of philosophy, you miserable average nobodies. Look -- it's you in all of the scenes!"" A bold statement to make in a mainstream product, I would say! :-DMore on plot holes and lack of realism --
Speaking of dreams and nightmares, there is usually not much logic/consistency in those. They just symbolically reflect daily life. On the brink of waking up, people try to force events in dreams sometimes for a satisfying outcome, and fall flat at that. The latter easily explains film's finale, for example.Conclusion: It's worth watching for all the good bits that it has. Not sure if it's worth revisiting once you feel you understand what it is all about.",Fight Club

The title of the movie led me to believe that it was going to be another ""Rocky"" flick with a ring and two guys fighting it out. (Or that I never really paid attention to the trailers... heh)But after I saw this movie, I was left in awe. It was powerful and moving. I don't think I have thought this much about a movie 5 hours after I've seen it before.If you haven't seen it, go pick it up cause it's worth 2 hours of your time and 5 bucks outta your wallet. =)",Fight Club

No joke, this movie completely changed my way of thinking for the better. Tyler Durdens' (Brad Pitt) philosophy that pretty much amounts to ""live fast and die young"" makes for a seriously interesting character. Brad Pitt's acting is such that you can actually imagine him AS Tyler Durden. Perfect casting. The same can be said for Edward Norton, who plays a role that's in stark contrast to his character in ""American History X"" also delivers a fantastic performance, something I've come to expect from him. Not only is this movie well acted but it's a story that really does make you question your philosophy on life up to this point. Watch this movie, end of story.",Fight Club
1599,bmiah89,Best Movie Ever Made!!!!!,10,8 July 2008,"If you have ever watched a movie and after the ending just wanted to watch it over and over again then this is the film. This film is simply perfection from beginning to end it's absolutely interesting, with an outstanding star cast, Edward Norton and Brad Pitt at there best! the chemistry between the two was brilliant, how different they are from each other however how they are exactly like each other... This is a MANs Film and is extremely enjoyable, it's what we go through everyday life; our jobs we hate, miserable life, isolation, the objects we own end up owning us etc. Tyler just finds a way to come across it and that is called ""Fight Club""!!!",Fight Club

I really liked the message in the movie, the performance of Edward Norton and Brad Pitt and you've just got to love 'em quotes. The one that got me thinking was; ""It's only after we've lost everything that we're free to do anything."" The movie is a bit harsh, but with an quite understanding and strong message. I saw this movie a couple of years ago and before that i though, yeah, it's a raw movie with men fighting. BUT, this movie was so much more than that! This truly is a masterpiece and i think it's the best movie made so far. I've studied philosophy and though this had the same message as the absurdism gives you. That the meaning of life doesn't exists. And of course the messages from the quotes, we're people who are addicted to material goods. And after we loose everything, we are free to do anything. We are no longer hooked on these goods and are free to do anything. The character that Edward Norton plays, changes a lot during the movie. He starts as an man who works in an dead end office job, is hooked on material goods (from IKEA) and suffers from insomnia. After he meets Tyler Durden (Brad Pitt) his life changes. But after i saw the ending, i couldn't believe what i've just witnessed. A perfect movie, with an great ending. The ending changes the whole movie, just in minutes.Just like this quote; ""The first soap was made from the ashes of heroes, like the first monkey shot into space. Without pain, without sacrifice, we would have nothing."" So, right and in an way that people really take it serious and starts thinking. So to all them ""treehuggers"", this is an loud message. It's just one of the movies that you think after you've seen it, yeah it was nice. And the next morning you think, that was really nice. It just gets better from day to day. This movie actually got me interested in philosophy.10/10 of course. Never seen a better movie, WATCH IT.",Fight Club

Ed Norton hasn't made a bad movie that I can think of, and Brad Pitt is equally phenominal.  Just the whole idea of an underground club like the Stonecutters of Simpsons lore I thought was cool. I also (SPOILER!) thought the two people as one was potentially a fantastic plot twist.(SPOILER pt 2).  The end, though, left a lot to be desired.  The first four fifths of the movie had my disbelief suspended very well, but then the shooting-myself-(in the head, no less)-to-kill-my-alter-ego bit was rediculous.  The whole movie fell apart at that moment.See it, though, because its greatness heavily outweighs its poor ending structure.",Fight Club
1603,iwantu2hitme,a different perspective on the film,10,25 February 2004,"I am admiddedly a fan of the film fight club, more so than many people, but not because of the cult status the film so abruptly gained, but because of the deep Nietzchian as well as Marxist philosophies that go into it, as well as the historical contexts the film takes into account.  Not many fans of the film I doubt are aware of this, but the film's story is some what unoriginal, this does not detract from the clever dialogue and directing, but to state the film as being completely original is an emission of ignorance.  Nietzche said in the very late 1800s and early 1900s that this new middle class was going to get bored with prosperity.  That this boredom would eventually lead to a backlash against this new found consumerist society. Something very much like this occurred in the beginning of World War one.  Many young soldiers graduated highschool and put off college to go have a gun fight with the english, they were all slaughtered because of their inexperience contrasting with the highly trained english commandos. They wanted to ""Do Something Great With Their Lives"".  The generations before them participated in the franco-prussian wars and succeeded. This generation did not have a great war, this generation did not have a great depression.  Do you see where I am going here?  In the book, at the end of Fight Club, the narrator goes into a mental institution, this is what happened to Nietzche as well towards the tail end of his life, I have no doubt this was a coincidence. Now for the Marxism.  A good way to compare the story is to Animal farm, or the Russian Revolution, Tyler Durden takes the role of the Stalin Figure, the one who is more hands on and a bit more violent as well as deceptive.  The narrator takes the role of a Lenin character.  Towards the end of Tyler and the narrator's partnership, as with Stalin and Lenin, stalin starts to push Lenin out of the picture.  The two like in history also staged to take over Capitolism and create a new Eutopian society free of consumerism and greed.  Of course as with history the antagonist's personal ambitions overwhelmed the goals that were originally set forth.Back to the Nietzche for a minute, as for now that i have related to two plot themes there is a bunch more of Nietzche that is in this story. Nietzche was very sexist, not implying that the film is, because it is not, but Nietzche spoke heavily of men being emasculated by women as well as the ""super man"" which dealt with the concept of the ideal or the perfect man. What was it, and why did men try to achieve it.  Fight club is very much this, this theme overlaps with the idea of the consumerism but it is important to single it out as well, being it why they are doing what they do in the first place. This has no relevance to the philosophies but alot of people seemed confused on the ending of the film.  I read in several articles that David Fincher decided to make a silly Hollywood ending purposefully to be satirical.  In that sense it bears alot of irony being that this is a big budget hollywood film.  The ending of the novel would probably never be appropriate to be viewed on the film screen, although it is far more dark and sinister and would be amazing to see on the screen.  All i can say is don't take the ending literally, it's a joke, you go to the movies, you see a movie, pretty much any film, and it ends on the upside, this was a film about the downside, and how it keeps getting worse, and how things don't always work out, by ending it like that, on the upside, surviving a gunblast to the face, Fincher is mocking the typical hollywood ending.  Why else would they look out happily at the buildings falling and society being plunged into another stoneage? I hope i have offered a different view on this film, and those who are into this film very much should get out some work by Nietzche and Marx because they might really enjoy it, otherwise, have a good day.",Fight Club
1604,granitor,Repeat Often For Maximum Benefit,10,26 September 2008,"Without spoiling it for those who haven't yet seen it, Fight Club gets better every time I re-watch it. There is so much attention to subtle (and even subliminal) messages that I discover something new, or appreciate some minor nuance, every time I re-watch it.Based on a novel of the same name (which I haven't read yet), some top talent and a big budget helped to make a movie which manages to involve you in the specific characters, whilst at the same time being generic, general, and abstract enough to be an obvious satire on ""modern"" life. Unlike most movies, with a sappy fairytale romantic subplot, the sexual relations in this movie are somewhat broken, since they involve people who are very broken... but it works and adds realism. Well, I don't want to spoil anything so I won't say anything more. Other people have already reviewed it in detail, so I will just say that it is worth owning...

This film will start manipulate your own psychology. YOU will start getting similarities between YOUR psychology and the psychology of the characters in the movie. And in the end of the movie you will suddenly realize that this movie was for YOU. This movie is not like any other movies. This movie conveys something. It manipulates you. When you end this movie you will start to think what did I saw? How could the director show such hard facts and feelings of our life? Then you will start to see it again and again.

1606,JoeP123,"My favourite film ever, never to be topped",10,16 August 2009,"When i watched this film i nearly collapsed. It's the greatest film EVER. It's violent, brutal, funny, silly, dark and disturbing, all in one little package. Though it's long and sometimes films can lose it in there length it carried on being all it's cracked up to be until the ending. Story= A man with a sleeping disorder goes to clubs about disability's, (cancer etc.) though he didn't have any of them, to help him have a good nights sleep. But when his condo is blown up he goes to live with a man he met on a plane, a man he'd only met once. Outside a bar he punches the man on his will and they start brawling. Afterwards they like fighting (and it helps his sleep) so they carry on to set up ""Fight Club"", unknowing of what it'd lead to. 10/10 Acting= The acting is brilliant. Enough said. 10/10 Humour= Funny bits include lines, actions, looks, everything. A lot of the film makes you laugh without being a comedy, brilliant. 10/10Overall a film that is perfect and truly the greatest film ever made.",Fight Club
1607,onelyfunitd,"Bizarrely,absurdly and insanely Brilliant.",10,4 October 2010,"I believe the movie-watching community is divided into three parts;the ones who love ""Fight Club"",the ones who hate it and the unfortunate ones who are yet to experience it.To maintain a neutral stance is quite impossible.Once the credits roll, you may be in awe of this logic-defying piece of celluloid or you may detest the seemingly needless depiction of blood,gore and violence.I belong to the former category and hence,what follows is more of a eulogy than review.So, if you have not seen it I,suggest you first give it a watch and then come back.This movie does not live on the edge;it goes beyond.It does not border on the bizarre.It quite literally ventures head-on into the bizarre and refuses to return.Simply put,this movie is the rock star of its generation.The plot revolves about an insomniac (Edward Norton) who is a by-product of the lifestyle obsession.His life is clichéd,branded and superficial;one where the ""Starbucks"" and ""Microsofts"" compensate for the complete void of emotion.He gets addicted to support groups for various ailments,pouring out his heart to complete strangers.Among these groups of terminally-ill people he finds solace making him realize he needs an outlet.In Tyler Durden (Brad Pitt) our protagonist finds his outlet and we find one of the all-time great movie characters.And they team up to create the Fight Club.It is in the fights here that they feel life;a far cry from the desensitized worlds they dwell in.To reveal anything beyond this point would be criminal.But to throw light upon the masterful adaptation from Chuck Palahniuk's book is a necessity.David Fincher's execution oozes style in every frame.Each scene brings out his innovation and is a sheer delight from start to finish.The casting is exemplary as Edward Norton as well as Helena Bonham Carter (having quite an integral role) play their parts to precise perfection.But Pitt's Tyler Durden is the zenith of Fight Club.His every word and mannerism is cult.So Hats off to Brad Pitt.As bad as his ""Achilles"" in ""Troy"" may be, his Tyler is,by now, immortal.Beyond that, tight screenplay,impactful dialogs,effective light and sound,a wacky score and stellar direction catapult it into a timeless classic.The essence of ""Fight Club"" lies in its sadomasochistic theme.It shows us the beauty of anarchy and the symmetry of insanity.It asks us to let go,to reject consumerism and to pull ourselves out from the deluge of brand-consciousness,without ever sounding preachy.It asks us to be alive.Blood-splattered fights may not be the most subtle way of telling us but ""How much can you know about yourself if you haven't been in a fight?"" is the Tyler-istic way of saying it.I am Jack's mesmerized head bowed in admiration.",Fight Club

1609,sz_chica11,totally righteous dude,9,11 March 2010,"Norton is one of my favorite actors. A brilliantly twisted thriller that makes your mind go in circles. It has psychological elements that make you go...huh? at first. So this is the type of movie you would have to watch several times in order to completely comprehend Edward Norton's character...and the reason behind Tyler Durden, his ""alter ego"" who comes to life if you will. The whole time Norton is mutilating himself, instead of Brad Pitt because Pitt(Tyler) is actually Norton. See...that's the part where you get confused about at first, but then you begin to understand is the film goes on. Just watch it a couple times, and you'll understand the plot. It's not just about guys beating the crap out of each other, there's so much more to it. It's a movie that leaves you on the edge of your seat. A must watch!",Fight Club
1610,rennix,Not bad for a Studio System Film,8,12 February 2004,"When this came out I didn't want to see it. TV and radio stations were flooded with Fight Club ads and Fox initially tried to sell the movie as one of these ""I'll beat the cr*p out of you"" movies. I guess this drew the wrong audience into the theaters and most people were disappointed because they didn't get to see blood and guts and superheroes. So I was very surprised when I got hold of the DVD and watched it for the first time (and then a second time, and a third time and on and on...)Although the philosophy behind it isn't as deep and profound as other reviewers at imdb have claimed it to be, it is still a very fascinating and strange movie - unlike anything you would expect from a Hollywood major studio.Fincher created a dark and visually stunning movie with a terrific cast and...well..some plotholes.But nevertheless. This is a ""must see"". Eventually this will be considered the classic 90's movie.Not to forget the great Pixies Song ""Where is my mind"" at the end.",Fight Club
1611,bdlambert,One of the best films ever -- It will have you thinking long after the end credits,10,25 June 2003,"Every time I watch ""Fight Club"" I notice something new and exciting about it.  Few films can do this, so to me this is a remarkable feat.I truly believe this film is a generational thing.  Pretty much anyone over 40 will not like this film (my Dad just didn't know what to think when he saw this one).  Those who have grown up in this era can only appreciate it the best (right now, I'm 20 years old).There are numerous things about this movie that grab me.  The ideas that's presented about a soulless world overwhelmed by mass consumption really hits it home with me.  What's interesting is that Tyler Durden has a nonconformist stance on modern society yet at the same time, he's indoctrinating everyone about this.  In effect, he's making everyone conform to his own vision of non-conformity.This movie came out in 1999 a year where the ""twist ending"" was en vogue (""Sixth Sense"" previously did it) and I never saw this twist coming.  I won't reveal it here (go see the movie if you want to find out) but it amazed me.  This has you watching the movie over and over to pick up on the clues.Everything about this movie was flawless.  It speaks to me on so many different levels (some I may have yet to discover).  Go check it out for yourself.

1612,rdrajatdixit,Different and unique!!!,9,1 August 2012,"David Fincher's Fight Club is one of the coolest films I have seen. It is fast-paced, well directed, well written and well acted. The pace of the movie is excellent. The average movie-goer may not understand it.What people don't see is the themes this film deals with. It deals with insomnia and the insanity of the protagonist. It is anti- society, anti- consumerism, anti- corporate companies and anti- today's lifestyle. I think The Narrator suffers from insomnia because he has to work a lot, something which is quite common these days. He is fed up of his lifestyle. He finds peace by visiting cancer groups. I think he is a bit like Travis Bickle: lonely, insomniac and insane. And just like Bickle, he becomes violent. I think it should be seen as a satiric thriller. That way it will be appreciated and understood better. Brad Pitt is excellent as Tyler Durden. I think his biggest strength is his ability to bring any character to life. He has done that in many of his films. Edward Norton also did very well and so did Helena Bonham Carter. The editing us top notch. The writing is excellent. Watch it. Strongly recommended.

Testosterone testosterone everywhere yet not a man in sight. Fight Club is an eloquent commentary on man's pathetic decline. Superbly written, it screams in your face, and makes you sit up and take notice. Yet... it offers nothing more than wet dreams and the fantasies of what it means to be a man. Long dead is the Duke. Long dead is the strong, capable man. In the end, Fight Club is nothing more than a flimsy gossamer veil that's meant to hide the ugliness of the collective male ego - so easily bruised - so easily controlled. It has become a phenomenon - a pseudo identity that weak men cling to in the hopes of seeing something more in the mirror - but it's a lie.

Although a while later I gave it chance to watch and once I did it I got really nailed-up! How wonderfully this was shot! How similar the main actor is to me!The most important issue should be pointed out is how realistically Edward Norton acted in a tired-of-life guy's role and how mischievous Brad Pitt was in there. As much in all movies I have seen from Brad Pitt as I can think of as a person who's been able to live up the role assigned to him like Se7en, O11. His self-ego must be having a quality giving a chance to any kind of role in Cinema.I too much highly recommend it for all generation because it won't ever be forgotten. (10 +++ / 10)",Fight Club
1616,FilmFanatic14,The best film ever made!,10,6 December 2003,"Where to begin? I loved Fight Club, along with many other people, and I would recommend it to anyone who has an 'open mind' and does not get offended easily. Fight Club had a dark feel, with very black comedy and a touch of mystery.Fight Club is about one man's journey through a weird part of his life. He (Edward Norton) has a good job working for a car company, he has nice IKEA furniture in his nice little condo. He was almost a complete man. Until, his condo explodes while he is away and he looses everything he owned. So, he rings Tyler (Brad Pitt), an acquaintance he made on a plane on one of his business trips. He goes and has a few beers with Tyler. After they finish they come out of the pub and Tyler asks him to hit him as hard as he can. After some hesitance he does, Tyler hits him back and they fight the night away. They get a buzz from fighting and that's how Fight Club starts. I won't give anything away but the story twists and turns ways you could never imagine.What made Fight Club so great was a combination of many different people doing a great job.  The novel buy Chuck Palahniuk was brilliant and I personally thought that it could never be brought to the screen and be as good as the book. But, Fight Club exceeded its limits and went a step further with a great screenplay by Jim Uhls, without the great screenplay the film would have flopped. Then there is the extraordinary acting all around, it was undoubtedly Edward Norton's, Helena Bonham Carter's and Brad Pitt's best performance ever and other small roles were played well too, such as Meat Loaf, playing Bob. And of coarse, last but not least, David Fincher. David exceeded all expectations making Fight Club. The film was given the prefect feeling thanks to David's precise direction, if you listen to the commentary and see all the extra features on the DVD you will be sure to know how much effort David put into Fight Club to give it the perfect feel, just like the book.Overall, Fight Club gives us some very strong messages, but I thing the very essence of the film is to take what you want from it. This is a must see for everyone, because in my opinion this is the best film ever made and you will most probably enjoy it. If you don't like it, watch it a second time, it will likely change you opinion. A definite: 10/10",Fight Club
1617,vasington1993,High hopes,7,1 January 2021,My expectations were probably too high since the movie was interesting mainly thanks to the Jekyll and Hide character of the main hero. Otherwise the plot was pretty simple and I think there are much better movies of the similar style,Fight Club

Brad Pitt was a frictional character in his brain.we see Norton's character fighting with himself initially and people starts joining him.My guess is is someone is seen fighting with himself people will rather take him to a mental hospital.apart from that it's one of the best movies ever made,carefully made movie too loosen up your screws. one of the all time best but not a ""MASTERPIECE"".3rd rule of fight club is. 1.)

1619,rahul-atri,This movie is 'Life Changining'.,10,30 December 2011,"I can't begin to explain how misguided some people are regarding the overall theme of this movie. They have completely missed the entire message of the movie. It is not a 'fighting' movie solely, and it is not meant to encourage fighting or represent 'real' fighting, in the real world. It is a film, it is not 100% accurate or representative of real life, and if you have the mindset of 'this is a fighting movie, a bloke movie', or any other shallow view, you will certainly be sorely disappointed.It exists as more of a reflection of society today – our preoccupation with materialistic goods, with celebrities who have done nothing to deserve our attention or respect, and the fact that we follow society's whims and do the same thing everyday, go to work, sleep, go to work again. And for what purpose? The movie challenges all these things but in a way that isn't in your face and blatant. You need to think about the movie, dwell on it, and perhaps take away something from the viewing, a philosophy or way of looking at life that you didn't have before.But in the end, one of the sad things is that most of the people who watch the movie (including me, despite my best efforts to the contrary) are the very 'society' it questions. Those who watch the movie, discard it as not being an accurate or realistic depiction of 'fight clubs', and go back to their jobs with not a thought as to why. That, I think, is what I find so compelling about the film – that it presents you with these views and ways of looking at the world, and then the viewers turn around and ignore it, returning to their everyday life.You need to look at this movie as more of an essay on life and society and its values in this current age. When looked at as simply another 'movie', or only about 'fighting', much can be overlooked. I urge you to watch it again, with an open mind; consider what it is saying and look within yourself to see whether you fall into the demographic it is talking about.But then, it may be said; aren't we all a part of society? Don't we all follow its rules and regulations, even as we seek to go against it? The answers may seem clear, but are open to question. Not every person on earth is. But most of the people who will end up watching the film are, those who work jobs and have not a clue why they do so. To earn money? Support a family? The reasons differ. The truth is, we do not need these luxuries and rituals that we have so easily become accustomed to in this digital age.This movie isn't a manual on how to live our lives. Rather, it raises questions about how we live and demands answers.And the sad thing is, most of what it brings up about society is absolutely right.",Fight Club
1620,TheWrench,Nothing more than greatness,10,17 April 2004,"I actually read the book Fight Club before I saw the movie. I actually read it at a book store when it had recently been released. So by the time the movie had come out I forgot I read it. This movie is so great that it is even better than the book. It works for so many kinds of people also: smart people, dumb people, and dumb people who want other people to think they're smart. Fight Club is most definitely a guy movie. It deals with acceptance, and male bonding, and testosterone, and loneliness. It follows an unnamed character (Edward Norton) through some big changes in his life. In the movie they never say his name, and in the book he didn't have a name. So for those of you who call him ""Jack"" you are wrong. He becomes friends with an outrageous Tyler Durdan (Brad Pitt). I don't want to say too much about it for people who may have not seen it. But it's smart, and entertaining, and definitely leaves plenty of room for conversations once the movie is over. It's a must see for any movie lover, even the ones who are idiots and don't like narrative voice overs. This is one of the few movies I actually saw in the theater 4 times.",Fight Club
1621,defaultblues,An indisputable masterpiece,10,28 March 2015,"Fight Club is a psychological thriller that will leave you tense and on the edge of your seat, as well as a black comedy that will leave anyone with a darker sense of humor doubled over. Finchers adaptation of Palahniuks novel is a great one, following the story of 'Jack' (Norton); an emasculated insomniac who finds solace in bare knuckled fighting as well as his new friend Tyler (Pitt) who has a lot more planned for the underground fight clubs. This film breaks down walls and pushes the boundaries of cinema, with terrific cinematography and amazing performances from the cast.A must-see, and then a must-see- again, and again..",Fight Club

And if you are in the mood to scream a big, fat ""F**k You"" to the world, then this is the film for you.Fight Club's nameless protagonist (Edward Norton) begins unravelling as he endures a destructive bout of insomnia. After following his doctor's advice, he becomes addicted to therapy groups and meets Marla Singer (Helena Bonham Carter). After this short-lived encounter with the only female in the movie, our narrator meets Tyler Durden (Brad Pitt) on a business flight. Their camaraderie eventually sees them starting a fight club built on the philosophy of anarchy and rejection of societal status quo. But is anarchy really the answer? How far do you take it?﻿﻿ If you have ever felt like a consumerist machine then I urge you to try this for kicks. The novel by Chuck Palaniuk is also a must read (but should be judged separately from the film as they differ in many aspects).Stand outs: Meatloaf as ""B**ch-tits Bob"": has to be seen to be believed.",Fight Club
1623,elkhadem,"Mystery, Action & Drama in one unique mix.",10,1 August 2004,"Fight Club is definitely one of the best movies of all time. The story is so good and the on-screen outcome is executed dynamically that you feel you are actually inside the movie seeing things for yourself. The basic idea behind the film is that one is only a loser because he/she doesn't tap into their abilities and take some positive steps in their life.The 3 main characters are so colorful and well-performed so that you believe them completely. What makes the movie unique is the amount of energy you see on-screen and the shocking events that keep the movie's pace very entertaining and interesting.This film has inspired so many people, I hear some crazy people started Fight Clubs after they watched it.",Fight Club

It is hard to talk restrained about the ""Fight Club"", even more as being just another movie, because it is anything but just another movie. If you like watching movies in which you don't know the truth until the very end, if you like symbolism and ambiguity, bizarre twists and strange characters, then you'll be delighted! The movie, in my own opinion, speaks about the absurdity of our modern world, the alienation of modern man - but, also, I am sure that everyone can come up with its own interpretation! Where is the line between madness and sanity? Do we all have our ""alter ego""? On what are people capable of doing in order to fill the void they feel in life? These all are the questions which David Fincher imposes in this rather dark and unusual movie. Brad Pitt and Edward Norton are excellent, but if you can stand neither blood nor physical aggression - I do not recommend it!",Fight Club

His doctor refuses to write a prescription for his insomnia and instead suggests that he visit a support group for testicular cancer victims in order to appreciate real suffering. By attending the group, the narrator feels distraught at the condition of these ill fated people and breaks down. He is then able to sleep soundly and subsequently fakes more illnesses so he can attend other support groups in order to get out his pent up emotions through crying. The narrator's routine is disrupted when he begins to notice another impostor, Marla Singer (Helena Bonham Carter), at the same meetings and his insomnia returns.During a flight for a business trip, the narrator meets Tyler Durden (Brad Pitt), who is a soap salesman. The narrator arrives home to find his apartment has been destroyed by an explosion. He calls Tyler and meets him at a bar. Tyler agrees to let the narrator stay at his home on the condition that the narrator hits him. The narrator complies and the two end up enjoying a fist fight outside the bar.

Nothing good, just release.ii) The movie doesn't give you a good break once in a while - it's dark throughout, and portrays men as either inherently violent leaders, or inherently violent soldiers. The protagonist is a very limited personality, only one in a hundred thousand could identify even by half. An over-inflated ego that finds his alter ego as a ""charming, highly sexual gangster"".

1630,jakenathanasher,Best David Fincher Movie,10,5 May 2014,"I only just recently saw this movie, but I was shocked to see how incredibly crafted this was. Not only was it written to perfection, but it actually follows Chuck Pahluniak's novel fairly well. It was dark and intense and at moments, kind of funny. I think it's safe to say that David Fincher is the best thriller director of the nineties, and in some cases, the best of the 20th Century. To be honest, I'm not the biggest fan Brad Pitt, but I immediately changed my impression of him after seeing this movie. He was perfectly coasted as Tyler Durden, and I honestly couldn't see anyone else excelling in that role. Edward Norton shows us why he needs to be considered one of greatest actors in Hollywood, by perfectly portraying the narrator. Helena Bonham Carter and Meatloaf supply a good supporting cast to an already superbly acted film. There's really not much I can say about this film except that it couldn't be a better movie if it tried.",Fight Club
1631,chris-pitcher,So good you'll watch it twice (at least).,10,16 June 2005,"Correct me if I'm wrong but isn't this the best movie of all time? Now, it might be a little violent in places but that doesn't mean it can't be good too. All the violence is completely necessary to the plot and character development and in fact it gives an impression of containing far more violence than it really has - surely one sign of a good movie already.The dialogue and the voice over is clever and witty e.g. ""I still can't think of anything to say."" ""Ah, flashback humour."" as the film catches up with itself and EN has a gun in his mouth.The editing is all neat and slick.The screen play and directing is outstanding. I was going to site an example or two but as I sit here, so many little scenes or parts of scenes suggest themselves that it impossible to pick one or two out, it's like trying to pick the best Beatles songs.The acting is monumental. Brad Pitt is somewhat larger than life but in fact he *is* larger than life. Edward Norton is ideal and it is so right that he isn't a hunk of meat like just about every other leading man these days. HBC is perfect, you feel you know her so well, a total head case that you can't help being drawn to.The plot is, needless to say, awesome. The film takes the novel, makes it it's own thing and then surpasses even the novel.What more do you want from a film for goodness sake? Well, what you want are 'little touches' that are unique. Like the almost subliminal clips of Tyler flashing throughout the film; The 'oh well' look that Edward Norton gives after beating Blondy to a pulp; The way Brad Pitt's pants are almost down to his crotch in the soap shop; The fact that the act of destruction in which Robert Paulson dies is called ""Operation Latte Thunder""; The line ""I haven't been ufcked liked that since grade school.""; The way Tyler (BP) throws things on the ground with such force all the time. I could go on.Name me a better film and I'm pretty sure that I can say that, you may prefer it to Fight Club, but Fight Club is still a better film. I have a few films that I prefer over Fight Club but that is because they tweek my buttons in just the right way but Fight Club just is a really good film.Did I mention that I think its quite good already?",Fight Club
1632,Machetemovies1998,What all psychological thrillers aim to be.,9,28 August 2019,"I recently watched this film knowing it to be a classic. What I got was exactly that, a classic. A film made before it's time, one that Split surely grabbed inspiration from. The mysterious Tyler ( the famous Brad Pitt) , the perpetually exhausted Edward Norton, the fantastic Helena bonham carter as the love interest. This movie keeps you guessing until the final 30 min. What I write about this movie is nothing new, it's one of those films that is just so intriguing it deserves 2-3 re watches. It is just that compelling. The dive into mental health is something people eat up in this day and age, something I would say is ahead of it's time. Without giving anything up, I would say pay as close attention as possible to try and see through the veiled glass of insanity that is this classic, and if you can figure out what is going on early in the film on your first watch, you are an impressive individual",Fight Club

I think TNT the commercial looked great. I thought to myself probably just another mindless fighting movie with no point. But I decided what the heck I went out and rented it. I turned on the movie and my eyes were GLUED to the T.V. though the whole movie. When it first came on I thought where's the fighting? Where's the gore? But, as it got going I realized this movie is much deeper! Edward Norton gives a spectacular performance as a man who hates his life! He hates his job and his boss. His life seems to be going nowhere. If you add insomnia on top of that well, who knows what he's capable of! Then Ed (aka ""Jack"") meets Tyler Durden (played by Brad Pitt whom also gives a stunning performance)who helps him fix his life by helping him create underground ""Fight Clubs"". Where men can come to beat the heck out of each other to relieve anger and stress. But then everything goes haywire when Tyler gets out of control!And on top of that Marla ,a fellow life hater, gets in the middle. I don't what to spoil it for you but this movie has an explosive ending! You'll never expect it! Ed Norton and Brad Pitt fans will fall in love with ""Fight Club""! As well as everyone else!!!!The 1st rule of Fight Club: You do not talk about Fight Club. The 2nd rule of Fight Club: You DO NOT talk about Fight Club. 3rd rule: Someone yells ""stop""... goes limp... or taps out... the fight is over. 4th rule: Only two guys to a fight. 5th rule: Only one fight at a time. 6th rule: No shirts, no shoes. 7th rule: Fights will go on as long as they have to.

Se7en was so brilliant but fight club was like an electric shock. I consider this film as my second favorite movie and the fact that I suffer from insomnia myself has everything to do with it. The film deserves a 10/10 only for Edward Norton's performance ( he's my favorite actor after Gary Oldman ). It is amazing to see the perfection of the movie even in the details like the clothes. The story goes so far up to the end which is enclosed by a great hit of Pixies, that it's a pleasure of every moment. I'm sorry my English is not so good.",Fight Club

He says the movie makes the mistake of masquerading as philosophical, and the point of the movie was probably taken the wrong way by many viewers. Roger Ebert is my favorite movie reviewer of all time, but he is dead wrong. Whatever you take away from Fight Club is whatever you take away. It is what is. This is the smartest movie I have ever watched and the best movie of 1999. You should definitely see this movie. Talk about it with your parents, smart friends, dumb friends. Different people see the point of this movie in different ways. At the end of the day, Fight Club does one simple thing. It empowers people to live more productive lives. Do something new, be a part of life. Or don't. Be the most productive person you can be in whatever you want to be productive in. Fight Club- 10/10",Fight Club

Fight Club was directed by David Fincher and written by Jim Uhls, based on the book by Chuck Palahniuk. It's a Dark Comedy which explores the ironies of our society, Fincher holds a mirror in our face show how disgusting we are and then he makes us laugh at this. This movie is masterfully directed and edited, beautifully filmed and decorated, it features some of the best performances by both Edward Norton and Brad Pitt. It is hard to understand what people didn't see when it came out, even though the magic was a bit lost when this movie became so popular, that now holds the tenth spot in the IMDb's Top 250, in my opinion it deserves this status, if not to compensate the hate or indifference it received when it came out then for its achievements as a stupendously well done movie.

Tyler Durden and his schizophrenic friend Brad Pitt's character set off to destroy the capitalist America by taking down major banks through soap bombs. I don't want to go into more detail for fear that the government will take me away. You can look it up on google and read the in depth analysis by people who were taken away. The chick's tits were bomb, even though they were CGI.

The film's bold, bruising humor leaves marks on a wide range of hot-button issues: It's about being young, male and powerless against the pacifying drug of consumerism.

I would understand it if people looked strangely at them as it would show something was up but they don't it's just lazy, not much smart is done to set up the twist yeah they do that whole thing that Tyler durden says to not talk to Marla about him but that's it the twist just happens and makes no sense, then he shoots himself in the cheek which kills Tyler. COME ON! That makes no sense why couldn't he just die. Ok I quite like the message but it is made redundant when the film has whorish product placement that just undermines the whole message. I don't like the fact that the film starts with the most interesting part, I find that a bit lazy. Helena Bonham Carter horribly overacts.

There are very few movies made where the director obviously did not let one FRAME onto the screen without a reason, and Fight Club is one of them. Nothing happens on screen without it having an effect on the plot.Brad Pitt is dynamic as Tyler Durden, an anarchistic man who lives in a run-down abandoned house and makes and sells soap for a living.

Wishing something bigger would happen in his life. Then to answer his prayers he meets a man on a plane ride named Tyler Durden (Brad Pitt). Who is exactly who the Narrator (Edward Norton) wants to be. One night they get together and start fighting and releasing pent up aggression and then the story only escalates into the story of hte Narrator losing control of his life and this movie in a nut shell follows the Narrator through this dark period in his life. The acting is absolutely superb Tyler is the man everyone of us wants to be he is absolutely crazy and we eat it up. Edward Nortons best movie in my opinion as hte Narrator even better then America History X. He plays the perfect depressed insomniac. And this movie is absolutely mind blowing. You could consider the movie to be the venture spiraling downward into ruining the narrators life or you could consider it his rebirth. This movie speaks on everything and this is really a movie you have to watch multiple times to really ""get"" it.Trust me its a lot funnier the second time you watch it. This movie also has many things to say about society today and how pointless are existence it. The fight club sequences are done masterfully these fighting ant pretty they're not stylized with Kung Fu or martial arts its an all out brawl crazy testosterone pumping. This movie really appealed to me because its about letting go I live a very similar life to the Narrator before he meets Tyler. This movie deserves higher on the top 250 list. Especially if you were born in this nineties MTV computer generation. This movie is impossible to pass up. I encourage every person to see this it appeals to all genres action comedy drama crime everything.",Fight Club
1653,stephanlimanmorocco,fresh but not deep,7,15 September 2005,"Okay, this movie is not Deep. Edward Norton rejects the consumer culture and dreams of being a primal dude and the character is brought to life. The notion of the fight clubs is like something out of a 20th century novel. I'm talking mid-20th century. We are now in the 21st century. This is not challenging stuff. Rejecting consumerism? Wow that's so edgy. You know what though? For a movie with this kind of a budget, it is PRETTY edgy. And that's about all you can say. Usually a movie with sets like this and the scale of this movie you would expect a more conservative viewpoint. You wouldn't expect a blatant dissing of the modern life. One negative for this movie is Fincher's complete lack of ability to direct Actors. Yes, he knows what to tell the D.P. and what to tell the production designer - he's one of the best at that - but having auditioned for him, i know firsthand what he tells actors, and my impression was he doesn't have a clue. He comes from music videos, not theatre. As a result, do you relate to Ed Norton's character? I sure don't. By contrast, PT Anderson, a GREAT actor's director, can director actors. Tell me you don't feel Mark Wahlberg in Boogie Nights. Rant over.",Fight Club

It is such a well throughout plot and the acting is really good too, it's no wonder this film has the reputation it does. Really feel like the main character develops throughout the film, making it feel meaningful.

This movie is life changing and reminds us that sometimes there isn't rhyme or reason to anything , or ourselves. Unique and original story line that makes you really dislike the characters yet empathize with them. This film really shows the raw side of the complete and utter chaos we live in- through a very complex out of the ordinary situation about control. The main characters provoke a ""lead or follow"" theme per say. Doesn't necessarily explain the events in the movie but more so what I got from it. The best part of this film is that the viewer can take a wide variety of ""meanings"" from the plot, event , climax and characters which gives it its raw variety we don't see often in films.",Fight Club

1663,mstanger-99388,A Favorite and a Classic!,9,28 September 2018,"Ever since I first watched this movie a few years back with some of my friends, I loved it. It became a sort of habit of ours to watch it every couple weeks or at least once a month while we laughed and quoted the whole thing for fun. 
 Anyways, what makes this movie better than what the 1999 box office credited it with, is the filmography. My favorite use of camera and film techniques probably had to be the moment where Tyler describes the meaningless of possessions in a shot inside their house as it wobbles from side to side. His calm demeanor reminds you more of Jack rather than himself and his more aggressive tone, creating a sense of foreshadowing the ultimate climax when Jack realizes he is Tyler and Tyler is him. It's also very interesting to see the change from a clear and sunny day in the city to the yellow-tinted bars, basements, and ultimately the abandoned house Jack and Tyler live in at night. There's a feeling of the underground's grime and dirt in these transitions, as well as a feel for the tougher moments in life that are a central theme in this movie.
 This movie also made a high ranking for me because it makes you think. In 1999, people were looking for stability in the shadow of Y2K. They weren't thinking about giving up everything they had, but preserving it and gathering more possessions, as highlighted throughout the film yet again as a central theme. This film goes exactly against contemporary consumer society at the time by instead of telling people to ""buy stuff we don't need"", it emphasizes the ideas of minimalism and even tribalism in some aspects when Tyler talks about ""starting over"" again. What sticks with this movie is that it's message still sticks to us today, perhaps even stronger than in 1999.",Fight Club

The visuals and direction are top-notch, right up there with Fincher's previous work, SE7EN, also starring Brad Pitt, except Brad is much more disturbing here.  Ed Norton again amazes, even though his character is light-years away from his AMERICAN HISTORY X character, Jack makes just as much an impact here.

1669,hikulix,Something doesn't quite fit with this movie...,1,6 November 1999,"As an earlier comment stated, the first 2/3rds of this movie are truly intriguing. The visuals are slick, but not in you Blade-meets-Mortal-Kombat kinda way, instead focusing on delivering irony, sarcasm and black jokes through flawless direction and edition ( and even some hi tech effects, like when the credits roll).   Edward Norton plays the narrator, and the social satire presented during the first half of the flic is simply put, awesome, because the movie doesn't seem to take itself too seriously ( althought it is serious ). One plus point is the fact that the narrator doesn't step on a soapbox to preach and condemn, he just...narrates and observes.   However, after the first half of the movie is over, it suddenly dulls and painfully slows down from the pace from which it begun. For starters, the attention to detail lowers, the dialogues start to dumb down, you get this ""anything can happen now, no matter how far fetched"" feeling, and plain and simple, it just gets silly. As in ""6th sense"", another recent movie, there a ""shocking"" twist near the end. But instead of leaving you gasping for air like in the former, here it all seems contrived, forced, it just doesn't fit. All in all, Fight Club is not a bad movie, but I really wished it had ended as good as it started...",Fight Club

A look at our society and ourselves that is seldom expressed today.  This could start a revelation, but will not because it is made by capitalists. It will make you want to buy a DVD just to watch each frame as it appears in its artistic and graphic fullness.I felt guilty for laughing, as nothing was funny, but it was some of the best humor I have seen in years, far surpassing the stupid tricks of Adam Sandler or similar ""comedians"" who think humor is about degrading themselves or another.  In Fight Club, the humor is about degrading the YOU the one who is watching and laughing, it makes you hate the fact that the blood or the suicide or the death is funny.The movie makes you feel guilty for paying $7.50 to watch it and $4.35 for the popcorn you hold.  It plays on some of the ideas in American Beauty, to leave you feeling rebellious, but subdued.And most of all, it makes you wonder, as you leave the theater, who is real.

Go see this movie! I personally don't need the box-office to signify if a film is good or not. however, i think it's a sad statement when something like ""double jeopardy"" is held with more enthusiasm amongst movie-goers than ""fight club"". personally it makes me believe in the issues portrayed in films like ""fight club"" even more! Like ed norton says, ""how embaressing, a houseful of condoments and no food..."". read in to that what you will. besides bringing up brave issues (by the way it is very american to bring up issues) fight club is directed and produced superbly, the acting was excellent, and if you insist on shutting off the thinking part of your brain it still look's genius and the sequencing is very creative.",Fight Club

This was spectacular writing and I am very interested in reading the book it was adapted from.Pitt and Norton impress me with every performance they have.

I would have liked to see an expansion of ""Jack"" after he realized what was happening to him,  the short clips gave you a taste but it left me wanting more.  Edward Norton is so talented, I loved his facial expressions, Helena Bonham Carter finally broke out of that porcelain doll stereotype and Brad Pitt, well, I've never seen anyone look so good in a pink bathrobe.

Yes, I agree with the critics who say whatever you think this movie is about, it really isn't. I will go see this movie again simply for the things that I missed on the first viewing. The acting in the movie is incredible. Edward Norton (Rounders, American History X) gives a very believable performance. Brad Pitt is also very good although I would say that Norton's performance is more on target that Pitt's. This movie is not something the academy gives nominations for but if the screenplay adaption does not get some kind of recognition, I will be very surprised. Helena Bonham Carter gives her usual fine performance. If you do see it, remember rules 1 and 2 of Fight Club. Do not talk about fight club.

One thing in it's favor, I liked it when I saw it the first time and loved it the second time.The only criticism I've heard worth investigating is that the film is a bad treatment on people who have mental disorders.

It is violent, venomous and ... hilarious.It is advisable not to eat too much before going to see it, because at least one scene with Pitt, Norton and the bag of raw material for soap made me feel quite a bit of nausea. And it's VERY hard to make me feel nausea...The icing on the cake for me was Pixies' ""Where Is My Mind"" at the end of it all. A perfect way to end a perfect movie.",Fight Club

A couple of spots seemed to drag just for a bit, but they picked right up again (or maybe I just missed something, which would have been easy to do since this movie was an a visceral assault on your mind.) I feel this film deserves a second viewing to catch it all. Not at all what you expect from the trailer. Theatres need to strictly enforce the admittance of minors to this film so ignorant teens dont start up fight clubs all over. This is not about fighting in the usual sense.

Fight Club did! Destroy the world! Destroy your self so you reach the bottom (so there is nothing to fear you) so afterwards you can destroy everything!And they do! Of course it is fiction, but it is something that can happen, it is not imposibble. Just find an army of fools and give them a target they will love. Every fool is looking for a leader to lead him to a target. And do them destroy the world! So simple, so briliant idea.

1683,the ninja,Fight Club will blow you away,10,11 November 1999,"Fight Club is a truly great film, in my opinion the best of the year (1999). This movie shows us something we haven't seen before. Based on Chuck Palahniuk's novel, Fight Club is the depiction of how one man's search for meaning in his life develops into a sort of fascist paranoia.
While the movie looks rather simple (a bunch of guys fighting each other is what the previews depict - they are VERY misleading), Fight Club is anything but simple. Mostly it is a vicious satire of consumerist society. We see our narrator, who identifies himself as Jack (played to perfection by Edward Norton), trapped in a pointless existence revolving around buying furniture and going to support groups. Then he meets Tyler Durden, who shows him how to break free and give his life meaning. This meeting will change his life forever.Where Fight Club goes from here is something that cannot be explained.

Working hard for his things.  That are just that-things.This film is like getting really drunk.  At first it feels pretty good but later you feel like death and hurt all over.

Then again, the violence is why quite a few people went to see it. If they went for straight out gore though, the hopefully left considering more interesting issues.I thoroughly disagree with those who state this is an irresponsible pion to Nazism... heavy-handed, sure (black shirts and soap) but, I don't see why it was particularly at fault: after all it drips cynicism and just cannot be read as a straight ahead film. I don't think it was saying men are defined only by aggression, rather that - men can easily be defined only by aggression. I particularly liked the creeping madness infecting the men of America - the idea of a surreal, out of control secret society. The lead two, Pitt and Norton, are great... unhinged, and repressed respectively.Helena Bonham-Carter is actually really good too(in a fairly slight role) as a rather dysfunctional love interest. I thought it quite a thoughtful film (if you reference Emerson, you automatically get a brownie point from me!) The incredibly eye-catching/hyper real visuals added to a sense of subverted reality.

Second don't be persuaded by previous ignorant comments that state this movie has no basis or message to deliver. Fight club is ingenious in delivery and concept leading you on a bizarre and twisted psychological journey. It is wonderfully crafted, maybe to much so for the average dullard viewer and reminds me in nature of another great flick THX-1138. It follows a man entrapped by materialistic desires suffering from insomnia despising what his life has become. He can only find comfort and sleep in the connection of those less fortunate then himself in self-help groups to ease his burdens. Until he meets her. He soon discovers feelings for a woman and sorrow in the death of a friend which previous eluded him being blinded by his materialistic greed. His journey takes him through a dark thou enlightning journey or transformation.The presentation along with the twisted turn of events at the end make this movie much deeper then originally given credit for. Bradd Pitt and Edward Norton deliver nothing less then spectacular acting creating characters as equally dark and disturbing as your worst nightmare. This is one movie that gets better with every viewing and more easily understood. I watched in 5x in one weekend and became more and more engrossed with every viewing. Director David Fincher, director of seven, and the game has outdone himself with this one delivering a fantastic outing with intriguing concepts such as the use of subliminal pictures used in the movie and used as a small role in the movie. There are several, most notable comes at the very end.As Tyler sez,""how much can you truly know about yourself if you've never been in a fight.""

The film itself is superbly acted, well written (screenplay as well as original novel), and masterfully directed, with exceptionally skillful and subtle use of special effects.  One can really tell that this movie was a labor of love for everyone involved, from David Fincher to Rhett Wooden.*More than this, though, it was the message that got to me.  This movie in no small part led to a drastic shift in my personal outlook on life and my critical perspective.  I became highly sensitive to - and critical of - uncontrolled consumerism, individual insulation, and media manipulation, among other things.  I can honestly say that this movie helped change my life.After time and subsequent viewings, however, I have become more critical of Fight Club.  Isn't Tyler Durden - and thus, through his less-than-subtle preachiness, the movie itself - practicing the same force-feeding of ideology on Ed Norton's narrator and his ""space monkeys"" that he spends the whole movie railing against?  Isn't this movie, as a prepackaged, glitzy media spectacle, just another element of the mass media fixation and dependency that the narrator is trying to escape?  Other critics have said as much, and denounced the movie for hypocrisy and didacticism.However, one ought to consider the idea that the medium itself is always a part of the message.  The movie itself hints at this, as Brad Pitt's mischievous character (think Puck meets Travis Bickle) splices pornographic images into movies even as the viewer sees images of Brad spliced into Fight Club occasionally.  Think the irony of Hollywood Hunk Brad Pitt cast as the character who proclaims, ""We're all brought up to believe that we'll be movie gods and rock stars, but we won't,"" is accidental?If someone watches Fight Club and latches on to the message with intensity, like I did, then obviously that person needed to hear what Tyler Durden had to say, and had to hear it from Brad Pitt's famous & attractive mouth. Conversely, if someone watches Fight Club and is able to say ""that movie, while nicely executed, is overly preachy and hypocritical in its stated purpose,"" then that someone is independent enough of media not to need the media/cultural liberation that Fight Club preaches.That's what Fight Club's about, really - breaking free from cultural restraint of all kinds, even the restraints that allowed the genesis of that freedom.  It's about questioning everything - especially ads, magazines, TV, and - you guessed it - big-budget movies that tell you how to live your life.  So, while I've become more critical of Fight Club than I was originally, I only respect the movie that much more for its ability to subject itself to the same scrutiny it gives everything else.For these reasons and more, Fight Club is one of the best movies of the decade, and may well prove to be one of the defining movies of our generation, like The Graduate for the 60s and Saturday Night Fever for the 70s.I highly recommend consumption of Fight Club in any form, although this is one rare instance where I think film is the better-suited medium over print. I do have a beef with the movie's adaptation of the ending (considerably happier than the novel's), but that just enforces the idea that the movie itself isn't free from the trappings of Hollywood.The DVD is especially high-quality, with insightful commentary from the novelist, screenwriter, director, and main players (notably film buff Norton).9.5/10

1696,kafka-21,"A metaphysical, creative, well-acted and intriguing movie.",7,25 February 2000,"Any film of Fight Club's nature is, essentially, best judged not for any moral perspective that it offers, but rather for the degree to which it leads its audience to debate whether any such perspective *is* offered; with this in mind, Fight Club is a successful effort - because, rather than in spite, of its many self-contradictions.  In the duality of the glorification and criticism of the cult of violence that is its most obvious device, the movie presents a number of different elements in juxtaposition, and is the richer for doing so.  Rather than adopt overly simplistic, black-and-white arguments, Fight Club presents many sides to its numerous coins, so that we are never sure who is deemed the ""villain"" and who the ""hero"", nor even the anti-hero.  The plot twist towards the end of the movie is the realisation of this aim, taken to extremes - rather silly extremes, admittedly, but it gets away with it.. just.  We're given a portrayal of the conventional and the unconventional; of good and evil - but one where the respective labels are shifted and reevaluated at every turn, in a somewhat dizzying and rather confusing method.  That the film's ultimate message is confusing, though, is by no means a criticism - Fight Club is most powerful in exploring and exploiting the inherent contradictions and ambiguities of everyday life. Where some reviewers have chosen to stick to one particular reading of a central ""message"", doing so is self-deceiving.  It should be understood that this is a tale of self-fulfillment, of coming to understand oneself, of extremes and extreme repercussions.  Arguably, things get a little *too* extreme in this movie, and the film's conceit is rather tenuous; nonetheless, it remains the perfect tool for evaluating the split-personality of both ourselves and of our culture.  We are lead on an intriguing, exciting and at times rather terrifying ride that, somewhat surprisingly, is most potent when the direction cuts back a little from its reliance on fetishizing violence, revealing an intelligent, almost kafkaesque core.Stylistically, the movie is sometimes a little overly pretentious and self-referential: the ""subtly"" inserted frames (reflecting the plot) are jarring and rather smug, while the violence is, as mentioned above, sometimes needlessly excessive to the extent that it steals the limelight. Nonetheless, this is a movie filled with clever jokes on society (as with the soap) and interesting turns, although the trist comes both too late and too early, leaving an uncomfortable amount of time in which to wrap everything up.  Ultimately, the films successes are also its failures, insomuch as it is a little too subtle for its own good, at times, and a little too unsubtle for its own good at others.  It is the eternal doom of any similarly intricate film that it will be both under- and over-analyzed; perhaps I'm guilty of the latter, here, but as with other Fincher directions this is a movie that grows in scope the more it is interpreted, for better or for worse.  It is interesting to read other reviewers' comments that suggest that the Norton character ""won"" over Tyler Durdon in the end; my own interpretation was the reverse - this was Videodrome, not The Exorcist. Either reading, though, is valid - and, in a sense, the two can exist simultaneously.  It is precisely this ambiguity that is the movie's ""message"" and its measure.",Fight Club

David Fincher proves again his extraordinary abbilities as a director (after he amazed the world with ""The game"" and ""Seven"") and realizes a real work of art. A perfect combination of thriller, dark comedy and psichological. David Fincher+Brad Pitt+Edward Norton--super! Brad Pitt shows everyone that he's not only appreciated because of his looks, but because he has a certain ammount of talent.And Edward Norton... what can I say? ""I am Jack's mountain of rage and anger"". If that wasn't an Oscar performance, then which is? He plaied fabulous, and if those people from the American Film Academy weren't that one-sided, taking in consideration only dramas or love-stories, and would take a short glance at another type of movies, like ""Fight Club"", Norton would have been admiring right this very moment a well deserved gold statue. The movie is too violent to have any other effect on critics but repulsion, but its real value cannot be judged. At least in my mind, the Oscar for a leading role sounds like this: ""The winner is... Edward Norton."" About the movie... only good things to say. It's absolutly delightful. The furniture needed by Edward's appartement, the explosion, the reason for people to fight, the horrible, unconscient laughter of Pitt, when he's beaten by the owner of the bar, the scenes between Edward and his boss, everything is made to perfection. I can't end this without saying something about Helena Carter, who completes the greatness of the movie, playing very good a tough and interesting role. And the ending... great!So, all of' ya, who wanna see this movie, GO SEE IT! All of' ya who don't wanna see this movie, GO SEE IT!

1699,actingeric,A life changing cinematic experience!,10,8 August 2000,"I have so much to say about this film that I don't know where to start. First of all it is not an action movie, like some previews made it out to be. It is a smart dark comedy. I truly believe Fight Club is one of the greatest films of all time. All aspects of it are superb. The acting by the entire cast is flawless (especially the main three). The directing is revolutionary. The score makes it flow perfectly. The cinematography is breath taking. And the outstandingly smart, intriguing, intricate, and mind boggling story makes it worth every minute. This film challenges you. It makes you look at your life and what you value. The character of Tyler Durden (Pitt) has a valid point, but it is up to the viewer to decide when to stop `listening to what Tyler says.' Rent this movie if you want you want to have an experience that won't soon forget. And remember...""THIS IS YOUR LIFE AND IT'S ENDING ONE MINUTE AT A TIME.""",Fight Club
1700,rob.daniel,David Fincher betters Se7en with a Number 10!,10,9 June 2000,"We all knew David Fincher could make a second trip to the well.  Se7en proved Alien3 was a film by committee screw-up, and Fight Club reveals The Game to be nothing more than post-phenomenon jitters.  Phew.  But Fincher does more than merely demonstrate his cinematic nerve; with Fight Club he recalibrates the term controversy, taking a disturbing, savagely intelligent, ferociously funny trip into the life of the mind.  Violence and chuckles in the same film?  No wonder the papers had such hissy-fits.Jack (Edward Norton) is reaching critical exasperation with his white-collar job and lifestyle.  A chronic insomniac, he begins crashing various group therapy courses at a local church, maintaining critical distance through a wry voiceover.Fight Club is intoxicating, its humour the blackest kind, the violence never less than bone crunching.  At the end of the millennium, with no wars to fight and no cause to champion, the suggestion that a fight club answers men's cries for freedom from the hell of 9-5 is heady stuff.  But Fight Club is not a threat to society anymore than Natural Born Killers or A Clockwork Orange were.  With a level of realism pitched at hyper, the film is more a joyride for the brain than a call to arms.As a director Fincher does not let the adrenalin high drop once, using combinations of cinematic left hooks and upper cuts.  Camera's plunge thirty storeys, travel through a character's brain, are on the receiving end of vicious blows, are addressed directly by Jack and finally shake with the giddiness of it all.  The Dust Brothers' frenzied, schizophrenic score, and Jim Uhls' script, a superb adaptation from Chuck Palahniuk's book, complement this visual overload.Pitt again proves he is Fincher's boy, while Norton deserves Oscar recognition for his multi-layered turn.  Even English rose Bonham-Carter convinces, as does Meatloaf as Bob.Fight Club also contains the best twist since Dudley Smith shot Jack Vincennes.  Unbelievably attacked from all quarters, this plot turn adds yet more dimensions to the insanity of modern man.  Just don't let anyone reveal it to you.Fight Club then: it's dark, it's disturbing and unsettling.  For better or worse it's a guy film, a wonderfully creative nightmare.

1703,markd813,A review,10,8 September 2000,"Fight Club is an adrenaline rush of a film.  A movie that takes you in, twists you around, tests your limits, and leaves you stunned.  It is an incredibly dark comedy, an inspired satire, and, all around, a great film.As the film opens, we are taken through the body of the Narrator (that is how he is credited, for very good reasons), until we arrive looking down the barrel of a gun jammed in his mouth.  The Narrator is played by Edward Norton, in a performance full of so much sarcasm, Kevin Spacey had better start watching his back.  Here Norton once again proves that he is one of the best actors appearing in film today.  His role is a tricky one, but he pulls it off so easily, it seems like child's play.The gun is being held by Tyler Durden played by Brad Pitt, who also pulls off a tricky performance.  Pitt is a very good actor who is unfortunately cursed with sex-symbol status, and therefore, not taken too seriously. Here, though, he once again shows that he is an actor.Shortly after this, we learn that buildings throughout the city are wired to explode in minutes.  As this is explained, we are given a spectacular special effects sequence where the camera swoops down the side of the high-rise, passes through the street, into the garage of the building, through a van, and right into the explosive device.  The film uses this effect a few other times in the film, and all to good effect.With this setup, the film flashes back to when the Narrator had a bit of insomnia.  His job is tedious, the stuff in his apartment doesn't seem as nice anymore, and he goes to support groups just to sleep at night.  He has a nice thing going until another `tourist' shows up to one of his support groups.  She is Marla, played with fun and a strange sadness by Helena Bonham Carter.Now the insomnia reappears, he is traveling for work excessively, and he just happens to meet Tyler on an airplane.  They talk for a bit, and the Narrator is intrigued by him.  When he returns home, he finds that it is a pile of rubble; blown out of the building.  His decision: call Tyler.  They have a drink, he asks to stay at Tyler's place (after some convincing), and something strange happens.  Tyler asks the Narrator to hit him.  Thus, the unofficial start of Fight Club.From here, the movie centers on the club and how it is gradually knocked up levels, until we begin to realize what Tyler's philosophy really is and its effects on the Narrator and the other members.David Fincher, who has explored the dark side of human nature in Seven, directs the film in such high style that there is never a dull shot in the film.  He proves he is a visionary director, and I am sure he will have many more opportunities to bring his vision to the screen.It is not often that a film is able to capture its time so perfectly. Earlier this year,  South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut was able to satirize the censorship issue.  Now comes Fight Club, a film about Generation X and corporate America that is brutally honest.  You leave the theater knowing that Tyler's actions are too extreme and anarchistic, but there is something in his words that speak to anyone who is fed up to some degree with the way our society is.  Fight Club is a film worthy of multiple viewings.  The first time, it is a visual experience.  The next time, something deeper appears.  By the third time, if you already haven't, you should see it with some of your more intelligent friends and discuss the issues the film deals with; and there are a lot.",Fight Club

1705,Red Dragon-2,Powerful thought and emotion behind the violent exterior,9,1 February 2001,"This movie is extremely hard to define and is certainly not a movie to be seen only once.  When I first saw it, I would classify it as a simple action/suspense/thriller movie, fairly entertaining but nothing special. The difference between this reaction and the reaction I got from seeing it a second time is astronomical.Edward Norton does an excellent job playing the unnamed narrator, a man who has a steady job, a nice apartment, a stable life...and is beginning to realize that it is all meaningless, that he is a by-product of the corporate society, that he is not really living at all.  Enter Tyler Durden, an independent rebel who identifies immediately with the narrator and by his nonconformist lifestyle that things do not have to be this way, that he can reject the cookie-cutter ""perfect life"" and instead make his life mean something--to stop living as society would have him live and not care about the reactions he gets.I've been told that this is a ""guy"" movie, but a look at the breakdown of user ratings here will tell you otherwise.  Despite the bare-knuckle boxing and action, this is not a ""guy"" movie, nor is action its focus.  This movie is about rebellion against a stagnant society, against living a life without purpose.  Tyler Durden carries these ideas to the extreme, and the results are clear.  However, I submit that this movie suggests that the opposite extreme is equally bad, if not worse.",Fight Club

1711,hypnopaedia,Radical and Original,10,11 March 2001,"Violence?  Essentially none compared to Saving Private Ryan, Gladiator and many other recent films.  Critics see an opportunity to jump all over this movie for its violence when in fact it is it's various themes, which threaten the establishment, that are the problem to them. People are not used to Hollywood putting out a movie that reflects society and its various members' feelings, they are uncomfortable with that. And they usually do a good job of stopping these kinds of films from being made.  They would rather a happy, repetitive and empty film than an honest one.  But there is a segment of the population that looks for the original and different film.This film is mocking society and it's pretty sad the length it has to go to do this.  Getting beaten to a pulp is the last resort to life that Jack sees in this early twenty-first century age.  Society says we should graduate from high school, go to college, get a well-paying job, get married, then have kids, but something seems to be missing to Jack while in the job stage of life, he is emotionally empty, numb and to top that off he has insomnia.  So to get some emotional feeling and contact and to possibly get some sleep, he attends support groups where each group has a different illness, which Jack has none of, but goes for a shot at life, an opportunity to live.  Now it is true that Jack isn't suffering with the various cancers within each group but nonetheless Jack is suffering.  Jack is suffering from insomnia, he's confused and he's unhappy.  So to treat these ailments he attends the support groups. So along with the other support group-goers Jack is attempting to heal a problem.  After a few months he sees a fellow ""tourist"" named Marla who goes to the support groups and also has none of the illnesses. So now Jack is again unable to sleep, so he tells Marla his problem and from then on they agree to attend different support groups.Fight Club is great in so many ways.  For example: this was one of the first movies to use photogrammetry, which is the shots you see going through the building floors then into the van with the bomb in it. The cool sex scene in the movie is also done by the use of photogrammetry. Photogrammetry was also used for the footage of the apartment blowing up: zooming into the stove and into the back of the refrigerator. Fight Club definitely has the most original story of at least the past couple of years; the protagonist's real name is never given; that's different and interesting.  This movie challenges everything about current-day society: whether it is corporate influence, or modern living, or being a sheep in a herd, or any of the other subjects that are addressed in the film.  This movie ends with a great song too, ""Where Is My Mind?"" by the Pixies, appropriate title too.  The intro into the film is amazing as well - the brain ride.  The music compliments the movie so well and fits in great with the whole modern-day age theme.For the people who are uncomfortable with Fight Club and people who find it offensive.  These people obviously have problems of their own that need to be addressed.  As Edward Norton said, ""Art reflects the flaws of society"" and if people are uncomfortable with this then they are the problem.  These people are perfectly comfortable with a movie like Saving Private Ryan that shows limbs flying off, faces ripped off, torsos blown off, etc. but they can't handle a fist to an eye. And it's a willing fist to an eye, both fighters realize they are going to get hit and they want that.  Whereas in Saving Private Ryan the people getting shot do not want to get hit, there is a difference.  It just shows the contradictory views that these conservatives hold, totally partial to one thing over another.  What decides what type of bloodshed is acceptable?  The answer is what the bloodshed is representing (what that particular movie is about).  In the case of Saving Private Ryan it was patriotic bloodshed, non-threatening bloodshed, acceptable bloodshed, but in Fight Club the bloodshed was part of a type of radicalism that was deemed a threat by the establishment whether it be Hollywood, the corporations, or the government.  That is where censorship comes in, the free flowing of ideas, which is completely necessary for a healthy democracy.  When censors start to flex their muscle that's when some form of communism or fascism makes its appearance.  With one critic calling Fight Club fascist, I say censoring an idea is fascist (an example most obvious in the case of Brazil where Terry Gilliam almost could not get the movie released).  If you don't like Fight Club or the ideas it presents then don't watch it, but don't decide for others if it is acceptable to watch or not.A few insights that I gained: the car company that Jack worked for is Ford Motor Company.  This is shown in the scene when Jack beats himself up in front of his boss and they quickly show a glimpse of the letters ""FMC"" on his boss's business card, which would refer to Ford Motor Company.  Jack got over his TV addiction that he and so many Americans have.  This shows that to live you have to lose that addiction. Upon reflecting, Tyler is so free in the ways that most (and almost all people) aren't.  Tyler doesn't have a car, doesn't have bills, doesn't have pointless possessions, he doesn't work everyday to pay for his new $25,000 car, he's free.  The rejection of material possessions is one important idea to take away from the film, if nothing else.",Fight Club

Never before has a film been more deserving of a 5/10.The first half of the film is exceptional. The narration draws you in, Norton's character is compelling to watch, and when Tyler Durden (Pitt) is introduced, the idea of self-destruction as the way forward, rejecting the norms imposed on society and acting in accordance with the essence of man, for good or for bad are amongst the fascinating issues explored subtly for the viewer to think about.The film should have continued like this, but instead decides to impose a bizarre twist, suddenly focusing on a plot rather than the character-based psychological issues previously being explored, which just descends into complete chaos, with unbelievable subplot after unbelievable subplot, which left me overwhelmed and regretting the demise of the intriguing first half of the film, which I am sure I'll watch over and over again before switching it off at the appropriate point.For many, I am sure, the unveiling of the big twist around the middle of the film will spark it into life as the film develops a real story, but for me it did not need a spectacularly unbelievable ending, it had it all from the start, but lost its way and never recovered.",Fight Club
1715,Michael Lindberg,A film that tries to be meaningful,6,21 March 2001,"SPOILERSFight Club is an interesting movie. On one level, it is a very funny film. Some of the writing is fabulous. On the other level, as a meaningful and philosophical film, it fails by a large margin.When I first saw Fight Club it was on the DVD special edition. I had avoided hearing anything about the film, and thus the inherent spoilers about the narrator's true nature were still there for me to be surprised about. When I first learned that him and Tyler were supposed to be the same person, I was thrown for a loop. I figured that there was no way the movie could pull such a cheap trick on me.When the movie ended, I was left with a very empty feeling. What I had just seen was at once supurbly edited and very humerous, but I felt that there was another side to it. On the second viewing I finally realized that it was nothing more than an amatuerish effort to use ""buzzwords"" to evoke responses from people. I watched the film a second time and paid closer attention to the movie's main message. I even tried to imagine what it would be like to follow the film's message, and so I thus placed my mind into a realm so I could just absorb and obey what the film was trying to say.After the second viewing, I realized that at most the film was trying to juxtapose two different films into one. The first sequence, before the establishment of Fight Club (some of the following scenes not directly involving Fight Club or Project Mayhem were also top-notch), was amazingly well-written. The characters interacted very well with each other. Once Fight Club began, the movie took a turn for the worse.The sequences of Fight Club and Project Mayhem were nothing more than an amateurish attempt to create a physical representation of a philosophy that in general makes sense. It tried to say (basically) that once you lost everything, your life began to have true meaning. ""Your life is not the sum of your possessions"" or something like that.While this message is powerful and inherently a ""buzzword"", the representation of this philosophy in Fight Club boiled down to chaos. While this was on one level a workmanlike way of handling it, I would have much preferred to see the movie evolve along the lines of discussional based philosophy (perhaps the planning of some of Project Mayhem and a nice bit of why it is ocurring would have been acceptable).I think that Fight Club had the chance to be a very good film. It did not handle itself properly (although this would never have been fixed since it was based on a book). Some sequences were very good and very meaningful, but the handling of the philosophies in a tangible manner came off as very amateur and base. I just wish that maybe the filmmakers would have explored some of the issues in a musing style rather than in a physical representation.",Fight Club

1719,smackblay,Horribly Overrated,1,1 August 2001,"Fight Club is the most over-rated movie I have ever seen (barely beating out Gladiator).  It is also one of the worst movies I've ever seen.  Its only redeeming quality is if you take it as an examination of mob mentality in a group of reprobates - except in that light, its quality ends up seeming like someone's final project for their high school psychology class (as in, amateurish and not very detailed).People talk about its ""depth"".  My answer to that is, ""What Depth?"".I have no problem with its premise - people are dissatisfied.  Hey, I could handle ""The computers that rule the future can build a nearly-indestructible attack robot out of liquid metal"" in Terminator 2, dissatisfied people is nothing.  Even the incorrect placement of blame is believable.What bothers me, though, is that the movie attempts to pass itself off as an accurate portrayal of the real world.  I'm not saying there aren't people like that.  What I'm saying is that they aren't right.  They aren't automatons, they're unambitious.  They aren't ""suppressed by an overly-materialistic society"".  They're just whining and looking for someone else to blame for their problems.  I have an easier time believing Marx's nonsense about class identity than I do the things this film tries to pass off as ""meaningful social commentary"".Fight Club doesn't have a social message.  Fight Club isn't entertaining.Don't watch Fight Club.",Fight Club
1720,yilingbaihe,This is a masterpiece!,10,18 March 2020,"In addition to ""split personality"", we can also understand the film from the perspective of the theory of ""ID, ego and superego"". At the same time, we should not ignore the simple, immortal, shadowy Mara with only primitive desire. ""ID, ego and superego"" are the personality components of each of us. Their survival ideas are different. They fight with each other and grow with each other. The film talks about all of us. In the end, morality shoots the ideal to join hands with desire, steals the heritage and continues to live.",Fight Club
1721,karladavisio,Cult movie,10,3 April 2020,"The Fight Club tops the list of those films that at the time of release are met by the public rather coolly and often fail at the box office, but over time they acquire cult status.
After watching the film, the author of the original work, Chuck Palahniuk, was very impressed and regretted that certain artistic techniques exceeded his writing style and more strongly affect the viewer. The novel is a manifesto of the middle class against the foundations of society, where chaos is gradually spreading. In the film, the characters follow the precepts of the book, while simultaneously immersing themselves in cigarette smoke, alcohol and the meetings of a secret society of men who beat each other to push for their own freedom and self-realization.
The story revolves around a nameless employee of an insurance company who looks like me after classes at the university - ready to give anything, just to take a nap. In an effort to relax somehow, he visits all sorts of patient support groups in order to visit the atmosphere of reigning sadness and mutual understanding. And everything seems to get better for him, until at these meetings he meets a woman named Marla Singer, who also goes to these groups to find peace of mind. And again, our hero loses the will to live until he meets Tyler Durden - a mysterious man who, through his actions, undermines established positions in society. He urinates in soups that waiters deliver, glues various porn frames into films, and sells soap cooked from human fat - in other words, a reaper, a well done fellow and a dude. The scuffle between friends attracts the attention of other men who are going to a club where fights between different people take place. However, gradually everything is led to the fact that Tyler transforms the Fight Club into something more, he puts the philosophy at the base that destruction is the impetus for development ...",Fight Club

From the entertaining visual trickery, to the awesome performances by Pitt and Norton, to the killer twist ending, this film speaks to the viewer on every conceivable level.

They start scrapping in a parking lot regularly because they're bored, attracting the attention of other men who want to fight. A secret society of bare knuckle fighters is formed as a result.Up to this point, I thought the movie was interesting. Jack is a man trying to fill the void in his boring life and realises he's not alone when his fight nights become wildly popular with other men trying to find excitement in their equally hum drum lives.The twist that Jack IS Tyler Durden was almost as bad as revealing it was all a dream. It would have been better keeping Tyler as a REAL man so we could watch how their philosophies clash without the stupid exaggerated conclusion.

1731,Movie_Finder,Exceptional Film,10,26 December 2001,"Many people seem to think Fight Club is a film about guys who join a club and bash the living daylight out of each other. This is simply not the case. Fight Club is a film that questions our society and reality. It is a film with many deep and effective meanings.The Narrator (Edward Norton) plays a wimpish insomniac who is living a boring life, filled with predictable events and no thrills. He is stuck in a dead-end job and the only real motivation for his existence is the will to help people who are dying and to collect furniture. All of this changes when he meets Tyler Durden (Brad Pitt) who shows him that there is more to life than collecting furniture. Tyler seems to be every man's dream as he gets to participate in exciting occupations and events as well as engage in much sexual activity.""You are not your job, you are not how much money you have in the bank, you are not the contents of your wallet, you are not a beautiful and unique snowflake, it is not until you have lost everything that you are free to do anything.""These are some of the lessons in which Tyler lives by and tries to deliver to Jack and the rest of the world.Overall, Fight Club is an Exceptional movie with an outstanding twist, and although it contains some gruesome violence, it is a movie that MUST be seen by anybody who is tough enough to question their motives and beliefs about existence. 10/10.",Fight Club

But it's much more than that the storyline is a mix a action, comedy and thriller which makes it really entertaining. The way it's filmed is great and the acting is superb. The interesting thing about this films is you really don't know whats going on you might have an idea but in the end you'll be shocked.

1741,tedwards77,An awful bore,1,31 January 2002,"I really didn't enjoy this film at all & I fall into the target group (male 20-30). 2/10 I'd give this.There seems a belief too that anyone who doesn't enjoy it is either thick, against violence or especially 'doesn't get the message behind it'. Well, none of those apply to me.In this flawed film, I understand that it was any of: a)a group of young men rebelling against a Borgeousie consumerism society. b)one man seeing how he is totally dissatisfied with life and how his mind tries to change things or c)people stopping to watch Cornelius fight himself because voyeurism is human nature the film makes a deliberate attempt to make the viewer feel guilty for being a voyeur. (I'll come to that later)You can take your pick really, whatever way, I still find it crap. Any film (Shawshank Redmeption excepted) which concerns 'one mans' anything, generally creates no emotion in me other than boredom. The whole tagline to the film makes me want to puke: ""one 30 year old man's journey of self-discovery.""So what? Are we supposed to sympathise with Norton because of this? I'm sorry but I have sympathy in films with people dying, or who's family have been killed. John Hurt triumphing over cancer in Champions, Tom Hanks in Saving Private Ryan, thousands of others. Even Norton himself actually in the brilliant American History X. In the 2nd half, I sympathise with him for the life he has found himself with.But in this (and I find myself saying the same as I did with the equally awful American Beauty) Just because some blokes fed up & having a midlife crisis we're supposed to feel for him. Oh diddums. The only film where this premise has worked brilliantly is 'It's a Wonderful Life' with James Stewart. He was in crisis (and justifyably too) but never resorted to any of the levels stooped to here.(That might seem a weak point, but It's just come to me & I can't put my finger on exactly why Wonderful Life is so far superior to Fight Club in tackling a midlife crisis, but they are as far extreme as you can get)
I'd also question whether we're all voyers? For every moron that slows down on a motorway to look at an accident on the other side, there's a 100 or so that can't believe the stupidity of it.There are countless flaws too. The scene prior to the car crash wouldn't have worked? Who was Norton talking to? with the passengers there? Where did he acquire his knowledge of soap from? Would people have watched 1 bloke fighting himself? and much more too. Ok, maybe one or 2 of those have answers but I couldn't find them.I think to really enjoy this film, you have to have clicked or empathised with the main character, and if you did, I feel a bit sorry for you. It would however account for the popularity of such things as marriage guidance councillors, drugs, footballers agents, even to a degree religion (but only when it becomes absolutely fanatical & life revolves around it).
Maybe it's just me & I'm fortunate but so many people seem unable to get through the little problems that life throws up on their own & without help of any kind anymore, like inventing a friend for one thing.I know plenty of people who like this, intelligent some of them, so I've no problem with people who enjoy 'Arty & deep' films with psychological meaning to them. I just don't. But not through failing to understand them, Just merely through not connecting with characters who suffer problems like a 'mid-life crisis for non deserving reasons'.On top of all of that, it was a very slow film too.",Fight Club

1744,atdmullally,An under appreciated masterpiece.,9,9 June 2002,"An interesting adaptation from the book.  Both are good, but don't see one without reading the other.  What Fight Club so intelligently and refreshingly acknowledges about being a young man in today's world more than makes up for the movies' shortcomings.  Let's face it: we're all mortgaging the happiness of our souls by working jobs we don't really like.  We do this in exchange for the opportunity buy crap we hope will self express ourselves and makes us feel unique...just like everyone else.  The vicious cycle is causing us more harm than any of us want to admit.  We're are too afraid to break it, so we carry on and continue our search for whatever coping mechanisms help us deal with it.  Then along came Fight Club.  For the first time (as far as I know) somebody found a novel way to talk about it.  And overcoming the fear of fist fighting with total strangers couldn't be more brilliant as the ultimate coping mechanism.My biggest complaint about this movie was that it was too stylized - so much so that I couldn't help but think some might accuse its anti-consumerism rants of being somewhat hypocritical.  Sure Brad Pitt looked like a dirty scum bag, but that was a carefully contrived ""scum style"" you were looking at.Notwithstanding those subtle dashes of Hollywood that, to me, seemed to sober the movies' message, both Brad Pitt and Ed Norton gave fantastic, believable performances.  They helped make this story, this idea, a highly authentic experience.  I am actually quite surprised this movie didn't create more buzz when it was in theatres. I can see the back half of the movie might have been where many people started to lose interest (I admit it weakens as the whole Project Mayhem stuff unfolds), but that first sixty minutes is all you really need to see as far as I'm concerned.  The power of that piece alone leads me to believe that Fight Club is one seriously under appreciated movie.  I think its legacy will start to shine the more we reflect on what it had to say.  Give it a second try, and give it time.",Fight Club
1745,True_sherwindsa,"Artistically audacious, brilliant craftsmanship and visually surreal _ also one of the most dangerous and spiritually ambiguous films ever made",5,13 June 2008,"What can I say about Fight Club? Technically it is one of the most well-crafted movies ever made with brilliant direction, superb acting, bravura cinematography and terrific editing. Music by the Dust Brothers maintains the overall surreal ambiance of the passages to which they are set (see the scoring of the segment where the Fight Clubbers try to pick fights with innocent people for a good example) and the writing and characterization are far more insightful than the average shocker. Every character is developed well enough for us to either identify with them or at least understand them. There is a lot of unusually ingenious creativity evident in certain scenes such as the IKEA catalog scene, the opening zoom through a brain sequence, the support group scenes, the use of a subjective voice over and non linear chronology.That's where the pluses end. Now for the minuses. The movie depicts men in their 20s and 30s who regain their masculinity by beating up/getting beaten up by other men. Once they regain their masculinity, they rebel against society by destroying the capitalistic /consumeristic society that has enslaved them for so long. That entails carrying out destructive and loathsome acts of vandalism against society. If you want to re attain your masculinity even if it means killing yourself, then go hurt yourself. Why terrorize innocent people in society who don't share your concerns and probably wont feel the same way you do? Splicing porn stills into children's films and spiking food with bodily fluids might seem downright funny to some, but it is simply vile, repellent and morally repugnant. Some people will even find making soap out of human fat positively revolting. Yet the cleverness with which all this is lensed will make some people want to imitate some of these pranks.Many of the dangerous ideas may actually sound deep and thought-provoking but some of them are just inversions of the Truth. For instance, all true Christians know that our corporate, materialistic world sells us a lie when it says we need our favorite McDonald meal to be happy or we aren't somebody if we don't have a good bank balance or the latest car. Fight Club knows this truth and perverts it. It also perverts the beautiful ideal of masculinity suggesting that if you do not have scars or injuries from dangerous beatings, you are not man enough. At least movies like Die Hard and the LOTR series celebrated masculinity in the proper moral context, with the protagonists flexing their muscles to protect and defend innocent people.An argument could be successfully constructed that this movie doesn't glorify its violence and nihilism rather it is a deconstruction of it as evidenced by the hero's futile attempts near the end to stop the mass destruction from taking place. The subtlety of the movie's last-act rebuttal to its anarchistic themes completely escaped me as I felt that this movie was nothing more than an apologetic for its one evil character's nihilistic philosophies.The eerily prescient image of the credit card buildings collapsing serves as a tight ruler slap to the wrists of all those who cheered during the destruction scenes of Independence Day and Armageddon. I never cheered during all those pyrotechnics so clearly I am not among the members of the audience this sharp satirical barb is aimed at. I am looking for the movie or movies that correctly satirize capitalism, materialism and the feminization of masculinity in developed societies, but Fight Club is not that film. I still remember finishing the screening of this film, feeling equal parts amazed and horrified. Amazed to see so much creativity in one single film and horrified at the possible real-world implications of what I had just seen.My rating:***** out of **********.Artistic Value:***** out of *****. Moral/Spiritual Value: 0 out of *****.",Fight Club
1746,arpavitt42,"On the surface a too-cool-for-school nihilistic alpha-male story, but underneath",10,2 April 2008,"Fight Club has all the parts required to make a classic film, a slick, bouncy script, star performances from Brad Pitt and Ed Norton and the chilling but meticulous direction that David Fincher brings to all his films. Yet at the box office it tanked, and reviewers, though intrigued by its boisterousness and attitude, were not too complimentary of its muscles and glamorisation of fascism.But the fight clubs are not everything, a point that is easily missed considering the title. What is important is the almost Dante-esquire journey by the Narrator through his own personal hell, through the conformist ""Ikea-porn"" stage, through the enticing Tyler Durden stage and the Zen faux-enlightenment, and out the other side in an explosion of bittersweet emotion, the hand-hold with Marla Singer (a gloriously untamed display from Helena Bonham Carter) at the end showing potential that this is the final step in the Narrator's charred journey.Brad Pitt delivers undoubtedly one of the coolest characters ever captured on screen, miraculously managing to do to soap what Steve McQueen once did to motorbikes, and it is easy to get wrapped up in his glorious ideals and intentions when this is in fact the story of the Narrator that we are watching, not that of Tyler Durden and his ""Space Monkey"" drones. Bearing this in mind, Tyler Durden should be taken simply a character that has been purpose-built to suck the viewer in, to make them believe every anarchic word he spits, because this is exactly how the Narrator sees him. This is still the Narrator's story, however, and Edward Norton delivers an understated but elegant performance, perfectly showcasing the dynamic and conflicting nature of his character, without trying to out-cool Brad Pitt.This film is simply a joy to experience, prepare to be sucked into the Fight Club mind-set, and prepare to be pulled out again by the end.

All I'm going to say is that it's nothing like any movie I've ever seen. Just prepare to enjoy and taste the brilliantness of this movie.This is by far the best performance from Brad Pitt I've seen so far (didn't see Babel tough). He is perfect for his role and I can't think of anyone, that would be better than him. I also love Norton's performance he is for me one of the best actors alive, capable of playing anyone. Helena Bonham Carter's performance is also very good for the complex role she had. The casting was very near to perfection in this movie, it's on the level of Magnolia.If you haven't already watched this movie, the you have to get up, walk to a video-rental store and go watch this movie.

1748,adtjoel,Masterpiece,10,14 August 2012,"This is a superb movie on so many levels. Sometime movies get mixed reviews from critics due to the concepts or themes portrayed, or lack of understanding of a complex plot - that is exactly the reason here.If you are thinking you are going to see movie that just involves people kicking the crap out of each other, you would be very wrong. It is so much more than that.Just go and see it! The undertone attacks the society we live in today - consumer driven and unrealistic expectations. It also has themes of violence but at the same time has elements of black comedy.The acting throughout is superb - great performances from the 3 main character played by Brad Pitt, Edward Norton and Helena Bonham Carter.***Spoilers*** You may have to watch this movie several times before you fully understand it and pick up on all the nuances but I outline some below.When I first saw this I thought there was something wrong with the DVD because at a few points is seems to flicker (and does) not until I put it on super-slow motion did I realise it was intended. If you slow it down you can see it's his alter-ego starting to form. Not only is this alone brilliant but later on it is revealed that Tyler working at a movie theatre does the same thing - edits movies to insert just a frame or 2 - something you notice but are not entirely was there (like when I first saw it - as I said I thought there was a slight DVD fault). Extremely clever.When he is beating himself up in his bosses office he says ""for some reason I thought back to my first fight with Tyler"" why? Because it was exactly the same situation.How could a fight club possibly form? If you see 2 guys fighting in a parking lot you aren't exactly going to join in - but if you see a crazy guy essentially fight himself you could conceivably approach to see what is going on.When Tyler is banging Marla he speaks to Ed Norton and then slams the door, Marla says ""who are you talking to?"" we get to find out. There are many more instances like that, the film doesn't cheat but when you find out the incredible twist you aren't expecting it.The palette used is superb - bland, subdued, fitting in perfectly with mental illness. Then you get Brad Pitt, looks striking, blonde hair, unusual outfits - He doesn't fit in at all - again, we get to find out why. Superb.The themes about modern society are absolutely bang on too if you think about them. Are you rich and famous? Weren't we lead to believe we could be? Do we need most of the things we clutter our lives with?These a just a few things, there are so many more things you will notice, when you see it again and again.Like I said.

1749,cheeks9,"Insert clichéd and ultimately unworthy way of saying ""this film is the balls"" here",10,24 June 2008,"I am Joe's newly enlightened perspective.One thing that can be said about Fight Club is that it exhibits a certain mastery of technique, a certain stranglehold of different conventions...this is evident in the way the film toys with these conventions, often with meticulous precision. Here is a film whose every design seems to point to the optimisation of narrative influence on the audience, through the unreliable narrator, the main character Jack. In Jack, unlike the main character in almost every other film before and after it, we get a character through whom we can see this world. Thus we are presented with an endlessly dark picture; Jack doesn't have the hopes of greatness that we can all identify in the heroes of old; the sanctimonious sense of self importance is done away with, as that would fly right over our heads. Instead our character lives in mundane, dull darkness, with eyes that filter it's sights with relentless pity and exhausted, often darkly humorous sardonism; a filter which, although not pleasant, fits like a glove into the psyche in it's vivid darkness and how we deal with the events to come.This is where the film comes in; I dealt with the main character first because his viewpoint, the narrator's insomniac, twisted view on the world is the spin on the narrative. His alter-ego, Tyler Durden provides the friction and uncertainty that breaks the darkness and introduces the pacey, sweaty, claustrophobic tension. The subliminal flashes of Durden in Jack's consciousness in the first leg of the film let the audience know that this film is out to break the comfort zone and to shock and surprise. The character in itself is the yang to Jack's yin and the pacemaker of the film: the clothes, the body language and the twisted philosophies. As we leave our comfortable insomniac viewpoint we enter these twisted philosophies along with the narrator, thanks largely to the fantasy scenes, the subliminal flashes the self referencing humour (the film reel gag referencing the earlier ways of the film), all made possible by the seamless, exciting method of direction and pacing. It takes enormous talent to produce such a twisted state of mind so vividly and so involvingly.It also takes one such talent to produce such a twist near the end in a way that pays off the attention and intense psychological involvement that the audience contributes. Up until the plot twist the plot becomes more and more dark and alienating; slowly the world Jack creates gets away from him and he drifts apart from his alter ego, and thus we feel increasingly more tense for the end. And the end pays off. The insomnia, the sanity, all of the abnormal traits vanish and for the first time we see a normal, clear headed human. Possibly the biggest pay off in any film I have ever seen; we see a character lose morals and gain new ones, we see a character heal without ever knowing it because the modern, revolutionary, self mocking storytelling doesn't let us come outside the dried-blood stained box and view him under the microscope, despite the fact that not all of us could normally relate to an chronic insomniac with an alter ego; at least, not with storytelling this tight.I am Joe's newly changed life. If you have yet to see this film, you have not yet seen how narrative perspective and fictional events can complement each other to perfection. This film is claustrophobic, mercilessly dark, endlessly brilliant. A credit to film and the boundlessness of the human imagination.",Fight Club
1750,raghu7862,i liked this movie,7,30 July 2008,"This is completely a different movie. at first you don't understand what exactly is going around and what is happening in the movie, you might really feel bored but as the movie is about to end you will realize what is exactly about and there comes the real suspense in the movie and then u will understand why is it named the fight club. people who don't understand it for first time, i recommend to watch it for the second time. Well coming to the story line it is about two persons one who works for car company and other selling soaps. the first guy is really frustrated of his life, his usual work and day to day life. once he meets the sales person and then happen to be friends later on. then they decide to start a club which is like a street fight and they set their own rules and regulations. this club further leads to some dangerous events. i hope every one likes this movie.",Fight Club
1751,darioattanasio,A film about our generation.,10,20 May 2004,"Well what can I say? This film is amazing. It has everything that an MTV generation boy or girl could want, all neatly packaged in this gem of a movie. I must say the book was amazing, I loved it, it really gave some fresh ideas to life, and why we act the way we act. But i feel the movie is a better medium in which to show this to mass audience. First things first, every actor in this film is marvellous, a joy to watch. Edward Norton is God, when it comes to really nailing a character and slipping into a role, he is close to DeNiro. Helena Bonham Carter, Meat Loaf and Jared Leto all are a pleasure to watch. But I must say this film is about one man, Tyler Durden... ladies and gentlemen... Brad Pitt rocked in this. I could never possibly imagine anybody else in this role, he magnificently slips into a potentially hypocritical role, looking good and acting the part, my hats off. What makes this film so great, naturally the twist is always important and a real brain teaser, is just how glorious it is after you realize the truth. On second viewing you pick up more details, the tiniest of things that just make the film worth watching over and over again. But most important is its visual flare. It is as if we are in the mind of Jack the narrator - take your pick] The constant jumping back, going forward, skipping to and throw, picking up were he left off, it represents beautifully what a modern mans life is like, full of constant hectic day to day monotomous work routines, all becoming slaves to the fashion and food industry, as if image were really the most important aspect in life. This is a rant on capitalism, and all the better for it, me and my friends enjoy it particularly for that reason, because it laughs in the face of democracy, not in an attempt to [as some American critics failed to understand] promote Fascism as an idealised movement, but just to stand there and say ""Hey this is what's wrong, I don't like this and that, F**k you and your rules, lets do something worth living about."" It really tunes into modern perceptions of life: Work, Sex, Fashion, Religion and Security... and just really mixes them around. I came out of the cinema bedazzled by the whole look of the film, but watch it again and enjoy it for what it really has to offer... everything.",Fight Club
1752,reesu_daddy,"Predictable, Overrated",6,30 March 2010,"I just watched the movie today only for the reason it is rated #16 in IMDb Top 250. Before watching I had no idea what the movie is all about, even I did not know the cast. I just knew the name and nothing else, not even the genre. After watching the rating, I downloaded the movie with some expectation to be something very good. But I was disappointed. It had nothing special. Even before the midway of the movie I suspected and predicted that the character Tyler Durden (Brad Pitt) is made up by Edward Norton. In the end my assumption came true. It was Edward Norton all the way who was the psycho. Maybe watching ""Secret Window"", ""The Machinist"", ""American Psycho"" gave me the drive to predict about the story. Yes, this movie was released before those three, but I watched those before. As an entertaining movie, it is OK, good. But it has nothing to be rated as #16 in Top 250. I feel this movie is very much overrated like ""Pulp Fiction"" (Which is the most overrated film in the history). I haven't found anything to call it a special movie, or this is nothing that I would like to watch it again. This movie is a one time show, do not expect it to be something special or classic. I just don't know why the psycho movies are so popular in USA.",Fight Club

The Naration is just perfect, the work of Brad Pit and Ed Norton and of course Helena Bonham Carter is great!!! Fight Club is a 1996 novel by Chuck Palahniuk. It follows the experiences of an unnamed protagonist struggling with insomnia. Inspired by his doctor's exasperated remark that insomnia is not suffering, the protagonist finds relief by impersonating a seriously ill person in several support groups. Then he meets a mysterious man named Tyler Durden and establishes an underground fighting club as radical psychotherapy.",Fight Club
1754,JeanRalphio,Most unexpected 10 stars.,10,19 March 2012,"I did not go into watching this movie thinking it would be one of my new favourite movies of all time. Considering my friend gave me a DVD rip version of it and I watched it on my laptop whilst mindlessly stalking people on Facebook. After the first five minutes, I knew it was like nothing I'd seen before. Firstly I had turned off Facebook and decided to actually pay attention instead of just watching enough of it so I could tell my friend the main plot points and Brad Pitt's best moments.It's not what you think it's about. If you think you're about to watch a movie similar to 'Never Back Down' (2008), then you're in for some trouble. 'Fight Club' had me thinking days after it had finished and it might even be better watching it the second, third, fourth, or fiftieth time though.To give you a quick run down it is about a character who is left unnamed (Edward Norton) and how his life is drastically changed once he meets Tyler Durdan (Brad Pitt). I would be giving away too much if I said much more, but if you enjoy the likes of David Fincher's other work or savour a psychological thriller like 'Black Swan' or 'American Psycho' definitely give 'Fight Club' a chance because I guarantee you this is better.",Fight Club
1755,Beeeyaaatch,"Hello, again...",9,11 January 2003,"I loved this movie!!! It succeeded in mushing up the difference between imaginary and truth. The characters have unreal connections and interactions which cause you to go ""huh!?!"" before the movie is over. The fantastical backdrops, out-there characters, and hard-edged music make it impossible to take your eyes off the screen. And I promise, you will be repeating the dialogue for days. Watch this film, you won't be disappointed. I give it a 9/10! Remember, don't become a slave to the Ikea catalogue.",Fight Club
1756,sbjwgrubb,Not even the slightest bit entertaining.,1,13 April 2003,"I don't know about anyone one else but when I watch a film I have one goal, to be entertained.  I can say without any reservation I was not entertained for even one minute during Fight Club.  What really shocks me is that this film is rated so highly.  Apparently so many who have watch this film find the bizarre so appealing.  To me a film is good when it's entertaining. You know, enjoyable to watch.  I found nothing even remotely enjoyable about this film.  Fight Club is nothing more than a film about dysfunction and LOTS of it.  Bizarre hallucinations and violence.  Is this thought provoking or intelligent?  Sorry, I don't see that.  My recommendation, if you're a person who looks for true entertainment in a film look elsewhere.  I am definitely worse off for spending 2.5 hours on Fight Club.  I give it 1 out of 10.",Fight Club
1757,coolhandanna,Best of 1999...,10,15 May 2010,"1999 was such a great year for film!! I mean ""The Matrix"" ""American Beauty"" "" Run Lola Run"" ""Toy Story 2"" AND ""Fight Club""! Out of all those films I mentioned Fight Club deserved the Oscar for Best Screenplay, Directing and Picture over them by a landslide!!This has to be one of the greatest films I have ever seen. It really forced me to think of the point of life and whether like them I need some crutch( for them it was Fight Club) to make me feel alive. I really think that Fight Club deserved the honour of an Oscar way more than American Beauty, and just because of that it obstructs my ability to enjoy American Beauty.The whole storyline is very original and entertaining at the same time. It kept me glued to my seat, waiting to see how ""Jack""(played by the amazing Edward Norton), if you will, would handle the whole situation. I love the fact that they put little flashes of Brad Pitt in scenes for like a split second before ""Jack"" is aware Tyler. This film was created by a very meticulous director and it really shows that he paid attention to every little detail. The ending was such a shock, for a moment I was thinking I don't know how this movie could get any better, and then they put in that HUGE twist;also because of that twist the movie is even more enjoyable the second time around, and the third time and the fourth time.Another thing I liked was that Jared Leto played Angel Face, I thought it was pretty funny since I remember him in "" My So-Called Life"" and now that he is the band 30 seconds to Mars. I just thought that was pretty cool, especially cause I didn't recognize him at all.Anyways, Fight Club is a great film, definitely the best of '99. You won't regret watching it.",Fight Club

But after seeing it plenty of times in 100 movies to see before you die lists I decided to watch it. In a short space of time Fight Club has become my favourite movie. It completely blew me away. Amazing performances from Edward Norton and especially Brad Pitt. The movie(based on Chuck Palahniuk book with the same title) has an incredible story and the ending was a complete surprise that I never saw coming and thats all I'll say about that.If you are at all a movie lover, watch this movie, it is sheer genius and once its over you will be thinking about Fight Club for days afterwards.",Fight Club
1759,Eric-Douglas-Statzer,"""I am Jack's complete lack of surprise.""",9,31 March 2011,"This movie is simply a masterpiece in every aspect. The first novel written by Chuck Palahniuk, this script was snatched up by 20th Century Fox and green-lit to perfection. There is a brilliance in the writing, especially the narration of one unnamed protagonist portrayed by Edward Norton. A depressed insomniac on the brink of insanity, working a miserable white- collar, office job, and obsessed with his worldly possessions, he unknowingly develops an alter ego. (Brad Pitt) His counterpart explains himself as saying, ""All the ways you wish you could be, that's me. I look like you wanna look, I f**k like you wanna f**k, I am smart, capable, and most importantly, I am free in all the ways that you are not."" This is Tyler Durden. The two men build an exclusive, global Fight Club, dedicated to loyalty and secrecy, which soon spawns into something much bigger than originally intended, Project Mayhem. The direction is led by David Fincher and is widely considered one of his best films, and that's saying a lot considering his resume. This movie will leave you baffled at its magnificence. The editing and sound is constructed beautifully, the set direction is grimy, yet magnificent. The performances are equally explosive with a strong lead role from Helena Bonham Carter as Marla Singer, the love interest of the narrator. Supporting roles include Jared Leto, Zach Grenier, and Meat Loaf. Fight Club will always be considered a ""guy's movie."" Plenty of punching, kicking, blood, sex, and rock & roll to match the kick-ass dialog that's delivered throughout. This is a movie that you will watch countless times, the lines and quotes will undoubtedly become second nature.

But, what is it about Fight Club that makes it unique? In one word: EVERYTHING. The plot is revolutionary (no pun intended), because it starts as a meditation on alienation and loneliness and evolves into a political commentary on today's society. The atmosphere that David Fincher builds is one of a world falling to pieces, just like the central character: dark, gritty, nihilistic... the performances are outstanding, specially that of Brad Pitt, who plays the guy we all want to be at some point: anarchic and free in all the ways possible. In short, a movie that dares to go where few film dare: to the heart of darkness of postmodern society...",Fight Club

1763,bilsborrow23,Fight Club Review,10,15 December 2011,"Fight club is definitely yet to be challenged in the genre of cult films, of all the cult films i have seen clockwork orange has come the closest but still lacks a touch of brilliance that fight club brings to the table.Firstly i want to talk about the performance of brad pitt, it has to be the best of his acting career. The character of tyler durden is completely mastered, the film's interpretation of the books tyler, was very accurate, a person who believes that working for what society deems to be normal, sitting in a office typing your life away to buy things we don't even need, is hit head on from the performance of brad pitt.David finchers view of the world according to fight club is frighteningly realistic, in parts of the film the philosophical theme can leave you thinking whether working for the rest of your life is actually the answer, Finchers unusual concept of directing was perfect for fight club, in my opinion if anybody else had tried to interpret chuck palahniuk's novel, it would have crashed to the ground faster than the release hot shots part deux.The quotations used in the film are scripted to perfection, delivery of the quotes are also perfect. Also i have to complement fincher again on his choice of actor/actresses, Norton plays the part of a sleepless insomniac dead on and helena bohnan carters role as the girlfriend dragged into the crazy world of the narrators character is nailed, The way the philosophies are brought into the films are also quite controversial, (I would tell you specific examples but i cannot include any spoiler), controversy is the core of any remotely successful cult film, which makes fight club the most crucial ingredient to the genre.",Fight Club
1764,IamMattsCompleteLackOfSuprise,Fincher joins with nortin and Pitt for their best ever,10,1 September 2003,"small spoilers but does not spoil the movieThe powerful story of a man who finds himself in his charismatic friend Tyler Durden. From the start of Fight Club you can tell it was going to be somewhat different from your average hollywood film.  Boasting to incredible leads, Edward Norton and Brad Pitt, and one of the most unique directors around, David Fincher the film had a lot going for it. the screenplay adapted from the book was differnt but it lost none of its power or affect.  In the film Edward Norton plays a man who works alot and has little or no fun in his life and he plays the role to perfection never missing a note or an opportunity to show his awesome talent.  When he meets Brad Pitt his life turns around and the two begin to get in fights to enrich their lives.  Brad Pitt play his character as well as Norton and it is a shock to me how they where over looked for best actor nominations.  David Fincher's creativity and the way in which he uses computer generated images to enhance the movie.  his directing is the best of his career and he was also terribly unluckly to been overlooked for a best director nomination.The script enhances the film and allows Brad Pitt and Edward Norton to have many incredible lines and very interesting converstaions with each other. Many people expected this film to be action and luckily for them it was not.  but some people will struggle to look past the violence and see what is really happening in the movie. Fight Club is a very bold statement aganist globalisation and the corporate power that some companies hold in the world and we have not have seen a film with this power and bravery in recent since and i don't think we every will.  If you are looking for straight foward movie steer well clear and if you have a weak stomach for violence some scenes many not be for you. but all in all a great film that all should see. 10/10",Fight Club

Despite this big fact , i liked the movie and it seemed to me as one the greatest of all time. the movie starts with high speed, so when you are watching you may feel little uncomfortable. Great acting by pitt and norton. As per as direction comes you shouldn't ask because from my point of view fincher is one the greatest director Hollywood had. The film is filled scenes which you will keep on guessing till the climax. this is definitely one of fincher's flick. This film is not for action movie lovers. This is also based on our day to day lives. I will go 5/5 for fincher's fight club. Go for it because its a great movie not because you may action sequences as movie doesn't have that too many .",Fight Club
1767,jayster7,My favorite movie - bar none,10,27 October 2003,"Fight Club is one of those movies that is incredible the first time you see it... but even better when you watch it again because it's viewed from a different perspective the second time around.Edward Norton gives a great performance, and even Brad Pitt, who I normally hate, finds himself on my good side in this flick.  I'm a white male in his late 20's working for corporate America... I've never really done anything wild, I've played by the rules, and I've never been in a fight.  Maybe that's why I love the movie so much... but I think my ability to relate to Norton's character is just a small reason why I loved this film so much.The movie tells an interesting story in an entertaining and thought-provoking way, delivers a message for our generation, and in a strange way, still includes a love story (although twisted).In summary, this movie gets my #1 recommendation!",Fight Club
1768,mvarda,A masterpiece that you shouldn't miss,10,9 February 2004,"I would say that this is one of the most underrated movies of last decade, which hasn't get by critics the acclaim (and the awards) it deserved. Brad Pitt delivers an excellent, amazing, Oscar winning performance here, one of his best to date. The same goes for Edward Norton, too. The direction by David Fincher is masterly and the dark cinematography by Jeff Cronenweth is absolutely functional. I firmly believe that Fight Club is one of the best movies in the cinema history.The film doesn't just reflect like a mirror the dysfunction of our society but enlarges it like a magnifying glass (as art should always do). At first it starts as a strong social comment on how the modern materialistic, consumer, full of angst way of life alienates and isolates people, making their spirit passive and deadening their soul, leading them ultimately to find out ways (even extreme and violent ones) to communicate with their emotions again. Then it shows how the combative dispute and resistance to such a situation may end in anarchy and mayhem, and how anarchy may finally result in a kind of totalitarianism. During its last forty minutes the movie becomes a breathtaking psychological thriller with one of the most original and stirring finales I've ever seen.This movie is fairly reckoned the Clockwork Orange of 90's. It's a masterpiece that you shouldn't miss.My rate: 10 out of 10",Fight Club
1769,Jatkinson94,"In my opinion, the greatest movie ever made",10,18 February 2012,"OK, rules 1+2 of Fight Club may be that we don't talk about Fight Club, but it's so good that I just can't help it! This is one of those movies that, once you reach the end the first time, you'll be so awestruck that you just go right back to the start and watch it again, so much so that this remains my favourite movie of all time.Yes, this is a dark and violent movie, and is certainly not for the faint hearted, however the violence isn't ubiquitous. It would be a mistake to brush this off as simply a movie about men beating each other up, that would be to miss Tyler's point entirely. It is rather a poignant social commentary, utilising the violence to get across it's point. There are also lighter and funny moments throughout that provide contrast with the darker moments and further emphasise them, and to be honest, the story is so good you just won't care about the violence.The acting is also incredible; in my opinion, Norton and Pitt both pull out the best performances in their careers. Norton's Narrator is a character one can easily empathise with, who Norton exceptionally portrays as the ""everyday Joe"", numb to the world and stuck in routine, until he meets Pitt's exceptionally cool Tyler Durden, who the viewer can't help but fall in love with from his first lines and who delivers, to start with, an interesting philosophy. The scene in which Durden threatens a check out boy with a gun into significantly altering his life for the better remains one of my favourite scenes in any movie.Over all this is a masterpiece, every aspect of it clicked my buttons and I cannot recommend this movie enough to you. Well why are you still reading this? Go buy it!",Fight Club

Granted the violence was a little extreme it made its point rather well I mean fights are bloody what do you suspect but if your one of those people with a weak stomach I highly recommend that you don't see this movie because it is very intense and will probably disturb you. The nice thing about the plot is that its always messing with your head, personally I found the ending to be a little disappointing even though it makes a hell of a lot of sense I thought it could have been better. Another thing that I thought to be very intriguing about the whole thing is that the second time that you watch it it is you catch the little things that you missed the first time that you saw it and you'll like it even more and for once for the type of movie this is the ending didn't ruin the whole movie for you even though as I said before it was a little disappointing both actors I believe did a magnificent job playing those roles.

Saw it last night (May 2013) only because my son wanted to watch it and I was too tired to get off the couch. I was totally blown away. It has no resemblance to Rocky or any other boring boxing movie. Can't stop thinking about it today, certainly can't concentrate on work. Why? Because I totally identify with The Narrator and it seems from the comments here and from the consensus of viewer ratings that I am far from alone. Its not 'Macho Porn', or 'little-boy posturing' as Roger Ebert describes it. It is rather one of the most thought provoking movies I have ever seen.I unleashed my own Tyler Durden 10 years ago, not violently or illegally, but I did turn my back on my serf-like existence as a well- paid corporate slave. Sure it was painful and chaotic. But my marriage survived and now I run my own small business. Sometimes I think I made a mistake, as my former affluent life sure was easier. But it takes a movie like this to remind me how empty it was and how much more satisfying it is to take the road less travelled, to forge my own destiny, to have a proper work life balance that allows me to know my kids and to not be sucked into hollow consumerism.",Fight Club

1775,sdsadler,Awesome movie,10,3 October 2004,"Now, I had heard nothing but good things about this movie before I saw it. Luckily, when I rented it, I was not disappointed. The screenplay was brilliant. Serious dialogue intertwined with witty remarks made for innumerable great quotes. The great acting of Ed Norton, Brad Pitt, and Helena Bonham Carter just made the screenplay and the movie itself seem that much better.The movie obviously faces criticism because the name suggests that there will be non-stop fighting between guys, obviously appealing to the people who would like to see a movie just to see guys beat the crap out of each other. They were probably mad, however, to realize that the movie had a deeper meaning. Perhaps they just don't understand the intellectual nature of the movie. I'll spell it out for you right now.The movie delves into the human need/desire for attention and a feeling of worth in the world. The Narrator doesn't want to be Joe Schmo with his IKEA house and run-of-the-mill job. So he starts Fight Club ""with Tyler."" It's about some worthless guy trying to less worthless.Also, the movie explains the evils of materialism. I don't care whether you're rich, poor, old, or young; you can appreciate the message that the movie gets across. You don't need to have an apartment with every piece of furniture from a catalog, you just need yourself and what makes you happy.I don't know about you, but I'd much rather spend 2 hours of my life watching something that'll give me a less rather than spend 2 hours watching men punch each other.",Fight Club

1777,The_Mantis,"A fine, and often misunderstood film",9,24 January 2006,"If you haven't seen it, and don't know others who have seen it, you probably think this is a movie that glorifies violence. And you'd be wrong. The movie is certainly charged with testosterone, but it is actually a deep, thought provoking movie examining the rampant consumerism of society versus ideas of nihilism and primitivism.The central figure to all the philosophizing is Tyler Durden, played to perfection by Brad Pitt. Durden is perhaps one of the most charismatic villains since Richard III, with eminently quotable sound bites that speak to the disillusionment in all of us. Pair that off with Ed Norton as a sardonic narrator, at first a wreck lost to the 'IKEA nesting instinct' and rendered cynical by the amorality of his job, and we have a scathing indictment of the consumerism smothering society.The bloody underground boxing of the Fight Club is a way the characters can gain control of their life, break free of the bonds society shackles them with. This in turn becomes Project Mayhem a terrorist organization aiming to send society 'back to zero.' In one chilling scene, Tyler evokes his dream world from the shadows: a world of post-apocalyptic proportions where people worry about things that matter--i.e. survival. Clearly, the violence has escalated beyond the point where it makes sense, but at the same time we can't shake the truth beyond Tyler's words, the desire to live one's own life.The film doesn't tell you 'do this' or 'do that.' It just asks you to think.(Some may be put off by a few plot holes the twist creates. These are actually fewer than they first appear, and further, the film is not the poster child for realism. Just ride with it.)",Fight Club
1778,mofodojo2010,Perfect,10,22 January 2013,"This movie is perfect. The acting is perfect. Everyone performs outstandingly, even the bit part actors. The writing is perfect. Every line seems real and thought out to the point that you would assume it is all taken from real-life accounts. The story is perfect. It makes you think about the world we live in and what is possible for one person to achieve. The narrating is perfect. It doesn't overshadow the entire movie and is always implemented at the best of times. It is a must see. I don't want to say any more than that because I don't want to reveal a single thing about this movie. All I can really say is that this movie made me respect Brad Pitt as an actor and it made me realize that Edward Norton may be one of the generations best actors. There is some confounding stuff at the end and as another review had said, ""it blows the sixth sense out of the water."" Some close friends have told me it was predictable but they said that after seeing it. Nobody that has watched it for the first time has gotten during the experience, so if you do then you are quite the genius. What are you doing reading this if you haven't watched it. Go buy it, watch it, ponder it, and watch it again. It is a must own!",Fight Club
1779,elliotff,Sophomoric,2,3 August 2004,"I cannot believe the number of rabid fans this sophomoric self-indulgent piece of watered down Nietzsche crossed with Herman Hesse's Steppenwolf has garnered. If this film was a life-changing experience for some of the reviewers I am wrung with pity at what that life must have been before, and with the thought of what it can have become. There was some amusing satire in here, but you had to wade through a lot of adolescent posing and prosing to hear it.I am commenting only because I think this tawdry junker needs a counterpoint to its unmerited adulation. If you found a lot in this movie and want to watch it again and again to validate your deep philosophical and artistic insights, you need to broaden your horizons. Grow up and join the real world.

1780,Kevo232,"Fincher's best yet, (but hes got a long career ahead)",9,28 January 2005,"To start, this is my 2nd favorite next to Shawshank. Ed Norton, my 2nd favorite actor next to Kevin Spacey, is amazing in this. Brad Pitts best role ever, closely followed by Se7en and Snatch, shines in this film. Basically a great story added to by creative cinematography and some of the best lighting in any movie i've seen. David Fincher's greatest in my opinion, though I don't think hes hit his peak. This should and will become a classic. There are so many quotes in this movie that just make you feel like your watching a good film. ""I am jacks smirking revenge"" (And all the ""I am Jacks..."" quotes) There are movies that have traits that are better than Fight Club, but all around, Fight Club owns all but Shawshank. This movie is a must see and will easily become a classic. If you don't like it, dig a hole, and live there the rest of your life.

1781,IDIOTBOX_WEB,Amazing film that rocked the pants of me.,10,21 September 2004,"Perhaps, I myself am not clever or witty enough to give a complete outline of the context, the ""behind scenes"" meaning of Fight Club but I can say that it is the most absorbing movie I have ever seen. I read the book after the movie made such a impact on me and found it equally impressive. I suppose it's the idea's of middle class, middle life, confusion that would appeal to anyone who doesn't know where they are going. Or maybe that's just bollocks and the film is just stylish and darkly comic. Or maybe still it's a mixture of the two. The plot is complicated and warrants a second viewing this is due to the surprises present at varying points of the movie. The disjointed timeline and superb use of atmosphere make this in my opinion better than Fincher's ""seven"" that being a bold statement to make. I'd also say that Tyler Durden has to be perhaps the most awesome character, and ""Jack"" the most uneasily real in a great deal of movies I have seen.In short..watch this movie..it'll be far better than the random babble of me.",Fight Club

It is one of the very few movies that i never get bored of watching.The story is full of twists, and though the story is somehow simple, it is full of hidden meanings and messages. Brilliant script from beginning till end, in the opening scene, we see a man (Brad Pitt) holding a gun and stuffing it inside another man's mouth ""Edward Norton"", who at the same time is the Narrator throughout the movie as he says :""For a second I totally forgot about Tyler's whole controlled demolition thing and I wonder how clean that gun is."" and around this sentence the movie revolved; how silly it is to get stucked in life little details while missing the true meaning of life.For sure this movie is not every one's type with it's violence, disturbing scenes and obscene language, if you are ready to go beyond those things (and ignore how clean the gun is) you will definitely enjoy a masterpiece.I give this movie a 10 out of 10",Fight Club

In a matter of roughly two hours, I was amazed, disgusted, SHOCKED, and excited. The pacing was great, the visual effects were stunning, and the overall concept was just unbelievable.At first, I didn't believe the rules of fight club. There is an established fight club. But no bets. No groupies. Its not even a fight to the death. You simply threw punches just to feel satisfied and happy. But then there was a deeper meaning to that, and I finally understood.In addition, the twist at the end just blew me away. Maybe some had predicted it already, but I was really surprised because I did not expect it to be that kind of movie.The cast was also great, particularly Edward Norton (why isn't he as famous as Brad Pitt?

It features captivating performances lead by Edward Norton and Brad Pitt, a slight comedic tone and a affective voice-over. Like I similarly mentioned in my previous review about the 70s, the 90s was just as an amazing year for cinema, it was branded Pulp Fiction, American Beauty, The Silence Of The Lambs and much more. Fight Club was adapted from Chuck Palahniuk's 1996 novel and, while assisted by Jim Uhls, was most likely adapted to be just as exhilarating as the book (Which I have not read). This movie likes to play with the concept of 'Multiple Personality Disorder', those who have viewed the film would understand what I mean. It depicts twists and psychological instability, while a no-name insomniac narrates the film with memorable quotes and a fair amount of comedy. If you ever receive the chance to watch this movie, I strongly recommend it, for you will not be disappointed.",Fight Club

What I'd like to state here is: I sat down one night in front of my TV set and started watching ""Fight Club"", because I really hadn't anything better to do that very night. I remember I thought ""it should be another ""Van Damme-style"" action movie, with a bunch of tough guys trying to beat the crap out one to another, with the power of their fists"". Well, the title didn't gave me any hope of getting something better. The movie started and the fights didn't, at least for a long while. What i saw was a very philosophical movie that captured my attention from the very beginning to the very end. And yes, if I expected for some action, the action was there too... but just as an exclamation mark, to enforce the whole idea of the film.

1793,morningview1955n,One of the greatest movies ever made,10,16 July 2005,"There is absolutely no argument that anyone could make against this movie that is valid. The direction is flawless, the action is intense, the acting is captivating, the way it's shot, edited, written, I could go on for days.Then there's it's true selling point; it's ability to be seen from multiple angles. Many young men (such as myself, I'll admit it), are Tyler followers and believe that his words are the way to freedom, but the thing that's great is that the movie never really passes judgement on him. It allows you to (if you feel so inclined) dismiss Tyler as a mad man and view all the consequences of his and Nortons characters as the results of a life lead without enough restraint. It is a film that really makes you think about how you feel on so many of lifes major issues and it tests you to put it in your own words instead of spoon feeding you the answers.

1794,lion_time,Edgelord ego fuel,1,7 July 2016,"I can't stand this movie. In and of itself, it's just a mediocre male power fantasy movie for privileged adolescents who feel misunderstood. However, too many grown men take this movie seriously and fawn over its wholly unremarkable and tedious semi-philosophical implications. In fact, I would recommend using this movie as a metric to avoid obnoxious people before you become too involved with them.The movie takes nearly two and a half hours to say ""work sucks!!! no one pays attention to me at the office!!! everyone around me is a chump!!!"" which would be just fine except that the movie is so incredibly misogynistic. The only woman in the movie with any role in the plot is Helena Bonham Carter's character who exists solely as an object of Edward Norton's fantasies. This kind of narrative is entirely unnecessary and at best mind numbingly boring (if not dangerous to an individual's perceptions of women and femininity). The values and glorifications in this movie are toxic and shallow.Not to mention how utterly unbelievable this whole story is. Why in the world would grown men want to just spend their time fighting each other? Why would a group of guys leaving a bar want to join in a fight that they came across in the street? Why would men who did enjoy fighting make the whole affair into a nihilistic cult? None of that is ever explained; we're meant to take for granted that men would just be interested in fighting for no discernible reason other than they're unhappy with their employment and credit scores.This movie was made by and for pretentious self involved clowns and an undeniable waste of time.",Fight Club
1795,Crispy_Quartz,"Awesome entertainment, excellent acting, muddled message",8,31 March 2015,"""Fight Club"" (Fox, 1999, USA) is a David Fincher dark comedy satirizing corporate-driven materialism and follows the Narrator's (Edward Norton) violently insane search for balance in this spiritually wanting world. You'll need to suspend your disbelief to enjoy this movie, even while it raises valid points without taking itself too seriously.The setting is anonymous urban USA (Wilmington, DE). The setting and narrator are drab and nondescript at the start.The Narrator is an auto recall assessor by day and a cynical, insomniac who is only able to get sleep by attending support groups and weeping with unfortunates in even worse shape than he's in. As soon as Marla Singer (Helena Bonham Carter), a chain-smoking misfit with a death wish, starts crashing the same meetings (for conditions such as blood parasites, brain tumors and testicular cancer) the Narrator can't get back to sleep and his mental condition starts deteriorating again.Narrator and Marla make a deal to divide which groups they go to before he leaves town. On a plane, the Narrator meets Tyler Durden (Brad Pitt), a cocky playboy who sells soap, wears flashy clothes and preaches nihilism. They become fast friends, hit a bar and then get into a fight, starting fight club.Fight club is a gathering of disaffected men seeking release thru bare knuckled underground fights. It grows, becomes the first of many clubs, then becomes a kind of national movement and cult led by Tyler. The whole thing escalates into something dangerous and absurd that counters and emulates the conformity the Narrator left behind.The movie is bleak and features sardonic humor about the ways of big business and materialism. The film posits that our society is in decline, and your Average Joe doesn't have enough room to be a man. So people limit themselves, look for fixes in all the wrong places or join fight club to regain that manly feeling.The Narrator is a case in point. He hates his job, his company would rather let customers die than lose money on a recall, he fantasizes about IKEA, thinks he hates Marla when he really wants her, and lacks passion. BTW, he never gets called by his name, although from his narrations you might deduce that his name is Jack, but you can't be sure because he refers to himself in the 3rd person.Edward Norton shows his chops, doing a solid job playing an alienated guy who's more passenger than driver in his own life. But as events get more insane, he begins to find his center, maybe because of the physical toll it takes on him. By the end, he has his epiphany, still standing after being ground up.Tyler OTOH is a peacock, dynamic, persuasive and no matter how insane the idea, he's decisive. Tyler doesn't deliberate or reflect and the ""random"" jumps in the story other reviewers mention are most abrupt when he's up to something. He's always stirring stuff up. Tyler represents everything the Narrator wishes to be, stylish, handsome, virile, resourceful, witty, and an admired leader of men. He lives in a dilapidated house in an industrial neighborhood and sells soap made from body fat procured from the local liposuction clinic.He talks about the uselessness of material possessions and detests social norms. He throws himself and others into danger without the slightest thought, causing mischief, danger and destruction. He starts Fight Club by inviting the Narrator to hit him. The irony is viewers must suspend *their* disbelief while characters under Tyler Durden's spell constantly re-up their misplaced faith. By the time the Narrator is able to believe in himself, catch up to Tyler and confront him on his insane antics, Armageddon has already begun.Brad Pitt embodies what this movie is all about and his performance is the picture of extra, hyper masculinity that's inadvertently ironic. Tyler constantly questions the gym bodied, preening underwear model type images fed to us, even while Pitt represents that image, especially here. He questions the rat race, but his alternative is to siphon people off into destruction. Tyler is at the center of a study of how men who have nothing to believe in can fall into following a crazy person.Marla Singer might be the only truly aware person in the entire movie. She appears at the most crucial points in the Narrator's development, and in spite of her off the wall craziness, Marla's relationship with the Narrator lends him a foothold on reality. She calls it like she sees it and is the only one willing to tell the Narrator how messed up he is. She's played well by Helena Bonham Carter who gives us the perfect mix of neurosis, honesty and unwitting humor to push the pace of the movie and keep us interested.Overall the movie is highly entertaining and I recommend it. It's not as profound as some people make it out to be, but it forthrightly challenges the more greedy and superficial aspects of US culture. David Fincher's shots are great, the way the colors on the actors pop out from the grim or sterile settings really conveys the sense that insanity is what it takes to set yourself apart in the world of Fight Club. The music is unobtrusive and the film's pace is fast, sometimes bordering on frenzied, especially after the Narrator discovers the twist.The dispiriting meta-problems of greed, vanity, soulless institutions and alienated consumer citizens don't get solved in the film. Tyler Durden's problem is he sees no value in anything except destruction. As for solutions, Fight Club entertains us with the crazy fantasy solution so we can easily dismiss it. Is it that there is no sane solution? Is it that everyone just needs to exorcise their inner demons before the solution is possible? Fight Club doesn't tell you, but it looks damn good saying what it does have to say.",Fight Club

I'm sure there's probably some out there, but I sure haven't seen them. On top of having a phenomenal script with some of the most quotable lines ever, (worker bee, rules 1 & 2, his name was Robert Paulson, etc.), it is also very well acted, with probably the best performances I've seen from Edward Norton and Brad Pitt, (and considering how much I love Edward Norton, that's saying a lot), has a great style, has fantastic cinematography, and, has one of the best twists ever IMO that I am SOOOOOOOO glad wasn't spoiled for me.

When Jack objects to the doctor's apparent lack of concern: ""Come on now I'm in pain here"" he suggested to drop into a nearby testicular cancer self help group to see what ""real"" pain was.Hooked on self-help or support groups and the result is his insomnia disappears.New found peace of mind is ruined by Marla Singer's (Helena Bonham Carter) amusing visit to the testicular cancer group.Returning home he discovers that someone has blown up his flat and he phones a soap salesman he met on the plane earlier; a charismatic fully confident philosopher, morally challenged but tough, witty, intelligent and maybe even ""creepy"". After Tyler requests Jack to hit him they beat each other up. Bystanders watching become interested and Fight Club is born. Tyler pours lye over poor Jacks hand and smacks him about, it is an intense scene one of the most memorable in the whole film the dialogue is exhilarating but some of Tylers assertions like so many in the film are plainly wrong!We get a clearer picture of this man Tylers character, flawed in nearly everyway imaginable and yet not only has a profound influence on Jack (banning him from speaking to Marla about him) but on other members of the Club which now stay with him. The club has grown and changed into a kind of ""Secret Army"" Warring against anything Tyler holds in derision. If the idea of hurting each other, getting the male aggression out of the system and riding the storm of a disenfranchised sub group of men trying to navigate the worlds problems as they all in some way have to endure the testosterone charged bodies as inadequate as this is portrayed well yet as we see their is a loss of control now and others who get in the way with Tyler's fixed twisted ideas can get seriously hurt. The madness of the ""plot"" unfolds, Tylers desire to demolish certain key financial buildings and bring chaos to the world where everyone would be equal again financially is farcical.Then Tyler disappears. Poor Jack doesn't hide his broken heart alluding to the departure of his dad as similar and what obviously had a big impact on his life. Marla makes an appearance and wonders why Jack is saying Tyler is gone. She is visibly saddened if not also puzzled and leaves dejectedly.He eventually finds Tyler after speaking about him to Marla Singer.Marla is brought up to Jack by his Fight Club mates. Tyler is now dead. The film ends with buildings falling down as Marla and Jack watch on; and to the sound of The Pixies song, Where is my Mind.Corporate greed, the influence of a culture or world immersed in materialism and devoid of spiritual growth; the nonchalance of Doctors, mental health problems; it's all there.",Fight Club

The sub-plot that I got out of this movie was that young men should have lustful sex with other men just for the fun of it all and then they would be less inclined to run around pounding each other to a pulp.

1810,sciencefictioncat,Better Than The Book,9,6 June 2018,"I never thought I'd say that. Still, it's true. Chuck Palahniuk's novel is (understandably) a bit sloppy in places. Debuts often are. The pacing isn't great. That is, the ending's awkwardly abrupt and certain characters (notably Marla Singer) appear to quickly. Arguably, these little flaws help portray the Narrator's messy mind... though they still annoyed me greatly. The movie, on the other hand, corrects these mistakes. Marla is introduced after the Narrator has attended numerous (unneeded) support meetings. That dramatic, destructive finale feels more, well, final. It's beautiful, too - in a horrifying way. Some people complain about the bad/outdated CGI sequences. In my opinion, they add to the 'distant' feel. After many sleepless nights most things seem false... plastic. Computer generated. I would know, having suffered from insomnia for decades. Edward Norton's monotonous narration captures that stilted, strange state quite well. Anyway, overall, this movie's fantastic for a variety of reasons. Though I still think you ought to read the book first... just because...

This is pure masterpiece. Everything in this movie is perfect and creates a whole ideal picture. THE CAST. I adore and admire Edward Norton, Brad Pitt and Helena Bonham Carter. The colours, the light. The image and vision of the city that inflames and creates a constant tension. Emotions and mental state of the narrator, feelings and condition he experiences, especially in the beginning scenes - I felt it to the bone.
Worth multiple rewatching - you will notice new things and details every time.
Final scene brings goosebumps.

This movie had come under a bad rap and many of those who chose to knock this film, haven't even watched it. Sure it's violent, but violence with a message is a different story. Brad Pitt was good, but Edward Norton shows why he's the best young actor of our time.  Not to mention he's underpaid.Go see Fight Club and decide for yourself.

1822,afong,Wildly overrated with little redeeming value,6,11 February 2001,"No one, and I mean NO ONE can convince me that this film is better than Wolfgang Petersen's DAS BOOT.  Absolutely ridiculous that users have given this trite piece of trendy garbage a better review. . .I challenge anyone to view both movies back to back and conclude anything except that DAS BOOT is the superior film!The actual film seems to be a bland variation of two Terry Gilliam films, ""12 monkeys"" and ""Brazil"", which both did the theme of dystopia much better, thank you.  I won't give anything away because there really isn't anything to GIVE AWAY!  The film is a pleasant little time waster but certainly nothing more than that.There are no cinematic breakthroughs, no ground breaking social commentary. The acting by Edward Norton is fine, but Brad Pitt seems to be recycling his roles from other movies.  Helena Bonham Carter vamps up the screen for a while, but has a disposable role.  The film is filled with cameos that camouflage the fact that the main characters are not as interesting as we'd be led to believe.The final plot twist left me saying, ""so what"", and now that I've seen the opinions of other users, I'm going to rewatch Gilliam's films to see how it SHOULD have been done.",Fight Club

I really didn't care if I ever saw it, but my wife went and rented it-- the next thing you know, I'm hooked!  Meat Loaf gets better and better- give him more stuff!  Brad was, as usual, a throwaway, but Norton was superb!  And I kinda liked scary-girl (she could have been played by anyone, like Brad).  But the one thing that really made me smile, was the deliberate mis-casting of Pitt- it lent the character more substance... I don't want to give anything away, but by casting a Hollywood ""heavy"", it added to the effect!  (If you saw it, you know what I mean).See this movie. period.",Fight Club

1825,Industry,Brilliant David Fincher subversive material,10,8 November 2001,"Take a great book (by Chuck Palahniuk), adapt it cleverly into a screenplay (by Jim Uhls), hand the whole package over to David Fincher, and what do you get?  A dark, twisted, violent, subversive commentary on the disillusionment of the American male at the turn of the century.  Just below the surface of a society where the things you own begin to own you, two(?) radicals have started a bold movement called ""Fight Club,"" where the only way to feel alive again is to physically beat and be beaten in an all-out mano-a-mano brawl.  Though it could be dismissed by a more squeamish audience as too brutal, the themes in this film will have the rest of us coming back for more.  It is surprisingly similar to ""American Beauty"" in theme, but completely opposite in its delivery.  Plus, the last quarter of the film should leave first-time viewers reeling.",Fight Club
1826,vbazzo,"Amazingly Smart, Highly Disturbing",10,30 July 2000,"What is ""The Fight Club""? Maybe the strongest and most daring movie of the year. David Fincher is brilliant. He has this amazing capacity to make movies electrical, powerful and disturbing. The smallest details of this movie are so well-done that the final result was perfect. The movie is about a man. A man lost in a pathetic life where collecting furniture was his major excitement. A man who couldn't sleep. A man looking for salvation. After meeting Tyler Durden, his life changes in many ways. He discovers his violent side, his willing to be free. Both create the ultimate therapy for people who can't find a meaning to their lives: The Fight Club.There men beat each other only to feel alive. Is this impossible? How many people enjoy boxing anyway? After the club becomes famous, though, Tyler starts to create something that will go out of control soon, and that will change that man's life forever. Fantastic dialogues. Amazing character development. A much better twist then 6th sense's. A flawless complex script. Very funny moments. Very tense moments. Nonsense. Insanity. Mischief. Mayhem. Soap.This movie really can rock your world. It made me feel much different about life itself, and is one of the best movies EVER. Highly recommended to anyone who likes to think. Edward Norton is amazing. Brad Pitt does his job well and David Fincher shows us once again that he has a great potential and must keep us addicted to his movies. A high praise to the guy who wrote the book as well. There is a guy who knows lots about humanity. 10/10",Fight Club
1827,RobAx,Truly a work of art.,10,7 November 1999,"Brian Fincher's latest movie is truly a work of art.  One of the most original movies to come out of Hollywood in a while.  Brad Pitt is amazing as Tyler Durden, as he once again portrays a great character masterfully, just as he did in 12 Monkeys and Se7en.  Even the minor details of his character, such as his night jobs, are pure genius.  Edward Norton also throws in a great performance as our mentally distraught narrator.  But what makes ""Fight Club"" a great movie is it's truthfulness of what we really are, and how we haven't noticed it.  It is put best when Norton talks how when the galaxy opens up, it will all be named after corporations(Planet Starbucks). Now most movie critics bashed Fight Club's ending, which of course I won't give away.  Personally, I thought it was great.  I recommend seeing it more than once though.  I just saw it for a third time, and I picked up on things that I didn't see the first two times.  I gave it a 9 out of 10.",Fight Club

It's, in short, better than you can possibly imagine. It does what you want. I don't want to describe the plot or praise the cast but just mention how rotten it makes everything I've seen since look.

1830,RWB99,"If you think this movie is just about men beating on each other, you're far off.",10,18 October 1999,"""Fight Club"" is easily one of the best movies of the year.  David Fincher's visual masterpiece is an event not to be missed. Edward Norton, not surprisingly, gives another blisteringly good performance.  Brad Pitt is the best he has ever been.  And what a surprise it is to see Helena Bonham Carter in a role like this.  I know when I think of he I think Shakespeare and Merchant & Ivory, I have completely gained a whole new respect for her after this movie. David Fincher is destined to be one of the greatest directors, up there with Scorsese, Spielberg, and De Palma.  From the very beginning we are hooked.  We can all relate to Edward Norton complaining about his job and obsessing over material things.  He's an insomniac who's only solace is being a ""tourist"" at support groups.  Enter Helena Bonham Carter, a fellow ""tourist"" who makes Norton feel uncomfortable being there. His life is thrown into further upheaval when he meets Brad Pitt.  To say anything more would be an injustice.  The statements it makes about life are as brilliant as the movie.",Fight Club
1831,Sidius,Fincher at his best,8,30 October 1999,"Going in to this film I had no real idea what to expect of this movie as I purposely avoided reading all reviews of the movie where the plot was revealed or discussed. I was pleasantly surprised with what I saw.This is not a film with excessive violence without context as some critics would like to have us believe. Among other things the film makes a none too subtle comment about the fabric that make up our human existence and the fact that sometimes pain is the only aspect of life that seems real to any of us.Instead of condoning the behaviours in the film the director (in what is perhaps Fincher's best work) continually emphasizes the relationship between what the characters are feeling and what the characters are doing. We see vividly the conflict within Edward Norton's character as the film progresses and we are effectively drawn into the movie taking each turn with him.The pacing of the movie is maintained superbly throughout and together with the direction, cinematography, and dialogue serve to create a movie packed with enough surprise to entice any true movie fan.The acting throughout is excellent with excellent performances by Edward Norton, Brad Pitt and Meatloaf. All of the actors turn in performances worthy of comparison to their best work to date.I truly hope that the greatness of this movie is not sullied by over analysis of it's violent content (Natural Born Killers certainly was) as it reaches into far deeper realms than the surface would immediately suggest.Rating: A",Fight Club

But I will say this.  Fight Club makes a strong, disturbing statement about the present generation of early thirties men living today. It digs deep into what we have been taught by out parents and the lie that most of us have grown up being told.  One of the best lines in the movie comes from Norton's character when he says something to the extent of ""I am a 30 year old boy"".  That seems to really sum this movie up well.  Men of this generation have grown up being told that we could do or be anything and when it didn't turn out that way, we are left feeling like children who never lived up to supposed potential that may never have really existed. Our parents generation has lied to us and now we are left feeling inadequate as a result.See this movie!!  It makes a great statement and pulls no punches.  Walking out of the theatre, I noticed many people my age(29) looking a bit more enlightened and most of the older crowd feeling frightened and somewhat guilty because this movie rang so true.",Fight Club

So I had to see it again and when I did I appreciated it even more as I could look over knowing what happens in the end. This film is my favourite of all time because it is amazing on so many levels. First there is the great plot of a young man's struggle with society and what he does as a reaction, second the acting which was just amazing especially form the always superb Edward Norton. He was very unlucky not to get an oscar nominations which he deserved. As well Brad Pitt pulled of some great acting even better than in Twelve Monkeys. The amazing direction that David Fincher brings to this film. Fincher in my opinion is one of the best directors around and is up there with Ridley Scott. Great CG shots are used in this film with many great effects coming out of the use of this technology.This film has an weird and wonderful originality to it, which is also seen in Being John Malkovich. There are many great quotes form this film that will be remember in history for years to come. The film it self has already become an over night film cult classic. I would truly recommend this film to everyone, even if after watching it you dislike it it becuase it is a brilliant mind blowing film with just the right mix of comedy, action, drama and a twist that will blow your mind.",Fight Club

In fact, I expected little or nothing. Was I wrong? In every sense of the word, and then some.Instead Fight Club delivers a strange, tense, funny, surreal, demented, thought provoking, even charming experience. The movie is just plain good. It confounds your expectations from the opening frame and keeps it up until the credits roll. Edward Norton is very good as an overworked, corporate nothing whose search for meaning leads him to Tyler Durden, Brad Pitt's character, and into some pretty strange basements. Brad Pitt does his best Brad Pitt, which is never bad, and brings to his role exactly what it needs, namely: Brad Pitt. Helena Bonham Carter must be jumping for joy being able to play a character from the 20th century, albeit the creepiest character since Isabella Rossalini in Blue Velvet.David Fincher brings his usual sense of style and lushness to the visuals making the movie nearly tangeable. The almost obscene amount of blood and bodily fluids in the flick will make most squirm, but somehow Fincher is able to keep it from becoming too much. The rest of the movie has more twists than a pretzel factory and actually contains a moral lesson. If morals aren't for you there's more than enough action to go around.So far, 1999 has shaped up to be the year of the mindf**k, at least as far as movies go, and Fight Club will stand out as a strong contender if not the winner by a TKO. Go see it. I dare you.",Fight Club

With the price of movies nobody wants to spend money to be disappointed.The Fight Club previews suggested an unusual look at fighting and its purpose but aroused my interest.  I watched this movie in awe.  Each move was another surprise. This movie had no problem keeping my attention and rolled along at a steady pace.  It provided plenty of stimulation and was well written and acted.   The unbelievable is what provides us the excitement and there was plenty to go around.An excellent film.   See this movie if you want something different than cops and robbers, family dysfunction and slapstick humor.",Fight Club
1837,jcla,"Ideas are interesting, but the execution is bad",5,28 January 2002,"Here's an idea.  Write a movie that explores the idea of a pawn in society turning to anarchist ideals.  Have the transformation happen in a unique setting.  Take the idea to extremes.  Throw in some unredeemed violence to give it that authentic gutter feel of anarchism.Okay, now you have the plot of a pretty decent movie.  Oh, wait, though. We should add a plot twist.  Hmmmm, but the twist will cause some of our scenes to make no sense.  Oh well, most of the movie is already printed, lets just finish it and call the loose ends artistic license.The only problem is the twist pretty much ruins the movie.  Oh sure, it makes you rethink the early parts, and adds a clever uncertainty to the original experience, but the twist just doesn't hold up.  How can many of the earlier scenes be plausibly explained?  The final scenes of the movie just let the air out of the whole plot (the twist didn't work in my mind, and the final sixty seconds made me think that the writers couldn't figure out how to finish off the movie).Good acting by Ed Norton and Helena Bonham Carter.  Brad Pitt has done this same character before in Twelve Monkeys.Compare this movie to momento, however, and you'll find that momento manages to pack in a much more devilish twist that makes you rethink the whole experience and doesn't leave you saying ""but hold on a second, how could that other scene have happened""?",Fight Club

It brewed up a few ideas I've been having myself this past period, and I find it to be an excellent visualization of the ""mutanity"" and sickness these days endorse.The violence completely shocked my parents, who also hated Seven for the same reason.

If you can roll with the punches it's worth it.",Fight Club
1840,boris-48,More than just a good fight.,9,17 October 1999,"You have to see Fight Club to know how good it really is.  A 20 something (Ed Norton) is unhappy with the life he should be happy with.  He's what society thinks everyone should be, yet he doesn't want the role of ""sanity's child"".  Nothing helps him past this unhappy life until he meets a strange soap salesman on an airplane.  Enter Tyler Durdan (Brad Pitt).  During a night of drinking, the two begin to fight.  Without argument or hatred, they just fight.  Ed Norton feels release in the insanity of merely hitting someone with his fists.  He begins doing this with Brad Pitt so frequently others take notice.  They start Fight Club.  People with similar problems as Ed Norton find a similar release.  This is only a part of the movie.  The fighting in Fight Club is more of a focus point, a ""bond that ties"", between everyone who's unhappy with what they are and with what everyone else wants them to be.  This is the kind of movie that makes you doubt your own thinking about who you are and what you want to become with what little life you have.  Not to mention all the humor you'll find all the way.

One of the best flicks I have seen this year.",Fight Club
1843,Evo-3,Fight Club Presentation,10,9 December 2000,"This discussion and review has a few spoilers in it.  I suggest ya watch the movie or read the book and then read this over.  Maybe you will get the same message out of the movie that I did.a)  What's it about:  It focuses on the life of a man in his late 20's. Basically this story follows one mans journey towards enlightenment.b)  Why did I choose it:  It gives us a different perspective on our modern culture.c)  What's the focus:  This story chronicles the life of a single white male.  Beyond these facts that is all we know about him.  In the book he is never given a name in the credits to the movie he is regarded only as the narrator.  He is unhappy with his job and more specifically his life.  He finds no fulfillment in anything.  He seems to have achieved the American dream.  He is educated, has a good paying job and lives in a well-furnished upper-class apartment.  Yet something is wrong.  He can't sleep.  His insomnia causes him to seek medical attention eventually referring him to a meeting of testicular cancer survivors to see what suffering truly is. There, in the absence of hope he found a release.  He was able to cry and vent his frustrations.  He was able to sleep once again.  He ends up becoming addicted to these meetings.  Eventually going to every type of survivors meetings he could attend.  A year goes by.  One night he encounters a woman who also religiously attends the same survivor meetings. Marla Singer.  She as well is not dying of the conditions that are affecting those people.  This causes a disruption in his routine allowing his insomnia to reoccur.  He makes an agreement with the woman, as sort of trade off between sessions and his life goes on.  One night on a business flight he meets Tyler Durden a sly soap salesman with a curious view of the world.  They trade business cards and go on their separate ways.  The narrator returns home to find his apartment blown up, all his possessions reduced to fiery rubble.  He calls Tyler and begins living with him in an abandoned house on the outskirts of the city.· The narrator is the embodiment of the average man.  A consumer, a slave to American society. · Tyler Durden is anti establishment, anti consumerism and against the plight that has become the American dream.  In the following quotation he states his true view on citizenship.  We are not Americans. `We are the all singing, all dancing crap of the world.'Tyler brings to light the concept of our modern society.  America is a society run completely by the media.  Movies, TV and literature has turned us into a nation of consumers.  It proposes us with what is fashionable, what is desirable.  What to love and what to hate.  It forms our vision of the future, and the profession we will one day attain.   It gives us our views of beauty and comfort.  It has formed the lives and world we live in.Through Tyler they form a group called Fight Club.  Tyler ushers in his own vision of an ideal society.  A culture that focuses on a more primal self.  Within this view people abandon their meaningless jobs and destroy their worthless possessions.   Trading in comfort for pain.  Fight Club turns into project mayhem an anti establishment terrorist team that fights back against the commercial media, targeting the source of consumerism. Trading passivity for violence.  Their group gains in number gathering support and followers in big cities all over the United States. The author calls these disciples `Space Monkeys.'  The author seems to be telling us that we have all become caught up within this materialistic, consumer culture.  We have all become slaves to our own media created culture.  Through Tyler Durden he presents us with a different type of society.  A culture based on anti consumerism, anti media.  He also shows us that these `Space Monkeys' are also noting but slaves to this new society. I believe that the author is telling us that this is not the entire answer. As the story goes on, project mayhem enacts more and more violent attacks against consumer culture, eventually causing a rift between the Narrator and Tyler.  Tyler wishes to destroy the buildings of the major credit card companies.  An effort to erase the debt held by the people. The Narrator tries to stop him but is thwarted at every turn.  In the stories most drastic plot twist we learn that the Narrator and Tyler are in fact the same person.  The Narrator responded to the pressures of our consumer culture by forming a separate version of himself who had the ability to leave this culture behind. The movie concludes with the Narrator being unable to stop what Tyler had started.  He finds a way to disassociate himself from his alter ego and falls back into the arms of Marla Singer. The author is telling us that we are not slaves.  We have the ability to change and form society to our likening.  While he portrays that the consumer society is wrong we are also able to that its destruction is also not the answer.  I believe the main message is that we, as a society, need to abandon our roles as consumers and form more secure bond with humanity. We need to leave materialism behind and find our connection with people. We, as a people, must form our own meaning in culture.d)  What is the connection between presentation and objective:  The book I encountered is bound in a simple white cover.  Nothing elaborate or flashy. I think this echoes the author's view on anti commercialism. The movie is filmed using many flashy and realistic camera angles. The director spends a lot of time focusing on depictions of modern advertisements.  You can almost say that the movie itself is filmed sort of like a commercial.  I think this shows the directors acceptance of the authors idea and displays the emptiness within our consumer culture.  The direction in this movie is something to be seen.",Fight Club

Helen Bonham Carter's role was a nothing role.  I think Fincher was trying to say to people to think for themselves and break free of this rampant commercialism.  His message gets lost with all the pummeling that takes place in the film.  I don't know of anyone who would want to take a beating on a consistent basis. This movie seems to say that fascism is good, but I am sure Fincher's intent was the opposite.  The ending was also contrived and not convincing. Brad Pitt and Edward Norton both perform well in the film.  Meat Loaf also has a good supporting role.  It is not enough however for me to recommend this film.",Fight Club
1847,JustnNLA,Bring back NC-17,2,21 October 1999,"Admittedly, I would have never gone to see Fight Club if it hadn't been part of a class I'm taking at USC, but this film makes you wonder what it takes for the MPAA not to give a film an R rating. It's so gratuitously violent and downright gross (even in non-violent scenes) that Pulp Fiction looks tame by comparison.Seriously, it's hyped as a violent film about non-violence, but isn't that akin to saying a film with gratuitous sex can be about abstinence. Sure, I guess it could, but you'd be hard pressed to find an example, just as I find it hard to believe that anyone honestly thinks this film is more than a glorified Faces Of Death with big name actors.I don't know what else to say, but keep your kids (and yourself) away from this film.",Fight Club
1848,kosher,Fight Club is a must see!,10,23 October 1999,"This is one of the best movies, maybe THE best movie I have EVER seen.  It is a commentary on the working class's struggle to maintain sanity in a world where corporate rule and big-whig-richies control our lives. Two men start a new kind of men's group to cope with the demands of life and work in general, then it become more than just an ""unusual"" social club.Fight Club asks you to rethink your own situation and revamp your life.  YOU ARE NOT YOUR JOB. If you miss this movie, you will be missing out on possibly one of the quintessential movies of the new millenium.  See Fight Club!  Then see it again!

1849,billnad,Great film with great subtext,10,10 December 2001,"When i first saw reviews saying that this movie was ir-responsible to be made I was hooked. I waited for video and have seen it twice and am going to buy the DVD. This movie is great!The movie may seem to just be a glorification of fighting, especially street fighting but underneath are very important 1990's type subtexts. There is materialism, fear, and ego behind everyone, so the film says. Most important in this film is the way that it portrays the classic modern american male of our time as lacking in a real hunger to strike out and fight for anything, more apt to look for an easy way to get dinner than hunt for it.The movie uses flashbacks well and is at least as good on a second viewing as it is on the first.",Fight Club
1850,rezmo-2,"On the edge, with an edge.",10,24 October 1999,"I agree with all the accolades spoken in reviews before me.  This filmdefies categorisation in that it deals with so many elements. No doubt it will be classified in the Vid stores as comedy/drama, but that hardly captures it.  It is one of the strongest EXPERIENCES in movies I've had in a long time (and I've seen some good films this year-for example, American Beauty).  Nothing touches F.C. for sheer impact visually, emotionally, philosophically, psychologically...etc.My expectations of  this movie, were shattered within a few minutes of the beginning.  I remember thinking ""this movie better be good, it's pretty long"".  Well, I come away from it reminded of a driving trip I took in the mountains of Oaxaca, Mexico where after 2-3 hours of surreal beauty, I said to my wife: ""whew, enough already. I gotta come down!""",Fight Club
1851,Liley,best movie this year,10,13 November 1999,"I had heard a little about the film before watching it and was rather ambivalent about it. On walking out of the theater, I had no doubts that this was the best movie I had seen all year, and possibly ever. Pitt plays the extrovert/devil superbly and Norton is superb not only onscreen (he's in 99% of the shots) but also with his voice over narration. The film is violent - but that's what its about. It is also very funny and witty in places. Many reviews complain that the last half of the film loses it a bit and while the final scene is a bit much these actions are presented as the logical conclusion for these men to attempt to reclaim what modern, consumerist life has stripped them ofThe film is a must see. Not only is it thought provoking but also extremely well made and entertaining",Fight Club

He is THE man!  He can act, he can be cool and he can be sexy without even trying. Edward was brilliant, as always.  His acting was as good as his performance in Primal Fear.

After a poor start out on the blockbuster scale (see Alien3) he's finally got it right. I'm not going to say Fight Club is better than se7en, it isn't, but it's just as good in keeping you routed to the spot til the very end. The opening scene does what every movie should do, it's quick, complex and get's you to beg for more. Simple isn't it Hollywood?! The ending was a little way out but everyone in their lifetime loves a freaked out movie. Fight Club is just that. It is a film not to be taken serously but one rather to enjoy the controvertial aspects that reflects our society today. We are all freaks and I'm sure we all want to beat the crap out of the people next to us and still be able to laugh with them about it. Come on I know you do. Just don't pick me.",Fight Club
1854,Topdog-182,"Graphically stylish, aestheticizes violent anti-social behavior",3,30 October 1999,"""Fight Club"" is a graphically stylish movie that vainly claims itself to being a thoughtful film, but whose effect in the end, is to aestheticize and condone the ideas it purports to examine. It is simply a violent, anti-social, and misogynist film hiding behind a veil of being a kind of psycho/social critique or expose on the masculine entity and the effect on it by North American values.I personally have no problem in the case of a truly artful and intelligent film making an argument for polemical statement and extremism; this is definitely not the case here. Content-wise, it is undeftly handled material; I think because the filmmaker was so utterly concerned with the making of certain visual moments and lost grip of the whole. I fear for all the angry young males in our society that may see this film and become inspired to re-enact the imagery.""Fight Club"" reminds me of a film that may have began as an interesting and compelling idea, but then in the course of its making, gets ""Hollywooded"". It has several fine visual moments that are in turn subverted by equally horrible ones. It insults the viewer over and over;  by employing pedantic, heavy-handed and contradictory motifs such as the highly militaristic yet zombie-esque 'army' to propagate ""mayhem""; by so glibly setting up what ultimately turns out to be a literal interpretation of multiple personality disorder (I suppose juxtaposing incongruous elements was the means).Too much visuals technology, probably too much budget and attention on the bottom line, not enough attention on structure and content, while pretending to be an ideas film, makes this an insulting and perhaps even, a dangerous movie.

The plot twist and turns with plenty of irony, crazy violence, action and sick jokes. It is one of those movies I think a lot of people will hate. I loved it! It has great performances from Edward Norton, Brad Pitt, and Meat Loaf. Brad Pitt is at his best playing a villain. Edward Norton is a top of the line actor. David Fincher keeps getting better as a director. Fight Club is one of those movies that once you think the plot is going one way it goes another.

1857,phuang,Male Psyche,10,9 January 2000,"What began for me as an action movie with senseless violence soon became a dogma for living. I walked into fight club with low expectations and yet walked out a new person. Forget for a second the anarchial nature of the film (which most of the female population focus upon) and see it as a Scream for Help from late 20th Century Males. Every single one of my mates related to it in their own way, and all of us feel the supression and depression felt by the main character Edward Norton (American History X, Rounders) who played the role with detailed intricacy.  Brad Pitt, was at his usual best, delivering the role of Tyler Durden with high intensity.  Without giving too much away, I will simply conclude by saying that Fight Club will be analyzed, scrupulized and moralized in future generations and best explains the social and mental state of the Males from the late twentieth century.",Fight Club

1860,cecil_peeps,Have a fight. It might change the way you look at life.,10,18 January 2000,"Fight Club....what exactly is it? Is it a gathering of dis-illusioned men fighting one another to engage their primal instincts in order to find their true meaning in life? Or does it refer to the fight within ourselves, of a man's soul trying to fight its way out from convention, from materialism, from a lack of direction in life? Or maybe it's just a story about a man who is going insane?Make of it what you will, but Fight Club is definitely one of the most memorable films of the past decade. Edward Norton is superb in his role as The Narrator (or is that Jack?), and, after a few mediocre performances recently, Brad Pitt excels as the ultra-cool (check out his wardrobe!) yet ultra-devious Tyler Durden. But perhaps the biggest suprise is Helena Bonham-Carter, who sheds her image as a period drama queen and comes out kicking and screaming as Marla Singer, a tough character who the viewer slowly warms to.Some say that the ending is a bit of a disappointment, but in a way, it is clever in the way it twists the story on its head. But this is definitely a film that makes you think long and hard about yourself. Indeed, our lives are ending, one minute at a time, and I for one don't want to be remembered as the ""all-singing, all dancing crap of the world"" with a pair of khakis on, surrounded by Swedish furniture and clever art.All in all, an excellent film which I would recommend to anyone.

Still, my friends and I had decided to go and see the film anyway, as it had received such startling reviews.We entered the cinema expecting merely a violent flick about people beating each other to a pulp, but what we were actually greeted with was a cinematic masterpiece, darkly satirical, whilst playing on the manic side of each and every person in the cinema. The plot is perfectly woven, Edward Norton is worthy of an oscar, Brad Pitt is back to Legends of the Fall form, the special effects add perfectly to the feel of the film, and you seem to leave the cinema safe in the knowledge that you've seen one of the few true cinematic masterpieces of the late 90's.I personally, was completely blown away by the Fight Club experience, and, having only seen the film twice, it firmly ranks as one of my all-time favourites. In short - Fight Club was by far the best film of 1999 (and that includes the Matrix) and one of the best of the decade itself.",Fight Club

Fight Club is the most original film that I have had the pleasure to see in a very, very long time.  The story is about a man trying to find himself, to see where his life is going.  Is it his own life he is leading, or a life lead by a consumer society of which most of us are probably guilty of leading.  Do we really need that new car, house or that new piece of furniture, the answer is probably no, but yet we buy these things all the same.  The film explores these ideas in a very unusual manner, but yet it is very effective in the way in which it is handled.If you are to see this film which I strongly suggest that you do, do view it with an open mind.  Don't avoid it because of it's portrayed violence, the message behind the violence is one worth standing up to and taking notice of.  Remember that Fincher wanted this movie to be seen as a black comedy, which I have to say it is even if it is as black as the night.",Fight Club

1872,Joe-560,This is where the term 'great film-making' comes from,10,22 December 2002,"Fight Club was, to say the least, one of the best films I've ever seen. I have and will continue to recommend this movie to anyone, despite the fact that the average viewer would prefer a mindless, boring, run-of-the-mill big action shoot-em-up flick over a provacative, brilliantly scripted and remarkably choreographed film with deep philosophical origins that actually requires use of the brain to comprehend. Critics such as Roger Ebert have declared this film ""pro-fascist"", and I still marvel at such ridiculous remarks. There are so many brilliant ways to interpret the meanings and ideals listed in said film and many combinations of viewpoints with which to perceive both emotionally and psychologically, as well as physically, that viewers with shallow-minded ignorance could not even begin to fathom the awe-inspiring delight and enlightenment that occurs as a result of viewing it. Most people will be offended for the film's strong celebrations of violence, but if they don't understand with what purposes the violence has and what motivations are clearly presented, as well as the overall effect of the anti-social behavior that the characters use with which to compromise their goals, then this film will probably be a waste of time for them. Others will be put off by the film's attack on modern society and the basic foundations of civilization because they listen but do not hear, and it is ignorance that is a dangerous root in our species. View with an open mind, a strong stomach, and most of all pay attention because if you're confused because you missed something or even worse misunderstood what is being said, then you will most likely say you didn't like the film because your apprehensive skills need work. Brilliant acting, taut script and wonderful direction, this film is definately a classic cinematic masterpiece that like other controversial films will be recognized for what it is as time progresses.",Fight Club

Jack soon begins to see things the way Tyler sees them, and they start ""Fight Club"", a secret club for frustrated men that needs to feel alive through pain. This alone would indicate that this is a pure action flick. Wrong. That would be the easy way. So, what is Fight Club about? Social criticism, personal values, fear of your own way of life, disillusion, revolt or frustration? Amazingly, it's all of the above and then some. Multi-layered and complex are the words I find to be the most accurate description. Fight Club branches out mercilessly throughout the entire movie, flogging and whipping values and morals into an unidentifiable pulp, with the only goal of re-shaping it into something better. This is perhaps the best, and most accurate description we have today, of young people trying to find a place in this world, where being you isn't enough and values, at best, aren't applied because you want to, but because you have to.

The movie works on several levels but I think many people who hate this movie simply cannot think beyond the most superficial levels.Anyway, it's a fantastic screenplay, clean directing, exciting cinematography, and great acting, (especially Norton & Helena Bonham Carter).

I mean, who would have ever thought of a guy who is addicted to 12 step programs.  But the minute that Brad Pitt's face hits the screen we are soon forced into mind numbing, senseless, violent trash.  I think that violence must be used for a purpose, such in Reserviour Dogs or Raging Bull.  In these movies we see violence as a tool to push the desperation and hopelessness of the main characters.  In Fight Club we see violence as a tool to drive along a bunch of nonsense, possibly the only reason I could see for all of the fights was for the male characters to bring out their pent up Freudian fantasies for violence.  If you want an immature movie where men beat the c**p out of each other for no reason then go ahead, bon appetite.

It took me in and kept me inside it from beginning to end credits.  I was totally spellbound.This movie definitely didn't get the ""Hollywood"" treatment.  It had eye candy that didn't happen at the expense of the plot (like ""Godzilla"") for one thing.  It had great cinematography that kept you glued to the screen. The characters were carefully built up and maintained.  The dialogue was crisp and intriguing; and incredibly it had a narrator that did not get in the way of the movie!There is just not enough good things I can say about this movie.  I am in my 30's, but it seems a lot of people I've talked to 40 or above were not as impressed by it. I am not sure why.Anyway, it also has elements in it that beg for further viewings.  It had a good secret that it kept ""close to it's chest"", but you could see clues for it early on so it didn't just ""appear"" out of nowhere near the end.  I thought the casting was was great too!  I even liked Meatloaf in his role!In closing, I'd like to say that I think it serves as an intriguing voice for this generation lost within the whirlpool of commercialization.",Fight Club

I felt as if I left the room I would miss something, and my eyes were focused on the screen for the duration of the movie.The movie is intense, but it has very sophisticated undertones.  Children, especially teenage boys, may enjoy the movie for the violence, but only the most mature or intelligent will truly comprehend the reasoning behind the fighting.I have to add that I sympathized heavily with our characters.  Being 33 myself, I am a member of that ""forgotten"" generation--the Post-Baby Boomers born during the duration of the Vietnam War.

1880,Qube-4,"Incredible, Introspective, and Perfect.....to say the least",10,12 August 2000,"The reason I absolutely love this movie is because I understood everything the first time. I was totally amazed with this movie. The plot itself was so intriguing, I found myself completely forgetting I had just spent $4.00 on my popcorn. This movie was directed by David Fincher, by far, the undisputed champion of film directing, in my books (other works by him: Seven, The Game, both of which are absolutely brilliant pieces of work)This movie's incredible amount of compression was what really made me love it. It seems as you watch it, that you are being tossed head first into an immense amount of information, flying past you at a thousand miles per hour. And still this movie has a way of making sure you don't miss any of it. The stunning use cinematography completely envelops you. I had the most incredible urge to find David Fincher and ask him how he does this. I just hope that in my future careers in film, I can be as talented and original as him.The cast contains not only an incredibly gifted and talented actor, Edward Norton, but a fantastic performance by Brad Pitt. I truly feel that Brad Pitt is a very underrated actor, who deserves much more then the biased ratings he gets from other critics. If you don't believe me, Seven is, I believe, his best performance in film ever, and that is NOT an insult. After seeing this movie, Edward Norton continues to be one of my favorite actors (among Kevin Spacy and Jack Nicolson).Of course, I can see why others may not like this movie. It is very violent, which has never stopped me from enjoying any movie. Furthermore, it is very thought provoking, which usually scares away most simple people, but keeps me nailed to the seat.As my conclusion, I cannot say anything bad about this movie.

There is not much to enjoy about this movie if you are looking for a simple plot scattered with action and violence.  Fight Club requires thought.  And if you can do that, you are in for a great treat.It is sad that so many people will go into this movie looking for mindless violence, and then come out dissatisfied.  Then they will tell everyone not to see the movie because the story was dumb and it made no sense.

Chuck Palahniuk is able to do much more with the characters than could be adapted on screen.It is also very interesting to notice the tiny liberties Fincher took with the story. A lot of the book didn't make the transition from book to movie, but the Fight Club is one of the greatest adaptations of novels to films, once again proving the futility of the Oscars.Please read the book.

I hope people can see past the violence of the fight scenes to see the terrific theme of the movie.  Every guy can identify with this movie - it's about us, fellas.  We all feel that way in some form.  Everyone should watch this movie twice.  Once for effect, twice for the whole story. The cinematography was as intelligent as the theme.  That's why you need to watch it twice.  You pick up a lot things in the background that you miss the first time because you're so engrossed by the plot.  Pay attention, listen to all the words and enjoy this one.By the way, Meatloaf rocks.",Fight Club
1886,gneee!!!,Very Dark Humor!,10,3 November 2000,"**SPOILERS**When I rented this film I actually thought it was about some underground boxing club run by Brad Pitt and Edward Norton. The trailer didn't help much. The only reason I rented it was because people I know were saying how good it was. And it was getting good reviews by people who don't exactly like Van Damme movies.When I finally did watch it, it just blew me away!!! The scene where ""Jack"" ( or ""the Narrator"") was in his apartment ordering something on the phone and the furniture lined up around him like in IKEA catalogs was brilliant! It even had price-tags and descriptions of the item. And the plot twist in the end was really unexpected. It doesn't really work out though (like in the scene where their driving and Tyler deliberately crashes the car), but who cares anyway.===WARNING: SPOILERS!==> While browsing through the reviews I noticed that someone wrote: ""This film seeks to undermine all the merits of mankind, while embracing decay and destruction."" What??? Were you watching the movie? It's about a guy (Jack)whose life is slipping away, and he unconsciously creates a person(Tyler Durden) that is everything he wants to be. That person hates this society and it's ever-growing commercialism (I do to but I don´t go blowing up buildings!). In the end Tyler is so strong that he starts doing things that Jack would never dream of doing. So, he starts chasing him around trying to stop him, until he figures out that Tyler Durden is actually himself (Brilliant!). And, you know, stuff happens, blah blah blah, until ""Jack"" finally stops Tyler, regains control of his own life, gets the girl, and saves the day (Well, not really).Phew! okay, glad that's over with. So in summation: A great film about how everyone is on the brink of insanity in our modern, commercial, fast food society, and how someone might just deal with it.Oh, and by the way: Anyone who thinks this movie is all about how cool it would be to start your own Fight Club, or make homemade explosives out of soap, really missed the point.",Fight Club
1887,bubbagump47,"Fantastic build up, empty ending",8,5 March 2001,"In terms of pop culture, this might be the edgiest movie I've ever seen widely released.  David Fincher continues his remarkable trend of engrossing movies that delve into what our culture is really like.  The movie begins with the Narrator (Edward Norton) tied up in a building with a bomb.  The majority of the movie explains how Norton came to this situation.  He begins with a flashback, describing his depression., the sense of a lack of something he cannot define.  That all changes when he meets Tyler Durden (Brad Pitt).  Norton begins to feel something when Pitt eggs him on to ""Punch me.""  Eventually they start fighting on a regular basis.  Norton finds that his aggression rids him of the emptiness left by pop culture. The decent into more and more violence continues until Norton utters the chilling line, ""I wanted to destroy something beautiful.""  At this point Fincher has mined the emotional content of the fight club.  Later the club becomes more like an army, as it struggles to fight those companies it disagrees with.  This sets up the climax of the film, ending Norton's flashback.The greatest strength of the film is this build up.  Norton's character begins his narration explaining that he was looking for the perfect bedroom set to give him happiness.  It takes the fight club to show him that his happiness is not dependent on his possessions.  The film explores the insidious nature of companies that sell their wholesomeness as their main product.  It's a lifestyle you are buying, something to help you escape your own existence for a moment.  The fight club goes against all that.  Rather than take on easy targets like corrupt oil firms or banks, ""Fight Club"" attacks those companies America embraces.  And the way ""Fight Club"" shows to fight the effects contains a dark edge.However, at the end, David Fincher tries to bite off too much and ends up with a hollow ending.  The dark humor and pointed insights that occur throughout the film, the edgy look at an oppressive world, all fade at the end of the film.  I don't think I have ever been so disappointed with a film's ending.  He said so much that was so remarkably pointed in the film, but then wrapped up the plot with a completely implausible ending. Because of this flaw, I drop an obvious masterpiece down to a 7.  Above average, but haunted by the terrific letdown that is the end of the film.",Fight Club
1888,jwbowman,Perhaps the worst film ever made...,1,14 October 2000,"Here's the moral of this film:  The way to self-realization is through utter self-debasement, delusion and the destruction of  achievement.This film seeks to undermine all the merits of mankind, while embracing decay and destruction.  This ugly message is portrayed as something noble, and it's sickening to me that an imaginative plot twist at the end is enough to fool the public into thinking this film was 'entertaining'.  Instead, it is amoral, anti-life, and perhaps the worst excuse for art or entertainment I've ever seen.",Fight Club
1889,camiloarenivar,Brilliant Direction and Superb Acting,9,6 December 2001,"Fight Club is a brash slap in the face of consumerism and the working dead. It questions reality. It is strikingly thought provoking and visually stimulating. The direction is incredibly brilliant. Director David Fincher (Aliens, Se7en and The Game) is at his finest here warping both space and time, dropping in things here and there to make things clear. Edward Norton is excellent as Jack, the narrator of the movie. He is a nerdy insomniac who catalog shops at Ikea and has a going nowhere job. Brad Pitt is dynamic as Tyler Durden, an anarchistic man who lives in a run-down abandoned house and makes and sells soap for a living. Helen Bonham Carter is also great as Marla Singer, the manic-depressive chain-smoking woman in both their lives. Her role is critical and she plays it well.There has been some controversy about the violence in this film but it is not gratuitous violence, it is part of the story and serves it well. It is much less than what you would see in your average Hollywood blockbuster. This is actually an insightful film and in many ways similar to American Beauty, although this film is much more in your face about it's message. If you are squeamish, you may not want to see it. There are some very painful bloody scenes, but if you can stomach it, then check it out. There is also a huge twist in this film that almost rivals the twist at the end of The Sixth Sense. And I must admit, it is the twist in this film that made me really love it. The best audience for this film is men in their 20's or 30's, but anyone that can appreciate film as a modern art should like it. One of the best films of 1999.",Fight Club

Then the people who thought the movie was a heap of trash cause it was to preachy or what ever. Well you missed the boat. I can't explain why but the movie is so much more. You people are just scratching the surface of this killer movie. I never once to myself thought ""This would be cool if we really did it."" Or thought about fighting someone.

1893,RavenMX,The First Rule of Fight Club is see this movie.,10,11 March 2001,"Sorry, I just had to do that.  It seems stupid, but hey, the time came and it was right.Right now, I'm claiming that this was the best movie of 1999, even better than American Beauty.  Edward Norton is fantastic as an insomniac who discovers a new form of therapy, known as Fight Club.  Tyler Durden, played by Brad Pitt, is the creator of Fight Club, and soon this new form of therapy erupts into a huge club.  And Helena Bonham Carter is the ""love interest"", though she annoys both Norton's and Pitt's characters.
The drama is never dull and the acting is on the mark.  Director David Fincher (Se7en), who shot many musical projects, mixes this movie well with the very upbeat and techno soundtrack.  What makes this film extremely interesting is the way Fincher blends the music of the film and Fincher's use of visual wizardry.Favorite Quote from the Movie:Tyler Durden: First rule of Fight Club, you do not talk about Fight Club. Second rule of Fight Club, you DO NOT talk about Fight Club. Third rule of Fight Club, when someone say ""stop"" or goes limp, the fight is over. Fourth rule of Fight Club, only two guys to a fight. Fifth rule of Fight Club, one fight at a time. Sixth rule of Fight Club, no shirt, no shoes. Seventh rule of Fight Club, fights go on as long as they have to. Eighth and final rule of Fight Club, if this is your first night at Fight Club, you have to fight.Of course, I had to post the 8 rules of Fight Club.Overall, I gave this movie a 10/10.  This movie rocks, so see it!",Fight Club

1899,imjakswastdlife7,nothing can sum up the greatness of this movie in one line,10,10 February 2001,"okay, lets start it off this way: this movie not only has one of the best plots in movie history, but it also had great writing and awesome fight scenes . . . AWESOME!!!!!!!!!! The movie is based on the life of a man who's looking for something different (Edward Norton) other than his daily job.  his insomnia is making him insane, yet he fights on.  after going to support groups as a tourist for emotional expression and help for sleeping, he meets Marla (Helena Bonham Carter).  Marla is another tourist, but the narrator can no longer enjoy his emotional outlets with her around, thus he loses sleep again.on a plane going home, he meets a man named Tyler Durden (Brad Pitt). they talk for a while until the plane gets to their destination and they go their own ways.  later, he finds his apartment has been blown to bits and decides to call Tyler.  Tyler buys him some beer, and just as they're about to leave, Tyler asks the narrator to hit Tyler as hard as he can.  shortly after, fight club is created, and everyone's perception of the world is changed for me, this movie really changed my life.  i saw things i have never seen before.  Chuck Palahniuk did a great job on the book, and an even better job on the movie.  this is the best movie i have ever seen and i have seen more than half the movies on the top 250 list.  the movie was funny, dramatic and verbally graphic.  if there's one movie you should see, its this.",Fight Club

It's a ""fun"" experience while still having a message about capitalism. It's a movie that's fun and that has a message!David Fincher is one of the best directors working today and Fight Club is my personal favourite of his. This movie could've had been garbage, but Fincher saved it.Brad Pitt as Tyler is just the best. I believe that we all need a Tyler for obvious reasons (not so obvious if you didn't see the movie).I have nothing else to say that hasn't been say countless amounts of time.If you haven't seen Fight Club, what are you doing here wasting your time reading reviews?

1901,clsupersonic,An Analysis of American Modern Society,10,8 October 2021,"Some people think Fight Club is about toxic masculinity. Part of that may be true, but it's more than that. The Narrator is nameless for a reason- because he is the one who represents all of American Male society. Penned up in an office at work with Starbucks in his right hand and a gun in the other pointing to his head, he then goes home to an empty condominium filled with pointless furniture from IKEA. He is bound to modern capitalistic consumerism because the world tells him that it is how to live. It isn't until he meets Tyler that he realizes that a primitive nature is what really makes one happy. Capitalistic consumerism has stripped the narrator of all his primitive senses that he cannot even fall asleep at night unless he can cry. The moral of the story is that consuming more and more of what capitalism has to offer will never truly fulfill. Tyler shows him a way out of this never ending maze of disillusionment with fight club. I would love to talk more about fight club, but we all know rules one and two.",Fight Club

It has really deep themes of manhood and true happiness and violence and what it overall really means to be human and it twists and contorts your views of the life you live and really makes you think deeply about the every day to day life you live.

Money was not wasted here, however much it cost to make.It is a cinematographically excellent movie. Gritty, atmospheric, textured, plain and yet furiously detailed. Watching this film more than once is definitely required, but it's certainly hard to get bored of.Supporting this is the plot, which has depth and originality. Although it can become confusing and is certainly questionable, this does not alter the fact that it is wonderful. It follows the seemingly simple, button-down life of ""The Narrator,"" or JACK as the screenplay states, as it deteriorates into a system of mischief, violence and mayhem. It is concerned with the modern role and social position of men and their relationships with women, but this serious undertone can be ignored. FIGHT CLUB also deals with the connected issue of how the depression and mundane routines of working life can lead (if obscurely) to such a psychotic aversion.Brilliant camera angles, integration of CGI, usage of voice-overs and extremely clean cuts to complement a very able presence of humour, as well as good acting and a simple but intelligent script make this film even better.If you have not seen it and have an open mind for modern cinema, do so.

It has something more than this that you need to experience in first hand.It discusses about a lot of interesting topics like consumerism,nihilism,chaos,denying existentialism, how the modern man is becoming more materialistic than spiritual.Well, if these topics don't appeal to you. You will watch it like a normal movie and even though you will like it because of the mind blowing twists that you'll ever see.If you want to experience this movie to the hardcore level, observe every dialogue and try to understand what does it mean. This is one of the rare cases where the movie elevates the book but not the other way around.Brad Pitt's acting is one the highlights of the movie. No one could have done better than him for this character. Unlike many movies like shutter island,predestination where the twist had made the movie better, this isn't the case here. It is already a way better movie but the twist makes it even better.It's no wonder the movie had developed a massive cult following since its release.

1923,brianshields,An amazing film that breaks many boundaries,10,10 July 2001,"Fight Club is a film I went to see reluctantly in the cinema.  I actually quite enjoy martial arts films done well but out-and-out macho celebrations (Rambo etc) leave me dry. It was only nudges from other people that persuaded me to try it shortly before the end of it's screen run...And how wrong I was. Fight Club is a deep, complicated (the film basically cannot be understood the first time you see it) exploration of alienation and identity of one individual in particular. It is packed with dense, clever dialogue - and a dry, witty narration fills the gaps between the agruments, speackes and face offs. The film runs 2h20m but has more freeze-frame detail than The Simpsons.The real theme of Fight Club is being unhappy in life, and exploring alternatives to an empty existence. The central character (played Edward Norton) both stars and narrates as one such individual, who's life is turned around when he meets the charismatic, assertive soad salesman Tyler Durden (Brad Pitt) who leads him, and others, on a mission to ""hit the bottom"". The first of these is the titualar Fight Club, which is more about giving and (in particular) revieving pain than winning. The narrator's spiral is complemented by the depressive Marla Singer (Helena Bonham-Carter), and the three become entwined in a _very_ complicated relationship.It's hard to talk about the themes in Fight Club without spoiling it, but I would recommend it to anyone capable of absorbing ideas or observations critically (i.e. without big ""this is right/wrong"" signs over it) and the violent scenes, although rare, are realistic (no martial arts/superhero stuff, just knuckes & blood) so the feint harted should stay away.The film will change your life.

This movie will make you think, whether you like it or not, and there is a depth to it that I was completely unprepared for the first time I saw it. A few stunning moments, along with truly profound observations and edge of your seat tension. Both Norton and Pitt play the parts wonderfully, and Norton's double role as narrator works well. Probably not suitable for those easily offended by violence, but otherwise there really is a message in this movie, a strong one that will not go away.

1928,PhilPacker,"Yes, this is Jekyll and Hyde",10,19 April 2018,"I do not hear it discussed too often, but FIGHT CLUB is essentially an adaptation/re-telling of Robert Lous Stevenson's THE STRANGE CASE OF DR. JEKYLL AND MR. HYDE. Yes, there are significant differences, but at it's core, the main points are there.First, the two sides to the character being played by different actors isn't unique, it's what Stevenson intended. He writes Jekyll and Hyde as two different people, both physically and mentally and they approach each other as individuals too. FIGHT CLUB essentially does the same. These are two different people with two different mindsets. The main difference being that Tyler and the narrarator only appear different to each other; physically they are the same to everyone else.Some of the key elements thematically are that both are about breaking free of the societal limitations fo the time. Durden is free of consumersim and capitalistic expectations. Hyde is free of Victorian reservations and norms.Additionally, Hyde/Durden both start off with less of an influence but eventually fight to take over the other personality in its entirety.At it's heart this is a great movie and a great adaptation/interpretion (call it what you will). It gets better with each viewing and reading (the book is even better).",Fight Club

This movie wasn't building any character or atmosphere but what it was building is total BOREDOM.I didn't want to watch this movie till the end but then I thought about the high points that people have given it and some of the reviewers were talking about its great twist ending.

1932,Hykinzer,This film not a beautiful and unique snowflake (spoilers),10,28 November 2002,"This film is ugly.  It really is.  It is hard to watch and is definitely not fun.  That said, it is simply amazing.  The acting is awe inspiring, as is the dialogue.  Technically, it's the best film I've ever seen.  The camera penetrates everywhere, and much more convincingly than in Panic Room. The plot, of course, is magnificent.  Nothing is at seems, yet everything is. Most of the people who will watch Fight Club won't get it, in fact, I'm not sure I get it.  However, what I think I do get is that it's not about how bad material possessions are, but about embracing it.  In the end, the narrator just stops fighting, stops trying ""cure"" his problems and just lets it go.  He has finally got complete freedom, for he has lost all hope, all hope that his life will be ""cured.""  I don't what the intentions of the author were, so I'm probably completely off. The film also works on a completely other level as a man's decent into insanity.  I read a review of the film in which the reviewer said that all the events in the film were all in the narrators head.  There is no Fight Club, it is only a metaphor for the narrator's problems.  The end symbolizes him blowing away any sanity left. As soon as I finish writing this, I'll probably think of other another theory, for thinking about this movie is it's true purpose.",Fight Club
1933,kpahwueitoerey,Men and capitalism,10,17 June 2021,"Bruh how do I start. At first, we see a man that feels that he is nothing, he follows everything that he people say to him, his alone, he isn't charismatic, he doesn't have any personality so he consumes material stuff, he has a boring azz job, he has insomnia and he wants desperately to change his life. At first we see a how does capitalist nature affects the mental health to average people, making the just some sheeps of this system. Everything in capitalism is arranged to happen how they want to. The narrator doesn't only feels like a nobody as a person, he is no man. When he enters to support groups he feels good with himself and he also feels good in general, and he doesn't by stuff every 30 sec also. Now we see a solution for everyone, mutual support and our own essence is the best way to help each other. But Marla appears. At first we see that the narrator is pretty fragile when he noticed Marla's lie. But he is fragile because he is afraid to be hamulated than lost the support groups. So when they talk there was something going on and the exchanged there numbers. This means that men are scared of woman in our modern society. When we see Tyler for first time his the perfect modern masculine model, and the narrator wants to be a man, he is a friend of Tyler now. At the first half of the movie wee see how they work together, meaning that our masculinity can be our best friends and best weapon at the same time. But when they want to relief there stress, they go to the fight club. Outside the fight club, we see how the narrator turned into a more violent man. This shows how man always want to be masculine at a point that we are slowly destroying or environment. The narrator doesn't consume material things anymore, in fact, he doesn't even live in a decent house. Man can live by their own. In the second part of the movie, Tyler doesn't inform of chaos project to the narrator and he is controlling the whole social circle of the narrator (including Marla). This shows that our masculinity can turn against us, trying to throw up our real person (the narrator). The Tyler wants to get rid of Marla, because if she gives attention to the narrator Tyler is gone. Tyler at this point is only toxic masculinity that only knows how to have s e x and not to love a woman. The narrator still feels alone and incomplete, so if he starts something with Marla, Tyler is gone. When the chaos project id finally executed, the economy of the city is gone and now the narrator only can see how he f ucked it up. In men psychology, were they are railed, controlled and mad with something, this causes destructive behavior. But now how is the city going to be stable? This means that the solution isn't destruction or the elimination of capitalism. And how we see through the movie, our masculinity can be our best friend and our worst enemy. And capitalism can be bad and not that bad. This is literally peak fiction lol.",Fight Club

She embraces the strange as normal and rejects the comfortable and pretty as the aberrations.

1943,chadwc,"Very Good, But Just Very Good",10,8 April 2007,"Of course Fight Club has it's fantastic plot, acting, directing and most importantly the stunning visual direction. David Fincher has pulled a cat out of the bag in the case of originality, Ed Norton and Brad Pitt are perfect as the two main characters. BUT the plot is sometimes over-shadowed by the film's bloody and graphic violence. Especially the OTT beating of Angel Face, the punching of the face goes on for too long and is drawn out. And also other scenes that sometimes show the highly exaggerated injuries and fake blood.

It's about anarchy, disorder, and, yes, even soap. The movie works on so many levels. There isn't a second in this movie where I was bored. Some movies have weak spots or a scene that takes away from the film. Fight club doesn't suffer from that. Every character, every line of dialogue, and every scene in the movie is so interesting and clever. The performances are awesome, David Fincher does an amazing job as well (can't wait for his next).

This film does have a few weak points but there's not enough to really bring up on.

1946,saxman429,Worthless,8,30 June 2002,"I had heard from several people that I should see Fight Club before I reluctantly rented it (I've never been terribly impressed with David Fincher's work).  After having finally watched it, I have no idea what they were thinking.  Stylistically it was nothing special--for some reason people are impressed by that yellowish tint Fincher seems to love (as seen in The Game).  This doesn't do anything special in my opinion--all it signifies to me is that the director wears yellow tinted sunglasses a bit too often. Some of the cinematography was fairly intricate, but nothing that added up to ""brilliant"" in any way (as many other reviewers seem to think).  I'm sure it's not difficult to get good looking shots on a budget of $63 million. In terms of content, Fincher really says nothing of consequence.  Who is he to comment on the working class?  Does he really find humor in people suffering from cancer?  He shows such a bleak, inaccurate view of the life that most people in this country lead and I really don't see the point--is Fincher trying to say that anyone who works 9-5 in order to make a nice home and to support themselves/their families is misguided?  Is it hard to see that people are much more complex than any of the characters in this movie? In order to ""really live"", should we all pour acid on our hands, crash our cars, and beat each other into a bloody pulp?  Does Fincher think he's making an intelligent political statement?  This lack of insight can be expected from someone whose toughest decision is figuring out which luxury car he feels like driving to the studio in the morning.  The only people I can imagine this movie would appeal to are male teenagers/college students with maxed out credit cards who think they know something about film because they've seen Reservoir Dogs.  I'm not going to give away the movie, but as many others have noted it has a trick ending that changes the meaning of the rest of the story.  This is not unlike what Fincher did in The Game. Personally I find this to be a cheap tactic used in order to get people to see the movie a second time (i.e. The Sixth Sense, The Usual Suspects), and doesn't make for art or even intelligent entertainment.  Fincher should stick to movies like The Game which, while not really that good, don't pretend to be much more than they are--cheap entertainment.  I normally don't care at all when a bad film or lousy director make it big--it happens all the time--but it's unbelievable to me that so many people comment on the artistic value of this movie.  I'm not really going to complain about the placement of it on the imdb top 250 (because it doesn't matter and there are even worse movies high up on the list), but just take a look at some of the films below this one.  There are so many great things to see out there--don't waste your time on this",Fight Club

""Fight Club"" is a work of art which must be seen at least three times to even begin to comprehend. The idea is a simple one and it belongs to the great Chuck Palahniuk. It's not the complexity of it that makes both Palahniuk's book and the movie based on it a must-read and a must-see. It's the way it's presented and the characters that present it. ""Fight Club"" isn't going to make you cry. You're not going to find it extremely funny either although it has it's moments. It throws some level of violence at the audience but if that's what you're looking for when you go to see this movie it will disappoint you. The directing, acting, cinematography and score are undeniably flawless but even they are not what makes this movie a masterpiece. The shining gem of this magnificent picture lies within the dual character of Edward Norton and Brad Pitt which combines and puts in opposition a ""normal guy"" and a true modern-day philosopher. The concepts of overpopulation and overconsumption are very familiar to everyone but nothing has ever made me question the ""progress"" of human society from it's very birth to our present day as this movie has. ""Fight Club"" aims to lift the shroud that we have put before our eyes, to pop the bubble of our comfort and remind us that what we use and consume in our every-day life is way over our necessities. And in this task the movie succeeds undoubtedly using rather shocking methods which I hope every serious viewer will not fail to notice.",Fight Club

If you need some sort of extra sign (like the ever more apparent 'contains strong fantasy violence'etc warnings that are appearing on every film then you can just forget about this.

Along with Goodfellas and Pulp Fiction (Rules Of Attraction not far behind) this is the best film of our lifetime (twentysomethings) I have no apology for saying that if you don't like/understand this film then you're clearly less intelligent or don't understand film or cinema.

1951,alexander-236,"Hello, teenage America!",6,10 February 2008,"Fight club is now a long time classic, and I have just watched a HDTV copy that came around. At the end of the day the movie scores slightly better than 'mediocre' on my personal hype-o-meter, primarily because of the innovative approach and the visual hallucinogenic reality distortion techniques which were sort of avant guard at the time(kinda reminiscent of Jacob's Ladder which is, I believe, older). I am positive it's a movie which will continue to mesmerize teenagers worldwide for years to come, for it's a 'Hello, teenage America!' movie down to the very last cell of its bone marrow. Sadly, it utterly fails to define a counter-culture of it own (or in fact any kind of innovative sub-culture anyway). The movie starts with setting a foothold of (pseudo)solid philosophy, and builds on superb acting and character development towards an enchanting rhetoric of denial, cultural reaction, and violent action. As you will probably gather from the other reviews, the main motifs gravitate around denial of society (as a whole and as individual actors), mainstream social values and aspirations, and, well, material possessions in a purely anarchistic, nihilistic manner, rooted in violence, puke, sex, drugs and total aggression. Oh, did I mention the overall psychedelic psychopath-ism ambiance, and the grand finale 9/11 march to urban destruction, and the penis frame? By now you probably have the idea... what else... Generally acting is top notch, and overall, it's a good movie to rent, but if you expect a life-changing, eye-opening experience, you're better off looking for the 'truth' elsewhere. For all of you new to the scene, constructive rebels out there I'd recommend Nietzsche and KMFDM instead, for Fight Club is a good watch, but it's Google-generation stuff a with a short expiry date.

This movie in no way condones the actions of Tyler Durden or Preoject Mayhem, but does a good job of sucking the viewer in, and wishing he were in on the fun.  In doing this, Fincher has proven to us how easily a charismatic leader can rally the downtrodden into performing whatever insane tasks he wishes.  Durden is not meant to be a hero, but he is, as said towards the end, the culmination of everything the narrator wished he was. He was a fantasy gone wrong, a beast with some decent ideas that went far overboard and turned him into what he was fighting against.  The audience is supposed to see how easy it is for one to be pulled into some lunatic's vision of perfection.  Think Hitler. And on top of all of that, the movie is just so damned well made.

The actors are clearly leading up to a climax which was predictable, had you seen more movies of this thriller/drama/action genre. If you want a brilliant ending, watch Primal Fear (Norton excellent), if you want a suave and well written script watch Chasing Amy and for an action movie with brutal fight scenes Raging Bull.

I've read the novel at least a dozen times and I am still in awe of what Chuck Palahniuk has created. Turning it into a film was undoubtedly a difficult task - two main characters being the same character. Yet, David Fincher and team pull it off wonderfully. Beyond the memorable characters, casted perfectly, this film (and the novel) is a critique of white-collar society. And it is a damn good one.I've written about half a dozen essays on the human condition and Fight Club has been referenced in pretty much all of them. Tyler Durden. Tyler Durden. ""In Tyler we Trust."" Admittedly, Brad Pitt does not make my list of favourite actors. He barely even comes close. However, I must say that Fight Club would not have been the same without him. He portrayed bad-ass Tyler with precision. Edward Norton? Well, he is my favourite actor, so I should be biased to say he was my favourite part of the film. But I'm not. My favourite part of the film? The entire thing. Everyone was feeding off of everyone else. To me, it looked as though everyone truly believed what they were saying. It makes me think that Project Mayhem could one day exist and could be run by Brad Pitt...or Edward Norton...depending what time of day you catch him...or them. Okay, enough of that. I can honestly say that Fight Club is one of the only movies I have ever seen in which I have nothing to complain about.

1958,bexx,Black comedy at its finest.,9,13 August 2003,"I find many 'narrated' films rather irritating, but this was superb and *really* entertaining. The initial situation, involving Edward Norton's character and the way he meets the slightly odd Marla (Helena Bonham Carter) is hilarious. The arrival in his life of the mysterious and manipulative Tyler Durden (Brad Pitt) is a roller-coaster of fascination, disbelief and horror; Norton's narrator is utterly seduced by the hypnotic Durden and his testosterone fuelled Bolshevism, climaxing in a fabulous twist and a spectacularly audacious final scene.The performances? Brad Pitt (Tyler Durden). I'll be so glad when I stop seeing ""Hey, Brad Pitt can really act!"" comments. Yes, he's beautiful, but that doesn't preclude his being good at his job. He is superb here; perfect casting of a exceptional actor giving an amazing performance. Doubters; stop thinking 'It's Brad Pitt' and just watch. Helena Bonham Carter is warm and very watchable as the neurotic, chain-smoking Marla Singer. Sadly, her character is reduced to 'flounce in, pout, flounce out' for most of the film. Edward Norton (The Narrator) gives a good, solid turn as the disoriented insomniac, but for reasons I find hard to define, the performance doesn't get out of the monochrome for me.

1960,dog_lover_twelve,Hit Me,9,17 February 2012,"David Fincher's 1999 adaptation of Chuck Palahniuk's novel, ""Fight Club"" is visceral, like a punch in the the chest. It is unapologetic, gritty, subversive, and at times blatantly sexual.And it's funny. It is a story about what happens when a movement that promises freedom becomes more constricting then confirmatory society ever was. Think 'Animal Farm' with abnormal psychology and bloody, bone-crunching fistfights.The unnamed anti-hero of this film, Narrator (Edward Norton,) is a disturbed office worker who can't sleep at night. His insomnia presents reality as some kind of waking dream. Well, he doesn't look as bad a Christian Bale in ""The Machinist,"" bu he's still pretty rough in appearance, and he can barely work up enough enthusiasm to go to work in the morning.Because he works repossessing unsafe cars after fatal accidents, he gets to travel a lot, but his life remains at a virtual standstill. All this changes when he meets Tyler Durden (Brad Pitt,) a nihilist rebel who believes humanity should be reduced to it's most primal state.After Narrator's apartment blows up under suspicious circumstances, he goes to live in Tyler Durden's home, which must of been a beautiful house at one time but is now repellent in it's decay and inefficiency.Soon, Tyler and his new house-guest start a Fight Club, which temporarily releases men's feelings of inadequacy minus a few teeth, and might seem like a great idea if you're into boxing and WWE.Add the Borderlinish, suicidal Marla Singer and the men's own twisted psyches, and you've got a recipe for disaster. The first thing that strikes me about this film is the overwhelming loneliness. Narrator is a cynic, so much so that he alienates himself and everyone around him.""How could Tyler thing it was a bad thing that Marla Singer was about to die?"" he muses when Marla swallows a bottle of Xanax and invites Tyler over for a night of lovemaking.In my 'Favorite Characters"" description of Edward Norton's character, I said this- 'like Chuck Palahniuk's character Victor Mancini, the sex addict at the center of the book and film ""Choke,"" 'Narrator' pretends to hold the human race in contempt, but at the same time cries out in pitiful loneliness, ""love me, love me, love me!!"" I think us cynics can relate.' I think this is pretty accurate.Although his character is dark-dark, I cannot help but sympathize with his urge to make things right after he finds out the truth about Tyler. This is not a film for everyone. The violence comes in droves, and no character presents themselves as noble. Furthermore, it is not really a realistic presentation of it content, and is more stylish than literal in it's subject matter.But it makes you think while it entertains you, and I cannot really find any movie to compare it to. It is utterly original. Note- This film is a work of fiction and any decision to partake in an actual Fight Club would be utter stupidity.",Fight Club
1961,kinito69,Most Overrated Movie Ever,3,14 April 2006,"I just recently saw fight club and I must say I think that it is one of the most overrated movies I have ever seen. (Actually, second because crash is the most overrated, how did that win best picture) All of my friends talked about how good it was but I always stayed away from this movie. I did enjoy the fight scenes and in the beginning, I was captivated by the plot. Things soon begin to come apart. It was really good until it dipped into the terrorism theme. All of a sudden the movie switched gears and never recovered. Does this really deserve to be in top 50? I don't think so. Brad Pitt was good. Edward was good but this was not their best. What do you think?",Fight Club
1962,gothicsoldier,"Genious, sardonic, comedic, and ironic.",9,1 June 2003,"I found Fight Club to be, in my opinion, the best movie ever.
The antisocial ideals and thoughts seem to be perfectly astute for our times.This movie displays the truthes that face our society. Our lives have become opressed and isolated because public concern and political correctness. A lack of modern gumption that drives all of the old fashioned American dreams into lazy, indifferent, aloof lives that seem subordinate compared to what they could be.Meanwhile, sterile living and corporate intervention cause us to be materialistic, and bland. We get all these things without going out and doing much; just putting some paperwork in order to get a paycheck. Any physical work would be done only in a small job. There is no manly or feminine work anymore. The world has become neutered.This film's intention is to alienate this fact and hope to get a message across for it.Fight Club was a genious, antisocial, wonderful film. It deserves to be number one on the top two-hundred fifty.",Fight Club
1963,croberton,This film is one of the best of 1999 and of the films on the top 250.,10,22 August 2012,"I hadn't seen Fight Club when it was released in 1999. I discovered the film many years subsequent to its release. I originally watched the film for the first time on late night TV. There are many clues in the film as to what is actually happening, but whether someone picks up on them or not on the first viewing is another thing altogether. For myself, I did not catch the many underlying clues the first time but the majority of viewers don't and won't no matter how clever you are. This film was brilliantly assembled with the dialogue, vernacular, and visual style. Fight Club has a non stop pace in its 2 hour and twenty minute running time. The Sixth Sense, Go, Election, Memento, and Election are similar in the sense that they all replay scenes that clarify the real meaning of the film or key scenes/information for each viewer. All of these films are very rewarding in that respect because each of these films enighten the viewer instead of frustrating them with a feeling of insipid, senseless visuals and dialogue that leaves no lasting memorable experience. All of the actors portrayals in Fight Club are exceptional even the supporting actors comprised of David Fincher usuals for those who have seen his other various other films in the 90's. The narrative in the film is intricately layed out so that even if you believe you have the full picture on film you don't until you've seen the entire film. Go features disparate characters who are connected and who intersect through one anothers lives through a drug deal gone awry and a rave party. The Sixth Sense features Bruce Willis as a child psychologist who has an intense meeting with a former patient of his at the beginning of the film and from there on set his goals on aiding an adolescent who has similar cerebral disorders as the patient who he failed to assist who broke into his home. Election features Reese Witherspoon as an overachieiving high school student who is attempting to win the presidency at carver high. Matthew Broderick plays a teacher who intevenes against her quest as president and enlists the aid of another student who is a jock to thwart her possibility of becoming the next school president. He basically is envious of her capabilities and that is why he alters the election scenario. In memento, Guy Pierce is trying to locate his wife's killer with clues that he has tattoed on himself and notes that he writes himself because his memory fades after a few minutes. The film is shown backwards and makes the audience feel as confused as Leonard(Guy Pierce) does. The film is shown backwards because Leonard's mind is backwards. The technique of showing a film like this is fascinating and unique. This film is the only film to utilize this technique setting the film apart from any other film.1999 and 2000 for the prevalent years of the psychological film. The films that I've seen from those two years up to this day include The Matrix, The Sixth Sense, American Beauty, The Gift, Election, The Talented Mr. Ripley, Dogma, Memento, Snatch, American Psycho, Requiem For A Dream, Charlie's Angels, The Cell, Go, Final Destination, Cruel Intentions, Traffic, Sleepy Hollow, Stir Of Echoes, The Ninth Gate, and Analyze This. That is the full amount of films I can recall from those years that were linked in the style and overall impression that they left audiences with. I grew up with these films, I was 10-11 when I saw most of these films and the quality of these films is in no comparison to the inferior quality of the films produced today.",Fight Club
1964,ceruleanblue61,My favorite movie of all time,10,21 July 2009,"this movie was awesome! it was well done, exciting, hilarious, and it seemed to be very relevant to my life. the cast was great and their acting was superb. this is my favorite movie of all times, the meter stick against which all other movies have fallen very, very short.To all the haters out there, aka film students and snobs, nothing will be as good as that which your professors told you was good. yes, i know, David lynch is the man blah blah blah. you film students rag on such great movies without making anything yourself. all we've been getting is garbage recently. why don't all you film students get together and make the epic film that you demand everyone else do?",Fight Club
1965,Turkus03,Not for the faint of mind,9,31 January 2003,"Fight Club, unfortunately, is a movie that requires reasonable intellect to understand.  To say that this movie is about violence is insanely unfounded and unresearched.  To get into the nitty gritty of Fight Club, you really have to study the words and the messages in the movie carefully. Obviously, not much can be said considering the ending of the film, but many things can be reasonably discussed.This movie, while on the surface is about a shallow excuse to fight, is about the destruction (in the author's view) of men.  Bob is actually a central character in the movie as he sums up EVERYTHING that men have become in today's society...women.  Men need to cook, clean, and do things that were widely considered female tasks centuries before.  But men, by their nature, are hunters and gatherers...warriors.  This movie tries to say that men are being turned away from being warriors.  Men are no longer men, they are no longer individuals but part of a larger, more feminine, mold.  Bob is the epitome of this (thus the reason for Bob's resolution in the film, it matches the director's feelings towards this subjectification of men) ideal man...a body builder who has the societal joys of life only to have the world turn him upside down...as he has basically become a woman.Fight Club nails home several messages that most movies and novels never get out the door with.  Anti-society, anti-big business, and pro-communism...all of which go to the author's view of men as an enslaved perpetual being rather than a multitude of individuals.The violence is the return of man to his most raw of forms, and Tyler Durden is the epitome of what every man wishes they could be.  Fincher also makes an unbelievable amount of hints towards the film's 180 conclusion and causes second, third, fourth, and often times TENTH re-views.  Excellent movie that is for ""the enlightened"" and not to be taken as a straightforward vehicle for Brad Pitt and some violence.",Fight Club
1966,roxanacalu,A must see!,10,26 January 2010,"Changes perspective, gets you out of routine mechanisms, makes you think and interpret! Brilliant! You don't waist time watching, it is not for entertainment purpose kind of movie. I put it on the classics movies, ones that you'll keep close to re-view it. The atmosphere and dark humor are spicing well this movie and of course the acting is strong. After I saw it I was ""wow"" and I had to tell my friends: I just saw an incredible movie : Fight Club! I mention that I have seen it about 1 year ago even if it's made in 1999. I did not know the subject before watching (I prefer that when I see a movie, in order to be surprised 100% if possible. A must see by anyone, no matter preferences in movie area.

1967,IaMboRED000,Its uniqueness is what makes its perfection.,10,7 March 2010,"Fight Club is about a man suffering from insomnia, who meets a soap salesman named Tyler Durden. Tyler brings him to his house and helps the man reshape his life one little bit at a time. No doubt one of the best movie of the century (and perhaps the next few centuries). There is no other movie like this one. The twist at the end is utterly mindblowing. The acting is fantastic. I honestly cannot stop watching this movie. I have memorized this entire movie line-after-line, and it's the only movie that I have acted in such a way. The soundtrack is traumatizing, as it matches every scene and is catchy as HELL. I know it's an old movie, but if you have not seen this movie yet, either buy it or downloaded it. Do whatever you can to read it. YOU WILL NOT BE DISAPPOINTED!!!",Fight Club

1969,guyatbar-4,This is a movie that you must watch more then once,9,30 March 2010,"This film can be either a persons favorite film, or they hate it and will hate anyone who gives it the slightest thumbs up. Whatever group that you fit into, you will at least agree that it is a movie that has created a whole new type of genre. The cast is led by the mysterious Tyler Durden (played by the always brilliant Brad Pitt), this characters back story is never fully explained. It is a physiological thriller throughout the whole film. I will tell you two watch this twice, not because of the start or the middle, but for the end. The first time you see this you will no doubt be shaking your head and saying ""What just happened?"" The second time that you sit down and watch this, you will notice a lot of little signs, giving hints to what is going to happen at the end. I would personally think that nearly everyone would simply over look these small easily missed details, but the second time around, keep a look out for them.Fight Club (the title) gives away only part of the film, but what the title does give away is the most brutal part of the film. Some of the fight scenes, without giving the movie away, are brutal. This is not a film that anyone under the age of fifteen should be watching. This is mainly because of the ending. I'm sure kids who watched it these days would laugh at the fight scenes, because they've grown up watching CGI fight scenes.I really believe that, whether you love the movie or hate it, you should definitely watch it. It is not a movie that is easily forgotten.",Fight Club

I think whatever I wanted to see at the time was sold out, so my dad took me to see this. I knew nothing about it other than the fact that it was about a bunch of guys boxing/fighting, or so I thought. It's purely a psychological analysis and one that David Fincher captured so perfectly. I mean it's one of those films that you watch over and over....I watch it to this day and I catch something new every time.From the ""psychological imprint"" flashes of Tyler Durden before his main introduction and much more, Fincher took Plahnuk's (I hope that's the right spelling) novel and made it into a masterpiece of a film. It's no wonder it's a cult classic.",Fight Club

1972,cp_nelson17,Fight Club,10,24 October 2010,"Going into Fight Club for the first time, everyone is expecting a film about, well, fighting. They're expecting Rocky or Never Back Down. Something along those lines. The truth is, of all the various plot lines in Fight Club, the fighting portion is probably the most brief. Fight Club is about fighting, but not physically. It is about fighting against society. What people tell you to do. Who they tell you to be. What to eat. How to sleep. Where to go. These are all things society tells us. Fight Club strikes a place in my heart with these ideas. I understand, and I agree. Fight Club is the most relate-able film I have ever watched, and will always be one of my favorites. David Fincher is quite possibly the most talented director of his time, and it definitely shows with Fight Club. The cast is also astounding. Every casting choice was spot-on in my opinion, especially Edward Norton's. I can't imagine anyone else playing that part. Of course the twist-ending shocked me, and also rewards repeat viewings, as you can find clues throughout the rest of the film. Over all Fight Club is and will always be one of my favorite films, and will get slightly better with each viewing.""I want you to hit me as hard as you can.""",Fight Club

1974,lewis-926-319163,Timeless Classic,10,29 April 2015,"When Fight Club was released, the over-emphasis on fighting and action that I saw in the trailer did little to make me want to watch the film. It was only upon heavy recommendation from friends that I checked it out. After viewing the movie the first time, it was clear to me that, not only was it grossly misrepresented by the trailer, but this was a very special film.David Fincher's directing run thus far has proved to be a very unique, and gritty one. I am a fan of a lot of his work, but not all of his pictures; Seven being another one of my favorites.Now that I've seen this movie countless times, and can quote it with ease, it is a no brainer for me to recommend Fight Club to the masses. Sure, it won't be everyone's cup of tea, but the amazing social commentary and just plain entertaining grit of this film is unmatched by many.Watch this film, watch it again, watch it with friends, and let the message and awe of this film entertain you like it has me many, many times.",Fight Club
1975,xtygerlillix,My Favourite Movie is Called Fight Club,10,18 January 2011,"""It's only after you've lost everything that you're free to do anything""I'm really adamant about this. Fight Club is my favourite movie of all time. The main point of this review is to get people to watch this film that has such deeper meaning than the title suggests.Consumerism has enslaved the modern man to 9 to 5 weekdays. That's the basic message, but what makes this film great is that after watching it time and time again, the message becomes more complex and well drawn out. In a way it's harder to put into words than the first time I ever saw it, because whether or not we are to agree with Tyler's point of view, or agree with how far he takes it, is really up in the air.It's not hard to imagine that a 9 to 5 office job running reports for a major car company's failure rates would cause insomnia when paired with the modern bachelor lifestyle. What's the point in having a fine line between waking and sleeping when your whole life is spent in a stupor? Our protagonist, Rupert/Cornelius/Travis/Jack (his real name is never given) is looking to change his life, to re-define himself, and he's not a healthy person to begin with. His mental illness is evident not only in his insomnia but in his droning narration, his cynicism, and his addiction to self-help groups. Attending groups for testicular cancer, tuberculosis, blood parasites, you name it, helps Jack feel like someone is actually listening to him (because they think he's dying), helps him cry, and ultimately helps him sleep at night. Until he finds something else, something better, that addresses the problem directly.Jack meets Tyler Durden - a man who lives a fulfilling and meaningful life far, far outside of the rules of society. He lives in squalor and filth, not as a result of poverty, but as the result of having rejected the materialist lifestyle of the young American worker. He knows what he wants out of life, he has a plan, and this makes Jack admire him to the point of exaltation. Jack and Tyler begin the fight club, a kind of therapy for the middle-class working bachelor who has no meaning in his life, but it ends up going farther than Jack ever imagined. This is Jack's first mistake, and a road to a very dark place. Much of the movie's message really hinges on whether or not he wants to be there in the end.---Spoilers ahead---Another Sunday spent movie watching. I've seen this film about a dozen times, and it gets better and better with each re-watch. This time I was left questioning Jack's final feelings on the actions of Project Mayhem. In the final scene it seems to be really left up to us to decide whether Tyler managed to free Jack from his chains, or whether we are to believe that Tyler went too far. Or do we get a combination of their two extreme viewpoints. Does freedom require violent rebellion?Jack doesn't seem too concerned that he has blown up all of the major credit-card company's headquarters. His final struggle was to overcome Tyler's control over his life and retain his sanity. Watching the skyscrapers plunge to the ground, accompanied by the soulful vocals of ""Where is my Mind"" by The Pixies, I'm personally filled with a sense of peace and acceptance. ""Let the chips fall where they may,"" as Tyler said. Jack fought against Tyler's incredibly dramatic strike for economic equilibrium, but now that it has happened and there is nothing we can do about it, we may as well enjoy the outcome. I think this is the best I can do to put the message into words. We're not struggling against our own rebellion any more. It's happened and we're enjoying the ride.",Fight Club

I am going to warn you right now that if, like me, you were hoping to learn about soap by watching this movie you will be sorely disappointed. Their house was totally dirty and had bad electricity. There was one point in this movie when I sat on the remote and accidentally changed the channel to ""the real housewives of new jersey"" and I didn't even notice! It's basically the same premise.

1979,c-carolinebeat,Alternative story,9,6 October 2013,"This film impressed me because it is not the typical story you find in books or movies. I'm a fan of black humor and it is quite funny how the characters laugh at themselves, at their lives and problems, and I think even moral fags will laugh on this and will be surprised. Also I found interesting the way the story develops, which has an alternative end that one doesn't expect to happen at all, but if one pays enough attention, there are a pair of details that suggests how it might end. It is a movie that makes you think about your own life, about scary things that happen around you and you don't even notice it. So it is not actually so far from reality.

1980,DoubleADolby,A Film With A Purpose,9,30 May 2004,"Fight Club is quite simply one of most thought-provoking and strange films I have ever seen and because of this I just love it and rightly belongs to be this high in the top 250. The main reason it's that good is that it tells us that even if you are in a total dead end in life and decide to turn it around it doesn't mean things will get better if fact it gets worse in this film.The plot is like this our narrator (played by Edward Norton), but I think his name is Jack, is board out of his brains, with his job and life. So he takes very strange actions to make his life more bearable, in which it reaches a point that his condo blows up. Before this happens he meets Tyler Durden (played brilliantly by Brad Pitt and in my mind his greatest performance so far), who has the most twisted takes on life and values like for example there's a line that goes ""Self-improvement is masturbation, self destruction is everything.""One great scene is when Tyler gives us the rules of fight club for the first time and I bet that scene will be replayed for years to come.As the loss of blood rises and the line of realty gets more blurred, things get more interesting when Marla Singer comes along (played by Helena Bonham Carter) and when you see her on one level you want to spit in her face, but on another level you feel rather aroused by her at the same time.Finally I will say this just watch this film, because it will change your look on life in the most strange way and it also had one of the greatest plot twists ever and trust me you will be blown away by it.WATCH IT!!!!!!!!!",Fight Club

Don't miss the alternative (subliminal) FBI warning by Durden when the DVD starts ;) Anyways, I don't want to give too many details and ruin the appetite of those who haven't seen this master piece.What makes this movie so amazing is the story ofcourse. It's based on Chuck Palahniuk's novel. and it's about... well... Our controlled way of life, searching satisfaction in materialistic things, Money, loneliness, NO SEX, NO SATISFACTION, ShXXty daily Jobs, getting stock in a small apartment filled with things from an Ikea catalogue, SEX but no happiness, No Money, No Home etc. etc. There are zillions of things that we are wasting our lives on, are these really important for us? Do we really need all the things that we buy? things... things... the things that make us angry...  the things that we hate... the things that we want... the people that we envy... the people that we wanna be... the things that make us SICK to the stomache... the people that makes us angry, the people that we hate... But there's SOMEONE THAT WE ALL HATE MOST... Do you know who that is? Well, this movie not only answers that, but it also slaps you right in the face with that answer...
David Fincher did an excellent job directing it. Ed Norton became one of my favorite actors after I've seen his acting in this movie (I've probably seen all of his movies after this one). He's simply amazing... Brad Pitt also proves that he's a great actor, not just a baby face sex symbol.Helena Bonham Carter... well, I can't imagine Fight Club without her, or any other actress playing her role...BUF Compagnie (Paris, FR), Blue Sky Studios (New York, US) and Digital Domain (CA, US) created the CG and Special Effects Art work in Fight Club. Yes these 3 great, award winning companies worked together in this movie. And their amazing art work is what makes the Fight Club so visually pleasing and rich... The famous Ikea scene is fantastic, but there's even more... since the CG work is perfectly blended in, you need to pay more attention to realize that there's actually lot of CG work in this movie -perhaps you may have to watch the movie couple times ;)-.Don't miss this movie...",Fight Club

At times, the movie was way over the top of exaggeration but in the end everything falls in place. The movie was fast tracked at many places and many sequences were skipped that were present in the previous version. The sequences were copied very much to the exactness of the situation and it was a good effort to bring back the charisma that a personality like Tyler Durden should have. One more special thing about this movie is its climax, which was not at all stereotype. Hollywood movies is brilliantly done.

If people don't have outlets for their anger they are going to turn to something that is very destructive. Anyway, the point is, the beginning of the movie was interesting and exciting with the new fight club. Then it seemed the movie went off on a tangent with the beginning of Tyler's army of anarchists.

1987,FightClub4995,OK...... this is simply the best movie ever made.,10,31 January 2005,"Simply put, this is the best movie ever. First off, lets talk about the acting. Edward Norton gives a great performance along with Brad Pitt. There was not ONE flaw in the acting of this movie. The writing in this movie is some of the greatest, taking great quotes from the book. I can't believe Fincher has not done that many movies, this is the best directing I have ever seen. The Overall style of this movie is really original. This movie will be a love it or hate it type movie. I think if you are the American Beauty/Pulp Fiction type then you may like this movie. If you hat dark/violent movies then this is not the movie for you. So give it a try, the ending is worth it! 10/10",Fight Club
1988,Chaa_Srinivaas,Post-modern film,10,1 September 2015,"A masterpiece for post-modern films. A Brilliant screenplay with a stunning performances makes an ultra modern film in 90's. I seriously assure those who didn't watched this flick missed some of life lessons which will help to understand their life. You can spare your two hours time for this flick without any hesitation. Chuck Palahniuk's novel based film. Basically the author of this novel is an post modern thinker too. In my opinion, it's the best film in David Fincher film career. i came to know there is controversy about the violence in the movie. But, comparing to recent flicks its far away from strong violence content. Brad Pitt and Edward Norton gave their ultimate performances.",Fight Club
1989,rustydhero2,AMAZINGNESS INCARNATE!,10,10 November 2004,"If this movie were any better, it would be fit for only God himself to see... From the amazing cinematography and effects to the acting which is so good, our English language lacks words to describe it. Brad Pitt plays the perfect badass, while Ed Norton is the more quiet reserved type, until he meets Tyler and gradually ""becomes what Tyler wants him to."" Helena Bonham Carter plays the part of Marla perfectly. On top of all this there's an intricate story, and tons of tiny details scattered throughout the movie. If you freeze frame through the 'Overview of destruction' in the beginning, you can see into each and every office and apartment on the way between explosives. There's EVEN A JANITOR WORKING IN ONE OF THEM!Overall, the movie kicks major butt!",Fight Club
1990,danguer,I can just say: Amazing,10,24 October 2005,"OK, I've seen this movie a couple of days before. It reflects the man condition since a view between platonic and real. The friendship, the needed to get out the adrenaline through a street fight where no one will be a winner, just to be you.The performance are genius, all the characters go through a half-dream and a half-real. The history is well driven, from a bore way to view the life, to the most exotic change of life. Also is the most amazing final I ever seen.""I'm sorry... you met me at a very strange time in my life."", you will remember that and other phrases from this movie.",Fight Club
1991,TaylorWCE14,Life-changing experience,9,18 January 2005,"Fight Club is an example of a movie that was completely dismissed by most critics, but hailed by everyone else. For me this movie has changed the way I view the world, so I guess watching it was a life-changing experience. The first time, I watched I wondered what had happened. What did I just see? The second time around, the idea that materialism and consumerism were taking over people's lives and causing impaired judgment just blew me away. I began to think in Fight Club terms. ""...an entire generation pumping gas, waiting tables; slaves with white collars. Advertising has us chasing cars and clothes, working jobs we hate so we can buy stuff we don't need. We're the middle children of history. No purpose or place. We have no Great War. No Great Depression. Our Great War is a spiritual war... our Great Depression is our lives. We've all been raised on television to believe that one day we'd all be millionaires, and movie gods, and rock stars. But we're not. And we're slowly learning that fact. And we're very, very p***ed off."" That speech changed my life. It did more for me than any speech about coming together for the cause of peace ever did (which by the way, I totally believe in). Fight Club could be the movie of an entire generation of guys in their thirties who are dissatisfied with life. Self-destruction and destruction of government property is a bit over-the-top, but in this movie, it was a way to cope with all the lies fed to us about how one day we will all grow into beautiful swans. There's a difference between wanting to destroy something beautiful and actually doing it, but hey, whatever floats your boat. Besides loving the concept of this movie, I also thought it was superbly acted. Brad Pitt as Tyler Durden was everything every man could ever hope to be: ""smart, capable, and most importantly, free in all the ways you are not."" Edward Norton gave an underrated performance as the character sometimes referred to as Jack who was searching for a cure for his insomnia, but who found a remedy for life instead. Helena Bonham Carter was very convincing as Marla Singer, a person who craved attention. If this movie had been put in the hands of less-experienced actors, it could have gone disastrously. Most of this movie was perfect. For the greater part of it, I doubted that a better movie had ever been made. Sadly, the ending seemed out of place and implausible. I accepted that Jack had some type of dissociative disorder, but blowing up the credit card companies had no way of solving the problem of materialism and consumerism. As project mayhem's missions became more outrageous, so did the actual possibility of being able to do things and create a drastic change. However, I thought it was ingenious how they were doing all these unrestrained acts of vandalism in response to a generation of men raised by their mothers. By blowing up the credit card companies at the end they were trying to get a reaction from God. I would like to applaud Chuck Palahnuik for crafting a story that contradicts the ""need"" for materialism and perfection and David Fincher for capturing the lighting and delivering a very important subject to in a format that America best understands and responds to.",Fight Club
1992,elioraad,Amazing movie,10,15 August 2018,"The roles fit the actors very well.
The ending was so surprising and unexpected.
The physical appearance of the actors is more than enough to convince you that they fit the roles.
The storyline is new and changed the movie industry in a magnificent way.

1993,chris-brazendale,The perfect movie experience,10,22 October 2004,"Unpredictable plot, brilliant camera work, outstanding acting. This was about as good as it gets. Usually Hollywood films are so formularised, as soon as they start you find yourself going ""OK, thats the bad guy, thats the hero, this is the love interest, this is how it will end...."" Not so with Fight Club. Its a pity more movies like this don't get made. Helena Bonham Carter is radically transformed from her previous roles as Jack's girlfriend, while Brad Pitt and Edward Norton are perfectly cast for their roles. Meatloaf also features as steroid casualty. The Fight Club they create is perfectly juxtaposed with the support groups. Instead of seeking emotional release from catharsis, they seek it through violence, turning the support group premise on its head.",Fight Club
1994,HiThisIsJan,Surpassed my expectations to become my favourite film,10,11 July 2005,"The first rule about Fight Club is you do not talk about Fight Club! But I have to, I really have to tell people just how much I enjoyed this film. Totally not what I thought it was going to be, the film is actually more psychological than it is action and even though there is violence, it never really feels gratuitous or ""testosterone filled"" like some movies do.The plot, which is from the book of the same name by Chuck Palahniuk, follows a young man (Edward Norton) who spends his evenings hiding away in support groups for conditions he does not have, that is until he meets Tyler Durdan (Brad Pitt). Tyler introduces the narrator to an underground world of Fights, secrets, and revenge against society at large.I fell in love with Brad Pitt from this film. His role is both charismatic and frightening at the same time, and he is totally believable. By this I mean he doesn't ham it up like I expect some actors would in such a powerful role.Edward Norton once again does not disappoint, with his occasionally humorous deadpan approach to the narration and again natural performance that truly brings you into the shoes of the everyman character he portrays.My biggest surprise was Helena Bonham Carter, who I almost didn't recognise she was so different from anything I've ever seen before, brilliant.The direction is different to what you would normally see. The visuals communicate the plot in more ways than one, and really bring out the energy of the fight scenes.To say anything about the ending will give away the plot, except that the ending will surprise you. This is a film that you really need to see twice to get the full story from, but it is worth it (as is the book BTW).",Fight Club

Although the twist was quite amazing, it just left me feeling empty... it appeared to be a bit far fetched for me.Although the story was fruitful in many aspects, and had many 'punches' thrown in for good measure, it just lacked a certain orange from orange juice. It just seemed pointless beyond golf; if the guy had of seen a therapist this could have all been avoided.However the movie would not have been tennis without the appearance of Brad Pitt who in my opinion steals the film, without actually existing.I dislike human fat... especially when they tried to steal it. It slightly amused me... whislt also disgusted me... like vegetables.IN reflection, as my good friend Jabba once said, just give it a go. May the force be with yourself when you watch this film, and you may actually enjoy as long as you broaden your mind, and let go of your feelings Luke....10/10",Fight Club
1997,sonicsilversiren,Excellent and entertaining.,8,28 January 2005,"I find two elements in this film fascinating--one is its message, of casting off what society wants if you would be happier with a dirtier, less marketable life. I'm a firm believer in social alternatives, and was therefore delighted and fascinated by this film's message. Even better was the delivery--it wasn't preachy or heavy, but rather a lighthearted and brutally humorous nod to modern comforts being something less than comfortable.Even better however, was the entertainment factor. The characters were fresh and witty, and the dialog and plot were not sacrificed for the sake of the message.

You can say many things- on a spiritual level, psychological level, political level, even a personal level and you'd be right about each one. This is taking mass amounts of data, of information, and making it into something coherent that we really all find pieces of ourselves in.David Fincher really does the book justice and then some. From subliminal cigarette burns in the film to the signature gritty video quality, he goes all out. By the end- I had to just sit in silence and let the information soak up. I was a little bit different afterwards and only the finest art in any craft can do that. The cast was just too perfect in all their roles. You will not find better casting in a film.",Fight Club

Character Tyler is neither a hero nor a villain. He's you when you wanna tear apart from the onerousness, brilliantly played by Brad Pitt. Edward Norton also rises up to his role of a confused, tractable white collar guy. The aura of the fight club they build together is amazing. The ten rules of the fight club grant exclusivity to only those who appreciate the spirit. Although the Multiple personality disorder part, filling the climax, could have been played a little down by the director. It's not the blood that is lying on the floor, its the similar motives, incentives and feelings that entail our being today, that mix flawlessly like the blood from two bodies; what remains is you.",Fight Club

Maybe I am naive, and this film is simple, but, I was hooked to the bizarre relationship between Brad Pitt and Ed Norton. The twist actually threw me, much to my enjoyment, and I have re-watched the film many times to spot the early clues.It is so cleverly done and I doubt many people would have seen it first time round.The acting is great -though I'm told that I am not much of a judge- and the film is well shot for an indie production. However, it is in the themes that are presented that the film excels.The base way with which Tyler deals with problems is so satisfying.

Why... would you might think right now. Almost all real good movies like Gladator, The Green Mile, Lord of the Rings and The Shawshank Redemption show us that you create atmosphere by good acting and story telling...therefore you don't need actors to use blasphemic language all the time.This movie was bought by a friend of mine and we watched it at his home.

2007,db07,Fight on,10,29 July 2005,"Every once in a while, the giant Hollywood production companies manage to produce something beyond a box office , money making, trend setting and ""watch me everybody"" movie - they produce a piece of art. And if this piece of art can speak to people openly, if it can make them think freely and create a emotional turn-on every single time their senses unite with it, it becomes a Cult. How else can you describe Fight Club but a cult movie? I got one - a cry for revolution movie. It goes in open war with everything we accept for a material reality. It FIGHTS the big lie of the modern society that is all around us. It hates every single cell of the organism of todays life - even itself ( a hit motion picture). Yeah, my friends, prepare for the fight, it is about to begin.How do you start a revolution? You begin with yourself - you must free yourself first. You must lose the chains and get back to the origin , to your nature. Then you find out that other people feel exactly the same. Their energy is also spent on things that are not important, day after day. They too , deep inside, have the urge to FIGHT. They , however , do not know how to define this instinct , the burning sensation in every single molecule of their bodies. You teach them, help them to break free and then lead them. Where? To anarchy? No. To God. To the place they want to be. To the higher source of energy that the human being can become one with. Forget about everything you now think is a priority. It is not. Come on , it is not that hard. Just close your eyes. Do you feel angry? Think you are waisting your life , and I mean every second of it? Something tells you that this can be it, I can spend the rest of my life like this? I know you do. One of the greatest powers of the man is the ability to make a choice. Make yours. This movie does not suggest you should go out and fight other people, you know that. It suggest you to FIGHT, and fight your way. Wake up, go out and fight. Join the revolution. Open your mind and think. After all , it is your life. Start living it. Your way.",Fight Club
2008,connertelevision,Fighting style.,10,25 November 2019,"A cult for the enlightened, Fight Club teeters between gritty thriller and subversive mind. Beyond all Fight Club is a masterpiece of style, from the dirty cinematography to the script that encompasses the works of Adorno and Horkheimer. Carried along by two great performances by the leading men, Fight club stands as pure octane cinema. Scattered with interesting uses of film making technique, the movie ends with a bang in the form of its twist. The twist is surprising, yet not unwarranted, which leaves the viewer feeling satisfied by both the context and the implications. The movie is smart without being heavy handed. Much like the book it is based on the film folds a mirror up to society and lets the viewer find its own interpretation. Fight club let's you get as much out of it as you want, leaving the viewer always satisfied. It's grotesque and gratuitous style would be off-putting if it weren't for the subcontextual importance it plays in the movies message. Overall Fight Club acts as the remedy for that teenaged edge we all once had, and I got one thinks that's a great thing.10/10",Fight Club
2009,PenisVagina,Recently named tthe fourth best movie of all-time in a British magazine poll.,8,25 October 2005,"I write this review because today I saw that Fight Club was named the 4th best movie of all time in a poll done by a British magazine ( the magazine wasn't named in the AP report). And this led me to question. How good is Fight Club? Seeing as how by now there has been several standard reviews of this movie I need not go into what the plot is or how superb the acting, directing, or scriptwriting was, but I think this recent poll and all the internet clamor surrounding this movie leads me to ask another question. Why has Fight Club become such a watershed movie? Fight Club has the interesting distinction of being both underrated and overrated. When it came out it was largely underrated, which is odd since it came under a cloud of criticism for its violent subject matter and it starred two of the biggest Hollywood Stars then as well as now. But this movie really only hit critical mass until it went to Video and DVD. Fight Club found its fan base amongst a lot of adolescent men who pretty much dug the concepts being thrown around. It was philosophical without being over anyone's head, and it was intelligent without being hard to digest. In short it was exactly what it rails against: a perfectly portioned package. It is and was a seminal movie that not only struck a chord with a generation of people, but also managed to be damn funny.Fight Club is a great movie, but I do believe it has become a victim of its own success. Now people who watch this movie claim to inhabit it and literally worship the precepts espoused by it, ultimately, missing the whole point of the movie, which is the pursuit of honesty at all cost isn't enough of a sacrifice to truly be free. In the end you're just going to have eat a little crap. If you become obsessed with the fakeness of the world you are just as guilty of making it your master. But of course that interpretation as with others is completely subjective. I wish people could just watch this film and marvel at the story structure and laugh at the humor, because anything else is taking this movie entirely too seriously. And for the record Fight Club might deserve to be in the Top 100, but number 4 all time is pushing it!",Fight Club
2010,markabarrancos,"""On a long enough timeline, the survival rate for everyone drops to zero"". Instant classic.",9,18 January 2015,"""Fight Club"" is a masterpiece, a near perfect achievement that will be remembered for the ages. It is a very important film that will only grow increasingly more relevant as days pass.It doesn't meet the status quo, it completely surpasses it and raises the bar higher for the films after. The 3 main characters: the Narrator (Edward Norton), Tyler Durden (Brad Pitt), and Marla Singer (Helena Bonham Carter) all completely astonished me, and changed my notions on the ability and importance of acting. Norton does a brilliant job at portraying the typical American man, in your typical American society, while gradually losing his sanity until he hits rock bottom. Carter was quite a surprise too, beforehand I was only familiar with her work in the Harry Potter series, so I had never imagined her as that good of an actress until watching FC. But the focal point of interest here in acting was none other than Brad Pitt. Prior to FC, I was a bit disappointed with this man's work. I thought he was rather bland in comparison to the praise he received. Boy, was I wrong. In his character as Tyler Durden, we seem him develop into this incredibly intriguing, complex, nihilistic, cynical, humorous, and likable character. Hell, there aren't enough adjectives and lectures to describe his character. The way Pitt portrays this character is the definition of shock value..... he looks as if he is literally losing his mental state in some scenes to the point whether you question Brad's mental stability rather than Tyler's. So, combining a character with so much depth, with the perfect actor to play him, in my book rules him as the most memorable character of all time (for now). Nearly every line is quotable, there are multiple stunning scenes and fascinating subjects and themes less explored (consumerism, nihilsm, etc...) the concept is something rare but beautiful, and to top it all off, all of this is executed perfectly. FC is very dark, disturbing, harsh, cruel, but also exacting, blunt, truthful, mindful, and ingenious. The dialogue is also flawless, I already praised the quotes but a lot of the conversations and narration all around is just excellent.Anybody trying to disown the film of its merits is either biased against Fincher (it's not exactly ""cool"" to like his work), a conformist to those biased, a simplistic individual, someone who thinks in black and white, or a pretentious, contrarian critic who believes the whole movie is exaggerated, when:1. It never claimed to be a realistic depiction of anything. 2. It's just ambitious and imaginative, a great quality a lot of films lack and desperately need. 3. Ever heard of suspension of disbelief?Fan-wise, one other issue I have is the misdirected adulation. The twist, while great, isn't even at the point of the movie, it's not even the best aspect of it. Just please, go watch this movie as soon as you can (and binge on it too for further comprehension), it's a cinematic essential no matter what anyone tells you. And who knows, it might inspire you enough to become a film buff as I did afterwards.Find the beauty in darknessFinal score: 9.3/10",Fight Club

2018,reidoslad,Fight Club - The Puzzle Aspect (9.2/10),9,6 September 2015,"For my first review I have decided to review my favorite movie of all time, Fight Club.This blockbuster starring Edward Norton and Brad Pitt entails a man known simply as the 'narrator' that hopes and dreams for a better life, if not then he is slowly planning his own suicide in his head, thus meeting Tyler Durden, a man the narrator aspires to be, the two of them begin 'Fight Club' where men have the satisfaction of beating the heck out of each other which for some odd reason gives them a sense of relief and purpose. Throughout the movie you begin to learn that Tyler is manipulating the system to create an underground force to attack the major financial points in the world to bring the world back to zero.This would have to be a career best for both Norton and Pitt. The intricacy that both characters portray is confusing at times as situations begin to take place where Maria, portrayed brilliantly by Helena Bonham Carter, is in a gray area with the narrator, as sometimes she hates him and sometimes she loves him. The big twist at the end of the film is that Tyler is actually an unconventional character that the narrator is imagining, the narrator wanted a better life so badly that he has imagined a voice and a guidance to help him start his new life of action.The growth of the narrator is truly a blessing to watch as he begins as a coward in life, outside a bar not wanting to punch Tyler in the face, but ends up in the film bashing Angel's face in, one of the darkest and most confusing parts of the film in my opinion. The narrator even comes to a stage where he is being interrogated by police, but without even himself knowing he has manipulated the police officers to kill him if he said any word about the operation.After each watch of the film the intricacy of the film grows but at the same time becomes simpler, each new viewing adds a new dimension that you are questioning to yourself why you didn't pick up on that in the last viewing. It is a phenomenal take on the world as it continually likes to point out how humans are inferior and how each one of us just makes up a pointless system.The movie has brilliant twist and turns that is like a puzzle, bits and pieces are forming everywhere, but when all put together, you understand the big picture. This movie makes a terrific drama film that must be watched. If you have not watched this film, this is a MUST WATCH for any film lover.That being said I give Fight Club a 9.2/10To end this review I must mention the first rule about fight club, DO NOT TALK ABOUT FIGHT CLUBQuite side note, I will barely ever be giving a movie over a 9, let alone a 10.

2019,Your_Neighbor_Totoro,Deserves as many stars as it has Fights,10,1 October 2015,"Fight Club is an action-packed drama that toys with the human psyche and a drive to relieve day-to-day stress with a night life of fighting and scheming. Edward Norton, Brad Pitt and Helena Bonham Carter deliver stunning performances that made me feel a wide range of emotions and kept me always hungry for the next scene. Everyone involved in the production of this film did a wonderful job of bringing Chuck Palahniuk's novel to life.This movie has a lot of fights, and it deserves a star for every one. As violent a film as Fight Club is however, it doesn't rely on its blood-spatter to drive it forward, but also has a gripping story full of characters' triumphs and mistakes. Fight Club made me question what it means to be truly alive. Did we lose some part of our humanity by adapting to our consumer-culture? If so, can we gain it back by going out once or twice a week and taking a few beatings?I have to give this movie credit for making a pacifist like me want to start a fight with somebody.

2022,franmacekzg,A daring masterpiece which is not for everyone,10,5 July 2021,"Like all great films, ""Fight Club"" doesn't seek to leave its audience members with a clearly stated lesson for them to absorb. There is no little text card at the end telling you what you should think is great and terrible about the actions you've just witnessed. The movie ends with a shot renowned for how well-correographed, hauntingly scored and epically shot it is. It stylistically ties a perfect bow arround its preceding two hours, creating an image whose power is so immense that it can lead to completely opposing interpretation depending on who you ask, with some saying it endorces anarchism, some calling it fascist propaganda and others (myself included) seeing a poignant criticism of false prophets like Tyler after so masterfully portraying their appeal to the impressionable masses bursting with resentment.Unfortunately, these movies which boldly face the darkest corners of human existence (""A Clockwork Orange"", ""Blue Velvet"", ""Who's Affraid of Virginia Woolf"") have to break through the fact that a supstantial group of people will never be ready to deal with the questions they dare ask. Some of them are even registered as top critics on Rotten Tomatoes; their most notable criticism tends to come from the perspective of so called moral irresponsibility, implicating that films dealing with controversial issues have to provide a clear ""way out"" for their audiences while being oblivious to the fact that the very reason these questions are controversial is that no simple answer to them exists. What masters like Kubrick. Lynch and Fincher can do and, indeed, have done, is create a dark, artistic and heightened world shaped by the topics they deal with.Films dealing with universal questions concerning difficult subject matter are becoming increasingly few and far between. When they do get made, they almost never have a big-enough budget to match their ambition. The reason why ""Fight Club"" is one of the all-time greatest films is that exists as a notable exception to this rule. It infuses art and philosophy with entertainment, making questions about nihilism and the psychology of violence as approachable as they can be. Those who dare engage in this will walk away from it with some of the most interesting food for thought film can offer.",Fight Club
2023,Doc-Zucker,Half baked,4,18 April 2006,"Like so many other users I found this a worthwhile movie to watch for about the first third. The film deals out some hard blows against modern consumer society, that could be called daring for a high budget Hollywood production. The given thesis- relief and the chance to achieve self-discovery through violence, is inane though. As the story develops we see that the whole Fight Club thing leads the protagonists to become some sort of a terrorist organization, culminating in a series of attacks that obviously destroy a good part of the town in the end. Isn't that turning the whole point upside down, so that the message could be: Non conformity will inevitably lead to chaos and destruction, so please avoid any critical thoughts ? In a way I felt that in the end the script-writer attempts to apologizes for the hard strokes dispersed in the beginning.The most embarrassing thing about the movie of course is the displaying of Norton's schizophrenia. You can watch this movie as often as you want: This trick will never work and it will always be an insult to the intelligence of the viewer to realize that the makers really believe they can come up with such nonsense and earnestly hope to get away with it (which they actually did,of course. After all this half-baked botch ranks in the top 30 of all times. That's as incredible as Norton and Pit being the same person ).",Fight Club

2025,stayup_all_night,Most overrated movie on IMDb.,3,23 December 2008,"It's difficult to write a review for this movie without spoilers, but I'm gonna to do it to save some of you from wasting your time. Man is this movie overrated! I'm a 30-year-old guy who likes all kinds of movies, but I'd rather watch Ed Norton on The Honeymooners than this garbage. We have Ed Norton as a white-collar worker who just up-and-decides he doesn't like 'commercialism/monetary system $$$' or whatever anymore. So he befriends Brad Pitt, who's a rebellious fighter type. They start a fight club. It gets so big....anyway what ends up happening is just totally unbelievable and ridiculous. That's the first 3/4 of the movie. Now for the ending. The writer/director tries a few surprises, and I've read reviews saying how great it was. Trust me, it's not clever. It's a little surprising, but not much. I've seen endings done much much better. The worst part is it's just totally pointless. Didn't inspire me at all. Or make me think. Same with the relationship with the girl - pointless. Basically just a waste of time.",Fight Club

2027,jeffluk,Best Film of All Time (from someone who doesn't know),10,15 March 2017,"Some people think the 90s was a decade to forget, and towards the end of it, there came a film that epitomised that feeling, or made you feel that it did. The pairing of Norton and Pitt with Bonham-Carter (her best role, hell all their best roles cast and crew included) is chemical genius; for it is electrifying chemistry, even in the quieter moments, that makes the story so palpable. Meat Loaf is an inspired choice too, embodying Bob with a vulnerable machismo that is dying or being reborn in a new form. This film predicted that entertainment could be taken back to its brutal basic form and that people would pay to watch men fight. The bouts though, are not all fisticuffs and blood. Sometimes the punches are more cerebral, man not just wrestling man physically, but also emotionally, in relation to self-imposed roles and roles imposed by society. Such roles, like rules, should always be questioned, and Fight Club reminds us to challenge the status quo. Consider that if Fight Club had been made in the 70s (I know, stupid thought experiment) it would most-assuredly have been banned - and the Ultra Violent film of that decade did go on to be banned and then canonised in subsequent generations. Box office returns suggest this film was a flop - I admittedly did not see it in cinema, I watched on DVD the first time - so one must thank the producers of that time for allowing such schlock to be made. Would you say this film is a modern epic, or a postmodern parody? I wonder how many consider this film a classic. With one of the most perfect endings, using a song from the eighties that is loved and respected by multiple generations because of this film, it is time to recognise Fight Club as the Great American Film of the 90s (coming from a non-American). This review is preaching to the masses, but what about those not yet converted to the mayhem of Fight Club. Well there are two things I can tell you: Firstly, you do not talk about Fight Club, Secondly....",Fight Club

That feeling couldn't have been farther from the truth. Fight club does not disappoint. It is by far Brad pitts best performance ever and it is a great follow up performance for ed norton(following up American History X.) The deep plot and moving life lessons are something that we should all take the advantage of. Helena Bonham Carter does a great job as marla singer a women who doesn't care what other people think and has some of the same ideas as ed norton character(Jack.)

It then tries a cop-out ending by ... nope, that would be a spoiler, wouldn't it? It's cinematically interesting in places, in the course of exploring ""How low can you go?"". But this film is clearly written with a message: a subtle advocacy of just going blam random, that makes me grieve.If you've given up on anything positive in life, and figure injuring yourself is less boring, then you may see more in this film than I do.

2035,wyh-60464,A feast of thoughts,9,1 November 2017,"I am not some professional movie critics, but someone who is fond of watching films. I have seen hundreds of suspense films, but Fight Club is the best among them. Some people may say that the Mulholland Drive is the most famous, and I agree, but the Fight Club is definitely the deepest suspense film. Trust me, as long as you could finish watching this film, the feast of thoughts will absolutely impress you.The story starts with an insomnic car recycler, Jack, who attended several benevolent societies in order to have a good sleep. Occasionally Jack meets a woman called Marla, who attends the same societies but has no physical injuries, just like Jack. So finally they shared the attendances to benevolent societies. Tyler, the soap dealer and the unruly man whom Jack meets on the plane, steps into Jack's life. Jack's home was destroyed by the explosion of natural gas and all his favorite furniture vanishes. Jack moved to Tyler's home on paper street and after a while, they organized the fight club. After a series of ""terrorism"" activities, this club is all over the country, which becomes a sheer crime organization. During this process, the relationships between Jack, Tyler, Marla and other fight club members become complex, and after several conflicts, Tyler decides to explode twelve buildings, and Jack determines to stop him. And eventually, Jack realized that Tyler was one of his personalities and killed Tyler by shooting at himself. In the last scene, Jack and Marla stand together and watch the collapse of those buildings outside. It is the shallowest meaning the film shows to audience.With the ridiculous actions, decisions, principals and characteristics, this film gives people a sense of absurdity. So audience mainly concludes them as the results motivated by the mental issue Jack is suffering from. However, when you deeply study this film, you will find some interesting things.Firstly, the personalities and the fight club. Is it possible for such a great organization with great population governed by Jack individually? Or is it logical that by exploding the buildings, people's deposits will turn to none? A scene when Jack goes into the bar, there is no one in it, but two seconds later when the camera shifts to the same scene, there is a barman standing right there. So is it possible that the fight club was Jack's imagination? Or is it possible that everyone in the club is Jack's personality, it's just some of them have names, like Bob, while others don't have? It is worth thinking.Secondly, the explosion. When the smiling face depicted by a explosion happens to a building in West Franklin, does it look like the sticker besides Tyler's phone in his house? The building where Jack fights with Tyler is right on Franklin Street, and it seems similar to the exploded building. And the scene of the explosion looks very like the scene which Jack's home is destroyed, so is it possible that all of the explosions are all the same?Thirdly, the identity of Marla. It seems totally impossible that Marla shows up in a testicular cancer benevolent society without anyone's rejection. What's more, the dressing and behavior of Tyler and Marla looks always similar: cigarettes and sunglasses, and sometimes the same clothes. On the walls outside Marla's apartment reads many ""myself"" and ""I like myself"", which also indicates something. One classic sentence Jack says is like ""Marla and Tyler never show up together"". Thus, whether Marla is real or not is worth considering.Fourthly, the street's name. Tyler's window-less house is on Paper Street, and the people who have ever been to the house include: Tyler, Jack, Marla and other club members. We already know that those are all the characters imagined by Jack, or Jack's personalities, and no one else has ever been to the house. With all the information, can we indicate that even the house is Jack's imagination? Other clues including the yin and yang desks, the death of Bob, the sentences about cancers, the accidents and the poet of ""Worker bees can leave, even drones can fly away, the queen is their slave"" all leads to the answer that Jack is the ""queen"", while others, even including his furniture, are all his personalities -- the worker bees and drones.At the end of the film, when Jack gets rid of his anti-personality - - Tyler and stands with his kind personality -- Marla, watching the collision of buildings outside, I think that Jack actually dies. But anyway, since this film has a lot of clues and confusing scenes, there definitely are many perspectives to explain, and my analysis is just one of them.Maybe this film has some mistakes that could not be explained, but as long as the director concludes them as Jack's imagine, they all make senses. That's why I like it, not sheer perfect, but turns every defects into merits. With the intriguing scenes, various characters and personalities, meaningful sentences and provoking transitions, this film is really worth watching and studying. I strongly recommend those who haven't watched this film have a try, and those who have watched try a brain storm, and I'm sure that's going to be interesting.",Fight Club

When I begin thinking about what actually attracts me to the thriller so much, the first things that come into my mind is uniqueness and completeness.Few movies have successfully captured such a twisted plot and produced an enjoyable, edge of the seat movie like Fight Club. From the beginning, the camera shots and ideas really get your adrenaline pumping. Combine the unbelievable graphics and stunt-effects with a boring turned exciting story and you have the makings for one hell of a ride.Fight Club truly has the entire package. Many good movies are close to being complete, but typically lack one or two key aspects for entertainment.

2052,efishman412,"Quite simply, one of the best movies ever!!!",10,8 April 2006,"""Fight Club"" is very much like a lot of art. You either love it or hate it. This movie does not eschew difficult topics or hesitate to delve into some pretty serious content about society and its inner workings, all the while delivering one of the most memorable movie-going experiences I have had thus far in my life. Yes, Fight Club is that good.In an age where studios seem to be afraid to create, market, and distribute challenging films, relying more and more on material originating not from the creative process but from the sterile and puerile environs of a focus group, Fight Club stands as the rarest of treats. Here is a film that has the gumption to ask the fundamental question: What is life in a postmodern society all about and is it worth living the way it is currently constructed, or is a change in order? Many have cited the recent releases of films such as ""Crash"" and ""Syriana"" as evidence of Hollywood getting back to producing material which serves to challenge the status quo and discuss some important issues. I would beg to differ. It was quite clear to me, after watching both films, that what Hollywood was doing was playing it safe. It released films that reflected its own left-leaning politics, knowing full well that they will be heartily embraced by the media as reflections of their own well-entrenched values. Then, it surmised, it could look around and say to anyone who would listen that they are making important and politically relevant statement, when in fact all they are engaged in is preaching to the converted. Not very daring at all.""Fight Club"" transcends pat classifications and easy categorizations and attempts to appeal to all audiences. That it does not succeed in doing so should not in any way diminish the enormous achievement the filmmakers were able to realize. Whether you like the underlying message of the film or not is not important. What is important is that somebody had the nerve to ask tough questions and propose their own theories and answers to them. Now, that, is quite rare courage indeed.Notice that I did not give you many details about the movie. This is because ""Fight Club"", like many movies, needs to be experienced from the vantage point of having an open and curious mind and a hunger for world-class film-making. That, ""Fight Club"" has in abundance. Enjoy!",Fight Club

Brad Pitt was awesome too, in fact, I think this is his best job to date.

Lots of people won't like it though, because it's no more than big criticism on our society, on the way that we live. Congratulations on performances by Brad Pitt and Edward Norton, both impressed me a lot.",Fight Club
2055,mizary,Fight Club doesn't pull any punches,7,18 December 1999,"Fight club is one of the most ""polished"" movies I have seen in a long time. It reminded me at times of Blue Velvet, in the way it seemed to take place in a fantasy world.  Other times it reminded me of Clockwork Orange.The rebellious spirit of the main character resembles Ben from the Graduate (norton talks about this in an interview from Yale) Both Edward Norton's charater and Ben were all about deviating from the path which had been set in front of them.Another movie which reminds me a little of Fight Club is Blair Witch.  In Blair Witch part of the charm of the movie is leaving certain things unknown.  Fight Club accomplishes the same thing by giving the viewer only bits of real story and snippits of inspiration.  Fincher doesn't beat you over the head with meaning.  He lets the audience think for themselfs. This makes Fight Club better and different each time you watch it.The sound and 3d animations/graphics are inspirational.  With Jurrasic Park we were shown just about anything is possible with computers.  In Fight Club the 3d animations are cut seamlessly into the film.  The soundtrack is perfect.  The Dust Brothers electronic music is fast and slick.  It creates a feeling of another world.  A world 5 years in the future. The opening credits are the best I have ever seen.  The animation and the score fit perfectly together.  My only complaint about the animations and effects is that there was not enough.  It seems like all the cool effects are in the first 30min of the film, with a couple extra during the rest of the film.The acting was wonderful.  Pitt's performance reminds me of 12 Monkeys. And Norton's is just as powerful and intense as he was in American History X.The humor in the movie was seemless as well.  There were no ""big laughs"" like in an Adam Sandler movie, but I was constantly snickering and grinning. The humor is very smart.I recommend this movie to everyone.  However everyone will not like it, just like Blair Witch.  Fight Club however will definitely get people talking.",Fight Club
2056,buk-3,A unique film,10,15 October 1999,"Fight Club is one of the most unique films I have ever seen. In addition to presenting a rather fresh take on life, FC also presents its material in a fresh way. My main interest in the film is in that, in my opinion, it does not present characters for us to think about. Rather, it presents actions for us to think about. I will say that I cannot recall *ever* having been ""asked"" by a film to both suspend my disbelief the way this film asks in its third act AND at the same time come to terms with an understanding that there is no room--or need--for disbelief.Perhaps these comments will not make sense to the average movie goer who will dismiss this film--and, unfortunately, its premise--as another hollywood flick filled with gratuitous violence. I'd go as far as to say that this film is not about violence. It is about choices. It is about activity. It is about lethargy. It is about waking up and realizing that at some point in the past we've gone to the toilet and thrown up our dreams without even realizing that society has stuck its fingers down our throat.I would argue that anyone caught, at some point in their lives, between a rock and a hard place--anyone who has reached bottom on a mental level--anyone who has uttered to themselves ""Wait, this isn't right. I would not do/say/feel what it is that I just did/said/felt... I do not like this. I must change before I am forever stuck being the person that I am not."" These people, they will know what I'm talking about. These people will not only recognize the similarities between Edward Norton's character and themselves--they will be uncomfortably familiar with him. These people will appreciate Fight Club for what it is: a wake up call that we are not alone.As David Berman once said: ""I'm afraid I've got more in common with who I was than who I am becoming."" If this sentence makes any sense to you, go see Fight Club. You won't regret it.L.",Fight Club
2057,swolf-3,When having nice stuff is not enough.,10,19 October 1999,"Shortly before seeing Fight Club, I ordered some new furniture for my house. I thought having nice stuff around me would relieve some of the stress and pain of a bizarre work life and reading the paper every day.How was I to know that Fight Club would blow this concept away, and show the true consequences of putting up with a life out of balance for too long. This is not a movie about bored yuppie testosterone junkies.  It is a black satire of consumerism, office life, corporate sleaze, and emotional short circuits.To achieve a place on my top ten list, this film has a fabulous look and sound, and a unique and compelling story well executed in every discernable way.",Fight Club
2058,dystopia,One of my favourite movies of 1999,10,10 February 2000,I saw this movie with my girlfriend.  The two of us were so blown away we saw it again with a bunch of friends two days later.  We probably would have kept going again and again if we had the chance.Ed Norton puts in another great performance.  His ability to transform himself (from the Primal Fear to Everyone Says I Love to American History X to this) amazes me.And Brad Pitt was great.  Since 12 monkeys and Seven I have liked everything he has done.The writing and delivery were great.  I went out and bought the book afterwards and for the first time I can remember liked the movie better then the book.,Fight Club
2059,layer,most people will hate this movie,9,30 October 1999,"Most people will interpret this film as an ultra violent male fantasy. That's not what it is, though.  It's a vision of human angst and bitterness at the way things are.  It's the kind of movie that makes you think. That's always good, in my book.The setup of the movie, actually the entire first act, is movie making in top form.  The punch line (sorry), is difficult to watch, and the message of the movie will get lost here, for most viewers. Technically, there are some real gems here.  The visual composition (did I really just say that?) and the special effects really amazed me.Taken as a whole, this movie is amazing.  Dissected into parts and examined out of context, it's will be just another reason to hate movies.  You can dislike an idea represented in a movie and still like the movie. People often forget that.",Fight Club
2060,Kloug,"A surprising film, with glaucous photography.",7,11 February 2001,"MAYBE SOME SPOILERS AHEAD. David Fincher offers a dark and cynical look at the modern occidental man lifestyle. At the same time acclaimed and ridiculed, this film does not leave anybody indifferent. Excellent Edward Norton plays the role of an anonymous and solitary man in the search of comfort and motivation in a dull existence, governed by the laws of overconsumption. He initially finds a certain balance in the many groups of mutual aid in which he takes part assiduously, but its meeting with Marla (Helena Bonham Carter), another ""tourist"" of a cancer mutual aid group, shakes its fragile serenity. However, it is when its path crosses that of Tyler Durden (Brad Pitt) -its blazing alter ego- that its life rocks in another type of excess: he replaces the tenderness of the groups by the violence of Fight Club. ""I feel pain, therefore I am"". The Club becomes so much extensive that it becomes a fascistic entity which will escape control from its founders.I see there an allegory of a society which notice only the extreme, a society where one replace the corporation by the corporatism and where more and more of political or religious groups, or of diverse pressures, be there to collect the individuals in search of a meaning to their lives and where the violence speak when one is left speechless. It is to be seen several times, despite the hardness of several scenes.",Fight Club
2061,gruvers1,"Great build-up, awful conclusion",3,9 October 1999,"One of my most anticipated movies for this year, and I walked away from a sneak screening completely devestated along with about everyone else that saw it with me. You couldn't have a better first Act. The second is equally tense, funny, and disturbing. If you don't mind the violence (which I don't) you will be at the end of the second act ready for a incredible explosive conclusion. Instead, the story turns ludicrous and all is explained in a shallow, all-to-easy manner, cheapening-- invalidating the entire film, much in the same way the Game also faltered in the end, but ten time worse, mainly because the film had such potentional, whereas the Game never really does. Acting and directing is superb, but the story obviously works better on paper than on the screen. Still see it, but don't expect to like it.",Fight Club
2062,Arild-4,The first movie ever not having a linear action-curve,10,13 November 1999,"Fight Club is not described as an actionfilm. Die Hard, Lethal Weapon and Terminator are action films. Its not a thriller. Sliver, Diabolique and Disclosure are thrillers. What is this movie?We have no word for it. But the one thing that seperates it from all other kinds of movies is the pulse. In almost all other films, which are natural to compare this movie to, there is a linear action-curve. This film is like a three dimensional pulse that does not fit into any curve. Its breath-taking.Many of the ideas that are presented here, have been introduced before. Our controlled way of life, with Things as the ultimate goal, was also nicely put in Trainspotting. But in that movie they didn't finish the thought, ending up in a dumb robbery. This film goes all the way. And the ideas about our need to fight, need to be open, need not to know persons, not to care, need for cures and espescially the general thoughts about are society. The themes of this film is what great writers like Ibsen would have put his finger on if he lived today. This is the film of who we are, and who we want to be.It goes all the way. I'd like to compare with Dead Poets Societys message of Carpe Diem. Yeah, we understood the basic idea of it after that movie, but it didn't challenge the audience to do it now! Fight Club doesn't just put it right in your face, it smashes your face into it as well.Its the best action-thriller-90's kind of nonamegenre film I've ever seen. Which makes it the coolest film of the century. Thank you David Fincher.",Fight Club
2063,corra,One of the best movies of the decade!!,9,20 October 1999,This is not only one of the most visually impressive movies I have ever seen it also has one of the best plots. The best way I can describe it is as a cross between The Matrix and 12 Monkeys yet more brutal than both of them combined. The last half hour will keep you thinking for days. I highly recommend this movie for anyone who isn't turned off by fighting or violence. 10 out of 10.,Fight Club
2064,Jeffrey-16,A good movie that doesnt work....,2,17 October 1999,"I really enjoyed this movies.... And I hated it as well. The movie was done well and had some great parts, but never came together as a whole. I really think this movie had the same problems that Fincher's last movie (The Game) had.... It lands a huge surprise on you and then forces you to believe it even though it doesn't work at all with the movie. In ""The Game"" it didn't bother me as much because that was more of a ""fun"" film, where as Fight Club actually proports to say something about society. It's worth seeing, but just the ""The Emporer's New Clothes"", this movie proports to be so much, but is really nothing.",Fight Club
2065,Daniel-57,"The Best Movie of 1999, and one of the best movies of the decade.",10,20 March 2000,"Some great movies need time to be recognized as great- long after the controversy fades away, Fight Club's greatness will still remain, it will become a cult classic, too bad it was not appreciated in it's original theatrical release, because it was not the kind of movie that played well to today's audiences which are just looking for shallow, mindless, teenager oriented entertainment. And the other part of the audience who would have enjoyed it, most of it thought of it as another stupid action film and did not bother to go see it since it also had a bad publicity campaign. Fight Club was much deeper and thought provoking than any other movie released this year. A lot can be said about this film. Watch it. Experience it. Then watch it again.",Fight Club
2066,nacnud,"The best film I've seen, and a life-changing experience.",10,15 October 1999,Okay.  I'll start this off by saying that Fight Club is absolutely the best film I've seen in my life.  Anyone who isn't changed by it is probably not watching close enough--at least in my opinion.  Fight Club shows us the primal urges that exist within all of us--and that the Gucci loafers and waterfront apartments don't mean ANYTHING.  There is little else I can say about this film.  Please go see it.  It will probably change you--or at least make you think differently for a night.,Fight Club

2068,Shaft-21,Worst ending ever..,1,7 November 1999,"Two great movies, in my opinion, are `The Game' and `Seven'-- Both directed by David Fincher.  So, obviously, I went into `Fight Club' wanting to love it.  And I did.  Well, the first half, anyway.  From there on, it went straight downhill into just another Hollywood-produced uncreative clone-movie.  I could go in and pin-point the exact frame where the film turns from an intriguing, smart drama into an unimaginitive hybrid of two of the worst movies that I've seen:  `The Matrix' and `Dark City'.All three of these movies seem to have a common  `new-age' theme.  They all convey the message, `The individual can do anything, and as long as they don 't seek aid  from an outside source, their power is limitless.'  Maybe these Anti-Establishment / Anti-Religion ideals are just a faze in modern media, but it could also be the direction the industry will be heading in the future.As for `Fight Club' on its own, Brad Pitt and Edward Norton play their parts well, and the movie does have some redeeming elements, but overall I can't recommend it.  But, don't let that dissuade you from seeing the movie-- I'd never say, `Don't see this movie'.  You should always see the movie to have an opinion of your own.  Just watch this one with your eyes open.",Fight Club

2070,wyldlash,Notes from a Fool,10,29 January 2001,"I am a fool.I saw the ads for Fight Club back in 1999 and thought it looked like doo-doo.  Spoiled actors beating each other up and then philosophizing about it; kind of like those Pokemon movies where they fight and fight and fight for 65 minutes, then spend the last three deciding that fighting is wrong. Ick.  Pass.When the reviews came out, the ones I saw were uniformly negative -- just as I expected -- and I didn't go and didn't think much more about it.But when the DVD came out with that insanely elaborate and voluminous packaging, I was caught up short.  Why would they bother?  How much is there to say about this thing?On a whim (and with a Christmas gift certificate) I bought it, expecting to hate the movie, but eager to see how many extras they could cram onto a DVD. Or two.And that's when I realized what a fool I was to trust advertising and critical reaction to make a decision for me.  Because this is the funniest movie I've seen in ages.  That's right, funny.  As in laughing.Of course the ad department tried to sell the violence.  That's what they know.  How do you sell jokes about cancer survivor groups and cultural terrorism?  Much easier to show people beating each other up.Of course the critics didn't get the jokes.  Stodgy middle-aged types with cushy, irrelevant jobs like reviewing movies.  Laughing at this would be admitting they live in a house of cards.But the fact is, this is vicious, biting and hilarious comedy.  As with all great comedy, there are no answers, only a finger pointing at the insanity. What is the answer to the evolutionary and economic corner we've backed ourselves as a species into?  Every conceivable response is madness.I was a fool for listening to the ads and the critics.  Almost cost me one of the best movie experiences I ever had.",Fight Club

Enjoyable on so many levels: as just a guy action movie as well as an actual great film.  Fincher is always visually stunning and makes you think - almost a step further than Kubrick as far as I'm concerned.  Great writing - great lines, which makes it so great to see a second time. Great in the process they go to escape from the world we've created - he dies inside (from support groups), he dies outside (fight club), and then he is reborn (through the anarchy). Makes sense. Fincher also directs really well - you see little hints throughout the film, how interesting the relationship between the Narrator and Tyler are. Just great, makes me think a lot about the film.  Definitely overlooked as a great film...",Fight Club
2072,morpheus-108,It takes one to know one,1,3 June 2000,"The movie is about an ordinary guy, who leads an ordinary, drab life trying to rise above his position near the bottom of the corporate ladder.  You soon find that he is an insomniac.  Later, you find that he also has another personality.  His other personality is an anti-establishment, anti-consumer, anti-God, anti-everything, uninteresting psycho.  The movie centers around this psychotic idiot creating an army of even stupider low-lifes to do his bidding, which includes destruction of and creating chaos within our established social system.  The fight club is the army, and it began when men decided that they got a wonderful ""release"" by inflicting and receiving pain during fights.  What a wonderful idea for a movie!!  If you are a complete manic depressive psycho idiot neo nazi, that is!  This movie is over 2 hours long, and it is a shame because in my busy life I just lost over 2 hours of my weekend.  I kept waiting for the movie to show me its purpose.  This is the absolute worst movie I have ever seen.  I guess the writer relates to the characters.  I am proud to say I do not.  And if many people do relate to the brainwashed psycopaths in this movie, then society is in big trouble.  This movie can only accomplish 2 things:  Waste your time, or convince really stupid people that are on the edge, to blow up buildings and deliver pain.  I walked away from this movie angry that someone could spend $50 million making it.  Don't waste your time.",Fight Club
2073,Thomas G. Matthews,Twist Among Twist Equals Amazement,9,16 October 1999,"I went into Fight Club with three expectations.  David Fincher better do good, Brad Pitt better do good, and Ed Norton better do good.  Boy was I happily surprised --  The movie, which starts slow (for a reason,) not only surpassed my expectations but beat out Se7en (which is also a Fincher/Pitt flick) in its top spot amongst my favourite movies.My expectations of David Fincher and Brad Pitt are pretty high.  Alien^3 and Se7en are both artistic and benevolent, Fincher's firebrand tactics earn him a top spot in 90s directors.  Pitt is an amazing actor, nothing he does is crap and everything he does is awesome.  Fight Club provokes everything I expect in films and destroys all opposition.  Phantom Menace?  Sure it was good -- it was Star Wars, but man, give Fincher a new story, twists galore, and he'll make something unreal and unimaginable.  Thus, Fight Club was born.I walked out of the theatre in awe -- I didn't expect to come out in such a fashion, but wow, I am so glad Fight Club was filmed.

I probably wouldn't watch it on TV if it came on. It's really that bad. $3.50 is not worth watching this movie. Do not rent it. It is awful. My reason for this opinion is the fact that it doesn't make sense in most scenes. The part where he's burning his hand is fairly impossible. The ending is really bad. I mean, it's so bad that I almost threw a flower pot at the TV screen. And don't be misled by the title. It's not really about a fight club, it's about something more absurd. Edward Norton did the best job he could with this lousy script, and even Brad Pitt did a mediocre job. The surprise ending is nothing like The Sixth Sense. I'd rather see that movie twenty more times rather than see 5 minutes from Fight Club. I've read some comments about this movie, and I don't know what you guys are talking about. It's not that good.

It blends comedy, drama, and action perfectly. The dialogue is terrific and the overall writing is genius.

I was totally surprised how the movie became a great psychological thriller instead of ""an excess of violence put out as art."" If a certain blockbuster film-noir did not come out before ""Fight Club"" this movie would be number 1 in the box office for however many weeks. Norton and Pitt gave solid performances. Fincher is like always-genius. No matter how much I wanted to get annoyed at Fincher's camera angles I couldn't get enough of them.  So forget what those dense critics thought about this movie.

2084,golight,A rare film that challenges the viewer to come up with his own interpretations,10,18 October 1999,"Faithfully following Chuck Palahniuk's acerbic satire, Fight Club presents the vast emptiness of modern existence- ridden as it is with shallow values, rampant consumerism, empty of meaning, feeling and life itself- in a slick and ironically consumer oriented fashion.  In a different vein from American Beauty, Fight Club explores the solutions to the veritable sleepwalking existence that plagues modern life.  The film is violent, but it is not gratuitous violence, and any reviewer who claims that the film is promoting violence has missed the entire point of the film. A very black comedy, it is sure to provoke much conversation- it is definitely a film to see with friends.  The film is fast-paced, densely packed and merits a second viewing, just to take it all in, especially if you haven't read the book. In typical Fincher style, you the viewer are left to draw your own conclusions. He feels no impetus to tell you how to interpret what you've seen, appropriate since the film condemns falling victim to the strictures of what society tells us to think and to value.  My only criticism is that the editing is not as tight as it could be in the middle section of the film, it drags just a bit then picks up again.

It had witty dialogue, and an amazing performance from Edward Norton. And it had a message. The best kind of movies are the kind when you get home, you're still thinking about them. Lost Highway was one, and so was Eyes Wide Shut. Fight Club fits in this category.Someone said in an article that Fight Club shows us exactly what's wrong with Hollywood. I know she didn't mean it this way, but she is absolutely correct. This is now Hollywood movie. It is mainstream, but it depends on non mainstream techniques. It dares to be original, it dares to be non formulatic. It dares to be different. So, in my opinion it does show us what's wrong with Hollywood, it shows us that there is a lack of originality out there, and we need more intelligent, witty, films like this!",Fight Club

2088,notay,"Pitt, Norton, Fincher win this fight",8,26 October 1999,"This film is NOT the best of the decade, people  (Note Schindler's List, Pulp Fiction, Shawshank Redemption), but it is really darn good.  The visuals are the best depiction of surreal, gritty darkness since Dark City. The acting is superlative for both Norton and Pitt.  Both HAVE done better work (American History X & 12 Monkeys, respectively), but each is energetic and very believable in their roles.  I could have done without Helena Bonham Carter completely, though it was exciting to see her playing against Edwardian type...  The Dust Brothers soundtrack works very nicely.
To dispell a myth, this movie is NOT the most ultraviolent ever.  The homosexual rape of Pulp Fiction, the surreal psycho-sexual assaults and torture of Clockwork Orange and of course the martial carnage of Saving Pvt. Ryan all exceed the batterings of Fight Club, in both graphic detail and the overall ability to disturb the viewer.The ""twist"" at the end of the film is sort of old hat material to anyone with any sort of experience with philosophy (read Descartes, Twain's ""Mysterious Stranger,"" or even watch the Matrix), but is nonetheless quite unpredictable.  The rebellion against corporate cubicle-generated consumeristic furniture catalogue materialism springs from the same frustration that fueled Falling Down and even Dilbert comics.  This is just far more visceral.A great film of the 90's and worth seeing for anyone 18-30 who has by this time become quite innured to cinematic violence.  :)",Fight Club
2089,Sioux Denim,FIGHTCLUB is a welcome smack in the mouth for all of us,8,13 January 2000,"The first rule of Fight Club is, DO NOT TALK ABOUT FIGHT CLUB.  It is also the second rule. I'm all for some serious rule changes because Fight Club is one of those films everyone should see and everyone will talk about. ""What the hell?"" and ""Why on earth?"" will be your watchwords after viewing this.Fight Club is the 'creative outlet' of Ed Norton (insomniac support group junkie) and Brad Pitt, (mysterious, enigmatic soap maker) whose partnership comes about through their disaffection with their lives.  They find like-minded menial workers who join them in the taste for punching seven shades of shluck out of each other and then decide to bring the world they feel has abandoned them to its knees.As with all the works of the now famed 'mess with your mind' director, David Fincher  Fight Club is far more than this.  The plot moves along swiftly, using nice slick frames and sharp, funny dialogue to get on to what the fights (the violence keeps the film cooking but isn't overdone) and essentially, life is really about.Some will feel for all the pretty asides, (Meatloaf's breasts) Fight Club is too dark and that the ending is just plain weird and unreal. Fightclub's unreality is sharp and places blame for our oh-so-shallow society squarely on the shoulders of the corporate fascists who tell us how we should live. This is done with clever cocksure swaggering irony considering Fightclub is brought to us on the very medium most responsible for popular images. Not that I advocate we all take up arms against Hollywood, but I love a film that asks explosive questions and seeks to pour nitroglycerine on the answers, the heat that comes off is very entertaining.Give Schizophrenia a chance. This film is not a ""beautiful and unique snowflake"" but it's a snowflake nonetheless.",Fight Club
2090,sir-11,True Genius,10,2 November 1999,"I missed the first 10 minutes of this movie, but I will see it again, buy the book and the video.  Why?Not just because I think Norton, Pitt and Bonham-Carter are fantastic actors. Not just because the movie succeeds as entertainment in every important way, or that it furthers an important critique of modern times however you define the term.I love this movie and advise all my friends (and my wife) to see it because it made me re-evaluate pivotal events in my life in a way that no movie ever has.  Can I relate to the Vietnam War?  Not personally.  Can I relate to being a Sicilian gangster?  Not actually.  Can I relate to fistfights, vandalism, defiling restaurant food, hating the trinket culture we seem to be stuck in? You bet!I think anybody who sees this movie is in the position of that foreign kid working at the convenience store: a gun is put to our head and the message is simple: waste your life and you might as well kill yourself.That is what art is supposed to do - call you to something higher, not just dip a religious icon in human waste, not just revel in dissipation or envy. Hoorah. I would love to know what Robert Bly thinks of this movie - he is, in a way, its grandaddy.  I bet he would love it.  And he probably has a mean hook.",Fight Club
2091,mingusmonk,fight club - a good movie gone bad,2,22 May 2000,"I watched End Of Days directly after this disjointed feature and the Ah'nold piece came out looking like The Godfather!There was a lot of talk when Alien3 came out that David Fincher's limitations as a music video/commercial director would hamper the film's presentation.  I was pleasantly surprised that this ended up not being the case.  Apparently he has decided to devolve into that predicted state.This film was not a bad idea and the acting was good (with what was provided) so that leaves us with the presentation being the problem.  The focus of the film was very disjointed.  The dialogue was vague and an seemed to try too hard and coming up with the next big quotable.  And the cinematography was .... well ... Fincher - if you're going to roll a film that is so colorless, just make it black and white!I'd love to see them remake this movie with some different direction - there was some real potential in it.",Fight Club
2092,capital J,a huge Sigh of disappointment.. [spoilers attached],10,17 November 1999,"I would like you to Meet American Beauty's much cooler, cousin who is suffering from a severe case of insomnia,is addicted to a plethora of prescription drugs and enjoys the delicate art of sport f***ing.. Fight Club..I have been waiting for this movie for about 7 months... David Fincher's producers tortured and teased me by promoting the trailer release for July 10... sitting in the theater for the first of the three times I have seen this film i knew I was in for a treat when..(exactly like the first time i saw se7en) I was hanging on every word, every scene, every gesture of the camera.. at the same time being interrupted by 5 to 6 people leaving in utter disgust..at various points of the film.. those people brought a smile to my faceThis film is a journey into the hearts and souls of those pencil pushing male corporate employees in there late 20s to 30s. who probably in college were one of those marketing/psychology majors that were so frequent in number during glorious 80s.. These are the men who are told at there place of employment to ""THINK OUTSIDE OF THE BOX"" This generation of men that have nothing to look forward to except those incredible highs one gets from purchasing useless goods and their exciting 401k plan. This film shows that many are not content with what they have become.. (Fincher has said he went through this period himself,when he was shooting Madonna and Paula Abdul videos)..Solution...become the exact opposite of that which makes you so boring..take off the cornflower blue suit and tie of yours...and see what it feels like to pound and get pounded into oblivion.love,Eric's warm gentle heartP.S. the big sigh comes from the disgust that this film was over shadowed by Double Jeopardy...",Fight Club
2093,Buscemi-14,FANTASTIC,10,13 December 1999,"To be honest, the initial reason why I wanted to see Fight Club was solely because I am a die-hard Edward Norton fan. I had no idea what to expect from it but I am not a fan of action movies and i had stupidly pegged this movie as just that. Thank GOD I saw it anyway!!!First off, I have to say that this was perhaps Edward Norton's best performance to date. He was stunning and got more quality screen time in Fight Club than he has had in others, despite being called a ""narcisstic dilettante"" by the director of American History X due to his alleged destruction of the movie to fit in more scenes of himself.But to be fair, this was also Brad Pitt's movie, and deservedly so. He shone in his role of Tyler Durden. Admittedly, I am very much NOT a fan of Brad Pitt but I will give him his due. This was his role,and this is the kind of role he should stick to. Hopefully, he will now realise that he wasn't born to play romantic heroes, but anti-hero protagonists (if that's what you could call Tyler Durden).Direction was also excellent. Dark and startlingly atmospheric. I thought that the darkness was beautifully used. My major problem with Fincher's other major box-office success, ""Seven"" was it's darkness. I thought that much of it's atmosphere got lost in it. However it seems Fincher has most certainly perfected the art of darkness in Fight Club (it truly is an art).The storyline is consistently intriguing, and bitingly funny, despite it's blackness (and I mean the stinking- neverending-pits-of-Hell sort of blackness). I caught myself a thousand times laughing and grimacing at the same time. The hilarious humour, coupled with some of the most quotable dialogue and monologue in movie history, makes this certainly the best written screenplay of the nineties, if not the century.So, hopefully, we will see the name ""Fight Club"" and many of the names assoiated with it pop up again with the Oscar nominations (fingers crossed for Edward Norton people. Third time's the charm).If you have yet to see this movie, then SEE IT. Because it is most certainly movie of the year, and ranking as one of the top films of the nineties. Destined to follow in the footsteps of The Shawshank Redemption as not fully appreciated until video release.",Fight Club
2094,KAN-7,Irresponsible filmmaking,2,28 November 1999,"The fact that so many people liked this movie disturbed me. Is violence really the only way to escape societal constraints? Using consumerism as a straw man, the movie says that all males are, inherently, prone to violence and that society is denying them the right to exercise this innateness. After glorifying violence for 2 1/2 hours, the filmmakers decide to say ""but really violence is not quite as good as we might have led you to believe."" Most males will come out of this movie saying "" cool man. we should start a fight club so that we can be real men"" and that is irresponsible filmmaking.",Fight Club
2095,dennizman,"Absolutely Brilliant, Pitt's Best Ever Performance!",10,2 December 1999,"This is by far the best film i have seen in a long time, it is a cinematic masterpiece, full of amazing twists in what is an exceptional story line.Brad Pitt delivers what I would say is his best ever movie performance as Tyler Durdan, Brilliant !.This film is a must see, it is absolutely fantastic, brilliantly written and performed.My IMDB Rating - 10 out of 10",Fight Club
2096,nicneven-2,More than a kick in the teeth,9,2 December 1999,"A lot of people, having no other information than the purposely vague first promotional preview, will go see this movie because of the fight scenes. And sure enough, they get plenty of them-blood and guts (and teeth) included. Still, this movie actually has a plot, and it's not another rehash a la ""Bloodsport"" or ""Best of the best"". People are not punching each other to death for money or for some misplaced and misguided sense of honor. This is not Ultimate Fighting on film.Edward Norton plays one side of a coin. An ordinary Joe who is torn between self-pity because of his drab, meaningless existence, and a growing self-loathing triggered by a feeling of having sold out to ""the system"". Helena Bonham Carter and Meatloaf provide hilarious performances as perpetual support group attendees, adding just the right amount of dark humor for the viewers to let their guard down. Enter Brad Pitt as Tyler Durden, the face of anti-establishment, the voice of the rage.Tyler Durden is the type of character you follow around with a morbid fascination, scared of what he might do next but shivering with anticipation because you can't wait to see it. He hovers menacingly in our peripheral vision waiting for the moment when our consciousness will be caught off guard. And the rest. is something you'll have to see for yourself. Go see Fight Club. and when you're done mopping up your brains from the floor, see it again.",Fight Club
2097,Bonneyboy,interesting but isn't really consistent about its theme,8,28 December 1999,"There seems to be a great emphasis on how the film tries to rap consumerism and conformity. The really strange thing is how the film itself contains a message of consumerism and conformity. At the end (without revealing more), the nihilistic Tyler is defeated but his goal is achieved. A typical happy ending? Also, while the ""twist"" is a stunner, it's not unprecedented. To say more would be too revealing. It doesn't pack an emotional wallop like The Sixth Sense or 12 monkeys; we just go,""Oh that's what's going on... without providing any sense of ballast. And let's not forget that the Fight Club seems to be a pseudo cult, and if there's anything that imposes rules and conformity among its members, it's a cult. The film's absolutely brilliant in its 1st hour but once ""the plan"" is started, it gets too involved, resembling the X files conspiracy complication. However, kudos to the director for making such a cinematic film - all kinds of clever tricks employed, mixing surrealism so subtly that in the end, it still seems like a wild dream. the settings are stunning and for once, violence is shown to be ugly rather than glorified. The actors rise to the challenge, though Norton's muscular physique somehow ruins the essential contrast between him and Pitt. Bonham-Carter is OK but she doesn't get the chance to showcase her acting skills - you have got to see her in The Wings of the Dove. And Pitt is the man we all want to be, and the dominatrix side of his character is irresistable. His pseudo-WWF costume is hilarious and I bet Tyler is just perfect for WWF. In the end, that's the only thing wrong with the Fight Club. It feels like a WWF show, plenty of violence but essentially harmless and stress-relieving, as a form of therapy. It has a very stagey feel, losing any sense of realism- the film's only death is treated comically. It's definitely not the best film of '99- my choices are either being john malkovich, which doesn't rely on a trick ending but constantly produces surprises, all about my mother, which relies on characters throughout rather than flashy techniques or complicated plot, and a film that resembles the fight club in its crusade against conformity; American Beauty. Some scenes are similar; the blackmailing of the boss and the ""who cares"" attitude but American Beauty is much more original and disconcerting because it hits harder and closer. It revolves around the family rather than the individual and the re-examination of beauty in the final montage is the lovliest thing this summer. Thus The Fight Club is the 4th best film for me.",Fight Club
2098,scrooge-10,Exceptional,9,4 January 2000,"What can I say, except that this film really surprised me. I began watching this movie with a couple of friends, not knowing what to expect, but was pretty sure it would be worth the time watching it, consider all excitement from the media. This film is almost perfect. Edward Norton did a great job acting a man with emotionally problems as well as mental aberration. The narrative is brilliant, it´s actually based on a novel by Chuck Palahniuk, credits to him.The violence was there, showing us some extremly drawnouted fighting scenes. Like it, or dislike it. Personally I think it was just enough disgusting for my liking. Half way in this movie something exhaustive happens. It really knocked me down. You have to see it, otherwise you will remain unknowing:) Now afterwards it was definitely worth the time. I really enjoyed it. All assumptions speaks for a pleasant 2 hours.",Fight Club
2099,Bionic_Antboy,What's up with this movie's popularity?,1,16 December 1999,"Fight Club hooks you fast, and has a lot going for it.  Fincher does a great job directing, and Pitt and Norton are great as well.  Unfortunately, the last 20 minutes, with it's clever little twist, totally ruined it for me. I think that the basic ideas behind the book got lost in the translation (to a certain extent, but not completely).",Fight Club
2100,i_are_god,Uhh...,10,30 December 1999,"Do people actually read these comments anyway?  Well, yeah, it seems that most people enjoyed Fight Club.  Oddly I wonder if the majority of the public actually understood the theme of the movie, or maybe the American public simply enjoyed the ""satire"" or happy go lucky violence.  I give Fincher credit for having massive picture effects and for creating this masterpiece of fascist and male chauvinistic propoganda.
Fight Club started out great.  The first 30 minutes were billiant.  Then where did they go wrong?  The movie was inconsistent between two parallels: State of Nature (State of War, a.k.a. anarchy, chaos, basically the opposite of society) and conformity.  It seemed like Fincher wanted to direct a movie about everything flawed in our society today, hitting subjects like individuality, equality, pragmatism (reality), etc.  but it was so...uniform and aimed at the general public that it fails to show WHY we are not our khakis.  And oh dear god, what screams establishment more than popular culture references?  So it constantly contradicts itself.  No...it doesn't, oh yeah it does, we aren't our khakis and pain is reality.  Blah blah blah.
Another thing, the whole theme of the movie is that our realities are so contorted by materialism that even pleasure isn't ""real"" anymore and that the only thing that's ""real"" and can save us is pain, i.e. getting punched in the face.  Yet this theme wasn't really executed in the movie.  It seemed more like 2 hours of sweaty men punching each other out!  I consider myself extremely liberal but I realize the needs of conformity in a society! Without uniformity to some degree, I assure you, 99.9% of our civilization would be lost.  Let's just throw away 5000 years of evolution and let natural selection kill everyone off except for people who're like Brad Pitt. Maybe I'm over analyzing, maybe I'm just too old-fashioned for all the new, hip anarchist-capitolists, but in my opinion, if people want exhilarating violence and male chauvinism (Fight Club failed to show the role of women in the cool new facist-anarchist empire we have a duty to create!)  they should go see the new James Bond movie or something, which was exactly what Fight Club is, minus the quasi-political subliminal messages:  ALL FLUFF!",Fight Club
2101,bathos7,Think for yourself,9,9 January 2000,"Yes, I thought that this was a great film, Finchers ability to mold and sculpt film is an amazing visual ride.No, I had no urge to punch anyone, or start any Fight Clubs after the film. There isn't any irresponsibility of anyone that made this film.  They presented it, and it's up to you to watch it and decide for YOURSELVES what it means to you. I love when I watch something and it creates all sorts of questions inside my head.  It's a failure if it doesn't spark something inside of yourself, whether hate, love, confusion, etc...   Fight Club did this for me.",Fight Club
2102,spooky-61,"Stunning, superb, brilliant",9,6 May 2000,"Fight Club is an astonishing film, probably the best film of 1999.  David Fincher delivers an incredible assault on the senses with pumping action, brilliantly choreographed fight scenes and amazing special effects and camera work.  The final twist ties up all the loose ends and confusing elements to the film which threaten to slightly ruin the overall feel of the movie until it is revealed.  I, personally, was very pleased to see Edward Norton receiving more screen time than Brad Pitt, who all the focus was on before the film was released.  Norton is definitely proving to be one of the most promising acting talents of the 21st century.  In his short career he has already picked up 2 oscar nominations for his excellent performances in American History X and Primal Fear.  Again, in Fight Club, his acting talents are fully exposed as his narration as well as his on screen time are both superb.  The cast is, on the whole, excellent with Brad Pitt taking a dramatic and essentially well judged career move and Helena Bonham Carter delivering a strangely awkward but overall effective performance.  The violence is brutal and bloody but never over the top or glamourised in any way.  Fight Club is a fantastic black comedy and is frequently hilarious, for instance, stealing bags of fat from a bin outside the back of a liposuction clinic to make soap!  GENIUS!  Bettering the excellent 'Seven' was always going to be tough but Fincher just about pulls it off with this powerhouse of a movie that everybody must see!  *9/10*",Fight Club
2103,ohaugan,Love or hate?,8,23 January 2000,"What can I say: Some people might love this film. They may worship it, and analyse it till their death. Others might think it really sucks! I was somewhere in the middle. It's a well made movie, but it didn't capture me. But I don't regret seeing it though.",Fight Club
2104,Mezzanine,Definitely not what you expect...,9,19 January 2000,"I went to see this movie knowing that it was directed by 'that guy who did se7en' and it was supposed to be pretty good!!  I was expecting some boxing type flick where Pitt works his way up the ranks or some such thing....How wrong could I have been...I walked out of the cinema 2 hours later in a daze.I love films that keep you on the edge never letting you know exactly whats happening or where the plots going to lead.  Fincher does this brilliantly, I looked into his past films and realised hes done it well with most of his other films inc The Game and Se7en.It has his usual dark feel, some amazing camera work and enough twists to completely lose yourself!  Norton and Pitt work extremly well together and both put in superb performances.The only thing I would moan about is the ending, Fincher seems to always let down there (Se7en being an exception) Alien3, The Game and Fight Club have brilliant ideas, they keep you watching on the edge of the seat but you get to the end and you feel somehow let down...Suffice to say I would recommend this to everyone (although some squimish people may find some of the fight scenes a bit much).  It will definitely hit a cord with the male audience when we get asked 'what has become of male man in modern society?'.  Definitely one of my favourite films of '99!",Fight Club
2105,jdomen,This movie will blow your mind!,9,6 June 2000,"Natural Born Killers meets the Sixth Sense meets Twelve Monkeys meets Jacob's Ladder meets Angel Heart meets the Matrix meets Killing Zoe. Need I say more? If you like any or all of the above films, this one's a no miss. Don't be turned off by what was a failed marketing plan that totally missed the intended audience and completely misrepresented what the film was about. That's why most of the people who should've seen this film didn't go, but I believe this will gain cult status on video once word of mouth spreads among those who the film was truly meant to be seen by in the first place.",Fight Club
2106,braziiiil,Pure Genius,10,22 January 2000,"I dont often say this about a movie...in fact only 5 films have deserved my 10/10 vote, this is one!Brad Pitt in possibly his finest ever role ( My girlfriend agreed, mmm) This film has absolutely everything and will keep you thinking for about a month after seeing it. But I musnt say any more because remember ""first rule of fight club is that you tell no-one about fight club""",Fight Club
2107,Seano-3,This film is Jack's brilliance,10,12 February 2000,"Okay, as an 18 year old male, I could well be seen as part of the perfect target audience for this film where Brad Pitt and Edward Norton instigate old-fashioned fighting. However, what I got out of this movie goes far beyond the somewhat superficial desire to just see cool fighting. If you are hesitant to see it because you don't appreciate this simple desire, you could well be missing out on a memorable personal experience.The movie tackles many issues pertinent to today. For me, it toys with the audience throughout on what the true message of the film is. It talks of the modern consumerist nature of our times, where people are exposed to buy products which are seemingly essential, but far too luxurious to be warranted as part of a survival kit. It delves into man's desire to fight and see blood in a slightly similar way as Kubrick's Eyes Wide Shut dealt with certain sexual desires, where I hope people get the message to not necessarily act on their desire to fight, but are honest to themselves about the desire. However I fear that very real Fight Clubs are being organised worldwide now!When the ""His name is Robert Paulsen"" scene comes, one can think the main message of the film is making a statement about sociological and propaganda effects when one has a powerful tool to influence people.*Possible Spoiler in following paragraph*But when the plot twist comes the biggest message of the film comes out, to me at least. Be honest and resolve your inner conflicts. Even though the film shows this in an insane man, it can be a lesson to all to look at oneself and ask what one wants, and whether it is the best for them. It has a positive tone too in that it says one can do what one wants, from becoming a leader to being incredible in bed.I must state that these are the messages I got out of the film personally. Unlike Taxi Driver where the messages are extracted in a character driven film, I found this to be a plot and character driven film which makes one make their own deductions. It doesn't tell you the messages, it delves into the issues and makes you deduct the messages.Accusations that Fight Club is a male film are certainly justified for the obvious reasons. However, women can certainly enjoy this movie just as much as I did when one goes beyond seeing groups of men fight and watch each other.The film is also seriously funny. It has been labelled a dark comedy which is certainly apt in both respects. From tremendous dialogues (like the ""I am Jack's..."" moments) to really witty concepts like being addicted to support groups. How do you cure that addiction? Make a support group for it? One immediately sees the problem.Fincher's direction is brilliant. Certain scenes ammount to perfection with many innovations used successfully. Norton's performance was superb, and I bet Pitt didn't have to be asked twice when he was offered the role of Tyler Durden, an epitome of what one wants to be. What a cool performance.The movie also quickly delves into the seemingly quiet period the world is going through, where previous historical events totally overshadow our everyday life. I amount this to the difficulty of seeing the present time in a historical context. Saying this, I hope this movie will be seen as a possible historical definition of the modern times we live in.",Fight Club
2108,Mad John,full of surprises..,9,27 May 2000,"Brad pitt was always just one for the ladies.. 12 monkeys changed that and this takes it one step further than Se7en. One of the most surprising movies I've seen as I thought it would be awful and it really delivers on all counts, with (for once) intelligent use of a soundtrack.

Not only was it the most visually breathtaking piece of celluloid that has ever been realised, but it contains at its je blck heart a truth that no self respecting man can shirk from. Who can honestly admit to wanting to beat the hell out of simply for no more than a minor incident? Brad Pitt gives a career defining performance, portraying a charater that we all want to exist within us, but is so far from societys projection of perfection we are scared to admit itPeople say tht american beauty is a stunning piece of cinema with a universally true moral- everthing we do can be seen as beautiful. that is a litlle too disney for my liking.Fight Club somes it up the best, we work we dont like to buy **** we dont need.tyler is part of every man, just not as much as we would like",Fight Club

2113,heathbobo37,Entertaining and Enlightening,10,27 June 2000,"This movie is easily one of my favorites of all time. It was both entertaining and enlightening, something many movies try to  achieve but fail to accomplish. The story is engrossing and you cant stop watching. As soon as the credits roll, youll want to see it again, and mostly likely again. This movie is not for all, its more oriented to the 30 and under crowd. It is a great divergence from the Reality Bites type of Gen X movies. The plot twist is completely out of left field, but makes sense and the ending is one of the best in cinematic history. The DVD is the best ever, and is worth the money to buy a DVD player just to see it.",Fight Club
2114,notesfromunderground,Great film!,10,17 July 2001,"Fight Club is a great film that stands up to repeated viewing, and actually gets better the more you watch it.  In fact, I recommend watching it at least twice to catch the double meaning in a lot of the dialogue and to understand all the characters' motivations.  I showed this to my Parents and they hated it, but they couldn't get past the violence to see the meaning behind the story.  Edward Norton also mentioned that many of the critics who raved about 'The Graduate' (a great movie as well) panned 'Fight Club' despite the fact that the central themes are similar.  Both movies are about someone pigeon-holed into society's view of how their life should be, and finding some way to break free of that while at the same time realizing what is important to them.  Where 'The Graduate' takes a more conventional and easy to follow path 'Fight Club' goes more cerebral and psychological path to about the same end.  Not only that, but the performances are fantastic, the direction and cinematography are excellent, and the writing is not only witty (sometimes down right hilarious and very quotable in everyday life) but also tight and magnificent.  I actually enjoyed the film more than the book.",Fight Club
2115,seattlecoffeedrinker,NOT the testosterone-filled flick I expected,9,28 May 2000,"I won't go on about the story line like some.  This movie is excellent. Acting was great-once again, Edward Norton, your the man- and dispite Brad Pitt's rep as being the man more infamously known for his good looks than his acting, he proved me wrong. Can I go on about how great the twists and turns the film had?  I won't, but it was all good.  I haven't seen this complicated of a plot since ""Being John Malkovich"". In fact, watching the whole film, especially towards the end, was kind of like being IN Malkovich's head. I think I should also call attention to the great job the writers did. I saw the previews and expected some stupid excuse of a violent action movie.  I overcame those prejudices, saw it, and loved it.  Yes, it's violent, and yes, it has about as much testosterone as a stadium full of hockey players, but it's also as dark and fast and scary as an indoor roller coaster.",Fight Club

2117,felix0884,My kind of movie,8,7 June 2000,"This is one of those movies where you can either really like it or dislike it depending on your mindset.  I like this movie because it explores peoples imaginations, and tells a story of a person in need of help.  **POTENTIAL SPOILER**  It shows that the imaginary friend can be a source of support in someones life.  Brad Pitt's character, Tyler Durden was everything that Edward Norton wanted to be, he looked better, acted more courageously, and was a more exciting person.  Most of the movie, before the secret is revealed, is all a part of edward norton's imagination.  He didnt realize until he actually became his creation, that he was imagining tyler.This movie shows that everyone in the world cries for help, and is answered in very unusual ways.

Once again we have stumbled across a timeless classic, a movie to be remembered for the ages! Edward Norton , currently one of the best actors today portrays the character perfectly. Brad Pitt, couldnt have been better cast as Tyler Durden, as i personlly am not a fan of Pitt but liked him in this movie. The movie is based on one of the best written scripts ever written and i suggest you see this movie as soon as you can as it can be ruined for you in one sentance. This movie rebels against everyday hollywood scripts, and makes its own formula to success instead of following the same old boring repetitive storylines.

2119,Wienis,MAD COOL MOVIE,10,11 June 2000,"When Fight Club first came out, I really didn't want to see it.  My friend tried to persuade me, but I thought it would just be a movie with Brad Pitt walking around without a shirt for 2 hours, and guys beating the hell out of each other.  However, I just finished watching (the same friend finally convinced me) and it was MAD AWESOME!!!  I managed to mix awesome blood and violence while successfully satirizing pop culture and modern masculinity. I could tell that it was going to be cool when I first saw Brad Pitt flash in for a frame three times in the opening scenes (my friend didn't see it, but he did see the giant wiener at the end, go figure).

If you haven't seen this movie yet, you should, unless you have a weak stomach.  I don't see why it was snubbed by the Oscars.  The title makes it seem like it is just a movie about fighting and then when you get around the ending, BAM! it takes you by surprise!  I have heard that people could easily predict the ending, but I highly doubt it! If you liked the surprise ending that Sixth Sense had, this movie might have the same effect or even a greater effect on you.  In my opinion it was better than Sixth Sense.",Fight Club
2122,tylerdurden_soap_maker,"Tired of Crappy Movies like American Beauty? Give ""Oscar Worthy"" Fight Club A Try.",10,30 June 2000,"Soap, mischief, mayhem, movie making genius. Once again, Hollywood has proven that the Oscar's do not mean crap. Fight Club is the soap that cleanses theaters of such ""high tech"" garbage as Independence Day and such unreal garbage as American Beauty (want to see a real disturbing look at society, try the Ice Storm). Fight Club is blend of surreal images, moody backdrops, viewer/narrator interaction, incredible music,dark humor, and soap. Just the opening sequence alone (perhaps the best ever, giving new meaning to ""in medias res"") will cause you to salivate like a rabid canine. Oh, I did mention this is a political film? Anyways, the premise seems simple enough. The narrator of the film, who we will call ""Jack,"" is an insomniac trapped in a dead-end, worker bee, corporate job. The only other important aspect of Jack's life is his condo filled with clever art, Swedish furniture, and a refrigerator full of condiments. That is, until Jack meets Tyler Durden, an eccentric fellow he meets on an air plane. Jack soon learns that Tyler is full of ""useful information."" There are two insanely glorious scenes that take place during and after his meeting with Tyler. Once scene involves a new look at airline emergency manuals and the other involves a hilarious look at dildos and vibrating luggage-- not to be missed. Anyways, enough about the plot. The film is one big Goodyear blimp full of anti-corporate messages and the lie of the ""so-called information age."" In fact, it find it totally amazing this film even made it to theaters! The same corporate mush heads who the film admonishes are the same people who finance this picture (the fine people at Fox, ""when corporate scumbags attack!! Next on Fox.) This is,however, the same reason Fight Club hopped in and out of the theater and failed to gain ol' Oscar's attention. In fact, if you see the trailers for the movie, it looks like ""See Brad Pitt fight, see Brad Pitt take off his shirt, see Fight Club."" They tried to sell the movie for everything it wasn't. The movie is a sharp, brutally honest, social commentary, and the acting was phenomenal. Ed Norton is incredible as always, and Brad Pitt plays Tyler to perfection. They originally thought of casting Sean Penn as Tyler, but believe me only Brad could have pulled this one off. Fight Club, Three Kings, Being John Malkovich are three films that have raised my expectations of film making; they are what Hollywood should be. But of course like any film with a message, with intelligent writing, that makes people think and question ends up in the La Brea Tar pit of Hollywood. So until Oscar finds the many creative uses of soap (watch the film), it is up to you to discover what great movie making is all about.",Fight Club
2123,ruinernin,The best film ever made.,10,19 July 2000,"Fight Club captures a great filmmaker at his best.  David Fincher is a genius behind the camera, but it's not just the unique directing in this movie that makes it so good.  A rare combination of great acting, directing and writing all play a part in the brilliance of this film.  This is a great psychological thriller about a man with deep seeded emotional problems who is living in an ersatz world that he subliminally despises.  The climax comes in the classic Poe style surprise ending which only adds to the thrill of this unpredictable plot.  If you like suspense, drama, or David Fincher, this is the movie to see.  I absolutely loved it.",Fight Club

Cynical Hollywood manipulations that make fools of their fans.Within the theatre walls, we vent vicariously with the main characters about the evils of consumerism, then what do we do after the credits roll?

2127,MrPerfect,A movie that appalled most and seems preachy but had alot of truths.,10,6 August 2000,"Fight Club was scorched by critics but may turn out to be a movie with a ""cult"" following. This movie was burned by critics for being mindlessly violent and over preaching at times. Which, is for the most part, true. But hidden in the script of this movie are alot of truths.Violence in this movie is necessary, I think, to get the point across that sometimes we really do want to just go with a feeling we have and to just let go.The only real complaint I have with the movie is it spirals downward at the end going from a creative plot to a typical action movie act 3. The big appeal about this movie to me is the unpredictable plot twist near the end. All in all, Fight Club is one of my favorite movies.",Fight Club
2128,khavanon,"Well underrated, this movie exposes everything about being force fed ""the way things ought to be"" while revealing the opposing path which is equally vile.",9,19 September 2000,"Many people in the media who have trashed this movie about how it glorifies violence never really understood it at all. It's a wonder how these people get paid to simply miss the point.(Spoiler!) This story is about a man (we were never told his name, something we didn't notice until we consciously thought about it) who was living an existence of monotony, but had been seeking a way to change his life. Incapable of making this change on his own, he creates a personality, named Tyler Durden, who acted separately of himself (unbeknownst to us, we are led to believe that he is in actuality a separate individual), through whom he functioned as a carefree opponent of the monotonous, binding society ""in which we live."" Tyler taught our protagonist how to become free of all his worries, and aimed to help others to do so by becoming chaotic. Near the end, the main character realized that this extreme personality was in fact himself, and he struggled to alleviate this illusion to protect everyone from his mayhem. Still incapable of doing so, the main character was at the mercy of his split personality Tyler until finally, in a bit of desperation, he told Tyler that he had finally understood (and we believe him). The main character forever rid himself of Tyler by shooting himself in the mouth, the bullet exiting the back of his jaw, symbolically killing Tyler in a rather grotesque, but darkly humorous manner.The point of course was not to emphasize the amount of violence, though it was attractive, but to show that there are two sides to any way of life, and we must find a balance between the two so we are not perpetuating madness within ourselves, whether it be monotony or chaos.",Fight Club
2129,mitestar,The anti-establishment masterpiece,10,4 January 2001,"Fight Club is a rare movie.  It is one of those movies that stress the anti-establishment movement in this country.  This movie can be taken many ways.  Simplistically, it can be taken as a good story of a guy who hates his job and tries to change it.  Dramatically and philosophically, it can be taken as a deeply moving movie.  The Narrator, played by Edward Norton, is the poster boy for the Mass Market Consolidation of America.  He wears his CK Shirts, his DKNY pants, and sleeps in his IKEA bed.  Throughout the course of this movie, he eliminates all of his material possessions to shed his human skin.  And then comes the Fight Club.
Critics like Roger Ebert condemned Fight Club due to its `Graphic displays of violence.'   I am forced to disagree.   While one might admit that the fighting scenes might be a bit graphic for some people, it has its place in the movie.  The fighting is a simplistic way of coming to terms with the animal instincts that we are bred with. `It isn't about winning or losing,' The Narrator states.  It isn't about trying to kill the other guy; it is about releasing all of the emotions that we are forced to suppress.  After a hard fought battle, the 2 competitors embrace, and there are no ill tempers. The fighting is pure in essence, and is analogous to the Bible.  The 10 Commandments are similar to the Rules of Fight Club.  The 1st and 2nd rules of Fight Club are, `Do not talk about Fight Club!'   The 3rd rule of Fight Club is if someone taps out, goes limp, says I quit, the fight is over. The 3rd rule is intact so people do not cause serious physical damage to each other.    As the Commandments were made to secure the humanity in man, the Rules of Fight Club were also meant to do the same.
The Narrator, with the help of Tyler Durden, played by Brad Pitt, tries to form his own reality.  He enlists people to commit acts of social disobedience.  One can see these acts as petty and trivial.  Another can see these as acts against the establishment.  They desensitize all of the movies in blockbuster, they destroy a computer store, and they try to tear down a local coffee shop.   The people trained to do this are like drones.  They are taught not to think for themselves, and to do as they are told.  Robert Paulsen, played by Meatloaf, says, `The 1st rule of Project Mayhem is you do not ask questions.'  Tyler Durden tells his minions, `You are not a beautiful and unique snowflake.  You are the same piece of decaying matter as the rest of us.'  This destruction of the human spirit has destroyed the individualizing qualities that make man special.
The Narrator is taught by Tyler to believe that to achieve success, one must hit rockbottom.  Not just thinking you are there, but actually being at rockbottom.  Tyler explains, `What do you think hitting rockbottom is like some kind of a switch that can be turned on or off at will?'  With this, Tyler proceeds to put HCL Acid on The Narrator's wrist, which immediately starts to dissolve.  When the ordeal is over, it leaves a burn scar all over The Narrator's wrist that will stay there forever.  Another case is when Tyler starts to drive on the wrong side of the road.  He waits to see whether The Narrator is going to try to take charge of the situation. Tyler starts, `If you were to die now, would you be happy with your life?' The Narrator responds, `No, get on the right side of the road.  All right, what do you want to hear? I am not proud of my life.  I have nothing good to say about my life.'  Tyler reacts,  `Look at you, you're pathetic, just let it go man, just let it go.'  After that, the car crashes, nearly killing all inside.  Rock bottom has just been hit.
This movie is very powerful, down to the very end.  It has massive social implications that apply to all human beings.  This movie stresses how we are becoming a commercialized culture that is constantly being desensitized to all off the negative emotions that we experience.  Why should one care if people in Somalia are starving, if we have our Kraft Macaroni and Cheese and are listening to the Backstreet Boys on our Sony Home Theatres?  Why should one care if the animals in China are being abused and mistreated if we are driving our Cadillac's with the roof down, with our children playing their Gameboys and watching their movie on a portable DVD player.  This movie shows us why we should care, and what will happen if people don't.",Fight Club

It is one of the few films of the past five years that deserves to be seen multiple times.  In fact, if you have seen it only once, you have missed something.  I was seriously hoping the movie would receive Oscar nominations for Best Actor (Norton), Best Screenplay, Best Director, Best Cinematography and Best Picture.So, how is it that the film received no nominations? Unfortunately, it had a mismatched ad campaign.  The ads made it seem like the movie was about street boxing, instead of a intellectual and emotional ride through a man's psyche as he takes a strange path toward rebellion against consumer society. As a result, most who went to see it were disappointed, and those who would recognize its brilliance stayed far away from the movie theaters.  This is one of the most underrated movies I know.I always love movies that keep you entertained and keep you guessing, and this movie scores a 10 in both.

2135,mersault3b,An exceptionally poor film,1,11 January 2001,"A day after the experience, I am still trying to reconcile how the man who was responsible for the magnificent subtlety of ""Seven"" could create such garbage.  Yes, the violence was gratuitous and excessive, but oddly enough that was the least of this films worries.Where to begin?  The plot was ridiculous on it's face, absolutely incoherent and nonsensical.  The various themes of the movie were amplified and remarkably shallow, showing no real insight into the problems of our society.  Ours is an overly commercial culture?  This is neither original nor especially interesting, especially when repeated ad nauseam.Fincher's direction and sophomoric MTV-style presentation did nothing to help a script that never got any further than ""live free or die"" (with minor variations).  Most of the dialogue reminded me of something my high school English teacher used to say when her students ventured out of their league: ""That's so deep it's shallow"".  This succinctly describes the handling of every major theme in the film.Then there are the performances.  Edward Norton, an otherwise gifted actor, does little with the simplistic character he's given.  There is no complexity to this character whatsoever and Norton can do nothing to help define him.  His early attempts at playing the neurotic are particularly unconvincing.  Brad Pitt has more to work with in the Tyler Durden character, but his tendency to overplay absolutely everything about his character (even beyond what the script calls for, or should have called for) makes Norton's performance seem that much more vapid.  Helena Bonham Carter simply showed up; throughout the movie, one had the feeling that she desperately wanted to be somewhere else.  It seems hard to blame her.Had this been the work of any number of other directors I could name, it would be easy to dismiss the overheated message of this film.  Fincher is capable of such subtlety and craftsmanship that it is hard to believe he could put his name to such a juvenile, simplistic film.  One hopes that ""Seven"" is not the only thing of beauty we see from Mr. Fincher.",Fight Club

I caught the last play at the local cinema, sat on my own in the smallest screen, and boy am I glad I did see it!Included in the DVD box set (R2) is a selection of quotes from well known US and UK newspapers, in every one the film is slagged off. Many of the critics have obviously not seen the film for what it is. Now looking at the votes on IMDB, the film is in the top 50 films of all time. The film got No Oscars, no Globes, no industry awards. What does this tell us?It may be a very long film, but after watching it for the 2nd time, you begin to notice how extremely important each and every frame is to the overall picture.

2137,Lopecita,OUTSTANDING!!!,10,30 November 2000,"After the previews I saw I was not excited about seeing the film. The scenes of fight, the scent of violence, the blood splitting everywhere is not my idea of a great movie. BUT, first: this is not just a movie. Second: previews -in an average percentage- are 98 to 100 a joint of images that has nothing to do with the movie itself. And third: THE MOVIE WAS NOT ABOUT THE KIND OF FIGHT -meaningless and ridiculous- that guys for any reason could -and do- have. This film TURNED ON MY BRAIN in a way that only those who wanna take a chance and see it will certainly experience. I can tell, this movie is as powerful enough to change lives. Edward Norton, as always, is by all means gifted. He can make you feel anything and everything just with a gesture. From my humble position of an amateur actress I envy his skills and I'm willing to go to hell for this sin. It is amazing the way he works and the feelings he manages with, like a magician... taking them out of his top-hat soul and making them appear in ours. That's magic. That's talent. That's him. God did not touched him, God grabbed him! Brad Pitt is an amazing actor too, and together they are unbeatleable...! Dinamite for emotions. Soap plus other stuff, you know...This cast, Palahniuk's idea and Fincher's direction made this movie a story that could not be possibly better. I hardly recommend this movie to EVERYBODY, specially to those who are in their 20's. You, male or female, will feel with an amazing intensity how close you are to Norton's character. Won't, can't and don't want to say anything else. This is not a movie to spoil with 'previous words'. But see it, feel it, get amazed and then talk by yourself. The 'after words' will be inevitable.

Brad Pitt was good, if out of place. Ed Norton delivers his dialogue as if he were asleep and comes across as a second-rate John Cusack wanna-be. Helen Carter is funny in parts and Meatloaf is just hilarious. Thumbs in the middle for this one.

Just as Lester Burnham is tired with his ""little life"", our hero (Ed Norton) needs to make some changes. He gets help from Brad Pitt, who comes to help ""deliver him from Swedish furniture"".  He repeats the words that are too true yet so difficult to admit.  You are not your job, you are not the car you drive, you are NOT your khakis.  Pitt tries to impart the wisdom that the stuff you own ends up owning you.  Just like Spacey told Bening ""It's just a couch"".  This film cannot be recommended strongly enough.

This is the film which maybe makes you think it completely includes fight scenes or any kind of but you ll be wrong sure because it is not all about. This is also the film that changed my whole perspective to all movies, now i can begin watching every movies with lots of negative comments, many times i say i saw that before, i saw the best of it and it cannot impress me anymore, so, so. Fight club includes so many negative criticism about our regular accustomed lifestyles. It said we are nothing but without our goods but it is not at all.And once for all ; The first rule of the Fight Club is, you do not talk about the Fight Club and The second rule of the Fight Club is, you do not talk about Fight Club.",Fight Club

2156,Films_of_Ophelia,Genius!,10,8 March 2001,"This film can be described in one word: genius.A white-collar, middle-class, boring man (Norton) who suffers from IKEA obsessions and insomnia does on a downward spiral when he meets and befriends a charismatic stranger named Tyler Durden (Pitt) through unfortunate events. Together, they from their own secret society type of cult for disillusioned men like themselves called ""Fight Club"", in which they beat the hell out of each other for a catharic release from the materialistic society they wish to escape.Everything is peachy keen until a chainsmoking she-Devil aquaintance of IKEA boy's named Marla interferes with he and Tyler's friendship by means of sex and seduction. Marla (Carter) begins a physical relationship with Tyler, while she and IKEA boy engage in a challenging, deeper love/hate relationship. Marla opens his eyes to how carried away ""Fight Club"" has grown, (now referred to as ""Project MAYHEM""), and everything begins to fall apart into the pieces of the puzzle that complete this story in the mind-blowing finale. Fight Club illustrates the growing isolation we feel from each other and the crazy ways we fulfil our need to be drawn back together. It's an intriguing look at underground culture and the spiritual release it brings.This is the A Clockwork Orange of our generation. This is my favorite film in the world. It has changed the way I see things. This movie literally rips you from your chair, beats the s**t out of you, and spits you back out...and damn, does it feel EUPHORIC! ;-)",Fight Club
2157,willdavison,An Absolute Masterclass in Filmmaking!,10,28 April 2021,"David Fincher's Fight Club is a mix of brilliant technique, hallucinatory story-telling, and phenomenal acting. In a scene-by-scene breakdown of this film, there are zero flaws. Each composition is curated perfectly to foreshadow an unsettling twist. Imaginative, lurid, and an immense amount of undulation, Fight Club gives people watching a punch in the face with masculinity. The illusory feeling that drives Ed Norton's character forces audiences to keep their eyes on the screen. Combined with Brad Pitt's impressive screen presence and Helen Bonham Carter's masterfully captivating yet provocative portrayal of Marla. The acting in Fight Club is nothing short of perfection. The imagery can articulate such a message by using a sui generis style of colour grade that Fincher has since made famous. Fight Club is intelligent, savage and witty, and remains one of my favourite films of all time.",Fight Club

I personally thought that 1999 was the best year for movies to come along in a long time. I don't have any complaints about this movie. The acting was great, the directing was great, the writing was great and the production for this movie was nothing less than great. I didn't even think I was going to like it at all because the commercials didn't do the movie justice. But I went to see it anyways. I'm glad I did because it turned out to be way better than I could have expected. Edward Norton hasn't disappointed me yet and if all of his movies turn out to be as good as they have been so far, I think he has one hell of a career ahead of him. Go see this movie. After that, go see it again. When your done with that, go buy it on video and DVD and watch it two more times. Trust me on this one.",Fight Club

Chuck Palahniuks legendary character Tyler Durden is perfectly portrayed by Pitt, in most likely his best acting role ever. You'll quickly understand the cult following behind Durden and why so many people envy the dark, yet all too real thought processes he holds. Tyler Durden carries the story in Fight Club, and Brad Pitt portrayal carries the movie. If there is ever a time you find yourself questioning your purpose in this world, Tyler Durden's nihilistic nature will undoubtedly send you into the pits of realization that you are not what you think you are.",Fight Club

A game changer in color bringing in a greenish tint to the film, Fincher goes into the mind of his characters and shoots right through to their souls.
Known for his excessive takes, Fincher continues to film until he gets it just right. And Edward Norton is fabulous as he takes us on the journey as the Narrator in this story which was originally written by best-selling novelist Chuck Palahniuk.

The number of excellent memorable scenes is mind boggling. Norton thrust himself to the top of the acting class. He is the best at making people know his character instead of knowing his acting quirks. Pitt does a fantastic job of ripping through excellent dialouge and pacing the movie.It is about a man who is living the typical life with a good job and a good apartment. He is in a perpetual rut though of the monotony of his life and he can not sleep. The only way for him to feel alive is to make bad choices and take pain and suffering. That is where pitt comes in who sort of becomes is mentor. The plot goes on from there then is flipped upside down. Youll have to watch it to know what im talking about. 10 out of 10",Fight Club

2173,Nitrorebel,A Critique of Today's Fake Manhood and Consumerism,10,6 May 2001,"Fight Club is easily one of the best films of the past decade. Similar to Taxi Driver or A Clockwork Orange, its reception has been mixed and ambiguous. Like its two illustrious predecessors, though, its portrait of society is spot-on.This is especially true for its poignant satire of the all-pervasive jock mentality in the US. By showing the disillusionment and inferiority complexes of men, it initially seems to bow to the generic macho response: denigrate women by ""hanging with the boys"" and finding oneself in brainless fascism. That's how Hitler recruited youths for the SS and SA, and that's how the WWF and MTV ""recruit"" its viewership. Yet its twist at the end turns the film into an ambiguous, postmodern criticism of its previous 120 minutes. Refusing to be typecast, Fight Club ends with a melodramatic anti-climax that leaves the viewer in a daze as to the film's exact meaning.As most people will tell you, the film's true essence only becomes apparent after a second viewing since one's innocence of the narrative has been lifted. Besides the amazing relevance of its content, be warned of the barrage of subliminal Tylers (can you spot them?) and penises, which together with the hilarious scene where Ed Norton shows Tyler's editing handiwork add to the self-parody of filmmaking in general and the film itself in particular.Be further warned of the aggressive criticism of today's male reactionism. While some have viewed the depiction of fighting as a literal expose of fascist ideology, the film actually denounces the violence it represents, although it does so in a more intellectual and subliminal way than people might be comfortable with.Gary Crowdus' summary of this masterpiece may also be its most accurate appraisal: ""The first film of the 21st century."" Ambiguous?!",Fight Club

2175,fx976,"Better than I expected, but no cigar",7,11 July 2002,"SPOILER ALERT  SPOILER ALERT  SPOILER ALERT SPOILER ALERT SPOILER ALERT The best aspects of ""Fight Club"" are the acting by Brad Pitt and Edward Norton, and the skillful cinematographic techniques and direction by David Fincher. Essentially this is a film about a man named Jack (or something) with a split personality played by Norton who meets the manifestation of his second personality in the form of Brad Pitt, who plays a doppelganger type character by the name of Tyler Durden. Unfortunately Fincher saved the revelation that Durden is a manifestation of Jack's troubled mind for the end. It would have been a stronger movie had we seen from the beginning that Durden is not for real. Enough with these O Henry endings in modern film. They were fine in The Crying Game, the Sixth Sense and The Usual Suspects, but here it comes close to sabotaging the film.  Watching the film, I could not understand why Jack does not do voluntary work for a charity or mentor a kid or maybe change his job if he feels so alienated. At least join a support group for insomniacs! His character would have been more interesting had I known the extent of his problems from the beginning. The film DID capture how easy it is to form cults, with so many dispirited, alienated people living in our society, and it is unfortunately accurate in displaying the repressed anger felt by many young men. The dialogue is better than what you find in most modern movies too, with several memorable lines.  There were individual scenes and performers I liked too.  Again, Pitt and Norton give brilliant performances. So I would give it three and a half stars our of five. Also, anyone who shoots himself in the mouth and survives probably would not have the physically ability to talk, let alone have the willingness to do anything except scream or at least moan uncontrollably. I don't care how much pain you learn to endure from pouring lye on yourself.",Fight Club
2176,blurip,It is more than just a movie about violence.,10,14 May 2001,"This movie is much more than just about violence. Yes, the violence is good; but the plot is more than that.

I was a fool! Please forgive me.The first rule about fightclub is you do not talk about fightclub. Therefore I won`t, and this is really unlike me! I like to rant and rave about movies I like.This is a cult film. It`s impact is growing. It`s easy to be obsessed with, easy to be in love with it`s anti-capitalist centiment.What is fightclub? Political, love story, soul searching, it is the hole in your life.If you were born in any of these decades you must see it immediately; 60`s, 70`s, 80`s.Your children will see this film because it is a classic. Rent it, Buy it, steal it from a friend but, SEE IT!!! You must be part of this movement. It will not answer your questions about life. It will not help your love life but, you will relate to it.Tell no one the ending, tell no one anything about this film other then they must see it.  That way they can experience what I experienced when my house mate finally made me sit down and watch the DVD.I WAS BLOWN AWAY BY THIS MOVIE!And to reassure the girls you, like me can see this film.  You will not feel isolated by the male machismo, you will be astounded by it`s intelligence.

It speaks to a generation that, as Tyler Durden says has no great war or great depression, that rings true no matter what sex you are religion or creed.  For anyone whoever thought, ""is there anyone else out there feeling the same anger and pain that I am at this exact moment?"" then by all means watch this movie.  It will answer with a resounding YES!, then watch the movie about 10 more times to get the full effect. Finally there is not enough room for the praise that Ed Norton, Brad Pitt, David Fincher and company deserve so I'll finish by saying only that if you loved the movie by all means BUY the dvd, and also read the book; it too is excellent.",Fight Club

It takes actually several times to see all the parts clearly unless you're some kind of eagle eye. The sex was invasive, violent and disturbing. Pitt is sometimes a little too deadpan, not a lot of expression. For me this was a real comedy, I was literally rolling on the floor laughing in the 'office'. The fantasy was dreamlike.

The ""fight for a better tomorrow"" aspect was amusing and original, but not profound. I didn't think the acting was all that great overall, but you always have to appreciate Brad Pitt's energy. I think the final worth of a movie is how it pleases, and how it affects the viewers. So without being a spoiler, let me say I was disappointed.

The story seems as though it is going to be quite straight forward but there are several twists which lead you to some strange truths about the characters.Although the ending is slightly bizarre, the film is really great.You probably need to watch it at least twice to get the whole story as you only really see the truth at the end.",Fight Club

He decides to start fighting, just fighting and starts a fight club which grows with a lot of other disappointed men.This is a great observation about how men are made to fight and have fisical exercise all day, but in this society they are locked up in an office all day.Also not a single direction mistake by Fincher and excellent acting by Brad Pitt and Edward Norton.In my opinion Fincher's best.",Fight Club

2204,iuly1983,what a movie,9,7 July 2015,"listering, hallucinatory, often brilliant, the film by David Fincher is a combination punch of social satire and sociopathology. Fight Club may be iconic and technically proficient, but it's more distant than perhaps any film to attain ""modern classic"" status. The trajectory of Fight Club is baffling. In its first hour or so, this picture appears to be a gloriously spiteful and well-acted satire of our bogus contemporary ""crisis of masculinity"": self- pitying guys hugging in groups and claiming victim status - modern consumer society having allegedly rendered the poor dears' hunter- gathering instincts obsolete. But, by the end, it has unravelled catastrophically into a strident, shallow, pretentious bore with a ""twist"" ending that doesn't work. And it is a film which smugly flirts, oh-so-very- controversially, with some of the intellectual and cultural paraphernalia of fascism - but does not have anything like the nerve, still less the cerebral equipment, to back this pose up.Edward Norton gives a compulsively twitchy, nerdy, hollow-eyed performance as Fight Club's Narrator: a 30-year-old single guy with a white collar job in the automotive industry and a secret addiction; he loves attending support groups posing as a sufferer.

2206,pangpang2punches,"Profound standpoint about shackles and freedom, material and spiritual.",10,16 July 2021,"In Nietzsche's philosophy, there are three states of the human mind: the camel, the lion and the baby. The first state camel, endure humiliation, passively obedient to the arrangement of others or fate; The second realm of lion is to change passivity into initiative, from""you should""to""I want"". I will take the initiative to fight for everything and take the responsibility of life. Third state baby, this is an ""I am"" state, living in the moment and enjoying the present.In the US in the 1990s, the domestic economy boomed, giving rise to a surge of middle-class consumerism. What is consumerism? Life goals are closely related to the acquisition of goods, even if those goods are not needed for survival or for the traditional purpose of showing off. In consumerism, people are obsessed with the process of acquiring goods as the basis of their identity. The social system also serves for consumerism, such as designers who are specially responsible for enhancing the attractiveness of goods and ubiquitous advertisements, etc. The biggest spiritual shackles of consumerism lies in this. The process of acquiring goods has become the basis of people's identity.Jack is such a consumerist. He worked in order to make money, and to make money in order to buy more and better material, goods became the purpose of Jack. Jack did the same boring work every day, and his boss was bleeding him. Jack is portrayed as a consumer in a society where consumerism is prevalent, and he is caught in the trap of consumerism, in the cycle of work and consumption. He is a prisoner of the spirit, unable to feel his own worth, unable to feel the vitality of life. He began to lose sleep, and he began to look for a way out of his pain.Jack is a submissive camel enslaved by the material and system, while Tyler is a lion who dares to fight against material society, opposes all rules and advocates spiritual freedom. When Jack met Tyler, fight club was born. Fight makes people devote themselves to it and release their wildness. The pain brought by fight makes people feel their own existence, makes people temporarily break away from the cycle of work and consumption, and makes people throw away all the troubles and discomforts of life. This method is popular with many people and more and more people join fight club. Taylor yearns for a world that reverts to a primal time of instinct, and Taylor still becomes an extremist. Taylor wanted to liberate mankind from modern material and institutional civilization, and he did it by destroying it. But this is not desirable. Although we are constrained by the social value system and rules of modern civilization, they also bring us social order and progress. Although the social value system and rules of modern civilization shackle part of our nature and become the shackles of our spirit, they guarantee the higher efficiency of social operation and the guarantee of our high standard of living. So it is not feasible to throw away material and system completely. So the lion evolved into a baby, and Jack killed Taylor. The baby represents a new birth, re-establishing its own worth and will.In the beginning, we are tamed as a camel, taught what values are and told what to do. Then we began to question and reflect, becoming lions of confrontation and destruction. Eventually we become babies, abandoning our old values and rules and perceiving the world all over again, reevaluating everything we come into contact with. Jack eliminated the split personality of Tyler, brought himself to a state of harmony, reached the infant state. Newborn babies have the will to choose actively, no longer blindly pursue the value defined by the external world, feel their inner world, redefine and create their own value, and achieve spiritual freedom.",Fight Club

The music,the story and the dialogues between the narrator and his friend are great. every time you watch the movie you notice some small differences you didnt know, which makes it even more satisfying.

On a plane for business, the narrator meets Tyler Durden, a man as interesting as he is revolutionary in his thought processes. Tyler offers him his business card and whenever the narrator's apartment burned down that he had so diligently worked for, he takes refuge in Tyler's dilapidated house. The two quickly become good friends, as they unexpectedly create an underground organization called Fight Club that spreads like wildfire across the nation, ultimately serving as a haven for repressed men to expel their bounded stress (which, in turn, replaces the narrator's first need for the support groups). The organization transforms into a faction that eventually terrorizes the free world for their materialistic values, and the narrator loses all sense of control as he comes to find out himself and his beliefs.",Fight Club

I found myself thinking ""wow, that was a brilliant shot"" every five seconds. It was also superbly acted with Brad Pitt, Edward Norton and Helen Bonham- Carter giving performances of a lifetime. Pitt especially manages to make his character Tyler Durden possibly the coolest character ever to grace the silver screen. Norton also manages to make his character superbly awkward and intense.

Where to begin. The man's body is so amazing that he puts an entire Abercrombie catalog to shame.

Go into it with an open mind and be willing to have your perspective contorted in ways you've never imagined. Don't let the end scene disturb you after recent events, keep in mind what they're doing.

I still can't get over how people could possibly think that. Did the movie suck? Definitely not   Was it a decent flick? Yes.The cinemetography , editing, and Fincher's directing were very good. The acting was superb. Brad Pitt delivered an excellent performance as Tyler Durden. And I still believe that Edward Norton is the best young actor today. The first 30-60 minutes were good. When Fight Club gets going and the whole Project Mayhem thing starts, it was a little ridiculous and my interest started to fade. Yes, the violence was entertaining to me,  I AM still 18, but it was definitely a little much. The message that ""you don't know who you are until you get into a fight"" is just silly. And that Edward Norton can only realize that life can contain positive things through this club is pretty sketchy. It's not until the infamous ending that the film TOTALLY falls off in my opinion. The double personality thing turned me off from the movie. It made the rest of the movie seem worthless as opposed to the intended improved.This to me was just your average psychological thriller that fails in it's attempt to kick you in the teeth with ""whoa! that was amazing"" and ends up slapping you in the face with ""wow! nice try, but that is just plain ridiculous""",Fight Club

The story is really confusing at some parts.At least difficult to understand at the first watch.You need to think what's going on.And when you start getting the things,The story takes a U Turn. And you are completely messed up with the story again.The action scenes are good (although the movie doesn't contain many scenes as per the name ""FIGHT CLUB""),The direction, acting.. everything is good.So if you really want to enjoy the movie don't stress at your BRAIN too much.Just enjoy and accept whats going on without going in much detail.",Fight Club

This movie is about much more than fighting, but the fight sequences in it are visually entertaining, and the violence isn't over the top.  Brad Pitt's character, Edward Norton's narration, and Meatloaf's supporting role are all top-notch...and the direction style is engrossing without being obnoxious (obnoxious like Oliver Stone, Or Quentin Tarintino, for instance).

Everything you ever thought about anything.A brilliant film, with Norton giving a shockingly realistic performance, and Pitt trying to distort Norton in every way possible.With a great start, an unbelievable middle, and the 2nd best movie ending ever, only next to Usual Suspects, this movie will really give your brain a cerebral workout.And don't forget to watch it again.

I will always wonder why Brad Pitt and Edward Norton were not even nominated for Oscars when films like Monster's Ball and Shakespeare In Love won best actress Oscars for Halle Berry and Gwyneth Paltrow who were lousy compared to Pitt and Norton but i can guarantee that anyone who sees this film no matter how old they are will not be disappointed.",Fight Club

I think the rating must be skewed because those that were attracted to the topic watched it and those that were not never considered it.Ebert's review was pretty spot-on. ""The Game"" and ""Se7en"" are far better films from the same director that actually have a plot and good dialog. Heck why not rent ""A Clockwork Orange"" which deals with the topic of violence in a far more interesting fashion and if uncut makes this ""Fight Club"" look like a children's story.That this film is ahead of ""The Silence of the Lambs"" or even worse ""Citizen Kane"" shows just how well the process of dumbing down the audience is working.

2242,raskytle,"If you don't like it, then you probably don't get it",10,13 July 2002,"I first saw this movie when it was first released on video a few years ago. I already knew the main jist of the ending unfortunately due to the Rosie O'Donnell Show, who hated it.Rosie hated it for the same reason most people hate it.  Either someone goes into the movie expecting a movie about guys who start an underground boxing ring and that's what the movie is about, and when they see the movie is not about violence they get turned off and never get into the movie.  Or someone watches the movie, sees some blood or violence, and then ignores the rest of the movie.  If you think this movie is about violence, you're an idiot. This is one of the most anti-violent movies I have ever seen...Fight Club is about many things.  The resentment of lifestyle standards imposed by advertising; the longing for fathers; numbness and alienation; finding self-empowerment through drastic means; you have to break yourself apart to build something new; fame, beauty, wealth, immortality, life without pain, are promised...but impossible.  To get these from the movie you have to pay attention to the movie, be open to the movie, think about the movie, and rewatch it as many times as you can stand.  Which is sad... not a sad thing on the movie's part, but on the viewer's part.This has to be one of my favorite movies of all time, and I love all movies. While I love all movies, few are my favorite, but my favorite are very diverse.  For example some of my other favorite movies include Almost Famous, The Usual Suspects, Dogma, and That Thing You Do!David Fincher is one of my favorite directors.  Se7en i thought was a really really good movie, but personally I think its a tad over rated.  The Game was just a cool movie to sit back and think of life as... a game.  Panic Room i just thought sucked and was no different than any other hostage/terrorist type movie.  But Fight Club is his true work of art.  A lot of people don't see Fight Club at art... and those people arn't people who understand art.  They think art has to be some nice Picasso painting, a foreign film they don't understand, or some Van Gough in the museum that they hate going to.  They don't understand that everything is art, nowadays especially things that are dark and hard to understand.If you see this movie and hate it, don't automatically dismiss it.  If you love it, don't just stop at buying the DVD.  READ THE BOOK.  The book and the movie go hand-in-hand.  It doesn't matter if you read the book first, or see the movie first.  Just make sure you see the movie at least 3 times, and read the book at least once.  And don't try and compare the two, take them in as one.  The book gives you light on parts of the movie, and the movie helps you see parts of the book better.  Just don't dismiss this as a teenage/college kid movie.  Because its not, if anything its a middle-age men movie.  But most of them are scared to have their whole life torn down, so teenage/college kids accept the facts of Fight Club before it takes over their lives.This has to be one of my favorite movies of all time, and I love all movies.

2243,mrmustard,A well-crafted commentary on modern consumerism.,10,22 July 2002,"Arguably one of the best made films to emerge in the last five years, Fight Club sets out to challenge the capitalist, materialistic society the Western world has created. While certainly surprising, although with enough clues along the way to tip you off, the much-hyped twist at the end is not as important as the underlying message, which aims to show that mankind is tricked into the desire for fashionable yet entirely useless designer goods. The story revolves around the campaign of an ever-growing terrorist organisation who seek to free the common man from the tyranny of consumerism and credit card companies. It's gripping, too, as we see the actions of the protagonists grow from petty vandalism to full-scale terrorism and beyond, and wonder just how the hell it will end until we come to the final twist, when events have spiraled out of control and are seemingly beyond the reach of the main character.  Although comical at times, there does seem to be a serious message below the increasingly silly terrorist plots, a suggestion that we are indeed letting ourselves be tricked into thinking that the purchase of material goods is all there is in life. The performances of all involved are excellent, even Meatloaf, and the effects are stunning in places. Perhaps David Fincher's best film so far, it is very well directed throughout. It deserves your attention, and it deserves to be listened to.Don't just see this as another gratuitously violent hollywood film, it's so much more than men bare-knuckle fighting in a basement.",Fight Club
2244,zombieking101,My favourite movie of all time.,10,6 April 2008,"In my opinion, this movie will never grow old. It seems more fresh and exciting with each viewing.The minute I stopped watching it, I had to watch it all again. From the opening song to the final scene, I couldn't take my eyes off the screen. There is so much packed into this movie and it appeals to so many people. The dialogue, the direction, the acting, the plot, the music, the incredible twist, everything is just superb about this film. The camera work will stun you, you'll finish with an infamous quote slipping from your tongue or a scene being replayed on your brain and it carries so many messages for you to think about. I honestly do not know a person who dislikes this movie.People of all tastes will find something to enjoy about this film, I guarantee it. It isn't just another barrage of action, one-liners and violence, it is a clever, realistic and well-thought out piece of modern cinema and most definitely David Fincher's best film to date.This film ignited my love for Edward Norton's work as well and the always impressive Brad Pitt plays the role of Tyler Durden so well, you will be taken away by this character on a ride you will never forget and he is clearly one of cinema's most lovable and outwardly psychotic characters. Helena Bonham-Carter also plays one of her greatest roles as Marla Singer, the object of The Narrator's lust.See this movie expecting something spectacular, and you'll get more.

2245,ajreinwand,Greatest Movie Ever,10,11 March 2008,"Every part of Fight Club is brilliant. From the acting of Brad Pitt, Edward Norton and Helena Bonham Carter to the directing of Fincher, it's all amazing. The plot / story is so thick and engaging there is a lot to take in and may take a few watchings to fully comprehend what exactly you just saw, but it's truly magnificent and everyone should see this film for what it is about; People, more pointed towards men though, and the demoralizing way we have become ""weak"" and gotten so far away from our natural instincts because of the way the world works now. Best way to fix that? Get into a fight of course. But there is so much more to it then just fighting someone - it's deeper than that and simply superb in it's ability to get the point across. It does stray from the book a bit, but it needs to, but luckily doesn't leave anything major out. Like I said before, everyone should see this movie at least once. It never got the respect it deserved, or the credit.",Fight Club
2246,SilverScreen03,Great movie with a few drawbacks,8,2 August 2002,"Fight Club is a supreme movie, but you should be forewarned that it does not necessarily retain the same mood throughout the film.  It starts out as a fun, sexy movie.  You have Edward Norton, playing the quirky narrator we all can sympathize with, paranoid but practical.  Then there's Brad Pitt, playing the ultra smooth, yet offbeat Tyler Derden, who keeps us guessing in every scene.  And of course, the girl- Helena Bonham Carter excellently portrays Marla Singer, a woman with sincere issues, but a soft side as well. If you came to see Brad Pitt, or if you came to see a flashy typical Hollywood blockbuster, the beginning of the movie is the part you'll like. However, as the plot thickens, the movie takes an entirely different shape. Fight Club and Project Mayhem are surrounded by cleverly written, deeply thought out themes and philosophies.  A statement about consumerism, the role of men in a maternal society, and humanity in general is brilliantly made.  However, this is not without a large dose of strangeness, and a plethora of disturbing imagery definitely not recommended for those who came just to see Brad Pitt strut his stuff.  This is where the true writing genius shines through, and where the movie gets (I believe) it's large fan base. Finally, we get to the infamous twist, and surrounding mayhem leading up to and coming down from it.  Both Norton and Pitt do some of their best acting here, and as the narrator's world becomes severely distorted, some of the most poignant observations are made.  Both actors are incredibly true to their characters, and Carter makes an excellent final appearance as well. In short, this movie does many things at once.  It creates a world beyond the imaginations of most, puts out a compelling social statement, and delves into the lives of very complex characters; while at the same time putting up an excellent cast and wonderful production work.  Though not for the feint of heart, and laced with some inherent problems and loose ends, I highly recommend this movie.",Fight Club
2247,BumSteer,Can be read many ways.,6,8 August 2002,"It's Summer 2002 and I just saw this film a few days ago.
I understand that quite a few heated exchanges have taken place over this film, so I'll take advantage of the fact that the initial strong breezes have finally blown over.I'll tell you what I like most about ""Fight Club"":  it can be read in more than one way.  That makes ""Fight Club"" rare, but not as unique as some of its more devout followers may claim.  But for a couple hours, I enjoyed being able to draw my own conclusions, comparing what I saw on the screen to my own existing opinions.  I can't say that my opinions have changed much since, but the fact that I was forced to examine them felt good.  And I didn't feel insulted at all by the filmmakers' take on the novel.  A less-talented director, such as David Lynch, might turn this project into a hateful, monotone soapbox movie that hammers you over the head with its cliched anti-establishment message (I know many of you may be Lynch fans. People, listen:  David Lynch is not a genius.  He is a subpar director. He is the liberal version of Michael Bay -- an ego-driven jerk.  Don't encourage either of them).  David Fincher and Company know better, and they treat the viewer as a human being.  After all is said and done, this film really is about Humanity and the worth of a Person.  Don't trust me? Watch Tyler Durden's dehumanizing rhetoric get slowly dissected and exposed for what it is.  Follow the evolution of Marla, from unwanted whore to desired love interest.  Despite all the postmodern MTV-style direction, there's a credible warmth to this movie that Lynch (or Bay) could never muster.If we can step back from all the dust kicked up by ""Fight Club"", we eventually notice, ""Hey!!!  This is a MODERATE film!!!""  I know that many people don't WANT this to be a moderate film.  They want something to justify their anger and hatred.  ""Fight Club"" is about what happens when hatred and hostility overcome people at the extremes.  It's a Warning Against Extremism.We know from the beginning that ""Jack's"" life as a worker bee in a hostile Capitalist world is not something to be admired.  Extreme Capitalism is what happens when Love of Money replaces Love of Humanity.  The result is Enron and WorldCom:  Evil men conspiring to rob decent people.  It's understandable that Jack hates his boss -- the guy's a hateful, condescending jerk.  We all know people like that, but some of the more ignorant viewers of ""Fight Club"" will use such examples as evidence that ""Capitalism has failed!"" while on their way to Capitalist Best Buy to purchase the Capitalist Special Edition DVD of this movie distributed by Capitalist (and Conservative) 20th Century Fox with their Capitalist money so they can watch it on their Capitalist home theatre system that their Capitalist Daddy bought for them.  Hypocrites, hypocrites, hypocrites. There's a special place in hell for you.  For such people, ""Fight Club"" will never be more than an escapist fantasy, where they can feel like rebels while being the exact opposite.  Do I think Capitalism is a 100% success? No.  But is Capitalism the Great Satan?  Not hardly.  Capitalism is just one way of doing things, and it has worked better than its critics want to admit.The other Extreme is Communism, which is what Durden's aim turns out to be. I don't think Communism is all bad either, at least in principle (everyone of equal worth, etc.), but anyone who says Communism is a perfect antidote to our few problems is obviously someone who has smoked a lotta weed and not paid attention in history class.  I hope and pray that there are not too many impressionable young twits out there giving serious thought to Tyler-Durdenism.  If I take issue with anything in ""Fight Club"", it's that it goes too far in glorifying Durden's hateful rhetoric, and spends too little time countering it with the real message.  Durden is no better than Jack's Boss.  Both of them are misogynistic jerks who reduce their followers to non-humans.  They step on the shoulders of their ""lessers"" -- in the Boss's case, to maintain a higher-level position.  But Tyler's case is ten times as hypocritical and destructive:  He wants to become a ""rebel"" superstar while he brainwashes his minions into skinhead nothings who exist to do his ""dirty work"".  His manifesto does not give men their manhood, it takes it AWAY and makes them less than they were.  ""We are God's unwanted children,"" he says, not sincerely including himself.  ""Durdenism"" robs men of their agency.""Fight Club"" is a cautionary tale about what happens when men hate each other.  It's about the hostility that extremists breed.  The worst disasters happen when extremists refuse to compromise or allow others' opinions to exist.  You have to understand, ""Fight Club"" could never get made in an extremist environment.  Right-wing Nazis would gas you for it, and Left-wing Stalinists would make you ""disappear"".  You could read ""Fight Club"" as an extremist piece of filmmaking, but I believe its ultimate message is that we need to respect one another's agency and humanity, and not try to belittle each other, either through punch-cards at the office or punches thrown in the ring.",Fight Club
2248,poingjam,Good for a lot more than the plot twist.,10,1 January 2005,"Lots of people love Fight Club for the plot twist. Others praise the acting or the dialogue. These three things combine to form a blockbuster movie. It's edgy, intense, it leaves you on the edge of your seat. Or, to sink lower, it's a triumph, and I give it two thumbs up. That's not what makes the movie good.Fight Club is good because: A. It calls into question modern men and their relationship to women, commercialism, friendship, individualism, identity, sanity, self-image, addiction, and a few billion other things and boils them all down to order and chaos. It doesn't get preachy, either.B. It has deep, interesting characters.C. It has really good small stuff.Preachiness gets old fast, as movies like American History X (another Edward Norton movie) and Signs attest. Fight Club avoids getting preachy by vilifying the preacher (Tyler Durden) and providing lots of different answers to its questions.The characters are beautifully disgusting. There's Marla, the suicidal sex-fiend, Bob, the steroid-filled man who perfected the art of chest expansion, Tyler, the controlling grungy idol, and many characters with no name but you love them anyway.But what makes Fight Club shine the most is the small stuff. The music and visuals are synced up with the dialogue perfectly. There's a scene in Edward Norton's condo that has furniture appearing left and right as it's mentioned by Norton. Or in the Reader's Digest scene, Tyler Durden rides a bicycle around in a wet basement without pants on. It's subtle and it works. Even the cheesy Hollywood plot twist towards the end has a subtle meaning, relating back to the premise of a struggle against commercialism.If you haven't seen this movie, see it. If you have, see it again, and pay attention to the little stuff. It's worth it. 10/10.",Fight Club
2249,liechtensteinfilms,Great until near the end,8,16 December 2013,"Something most of us frustrated workers and homemakers can relate to, in the same way as with Matrix and it's series. I loved it until that last scenes. Please give the main character some victory after all he's been through please. Not humility as a mere nut case. People need something in the end of a plot to bump them up in hope, or to warn. Not head analysis. Any versions with more profound up beat alternative endings? Would love that. Hopefully a great ending is not lost on the cutting room floor. Fun movie anyways. I laughed. Wonderful monologue, moody lighting, profound costume design, amazing set design. The script is great until the last part. I relate to the airline passenger scenes. Most people will. Very funny part of the move. The monologue is very funny in this part of the film. Also, I relate to the cheap furniture sequence. So telling of life on the treadmill. Love the makeup design in this film too.",Fight Club
2250,justconner,Everything I need,10,1 December 2008,"This is (in my mind)is film excellence. In every way shape and form, this movie incorporates everything that I now rate all other movies against. It was humorous, intelligent, provoking, thrilling, intriguing, exciting, gritty, realistic, informal and most of all entertaining. The casting was excellent, the plot twisting and very dramatic and enjoyable. The plot and movie are both hard to grasp on the first play though, only after the second or third play through, can you truly respect the genius of the movie. This movie, (I think) truly made the two main actors later career. I do not like being too generous with my ratings, but when I award a perfect score it's only because I think it deserves such merit. I loved every part of this movie. I've viewed countless times, in my mind you cannot top this film.Thanks for viewing my comment.",Fight Club
2251,Liz8675309,If at first you don't succeed...,10,5 October 2002,"I must admit, the first time I saw Fight Club I was visually, mentally and emotionally overstimulated; however, at the prompting of a friend, I watched it again and was able to grasp and appreciate the raw, brutal honesty portrayed in it.  It's reminiscent of Wall Street in that it critiques our generation, our attitudes, the environment we either helped to create or continue to perpetuate by doing nothing to stop it. Others have commented on the brilliance of the cast and crew (most especially David Fincher and Ed Norton), so I will avoid that topic.  I will say, however, that the movie prompted me to read Chuck Palahniuk's book (of the same name, on which the movie is based), and this taught me it is always better to read the book after the movie than vice versa.  If you enjoy the movie, and I'm willing to bet you will, please read the book--there are so many profound observations and character insights for which the movie simply has no room (that is, time).  I highly recommend any of his other books, especially _Survivor_, which may or may not be made into a movie (in the post-9/11 American society, it is hard to find a studio willing to back a project with a odless] plane hijacking). If you don't like the movie the first time around, please give it a second chance.  Watch it again--and then again, and again.

It is a place where people can let off some steam and justfight. this is so different and imaginative and also a very importantfilm that shows the madness of people today. the cinematography is fantastic and the directorial magic of Fincher is brought to life by Edward Norton and yet again by Brad Pitt.

2254,jakeslankard,Mind-bending and Intense Revelation of Film,10,8 November 2010,"I've always wanted to see this movie, and it was playing on TV recently and saw it for the first time. I was simply blown away. Everything about it is unbelievably genius: the story (main thanks to Chuck Pahlaniuk), the acting (especially the two leads, Norton and Pitt), the tone, the twist at the end. David Fincher is a modern day genius who keeps putting out masterpiece after masterpiece (keep in mind before this he did Se7en, another modern day classic). The highlight of the movie is mainly Edward Norton, as the perfect unreliable Narrator, a man who doesn't even really know who he is for most of the movie. And of course there's Brad Pitt, in his best performance he'll probably ever do. Tyler Durden is a destructive, philosophical radical revolutionary, who hates all form of consumerism and probably society itself. He's probably the most powerful amazing, deep character to come in recent movies (well along with the Joker in the Dark Knight). Overall, this is such an incredible movie, it would be bad for you to miss it, well if you're old enough to see it of course, but still, something to really see and think about, seriously, shouldn't be missed at some point in your life.",Fight Club

David Fincher's best work to date, as well as Brad Pitt. Tyler Durden was a great character that pulls you into this story. I've loved this film since the day I saw it and I do to this day. This is a movie you definitely have to see before you die. It has a great message. It might be a little out there for some people, but it is a fantastic movie. Probably one of the best written screenplays to date. This is an overall wonderful movie, it has intense violence and it's not about guys beating each other up, it's an actual movie with a fantastic plot. A must see, as previously stated.",Fight Club

I know it sounds dorky, but i also had to watch it in slow motion at all the parts where they flash Tyler into the picture. Great writing, directing and acting.

2260,bluemikey3,One of the best movies of the 90s.,10,21 January 2003,"Fight Club definitely is one of the best movies of the 1990s.  Edward Norton has had a stellar career, but this role for him ranks right up with his roles in American History X and 25th Hour.  Brad Pitt is stellar, as always, in a role that seemed almost made for him.The one thing I appreciate about this movie is it's attention to detail. Certainly, it would be impossible to do a movie of this nature without making sure that every little thing fit, but the fact that it does blows me away.  I went in to watching this movie, the first time, not knowing at all what it was about.  I took my standard movie-watching mind into it, and assumed that I wouldn't and couldn't be surprised at the ending, in fact, the idea of a surprise ending never even entered my mind.  Little did I know the surprise I was about to experience.The second (and subsequent) times you watch Fight Club, you see all the things you missed, all the clues that would have led you to figure things out for yourself.  Of course, normally, you'd miss it and feel like an idiot, but since the movie is woven together so well, most of your observations are left to, ""Oh my, that's so clever!""Few people dislike this movie, and those are people who are either too uptight or want their movies all to be cut from the same Nora Ephron mold (not that there is anything wrong with Nora Ephron movies).If you haven't seen Fight Club, you need to see it right away, and if you have seen it, why not watch it again?  It's one of the best movies of the 90s, after all.",Fight Club

2262,JaykobStorey,What a disappointment,3,14 February 2011,"So It's been 12 years since this movie came out, and I've finally gotten around to watching it. Given I was seven when it came out so the content would've been unsuitable. Still I've heard for years how good this movie, heard all the memorable quotes, everything that sort of surrounds a cult film like this. So I can't begin to tell you how disappointing this film is. One thing to remember before watching the film is that it's not about fighting, so don't even expect a few cheap thrills from the action, cause the fisticuffs are short, few, and far between. Yeah it's a metaphor for the male role in modern society, what a rip off.It's crap masquerading as intellectual, and important, but really it's just burying itself in grit and violence, and tricking you all into thinking it's a smart film, just because it's dark and misanthropic nature. Don't get me wrong a dark and gritty film can be excellent, however Fight Club doesn't deliver anything but sloppy, bloody punches. It's well shot, and the acting is good, but it's just completely devoid of entertainment. Setting aside the fact that it's one of the most depressing films I've had the displeasure of seeing, where 90% of the dialogue is Norton whining about his petty problems, and then going about like a total ponce and faking real problems to get attention. Somehow I'm supposed to care about this character? He's a douche, an unsympathetic, pathetic, boring douche, not the everyman that this movie thinks he is. The protagonist isn't this film's only flaw, it's arrogant, and pretentious, and has this twisted view of the world which it has deluded itself into believing everyone else shares.In short this is a popular film, and you will probably like it more than me, especially if you've got a taste for the realistic and seedier side of film making, but please don't just be like swarms of other people and actually view this film objectively, rather than just going in and getting psyched because of it's cult status, and basically tricking yourself into thinking you like it. It's a movie that tries to make you think, but unfortunately few do, please think about the content. Now I just wish that my first IMDb review weren't a negative one.",Fight Club

This movie is freakin' awesome. It's about materialism in society. I really wish someone would blow up all them banks so my credit would be clear and I could start new. Brad Pitt and Ed Norton should have won Oscars for these roles. When Jared Leto gets his face punched in, that was the shiznits. This was definitely Tim Burton's wife's best role.

It is also because of this reason that when I eventually did see the movie, I was amazed...The story, the music, the perfect acting of Norton and Pitt, the action, the twist the philosophical and psychological ideas behind the surface...

In both films a brilliant first half is eclipsed by a second half that loses focus and purpose.While it is a very humorous movie, the second half collapses under it's own weight, failing to see or realize the satire evident in the novel.  The film's end cuts out the original ending of the book- which is a classic mind-f**k that the film is not sophisticated to appreciate.  The whole intellectual side of the movie and Norton character and his progression from beginning to end is overshadowed by pointless action such as the fight in the garage between Norton and Pitt.  By the time the female lead shows up again at the end we hardly remember the significance of her role in the film's beginning.  The support groups that lead into the story also serve as a very simplistic foil to the support club of the fight club- their original significance in the mind of Norton is lost along with most of the other intellectual aspects of the story.  The director is brilliant and has great style but seems to lose focus on what he is trying to say- if he even knows...",Fight Club

The acting, storyline, directing, everything is just great.Like I said before, the acting is great. Edward Norton just plays his role so perfect as a crazy insomniac who just needs to find a way out of his consumer-driven life and start something better for himself. Helena Bonham Carter is also really good as The Narrator's, I guess you would say girlfriend? who is pretty much in the same position as him, just trying to hit bottom in any way they can.Note: This whole paragraph is about Brad Pitt's performance. Before this movie, I thought of Brad Pitt as just another actor. I really liked him in Inglourious Basterds, but besides that, I didn't really pay attention to him too much. However, after seeing Fight Club, he is now one of my favorite actors of all time. His role as Tyler Durden, the strong, smart, and slightly Neo-Nazi side of The Narrator's split personality is just incredible.I really, highly recommend this movie to anyone that wants to view acting at its absolute finest, and watch an incredible storyline at the same time.",Fight Club
2268,Assemble,"Powerful, mind-bending and dark film.",10,29 April 2010,"The first rule of Fight Club is that you do not talk about Fight Club. But in this case, I can't help but break that rule.If you're looking for a happy, all-is-well film, you'd better turn around and walk away. Right at the beginning, the film kicks off by introducing an intense situation, and it only goes downhill from there. Immediately the audience is hooked and wants to know more. From the title, many people assume that this movie is all about fighting, and so they discard it, but it's really about much more than that. Consumerism, anti-sociality, and sociopathic behaviours are covered and supplement the film nicely.An insomniac is the center of this film. Norton plays this insomniac, who also happens to have an everyman job, everyman boss, and basically an everyman life. What's not to like? Although we don't get this information right away, it does shape the basis for the film. He loves his home and his furniture, but soon his life turns upside down.The characters are witty and clever. Norton's character's voiceovers come at just the right moment, supplementing the dark moments of the film with humour, and Brad Pitt's character is anything but a cardboard cut-out. They both evolve, along with Helena Bonham Carter's character, at a good pace, which keeps the audience constantly interested. Still on this topic, the acting and portrayal of the three main characters is superbly done; in my opinion, the best was Edward Norton. Genuine surprise, guilt, and overall acting.All in all, Fight Club is definitely a film to check out.",Fight Club

No one has ever thought of that before.Obviously I am being sarcastic.This movie was so boring that I could only get about halfway through it before having to stop, and only later did I get around to watching the second half. That was a mistake. It was as utterly pointless and uninteresting in the second half as it was in the first.This is a classic example of a movie being popular simply because it was trendy for people to say that they liked it.And Brad Pitt? Give me a break. The guy is a hack, only a star because of his looks. He simply can't act.",Fight Club

And with a chance encounter with another person, his life changes. For the better or for the worse is for the viewer to decide.When I first viewed this film, I was 14 years old and a freshman in high school. I bought it right off the shelf without having previously seen it, because I heard it was good. I watched it the night that I bought it, and was changed somehow. I knew that I liked it, but I wasn't sure why. So I watched it again. And again. And again; 6 times over the following 2 weeks. And when I got familiarized with the philosophy and artistic value, it became even better.The flawless direction, the superb writing, and the perfect casting make this dark comedy one of the best films ever made, and also my favorite movie. Its more than just a movie, its a work of art. Its a great piece of literature converted to the screen.Fight Club can change your life if you give it a chance. It did for me. It gives people a new take on how life can be lived. A new take on what you are as a human being and what you can become. Its an instant classic and a movie should be viewed by everyone who is unsure of themselves.10/10",Fight Club

2284,interesting_akhil,"Favourite Quote: ""Now a question of etiquette; as I pass, do I give you the ass or the crotch...?""",10,22 December 2004,"Fight Club is an excellent movie, just saw it yesterday for like the 15th time and loved every minute of it. It just never ages. Fight Club would be always known for its quotes. I loved all of them. Now coming to my point, I think every special line or quote from fight club had that added 'touch' with it. This means that whenever a quote or an excellent line is delivered, there is something about it that's not clichéd. This could be an uncommon gesture given by the actors (the way Brad Pitt looks really cool after most of the memorable lines he delivers), the addition of playback music (for instance, the wacky music that starts when Edward Norton says ""that really hurt, hit me again""), complete silence (e.g., when Helena Carter says ""My God. I haven't been fucked like that since grade school.""), crisp editing that starts with another scene totally not related to previous one only to make you wonder about what just happened (for example, the narrator says ""Tyler was now involved in a class action lawsuit against the Pressman Hotel over the urine content of their soup."" and this has no relation with what happens next). There were few quotes though, that when the movie is seen for the first time, can go easily unnoticed. My favorite of these 'unnoticeable quotes' is when Brad Pitt gets up from the airplane seat next to Edward Norton and says ""Now a question of etiquette; as I pass, do I give you the ass or the crotch...?"". Every other line has a philosophical attachment towards it and is linked to the main theme of the movie, but this quote just comes out of nowhere and goes unnoticed. It certainly is my favorite quote. Do you guys agree? Think about it this way, if it wasn't in the script, it would've made no difference, but they purposely put it in. It made its way in because it deserved to be there. Looking forward to comments from you all regarding this.",Fight Club
2285,markh2607,An Artistic Masterpiece,10,28 March 2012,"You can tell the work Dave Fincher put in to this film as soon as you watch it. The film begins with the insomnia prone narrator(Ed Norton) who can only sleep after he cries. This film really delves in to the book more than any other film as basically all the lines are there in the film, apart from one or two due to the extreme nature of the text. Every little bit of the film is able to take the best and most important thing from the book as well as the smallest little details of Tyler Durden(Brad Pitt) and Marla Singer(Helena Bonham-Carter)as Marla also goes to the same classes as the narrator as they both make themselves happy.

2286,blist79,The Ultimate Irony...,10,6 July 2006,"First let me say that I love this movie. I love the message it sends; however, I wonder if the message I got is the same as everyone else got. It seems to me a lot of people got caught up in the whole egalitarian, anarchist aspect of Tyler. But I think the message (or at least the main message) of the film was that this is ultimately destructive to oneself. Self destruction is good insofar as you destroy what is non-essential (clothes, excessive pride, money, etc.). When you begin destroying the fabric of who you are (as many of the goons of Project Mayhem did) it becomes pointless. Instead of seeking enlightenment or truth through aggression, pain, or conflict... they seek nothing. In fact, it teaches nihilistic self abandonment; remember, ""The first rule of Project Mayhem is 'You do not ask Questions'."" At least in religion that self-denial is met with at least the promise of reward. What does Tyler promise? He speaks of giving up ""the condo life, the s**t job, watching sitcoms"" but what does he offer as the alternative? Mindless destruction? They attack corporations and what they perceive as order or the establishment, but there seems to be little reason behind it. If it was true equality as Tyler claims, they why do his followers obey him like some god-like guru instead of in a more democratic method? My take is this... the film does endorse much of what Tyler has to say. But obviously, there are limits to anything. The film shows you to come to the truth and accept responsibility as the Narrator does in the end. Don't be a mindless follower of the system or of someone who seems to have all the answers. Think for yourself. Don't be follower, a goose-stepper, a fool.Just my 2 cents... what do you think?",Fight Club
2287,codeyolfert,Hated it,2,2 July 2012,"I suppose the character development was good, and the acting was also good, but this movie had no entertainment value at all. Unlike most people who review movies on here, I don't try to be a critic,pick things apart looking for holes in the plot, and look for some profound meaning. I don't need Hollywood trying to influence my thinking about anything. This was not a chick flick or an action movie that most average guys would watch. I don't know what it was. I get the whole modern man hamster wheel thing where we are utterly spending ourselves trying to acquire the things that corporations advertise and convince us that we need, but we really don't need at all. But the fighting thing for fun and release? Just stupid. I guess some viewers think that they are more intelligent than the rest of us and are able to grasp the deeper meaning, and thus become more enlightened, but if your like me and just love good stories and being entertained, don't watch this show.",Fight Club

A true satire of not only American sub culture, but also a satire about how we live and breathe with the constant advertisements, merchandise, commercialization and overall materialistic points of view that inherit much our lives. A true gritty film about freeing oneself from all things and life and finding yourself in a world with fear.

2290,rjcmls,An all-time classic.,10,14 July 2011,"I first viewed Fight Club when I was a young teenager and loved it not only for its quotable aphorisms and graphic violence, but for its raw emotional angst. I never grappled with its philosophical underpinnings or its moral instructions. I hadn't seen it for years until my (rather brilliant) cultural history professor mentioned it during a lecture. After re-watching it, I see it for what it is: a commentary on the frivolous nature of the consumer- capitalist culture of the 90s. It infers that nihilism is the only rational way to cope with a society characterized by excessive materialism and controlled by a small coterie looking to exploit the average man's insecurities and impulses. Such is a fascinating way to consider what we have arrived at in terms of our values. And considering the cult following this movie has garnered, this idea has clearly resonated with people. Movies that are able to define something as complex as an entire culture are infrequent, extraordinary works of art that must be appreciated for what they are. I'm glad Fight Club has become so highly regarded and is widely seen for what it is, not just what it appears to be.",Fight Club

2293,HornetMike,Simply incredible,9,7 June 2004,"Although this is a fantastic observation on nihilism it's not this underlying theme that makes me like Fight Club so much.Firstly, it's the direction - Fincher gives his films a fantastic noir-ish feel. It's a different style to the noir of Se7en, indeed I love how Fincher has created a noir that is not hidden from society, but is out in modern life. It's beautifully and originally shot (and a little beside the point, but it has a fantastic soundtrack). Secondly I am a huge admirer of both Brad Pitt and Edward Norton who both put in great performances here. Meatloaf, Helen Bonham Carter (an incredible change of accent), Jared Leto and a personal favourite of mine - Eion Bailey make an excellent supporting cast. The storyline, despite it's deeper meaning, is fantastic. One gets a real understanding with the characters and it's keeps you engrossed.A must see.",Fight Club

Or is it supposed to completely make you think about who you truly are inside? Fight Club is one of the best movies i've ever seen, hands down. The acting, the subtle hints of knowing its a great movie, the character build ups and changes, the everything. After watching this movie, one can only take a few minutes, breathe in and out and wonder what the hell they just watched. It's almost as if the viewer is part of Durden's army, as if we are one. Now I'm mainly writing this to express my enthusiasm about the movie (I registered for IMDb just now after watching the movie). Fight Club brings back a sense of Rebel Without A Cause, yet twists into a sort of real world experience, as if it happens everyday. The people of ""the real world"" seem lie the enemies after during the movie and life seems so...so out of reach, yet so close. I can't express my feelings and write in correct sentences because Fight Club is truly a movie that shakes the definition of what it means to be living life. Now of course The Narrator, played by the spectral Norton, is bipolar, and perhaps deathly bipolar at that. But Pitt's character engulfs the viewer in a world full of nonchalantness, carelessness and bliss. Everything happens, everything sucks, everything is alright. I mean I just can't express enough my love for this film. Truly one of the best films ever made IMO.",Fight Club

Whether people want to admit it or not, being a man in modern America is not all it's cracked up to be. And that's what this movie is about. Self-awareness, enlightenment and total control over your emotions is what this movie will help you learn about.Fight Club warns us about the brainwashing of the mass media. The media of a society that destroys our souls so we'll be robots for the system. It will teach you that the things you own don't matter. What really matters is how you feel about yourself inside.And the best way to feel good about yourself is to win a fight with another man! Who can argue that?! Fighting is a form of therapy in this movie. After a night of fighting the main character is completely calm and cool the next day at work. Nothing angers him anymore. Not even those little everyday annoyances like his stupid boss. Every man should own this movie and watch it regularly. Not only is it a masterpiece of moviemaking, it's a masterpiece of philosophy.",Fight Club

It features brilliant performances by Edward Norton, Brad Pitt, Helena Bonham Carter, and even Meat Loaf Aday. This film captures the voice of the common man and expands upon it in such a brilliant fashion that it is almost mind-blowing. Everything about this film, from the cinematography to the visuals to the acting to the pace to the message is all flawless. In the past five days, I have watched it three times and would watch it again in a second. There is some much that one can take away from this film, you can never grasp it in a few viewings. You will come out of this film every time saying, ""Wow. I learned something new."" I firmly believe that every person should view this movie at least once to get a better understanding of their surroundings and the world they live in. One of the themes of this movie, the idea that ""the things you own end up owning you"", is such a powerful message that I find that it can be applied to most areas in our lives, especially in a society as worldly as ours.Not only is this film powerful, but it is also quite hilarious. Brad Pitt's Tyler Durden incorporates great humor and sarcasm that helps balance the plot. All of the other characters have their fair share of comical moments which just make this movie even greater.This film will intrigue you and bring you in like very few films can.",Fight Club
2300,Theglasseshaveit,"In a year of amazing films, this one always stands out for me.",9,23 November 2013,"Whenever I talk about different years in movies, I always pick 1999 as my favourite year. So many amazing films came out such as American Beauty, The Green Mile, The Matrix and Being John Malkovich. Out of every movie that came out this year, one stands out for me and that is Fight Club.The first time I ever watched this movie was really late at night and I had waited for it to come on T.V and had to wait until everyone was asleep. I was in absolute awe over the sheer brilliance of the film. everything about it is amazing.The first thing I noticed was the cinematography. Every time I watch this movie, the opening shot gets me excited and ready for a powerful film.The story itself is so interesting, it doesn't have any dull moments. Even when a character's life is portrayed as boring you are just hooked in wanting to see what will happened next. The way the story develops also is very fascinating.Then we have wonderful performances from both Edward Norton and Brad Pitt. But I think that the real standout here is Helena Bonham Carter. She plays one of the only female characters in the movie and truly makes you think about everything in the movie.There is one negative point though, the fact that a few scenes feel random and tacked on, along with some plot holes.Overall, if you haven't checked this out, this is a must for every person as long as you aren't squeamish.Rating: 6.8/7 (or 9/10)",Fight Club

Brad Pitt and Edward Norton wonderfully lead Fight club with such convincing performances, that you forget they're actors and believe them as Tyler Durden and ""Jack"" (the narrator). In my opinion, this film is what launched and defined Helena Bonham Carter's career.This film is hailed as a timeless classic for fan boys, action junkies, philosophers, film buffs, actors, writers, directors, and cinematographers.

Personally, I don't know if I saw it again now if my opinion would be different...maybe, but somehow I doubt it.The beginning was interesting enough to entertain me...specifically the whole him going to different group session things as a hobby and then meeting Marla who does the same thing. That's interesting.I think the whole thing started to bore me about when the movie started going nowhere, from what I remember, it was just Marla living there, and Brad Pitt beating the crap out of Edward Norton every night or whatever. It just lost its interest.The end was a cool twist, the whole Tyler thing...it was interesting, but the film as a whole I don't think was just very well presented. Maybe if I'd read the book it'd make more sense.I just think I didn't like it because it didn't make sense to me. I understand this makes me a bit of an outcast because everyone loves Fight Club, but I apologize...just not my taste. If anyone wants to just explain a few key points out for me, or something, that'd be great.Just please don't rip me a new one, because I understand I am like, the ONLY one who doesn't like that movie.""SLIDE!""",Fight Club
2304,howrie,Amazing,10,22 October 2004,"SPOILERS AHEADIts really quite amazing that a movie with Brad Pitt can be so good. Usually Brad Pitt cant act for crap and his movies are lame. But put him and Edward Norton together they make magic.Fight Club is one of the best movies ever made, think about how long the people involved with the film had to spend to not have Tyler and the narrator interact with the same person at the same time and to make sure no-one pays attention to both of them. This movie really plays with your mind and this is one of the few movies which you can actually enjoy more when you watch it for a second time.The character of Marla Singer is very good because she is the person that 'interacts' with both if them but in the end she is really having sex with the Narrator (but its all the same for her).This movie is easily one of the greatest movies ever and I cant believe the only Oscar it got nominated for was for some lame sound award.

2306,guoyandao,stunningly deep,10,2 April 2004,"I hope this does not infringe copyright but first of all I have to quote this humourous commentary i saw somewhere:""I thought I had already seen the worst movie of 1999 but after watching ""Fight Club,"" this was wrong as ""Fight Club"" took the honor. There was no point to this film and it was the waste of talent for two otherwise excellent actors.There is not much to say about ""Fight Club"" because there was nothing worthwhile to remember. After the first ten minutes of this film, I realized I was watching a film that is best described by the condition of the house the two lead characters were living in old, delapidated, rundown and an ugly home. Brad Pitt made a wrong career move selecting ""Fight Club"" and Edward Norton just wasn't thinking as he made his decision.With a story that made no sense, action that was non-existent and performances that were poor; ""Fight Club"" was nothing more than a time and space filler for the studios. ""Well that was the most perfect demonstration of how a milestone movie can be spoilt by Spiderman-Independence Day-Titanic fans. No offense to those fans though, but this is a movie that compels you to think, like Matrix, like American Beauty. It's not a popcorn-and-tears movie. I'm sorry.I've read plenty of reviews after I watched it coz I couldn't completely understand it. But the fact is, nobody seems to do either. So there're either too much gimmicks, or too much depth. I hope it's the latter.To me, it is a movie that reflects on the age of modernization and commercialization. We are all slaves of the lives we pursue. To Tyler Durden, only destruction, which leads to nullifying the society established on paychecks and credit cards, can save the human beings out of this vicious cycle. It's a struggle against the loss of sanity or freedom in a capitalistic world. That's why fight club. That's why fighting.
So why the hell Jack(if that's his name) made a compromise to Tyler's ambition in the end? Coming back to reality? Tragedy of life?Tyler Durden is so unforgettable. Brad Pitt put in an unparalleled performance.The camerawork is revolutionary, I believe Matrix drew inspiration from it. And the dialogue is brilliant and stunning. In many ways it is comparable to American Beauty(browbeating the boss), which has a tragic ending as well. Both are classic.The only thing I'm confused with is Helena's role. What the hell is she doing here? I hope it's not another Hollywood trick that murdered a masterpiece.9.5/10",Fight Club
2307,philchan-320-196827,Twists and Turns Galore!,9,22 March 2012,"""Fight Club"" is pretty awesome. The only real complaint is it does tend to be very preachy. While watching it does change your attitude on life, you probably feel depressed. But I did not go home and start tossing my electronics and anything else that had a hold on me. Once I left the theater that was it, the movie became nothing more than any other movie I have watched.Although I can see where a few people may be disappointed, especially when we live in an era where John Woo, James Cameron, and for the love of god Ron Howard are considered brilliant. Instead of the greats that have seem to die out in the early 90s. Anyways these people tend to be the 'have to have everything clearly wrapped up' or they complain if more than 80 seconds go by without any 'entertainment.' If that is what you are looking for, avoid this movie. Also, what is academy looking for in a movie, I have yet to enjoy a single Oscar winner since Schindlers List, stop with all these posers and start nominating originality, or at least masterpieces. Pop art is not worth an Oscar. And just because the company that produced it is small scale, it only means the film is a poser on top of of cheaply produced. The only true great independent films are Fargo and Clerks.Like others have said, you can watch this movie ten times and find something new. The plot twists alone will blow most peoples minds. Especially when they find out a movie title fight club has a real message.",Fight Club
2308,tommy-alvarez,THIS was really good!,8,29 March 2012,"I had heard the hype thru the years, so I rented the Fight Club DVD with reservations. I thought it was a film about a bunch of guys beating each other senseless, but the reviews were good. The film was much more than I expected and held my interest from beginning to end. It is a movie that you will think about long after you have seen it. I would have originally rated it a ""6"", but a week later I raised that to a ""7"". I was tempted to go higher, but it has been months since I have seen it, and I know there were parts where I thought ""oh, come on, this is bordering on ridiculous"". It is a great commentary on modern society told with lots of insight and a surprising amount of humor. I didn't expect a ""surprise"" ending, but started to suspect that things were not what they seemed to be. Now when people ask me if I have seen any good movies recently, the Fight Club is the first one I recommend. Although I have no desire to be beaten to a pulp or to do that to anyone else, I could certainly identify with many of the ideas expressed by Edward Norton's character.",Fight Club

It has been my favorite movie of all time since. it is so deep and philosophical it requires many views to get it all in, thats not to say that its hard to understand, its just that good. i have seen it about 20 or so times all the way through and just picked up on the flash back humor at the end of the movie. I was stunned i had not picked up on that before.This is surely a life changing movie that gets you thinking, thinking about what really matters in life and other deep crap. its hard to sit and write a review about a movie as deep as this one, due to all the little things put in it. The first rule of fight club, is we don't talk about fight club. So stop what you're doing and go watch this movie if you haven't already.BEST MOVIE OF ALL TIME",Fight Club

Hands down in my top 5 favourite movies of all time. Fight Club tells the story of a socially and emotionally troubled individual trying to navigate his purpose in life, all the while succumbing to the deepest darkest depths of his subconscious. Plagued by visions of a overly commercialized society the narrative character begins down a righteous; albeit dangerous, path with his best friend and worst enemy to cleanse the world of its over consuming commercialized ideology.

The special effects are outstanding. The dialogue absolutely gorgeously grotesque in all of its 90's splendor. The character development is as complex as the storyboard.

The convincing performances by Pitt and especially by Norton allow you to lose yourself in the story. If you haven't read the book, you should. It is only about 200-some pages but is just as compelling as the movie. Another thing I love about this movie is how quotable it is. The sharp narration and dialogue is derived mostly from the book, but some was not and the presentation of it is simply superb. Norton should have won an Oscar for his performance. If you haven't seen him in Primal Fear and American History X, definitely do so. Pitt is also extremely witty in what is his best role to date. His sex-symbol status aside, the guy can really act!

2317,jbltk,The people that don't like this movie generally fall into 2 groups,10,2 October 2004,"The people that don't like this generally fall into 2 groups: Those that approach it believing its central theme is fighting and those that think it is shallow and represents everything it claims to be against.9 out of 10 people fall into the 1st category and feel let down when they realize that fighting encompasses a relatively small amount of the movie's content. They are what I classify as ""mouth breathers"" or the ""lowest common denominator"". They are incapable of ignoring their preconceived notions of the movie's theme and unable to judge the movie on what it really is. To them, it is a disappointment that they saw a completely different movie than they expected, and it is therefore sub-par in their narrow little world.The other 10% see the themes and story for what they are, but feel it's over-produced and ""too stylish"", something the movie purports to outright protest. What is lost on these poor souls is that was the exact point of why it is the way it is. It makes fun of itself, all the while protesting our modern culture. It's the ultimate self-deprecating humor.I know there are others who don't like the movie for a variety of reasons, but these are generalizations and are, therefore, generally true. There are exceptions, but these are what the majority of negative feelings for this movie encompass.To me, this movie is clever and full of great, dark humor. The violence these men engage in is the same kind of self-destructive behavior that ""cutting"" is for young women. They both feel numb to the world and cutting or fighting is the way they have chosen to ""feel"". Of course it's not a healthy way to address these emotional crises, but the movie uses it as a way of illustrating the lengths to which people sometimes go in their search for a cure to their despair.I enjoy watching this movie over and over again. It's one of the few movies that never gets boring no matter how many times I see it.10/10",Fight Club
2318,tarikstar_143,Fight Club,8,12 February 2015,"This film really exceeded my expectations. As well as being well acted, with a great script and storyline, it's got a good sense of humor and doesn't take itself too seriously. Perhaps because of this, the serious bits really have a lot of impact. It's a film that men and women will probably enjoy equally, which is too rare in my opinion. Brad Pitt proves again that he's not just a pretty face, and Edward Norton's performance is great. I even managed to get over my usual hatred of Helena Bonham Carter! Far far better than American Psycho, which has some similarities. The narrator blacks out after the conversation. When he wakes, he discovers from his telephone log that Tyler made calls during his blackout. He uncovers Tyler's plans to erase debt by destroying buildings that contain credit card companies' records. The narrator tries to contact the police but finds that the officers are members of the Project. He attempts to disarm explosives in a building, but Tyler subdues him and moves him to the upper floor. The narrator, held by Tyler at gunpoint, realizes that in sharing the same body with Tyler, he himself is actually holding the gun. He fires it into his mouth, shooting through the cheek without killing himself. Tyler collapses with an exit wound to the back of his head, and the narrator stops mentally projecting him. Afterward, Project Mayhem members bring a kidnapped Marla to him, believing him to be Tyler, and leave them alone.

Fightclub is a movie that makes you think about what you've done with your life, about everything, and especially society and mediocrity. Be prepared to realize that, as Tyler Durden says, ""We are all part of the same compost heap."" Firstly there is no actor that can ever compare to Edward Norton.

2322,writethewrong,Deeper and deeper...,10,24 February 2005,"Let me just start out by saying that this is one of my favorite movies of all time. Reasons being: 1) it was brilliantly done (I'm not gonna go into cool camera effects and the great music or anything; you've all seen the movie); 2) it makes so much sense. This movie has changed my perspective on a lot of things in my life; all the materialism is just not important, nor does it matter. And it's screwed up, how our society runs. But that's not why I'm writing this comment.I'm writing this comment to give you all an idea, something to ponder the next time you choose to watch this movie. I am in tenth grade, and my Humanities teacher showed this movie in class (the whole thing, unedited, sex scenes and all) (I had already seen it before). Why would a teacher show this brutal and harsh movie in class? At the time, we were working on Romanticism. Here is a definition of Romanticism: a movement of the 19th century that sought to replace the great emphasis on reason with a new focus on feelings, emotions, and nature. Nature often came to replace God, and reason was seen as a restraint on true feeling. (This definition is extremely vague and I will elaborate a bit more later on.) Now, how in the world could Fight Club possibly tie in with Romanticism? A big thing with Romanticism was self-discovery and liberation from material needs. It was about humans going back to their primitive state, living in and appreciating nature. Romantic literature and artwork often portrayed a sense of hopelessness or loss. All of these things are present in Fight Club. Edward Norton's character is consumed by his material possessions, and Brad Pitt's character shows him a way out of it. They start a Fight Club, which gives men a primitive outlet for their frustration and everything they have pent up (fighting is an extremely primitive way to solve problems). In the scene after Edward Norton is injured in the car crash, Brad Pitt begins to talk about his world, in which people climb on vines wrapping around the Sears Tower, people wear leather clothes that will last the rest of their lives, and people pound corn and lay strips of venison on an abandoned highway. All of these things are obviously Romantic in nature.I'm presenting you these ideas so that, perhaps, we can learn even more from this movie that already teaches so much. It's definitely a great movie that deserves to be seen more than once.",Fight Club

I only saw the last 45 minutes or so but even then I knew it was a terrific movie. That was almost a year ago, but I knew it was a movie I would love. I just recently saw the entire movie and I was right. Fight Club is a movie about male bonding and wanting what you can't have, even if you don't know what it is you want. Edward Norton plays the Narrator perfectly and Brad Pitt hasn't been better since Interview with the Vampire. They take a story that performed by other actors, may've been unrealistic, hokey and senseless and turned it into a complex, believable creepy masterpiece. It's one of my favorite movies since Silence of the Lambs. Be assured that you won't mind having to watch the movie several times before actually getting it all.",Fight Club

(David Fincher). Based on the Chuck Palahniuk book of the same title, it is a coming of age story for people who are still coming of age in their thirty's. Our main character, who i will refer to as narrator (Norton), is a man on the edge of sanity. His job carries him all over the world, and because of it he cannot sleep. His airport to hotel lifestyle brings many new friends, including one special one. Tyler Durden (Pitt), is a sick, delinquent free-spirit who is just full of meaningful quotes and useful information. Their relashonship grows, and Tyler's influence over the narrator becomes powerful. Together they start FIGHT CLUB, an underground bare-knuckle boxing arena where blue-collar slaves may come and truly live. Their journey together goes through making soap, grand-scale vandalism, chemical burns, and city blocks reduced to rubble. As the narrator discovers more about himself, he discovers the secret about Tyler. The twist in fight club will send you into whiplash, then make you rethink the entire movie, and its meaning. It is the only movie in my collection that i can watch again and again and every time discover more about the characters, and more about my own life.

What's worse than Fincher's ham-fisted direction is the performance of the non-actors Brad Pitt and Edward Norton. Everything they do tends to either be over-the-top bad or so very unforgettable as to almost be non-existent.

2329,faraidmobin,My assessment about Fight Club.,9,29 July 2013,"Fight Club (1999) Today I have seen this movie. It was released at 15 October in 1999. It is a dram type movie, directed by David Fincher, starred by Edward Norton, Brad Pitt, Helena Bonham Carter and several others.In my perception, it is another special kind of brain crushing, psychotic movie. The name ""Fight Club"" seems like that it can be a total fighting or conventionally action movie. But I think, it is stuff of an insomniac patient's subconscious or may be unconscious mind. The man (Edward Norton, who narrates) was fed of the total system and his physical and mental conditions and he was finding an escape to find peace and to find assurance of night sleeping. But a stranger girl named Marla Singer (Helena Bonham Carter), who was a drug addicted chick, distorted him from his normal pace. He was lost his attention and crushed on her. His all attempts of getting peace had gone in vain.Tyler Durden (Brad Pitt) was not a man, but another soul of that distorted guy, who was a symbol of rebellion, that was hidden in that guy's subconscious mind. He was always thinking like that, he wanted to fight with everyone and everything which was bothering him a lot, like his boss. So, the ""Fight Club"" was formed on the basis of his idea which was promoted by Tyler Durden. But, that Tyler Durden was no one but him. But, his conscious mind's logic and morality was not supporting it, as the time was running. So, it gradually became a fight between two souls, in one's body. That was completely psychotic.What so ever, this movie is awesome. In fact, it is teaching us about that, if someone wants to find peace and do things with a cool mind, he or she should hear to his or her subconscious mind. In the body of human, it is the real human. So, respect it and score, otherwise it is eternal fighting, eternal Fight Club.Faraid Mobin Dipon 29.07.2013",Fight Club

It is much less than what you would see in your average Hollywood blockbuster. This is actually an insightful film and in many ways similar to American Beauty, although this film is much more in your face about it's message. If you are squeamish, you may not want to see it. There are some very painful bloody scenes, but if you can stomach it, then check it out. There is also a huge twist in this film that almost rivals the twist at the end of The Sixth Sense.

2332,jmerkel57,Good Movie but way overrated,7,5 February 2006,"Overall Fight Club is a good movie and is certainly worth watching but I'm not buying into all the ""best film ever"" bullcrap. Hearing that is really annoying to me in fact and part of the reason why I'm writing this right now. Let me start off by saying, I get the film. I'm sick of hearing people tell me that I don't get the movie. That really annoys me. The movie is what it is and I'm pretty sure most of the retards that spend all their time of Fight Club message boards saying ""I am Jack's (insert retarded something or other here)"" are looking too much into the film. Fincher is pretty good as the film's director, but the direction gets annoying to me after a while because I just keep feeling that he's pretty sure he's a bad@ss which isn't true. Se7en's good, definitely better than Fight Club and mostly it's because of how Fincher keeps his style at a minimum whereas in Fight Club he goes crazy, this too annoys me. Edward Norton and Brad Pitt are good in their roles, Norton has been better though (Primal Fear) and Brad Pitt is not the person I want to learn a life lesson from but he's alright and he makes me laugh every now and then so he's OK. I do however have certain problems what this movie is trying to preach which people then take seriously and follow, mostly that it's anti-corporations and stuff but the film itself has countless actual logo's for major corporations within it. You think that Fincher was just being clever by putting those in the film? I don't, he's a sell out just like the people they're fighting against in the film. Also, while they're on the bus looking at the underwear ad and Brad Pitt says, ""Self-improvement is masturbation."" I almost cracked up, he couldn't say anything more absurd considering how he himself looks. Anyway, these are just a few of my gripes but whatever. It's a pretty good movie just don't buy into all these morons and their view of Fincher as Jesus' Second Coming and Fight Club as perfect, that's just dumb and it annoys me.",Fight Club

When you hear these things it makes you want to rewind the movie but you decide not to because you hope that what he said will be explained in a few minutes. The next thing you know the movies almost over, you have all these lines and questions in your head that you want explained and answered but you so involved in the movie that by now you don't care if they are because all your really thinking about is how fast 'Project Myhem' progressed or why they had to shoot Bob in the head why not in the leg he didn't hurt anyone or do anything wrong all he did was remodel a shop a little. This movie has all the elements funny lines, questionable speeches, insightful knowledge into real life that you may have never thought of. You can never go wrong with a movie that makes you wonder.",Fight Club
2339,conor601,Fight Club is the best film of all time,10,5 April 2006,"In my opinion the greatest film of all time. It defines a generation while giving hope to those coming after smashing their world with every word out of Tyler's mouth. Disturbingly beautiful, magnificently directed and the greatest performance of Pitt, and possibly Nortan (if not in American History X). Do not miss this powerful, gorgeous, incredible film. It makes you laugh, smile, grimace, cry, and stare mouth agape at the sheer magnitude of what you are witnessing before you. Carter does a wonderful job as the love interest. There are certain scenes which can only be described as magic. They are some of the greatest revelations and conversations ever captured. You simply must watch it, and then watch it again because you know you want to!",Fight Club

It has it all: flawless, phenomenal casting, flawless, phenomenal acting, flawless, phenomenal direction, flawless, phenomenal editing, flawless, phenomenal cinematography and, most importantly, flawless, phenomenal story writing and script with a wonderful, very logical, yet unexpected twist. Oh, and a culturally very significant movie with deep wisdom and some of the best lines ever uttered on the big screen.

2341,ranjith-1,One the best movies ever.,10,27 December 2005,"This movie is hands down the best movie I have ever seen. Before this movie 'American Beauty' was my favorite movie. Although the two movies are quite different I would rate 'Fight Club' better for it's great screenplay and direction. David Fincher has become one of the best Directors in Hollywood with this movie. I had seen his movie 'Seven' before, but this movie is better than that. The big budget for this movie can be seen in many of the great computer aided and stunt scenes (the graphics in the ending scenes of the movie look artificial, but I guess that's the best possible with that day's technology). The music, the plot, the acting, the casting and the photography are all excellent. Its a must watch for everybody.",Fight Club

Those that view past the superficial and actually watch the film will see that it is bursting with moral guidelines and questions about the society we all partake in on a daily basis, as well as providing us with a little self reflection.Anyone who has not yet had the life changing viewing experience is without a doubt missing out.

I borrowed the DVD from my sister and I've watched it about 5 times since. No movie has left me thinking about it like Fight Club. Its got just about everything you would want in a movie, its funny, its got plenty of action, it has a great plot twist, it might not make you cry but who wants to be sad when they watch a movie. Before I saw the movie I thought I knew what it was about. I thought it would be full of guys fighting and not a whole lot else. Well as soon as the movie starts you know that is not the case. It does get a little confusing around the mid-way point but at the end everything makes sense. By the way the ending is one of the best parts of the movie. I wont say what happens but its just perfect. The music for this movie (especially at the end) fits perfectly, and makes it even better. It does have a couple moments of pretty intense violence and its a thinker as well so its not for everybody. Basically, you'll either love it, or hate it. But if you look past the violence and can understand the message, you'll love it.",Fight Club
2345,ercrosswhite,No one doubts it was awesome,9,10 April 2006,"Now i'm not saying that Pitt is better than Norton. I'm just saying in the film Brad Pitt does a better job! Norton was amazing and so was Marla but Brad was the climax character and made the movie what it was. The only bad thing about Brad's character portrayal is that he was ripped and the whole ""hating guys that work out"" thing in the film completely contradicts it. Yet it makes sense that it is how Jack would of portrayed Tyler. Now I'm sure some of u are going to get ticked. Especially those that are die hard Norton fans but so am i. I'm just being honest. I think Brad could of played Jack but i don't think Norton could of played Tyler. Sorry Eddy!",Fight Club
2346,jrec-1,Finely crafted commentary on society,10,27 April 2005,"There is nothing done badly in this movie. Oustanding cinematography and superior acting only complement a well crafted script and editing. The most compelling reason to see this, despite what critics may say, is the script's deep reaching commentary on modern society. The way that the run of everyday, 9-5 work, consumer based life slowly erodes dreams and passion, the anger that stirs beneath that, and becomes rage in some people is precisely exemplified by this story. Full of twists and turns, the plot doesn't stand alone, but really revolves around the theme of consumer anger. All the while being a hopeful piece, I think this movie really shines a light into a standard area of denial in society. Namely; that ""the stuff you own, ends up owning you"". Like all good debate though, the script presents both sides of the issue, and by the time the movie ends, you believe in love again, but you can also understand why some of the wackos snap on occasion, and lash out at just about anyone they can find. It is tough to write about the source of frustration that causes some people to go postal, but Fight Club delivers that in a compelling, can't help but look at the traffic accident kind of way.That's not to say the film is just a theme piece though. I loved the edgy, gritty shots and interesting angles that the director uses for effect. The overall dark, dirty and rainy feel to the pic is reminiscent of the Ridley Scott movies, Blade Runner, and maybe Black Rain. Fincher clearly has perfected his craft since Se7en, as good as that movie was.I usually guess the ending in almost all movies, this one is one of the rare ones that had me going through the journey along with the characters.",Fight Club

2348,duggalshivraj,Absolutely the most brilliant film I've ever see,10,26 July 2015,"this was a complete stunner of a film. it doesn't grab you at the beginning, but when the soap maker comes into the picture, its interesting enough that you can see Tyler durden make soap out of people's fat all day long. the absolute stroke of genius added to this film took me by storm and the amount of easter eggs that makes you feel absolutely stupid towards the end. the direction of the film was absolutely amazing, and the acting was top class, the plot, how all the humans turn into robots, following their sir's orders and killing each other as a form of therapy, it sounds dumb but it was one of the best movies ever made in the 20th century.this movie had the best progress in characters in a film ever and the display of insanity in each of them made them even more spicy and even more interesting to watch, I could never have thought Tyler to be the narrators imagination, and of course, one more unnoticed thing that just left the audience startled was that Edward Norton wasn't named even once in the film, so after watching the film, when you're reviewing it with your friends, you just don't remember his name and it just messes with you. according to me, I found this even crazier and wittier than inception or any Nolan movie. when you combine the genius between a riddle film and the magnitude of an action film, you get fight club.Edward Nortan and Brad Pitt's chemistry goes like maple syrup with pancakes. their chemistry in this film made them seem like a pair Hollywood has never seen before. the chemistry and bonding between these two make them according to me the best pair of actors in a film ever. evolution of the fight club as insane as the testicular cancer support group scene was, project mayhem took the cake for the weirdest part of the movie. this movie in particular is my favourite, however many stupidly nonsensical weird scenes it has.to this day it is quiet hard to figure out what sort of redemption project mayhem gave to Edward Norton (more or less his subconscious as he was unaware it was Tyler durden because Tyler was a hallucination.) as it wasn't contributing to any form of therapy, and only ended up in flames every where and extreme acts of vandalism. the therapy from the club just didn't seem enough for durden, so the ""soap guy"" took it to extremes, building the main plot point. my favourite scene was the shooting, and the narrator's fight with durden. The CCTV camera views were absolutely, hilariously genius way to explain what his fight actually looked like, and of course, in particular, the shooting and his bonding with Marla Singer in the end. Bravo, there best movie that exists.",Fight Club
2349,kat_chivers,Totally awesome!,10,20 April 2006,"I saw this movie for the first time at the age of 12, I therefore blame it almost entirely for my frail mentality. It is the reason the phrase 'dark and disturbing' was created; and it gets better with each viewing. Not only does Edward Norton give, in my opinion, his strongest performance, this film contains the most mind blowing plot in existence. Brad Pitt excels himself as Tyler Durden who is in fact Tyler Durden's imaginary 'friend'. If you haven't yet seen this movie I suggest you do so, at the earliest possible moment. In fact this movie is so good that it makes a scene with Helena Bonham Carter in a bridesmaid's dress whilst speaking in an American accent totally believable and completely enjoyable to watch. Plus the use of the phrase 'death hairball' would make it worth watching even if the rest of the movie was terrible (which it most definitely isn't).Just for the cherry on top of the giant violence fuelled movie; Meat Loaf is in it and has a pair of breasts with nipples the size of dustbin lids. :-)",Fight Club

Technically well done, but evil still. This film shits on every value I hold dear : honesty, hard work, liberty of thought, non-violence, respect of others as equals, reason as my best tool to make something of my life. It glorifies senseless destruction of property and (which is much, much worse) of able minds in cult-like brainwashing to serve egoistical means. Every problem should be overcome with violence, lies, or blackmail. Every man who is not you is there to be used or beaten into a pathetic degenerate. There is no respect of the other.

It's macho porn -- the sex movie Hollywood has been moving toward for years, in which eroticism between the sexes is replaced by all-guy locker-room fights. Women, who have had a lifetime of practice at dealing with little-boy posturing, will instinctively see through it; men may get off on the testosterone rush. The fact that it is very well made and has a great first act certainly clouds the issue. - Roger Ebert.",Fight Club

I had no desire to see this movie before, the title ""Fight Club"" proved that this movie was opposite of what I enjoy. However, nothing else was on, and I had watched all of Gigli, so this couldn't be that bad compared to it.This movie has EXCELLENT acting, when you are confused so is Edward Norton's character, (so you don't feel you missed something) the plot is good, and the purpose of this film is important.The main character's apartment burns down, along with his Swedish furniture. He had lost his briefcase with EVERYTHING in it: all his designer clothes.Fight Club (the actual club) encourages it's members to turn away from commericalism, but trust, no one gets on a pulpit and preaches.

2353,meydanaki,Fight Club,8,17 October 2016,"Brilliantly realized nonsense, Fight Club is one of the most highly stylized and energetic movies ever made. I can only imagine how impressively innovative it must have seemed when it first came out, with its surreal pulsating soundtrack, constant miniature sucker punches, and wildly inspired direction. The performances are all darkly comical and Nortan's character is an amusingly disturbed individual. It's not perfect however. It has a twist ending that descends the story into complete, albeit entertaining, stupidity, it packs on way too much sexually immoral content, and lacks any true meaning despite its constant insistence that it does. It also slows down too much during some sections. These flaws would normally sink a movie's score a lot further down and even kill some outright, but Fight club is so entertaining in a hyper macho off kilter sort of way, so well made, and so memorable in ways that few movies can ever achieve that in the end they're not detrimental to the film's overall quality. I have to say, Fight Club is some sort of flawed, but brilliant classic. But don't watch it unless you're mature and old enough to not be scarred by some of the film's immoral or violent material.",Fight Club

There are some great quotes and there are lots of awesome shots in this movie. Its a definite classic, one not to be missed in my opinion.

2358,Vader999,It makes no sense. AGGGGGHHHHH!!!!!!!,10,25 June 2005,"1ST PARAGRAPH CONTAINS NO SPOILERS. This has all the hallmarks of a great movie, a very fluid sense of direction, cool cinematography, cool one-liners, and a fresh and innovative storyline. Slowly you start to notice gaps in the plot, which you accept because with a movie like this you know to expect a twist later on. As the movie progresses into anarchy you become increasingly more desperate to work out what the 'twist' is as the plot becomes more elaborate and nagging discrepancies are brought to the fore. You'll have a long wait cos its only revealed at the end of the movie and when you get there its like ""WWHHHHAAAAAATT???"", (pause for a few seconds as it filters in), ""hmmmmm, maybe i wasn't paying proper attention, no problem i'll have another watch in a few days"". With the 'knowledge' now sitting in your cerebral cortex you follow the story fully armed and only now you fully appreciate how big a cock-up the writer made.SPOILERS FROM HEREONFor those that have seen this movie, if you do not agree, i think i only need to point to one scene. If you saw a guy in your local park or even a car park (as in the infamous scene where fight club is officially born) having a psychotic episode and trying really hard to hurt himself in an at first comical, but as the moments pass more disturbing, fashion (interlude: Have you realised how hard it is to use physical attacks on yourself? It is a physical impossibility for most of us to kick ourselves, apart from kicking the other leg, or punch anything but the head with force). Anyway back to psycho dude. So you see him and its about midnight; what do you do?1. If your a good Samaritan you call an ambulance (and the mental health people). 2. If your a normal person you try your best to avoid him by keeping a distance of at least 20 yards at all times. 3. If your unhinged you help him accomplish his ever so difficult task of hurting himself.What you do not do is say, ""Hey dude, you're a great fighter. Wanna start up a fight club where we can all share our passion for self-mutilation on a weekly basis. You do? Great, we might also wanna erase the national credit history database without letting people know how we actually accomplished it by taking down a skyscraper."" I know not to take this movie seriously but the fact that the writer having come up with a good plot twist, using that as the be all and end all of the movie, couldn't be bothered to finish the job and tie up all the loose ends that actually make up the story really drives me up the wall.

Once the movie started i figured i knew exactly where it was headed, that this would be another pointless film that had no real point or purpose. once the story started unveiling and the narrator and plot got so detailed and descriptive i grew more and more anxious to find out the meaning and reasoning behind all the things said and done in the movie so far. First go around you will miss a lot and get so mislead about this movie and what its true meaning is. this isn't that kind of movie you just randomly watch because you want you and your friends to be entertained. no, this movie you have to sit down in quiet and really listen to and pay attention to all of it you possibly can. then maybe you'll know who Tyler durden is.",Fight Club

Some things were good, some were bad. Now Tyler Durden, that was the best thing about this movie. He was a guy that many people are envious of. Laid back, cool, exciting. Brad Pitt played the part perfectly. But just the whole story line was, in my opinion, not that exciting. Don't get me wrong, there were some awesome parts, but there were some bad parts as well. I'm not at all saying this movie was bad, but I felt let down or disappointed after hearing all the rant and rave about how great of a movie it was.

2361,DownWithCapitalism,A brilliant look at the human psyche,10,22 June 2005,"I first viewed Fight Club three or four years ago, and the first time I saw it, i didn't get it. I understood the fact that Edward Norton had created some delusional characterization of what he himself wanted to be, but I just didn't get IT. The human race, despite all our knowledge, all our capacity for thought, and the sheer miracle of our being, despite all of these things, we are always wanting more. It is the reason that we achieve so much; that we build skyscrapers, that we put a man on the moon, this is why in our eyes we can never be good enough, can never be perfect. This movie is not about a bunch of guys fighting, it is about contrasting stories of the human mind. On one hand you have Edward Norton (aka Tyler Durden) who on a subconscious level is so hopelessly lost in life, and in that principle of wanting to be something your not, that he remakes himself in his mind, and in turn that thing which he created tries to achieve even greater things, and so on and so forth. While on the other hand, in his frantic search for something other than himself, he helps thousands of people around the country let go of that human strive for perfection, and if for only a moment, find themselves by beating the crap out of each other. Two opposites react and complete the cycle, and by the end Edward Norton comes to terms with who he is, and is finally at peace. This is one of the greatest stories ever told, and sums up the human race in one beautiful story about the simple concept of being.",Fight Club
2362,liamconnors8,"""What's Fight Club about?""",10,21 October 2015,"The question is simple. The answer, not so much.If this question is ever answered by the explanation of some brash, barbaric action film, I would suggest you end your conversation (and maybe friendship) with your counterpart immediately. I can't understand how many times I've heard this film described in such a way and it truly irks me and proves nothing more than the fact that this person was unable to look past the title. I'm almost certain this was actually Chuck Palahniuk's original idea in naming his book Fight Club: weed out the narrow minded audience and speak to the people in search of something more. In any case, the action in the film is not representative of the story, it is more so used as a platform to relay some of the underlying messages. There is incredible depth behind this film and you need to look past some of its seemingly tasteless features to find it.Likewise, if this question is ever answered with a simple explanation, these people do not understand the film. The beauty of Fight Club is understanding that you cannot fully understand it. With hundreds of separate messages combined into one plot, there is no way to grasp the subject matter at hand. There are two forms of incomprehensible art: art that is so poorly constructed that it's intentions are not properly relayed, and art that is so methodical that putting it into words will only destroy it's beauty. Fight Club is the latter. From solely a film point of view, the execution is fantastic. Being a devout Palahniuk fan and having read the book, I could not think of two actors who would have represented their characters better than Brad Pitt and Edward Norton. Not to mention, they had an incredible challenge on their hands in basically putting an entire film on their shoulders. The supporting cast mast have had about 30 lines of dialogue in total, meaning Pitt, Norton and Helena Bonham Carter needed to be extraordinary in order to create a successful movie, which they were. The filming was exceptional and Fincher's interpretation and display were the reason it turned into a classic. In my mind, Fincher's greatest accomplishment was his ability to astound a numb 1990's society.This film truly changed my outlook on many aspects of life. I know the film has different effects on different people, and some may not see it as ""life changing"", but it is a must watch for everybody. Touching on a range of topics - corporate takeover, modern society's view of men, and mental instability just to name a few - it was truly transcendent.Palahniuk created the masterpiece, Fincher created a classic, and Pitt/Norton created perfection. Watch this movie.",Fight Club
2363,mysteryman21,One of the Elite,10,15 April 2009,"What is Fight Club? Like its main character, it takes on many different identities and seems like quite the epic journey to self-realization. Sometimes it's an action flick. Other times it's a thriller. Maybe even a light comedy, and it's all thrown into a philosophical masterpiece. Fight Club tells the story of the narrator (Edward Norton) whose life is in turmoil due to an extreme case of insomnia. He turns to self-help groups, which cures his insomnia because he sees people who are worse than him. The character is never given a name because he cannot attain a true identity. He is lost within the world as another soul with nothing to live for. The director (David Fincher) injects a lot of comedic moments throughout the film that work quite well. It is in fact a dark comedy, for example when they joke about a woman with cancer. Except, even with this subject matter, you find yourself laughing at what she and the narrator says. In turn, you feel disgusted with yourself and find yourself staring eye to eye with Edward Norton's character. He too is disgusted with his entire life and is stuck in this endless cycle. He then meets Tyler Durden, played by Brad Pitt, who seems to know exactly who he is inside. He is everything that people are not, specifically the narrator. I found myself wanting to be Tyler Durden mainly because of the way he handles himself. Brad Pitt's performance is wonderfully captivating as he teeters on becoming a psycho and yet you want to join in with that madness.They both decide to start a fight club in which people fight with one another in order to feel something again in their numbing worlds. The film is definitely geared towards the younger audience, but then again if you dislike the world at points of your life, you can relate. The only real flaw within the film is it gets a little off track. It delves into the excessive and overdone specifically with the ""space monkey"" scenes, but is able to get on again after a while. By the end of the film, the viewer is exhausted as the narrator aimlessly tries to find Tyler again after he leaves him. Although, he doesn't really need to find him ever again. I could tell you why, but that would be breaking the rules of Fight Club. The film successfully uses this plot twist to further its themes, but also add another dimension to the story for the audience.The film is able to work on many levels due to the amount of relating the audience can do with their own life. This is a story about how society is one big commercial. They are rebelling, specifically Edward Norton's character, towards that feeling and creating a new one by feeling a fist against their cheekbone. They are all so infuriated that by the end of the film, they watch the credit card buildings burn down to the ground. But none of them are scared, they know who they are and that's all that matters. The film touches on so many different subjects and tries to cover every reach of the human emotion. This is its brilliance and pitfall. It overreaches at some points, but grabs hold of something much greater at others. The film makes the viewer think on a grand scale and gives them questions. I still haven't been able to shake it off even after ten viewings. By the end of the film you won't be asking yourself what is Fight Club, but who am I?",Fight Club

We actually feel the frustration of the character with this world. We believe that our lives will be great and awesome but that ain't going to happen. And this movie shows us that fact. It opens our eyes to where we're living and it makes us doubt if we are indeed living. Again, the way that this movie tells us not to be dependent of what we have and to be prepare that our lives ain't going to be that great but still we can make a difference, it's great. We do have a lot of potential. Just like this movie. So, let's live like we really should. But first, watch this movie.",Fight Club

Because I really don't understand if it was bringing some inspiration to me or was it more of a mind set ... I am from India and We Indians make many good movies where in you can see a lot of character actors . I believe they are good But while comparing to to the actors like Brad and Norton, they are more like, nothing much to do It could be because of the exposure they get ? I don't think so, It is about the talent. I cannot imagine any one else in this movie other than these two. Awesome casting. And again, I am a a crazy movie watcher who waits for David Fincher movies to come out and go for the first day first show... Thanks for the movie, ..MR. Fincher.. because I believe this movie could make at least little changes in my life too.",Fight Club
2371,calincostian-57001,A subtle film,8,27 June 2018,"I have not read the novel, so I can only comment on the film. I was surprised to see that most reviews have been focused on the anti-consumerism message, which is certainly an aspect of the movie but is only the surface layer. SPOILERS AHEAD. If we ask ourselves why at the end of the film the Narrator kills Brad Pitt's character, this begs the question: was Tyler Durden a positive or a negative influence on the Narrator? If we revisit Durden's actions throughout the movie, it becomes increasingly clear that his influence on the Narrator is a negative one, despite Durden's efforts to convince him (and us) otherwise. Durden cleverly plays his card as a liberator, a knight in shining armor who has come to push the Narrator out of his dull existence and into a life of wild excitement and adventure. But Durden's reckless, dangerous behavior transpires through his every action: his relationship with Marla is nothing short of crazed, his violent tendencies are nothing short of insane, his building of an army for large scale destruction of property is nothing short of terrorism, and his sole goal is to dominate and influence the Narrator in order to ultimately bring about his ruin. So who is Tyler Durden? I would argue that he is not just an alter ego as other reviews proposed, rather he is the Narrator's EGO itself. Our ego uses clever disguises and non-sequiturs such as ""your life is too dull therefore do something that may destroy you just to feel that you're alive"" to drive us to extreme behaviors that look enticing in the beginning but in the end prove self-destructive. As an example, just before crashing the car Durden tells the Narrator to stop trying to control things and to just ""Let go!"". A good concept in itself, this makes Durden appear almost as a Zen philosopher - only in this case Durden's intent is for the Narrator to surrender himself to him (Durden). Durden creates the perfect illusion of freedom, which is actually an abandonment to our ego's whims that brings our downfall instead. The ego fools us and blinds us by making us identify with it and taking us away from our true self. This is why in the beginning the Narrator isn't even aware of Durden's actions, he sees only pieces of them until Durden's identity is revealed when they meet at the hotel. This portrayal is pure genius in my opinion. The end of the film is uplifting - the Narrator does achieve true freedom by killing his ego, arguably the most difficult endeavor we can undertake which requires tremendous courage and sincerity. The collapsing buildings are perhaps a symbol of the price the Narrator had to pay for taking too long to extricate himself from the clutches of his ego. David Fincher is an undeniable talent in filmmaking, I just wish he had allowed for more time to show the transformation that happened in the Narrator after killing Durden, although naturally every adaptation comes with its own constraints.",Fight Club
2372,samuelking199,good,9,15 January 2016,This movie is very great. My favorite part is when they was fighting on the roof and he knocked the man out. But I knew the girl put the bet on him and she knew how great he was. Then at the end the fighter was nice to bring his manager on there trip with them. I would watch that movie so many times I think it was a great movie. me and my whole family was watching it for a while it was great. this was the best movie I watched so far. so I believed u will think its a great movie. so if you have time try to check it out its very good..

One amazing thing is that the movie is so rich: it contains so many interesting scenes and ideas. Another is the combination of a both dark and very funny atmosphere. A last 'detail' that is quite subjective: I love the way the alternative scene is portrayed. (The Pixies' best number is used on the best moment.)

I read the book by Chuck Palahniuk first and then I watched David Finchers brilliant movie. Fincher has done great work and I can recommend this masterpiece. It's not all about men hitting men. It's about ourselves, our souls, our imagination. I learned a lot about people whilst watching the movie. First, I did not want to see it, but my elder brother bought it at our local DVD shop and asked me, if I wanted to see an extraordinary good movie. When I heard I was about to see Fight Club, I wanted to go, but he ""made"" me sit down and gave a bag of crisps to me. I thought ""alright, just another day wasted"". But I was wrong. I wanted to see that movie a second time, so I took it home to my flat, and watched it again and again (i think about seven times) I love this movie and I guess, it's my favorite one!",Fight Club

I don't mean this in any rude way, but it leaves you with some unknown intelligence, as for example, months after I saw this movie, my husband, my BIL and I sat down for hours examining the inner meanings of FIGHT CLUB. It was so mind-blowing, and really not your typical Hollywood movie. I think I quote this movie at least one time per day, and it makes it even more fun when I say something from Fight Club and a complete stranger laughs, or repeats something back.

Like the stupid things we would do to join any guys 'club'. Jumping off things, games with knives, guns, explosives you name it. That what makes this movie easy to identify with.

As the truth is slowly revealed and the bigger picture revealed you have to notice the directing of David Fincher as he displays the adrenaline and dilemma of the situation.Brad Pitt again performs amazingly, adding yet another type of character to his list of characters hes able to depict. His smug views and unwincing attitude throughout the film are definitely something thats to be admired.Overall this film is unmissable in so many ways, the ending is something to blow your mind ....(literaly)",Fight Club

Bob (Meat Loaf) is one of my favorite characters. In the beginning he has pain inside of course due to testacular cancer. But then with fight club started he lost his pain. Its like something you really wanted to do but you couldn't. You want to fight but you don't do it. It says fight without a reason to fight.

Putting all that aside i found this movie brilliant the carefree attitude Pitt uses for Tyler is almost exactly like he is portrayed in the book. Marla Singer is played beautifully and even Big Bob (played by meatloaf) are exact of what they should be in counterpart to the book. Even for those who are squeamish i must digress how important this film is on the veiws it presents of socioty.

Edard Norton is my favorite actor along with my favorite director, David Fincher. Along with my favorite actress, Helena Bonham Carter mixed in wit my boys Brad Pitt and meatloaf, they've really kicked out one hell of a movie and i am surprised that only now are people realizing what an awesome movie this is.

2398,toxic_animation,Film at its best,9,3 January 2006,"This is one of my all time favourite films. Unfortunately, not many people i know agree. The depth of ""Fight Club"" is of epic proportions as well as importance. At face value, it appears as a story of two men isolating themselves from society and rebelling against the system. However, as well as this, there is strong Fascist and homosexual messages.Brad Pitt's character, Tyler becomes the dictator of Fight Club, heading its progression into the eventual Project Mayhem. This could be seen as necessary as the members of Fight Club strip themselves of everything society gives them to reconstruct their own. This is shown on screen in a number of ways, including the rules of Fight Club, the absence of clothes and the underground setting for the fights.Although this has been branded as a male orientated movie, it is almost purposefully this way. The use of philosophical speeches by Tyler and Edward Nortan's Character, Jack's interpretation of them, sometimes amusingly done through the excellent use of the book Jack finds at Tyler's house, ""I am Jack's..."" I would recommend this movie to anyone interested in film, and especially semiotics in film. It is perfectly done and the book also highlights the subliminal messages ""Fight Club"" has to offer. David Finchers interpretation of the story through his directing is expertly executed.This is definitely a highly under-rated film.

2409,AViewOfYou,"Don't Spit in the Soup, Watch UFC!",3,28 March 2006,"Fight Club is incredibly over-rated. Why? It wasn't the the acting, which was very good, or the direction, which was also true to the story. The problem was with the story and then with the ""twist"" ending. The story had no resonance because, except for the beginning, it wasn't believable as fiction or fantasy. Once our hero (the narrator) moves in with Tyler Durden, everyone in the story serves only the plot elements without ever being believable in their actions.Other fantasy movies like The Matrix, LOTR, Memento, etc. manage to create a fictional world with somewhat believable characters. Some of them manage the ""twist"" ending very well. Memento's twist ending (or was it a twist beginning?) is excellent. Not Fight Club. It only piles on the absurdity.It's clear that the author is violently against materialism, against creature comforts, against middle class values. Hmmm, is he promoting the idea of fighting with others (or yourself) to be free? Naah, not really. Does he actually show the damage a bare knuckle fight would really do? Despite all the blood and relentless smashing of faces, the answer is no. Just a few new bruises the next day and ready for more fighting. Ha! And just what is the message? Blow up the system? Embrace anarchy? Join a cult (or Support Group)? Change the world by spitting (or spewing other bodily fluids) in restaurant food? Who really knows? Maybe it's a good way to let us enjoy lots of brutal violence and make us feel better because there is a valuable and deep philosophy there. Haha! If you want some good, healthy real fighting, watch Pride or UFC fights. After a brutal knock-out of an opponent, a UFC fighter was asked, ""Why do you do this?""

2416,king_0f_dairy_queen,It stays in the fight club.,9,14 November 2018,"Fight Club is a brash slap in the face of consumerism and the working dead. It questions reality. It is strikingly thought provoking and visually stimulating. The direction is incredibly brilliant. Director David Fincher (Aliens, Se7en and The Game) is at his finest here warping both space and time, dropping in things here and there to make things clear. Edward Norton is excellent as Jack, the narrator of the movie. He is a nerdy insomniac who catalog shops at Ikea and has a going nowhere job. Brad Pitt is dynamic as Tyler Durden, an anarchistic man who lives in a run-down abandoned house and makes and sells soap for a living. Helen Bonham Carter is also great as Marla Singer, the manic-depressive chain-smoking woman in both their lives. Her role is critical and she plays it well. There has been some controversy about the violence in this film but it is not gratuitous violence, it is part of the story and serves it well. It is much less than what you would see in your average Hollywood blockbuster. This is actually an insightful film and in many ways similar to American Beauty, although this film is much more in your face about it's message. If you are squeamish, you may not want to see it. There are some very painful bloody scenes, but if you can stomach it, then check it out. There is also a huge twist in this film that almost rivals the twist at the end of The Sixth Sense. And I must admit, it is the twist in this film that made me really love it. The best audience for this film is men in their 20's or 30's, but anyone that can appreciate film as a modern art should like it. One of the best films of 1999.",Fight Club
2417,netjustice,The most significant movie in my life,10,23 February 2006,"One night I decided to intrude into neighboring computers in the local dormitory network. Nothing personal, just looking for movies and mp3s. The very first file I came across was an avi version of ""Fight club"". It was a stroke of luck since all I could find in the next few months was almost worthless, but as for this movie - it was SO about time for me! The last thing I paid attention to is the fights proper. But I was appealed to this ingenious depiction of the suffocating atmosphere of contemporary consumerism and inability of an average person to lead a meaningful, and therefore satisfying, life. The movie deals with insomnia and its underlying causes, the charm and usefulness of self-destruction as well as the limitations of this approach. It also makes you wonder how far you would go with transforming your personality to avoid desperation, as opposed to changing yourself for the one you love. The picture radiates an unexpected healing power - neither due to the cinematographic merits per se, nor because of a happy ending or positive message. I suppose, at least for the actual target audience, it is the feeling you're not alone and there are many other ""lost souls"" out there choking and coping with it just the way you do. For me and a good friend of mine the movie actually meant accepting our attitude towards existence and trying to live up to this perception. We often found each other drinking and watching the movie simultaneously when one emailed his buddy and passed him a reflection that occurred to his mind during the film. Now this period is over but we still know many episodes by heart and keep a very warm feeling to the movie for all it gave us then. I guess there is no need to discuss the excellent work by David Fincher and the cast  the well-earned praises abound elsewhere. But I do highly recommend finding the script by Jim Uhls (available in the internet) and purchasing a double DVD set. The extras, such as ""This is your life"" music video, render it an excellent bargain.Go ahead and watch the movie. It's not about fighting others; it's about challenging your life of convenience and compromise. Watch, then think, then watch again.

All i will say is that this film is the voice of a generation, a generation fed up with every little thing in this world having a dollar sign on it, a generation sick to their back teeth of working their meaningless 9-5 jobs surrounded by people who value money as the most important thing in this world, to the people who slated this film i pity you for completely missing the point !, Brad pit is fantastic as Tyler, and the chemistry between jack and Marla is wonderfully simplistic in the lack of narration but explosive in the subtle looks of lust, anger and ultimately love, simply perfect",Fight Club

The idea it conveys is brilliant, yet unreasonable. Brat Pitt makes such a good alter ego. His acting style is nice. For a crazy type hes perfect. I think the idea of underground fight clubs though is not a bad idea. I think there's too much rage in society as it is. Men need more of a way to bring them down to there primal intincts. After all were all animals. Kinda like sex. So many problems stem from those basic instincts. Perhaps thats why this film hold s some validity. Though once they start terrorizing stuff, thats going too far. Still and awesome movie.",Fight Club

In addition to presenting a rather fresh take on life, FC also presents its material in a fresh way. My main interest in the film is in that, in my opinion, it does not present characters for us to think about. Rather, it presents actions for us to think about.

The pacing of Fight Club is very well done, and smoothly transitions from dark comedy to serious drama in a matter of minutes. I loved the subtle hints toward the twist at the end spread throughout the film, and have come across at least one new hint upon each re-watch.

I couldn't ever watch it until years later when I watched it with my dad who eventually didn't want to watch more of it. When I finally got around to seeing the whole thing the first time I loved it, maybe not so much the ending.
After watching this many times I still enjoy coming back to it for certain scenes. This movie is legendary and has unforgettable moments. The opening credits, the visuals with Edward norton picking furniture for his house. The movie has a very original vibe and look.
I knock off points because of plot holes and overall I feel the message of the movie is confused and nihilistic. It feels like an edgy teenager who thinks deep but incredibly narrowly.

A movie that grabs a hold of you and sits with you for days never letting go. Director David Fincher unscrews your head and scrambles your brain with his jawdropping visuals. As funny as it is dark and thoughtprovoking. Brad Pitt's best performance to date. If there was any fairness in the world he should get an oscar for this, but he probably won't. Edward Norton is god in this movie and I'll never see a costume drama with Helena Bonham Carter again. There's just too much to recommend in this movie. Too much quality to describe in words.

Worth watching over and over again.One more thing is: I've already lost my faith that the Oscars are given according to merits, but still I do hope this movie gets the best picture award cause it deserves it.

While there is much to admire in terms of acting (consistently high all-round) and art direction, two aspects of the film left me feeling down-for-the-count.First is the omnipresent voice-over narration.  Admittedly, I am not a fan of this type of narrative short-cut, but in this instance, it was used liberally through-out and unnecessarily 90% of the time.Second was the jaw-dropping plot twist, which I will not give away.

2437,Scarlett-22,Most exciting movie of year... but best?,5,19 October 1999,"I totally agree with all critics and comments here that laud the film for being exciting, both in terms of acting and cinematography. I also have no problems with the excessive violence. But I have a lot of issues with it's content: that women are portrayed as non-existent (save, of course, for what amounts to an emotional whore); that ""men"" alone are supposedly oppressed and confined by our society, as though they alone miss the action and challenge of the past; that social change here equals destruction, and not construction. Things can be dismantled and improved without violence and destruction, and this film leaves no room for that fact of life. I was also totally baffled by the comment about their being men ""who are babies, children, a generation raised by women."" Which generation WASN'T raised by women? And what does that have to do with their rage? Why wouldn't that make them, and not their sisters or fathers, angry too? I'd appreciate input on that. In addition, I think a lot of people who see this movie are not mature/intelligent enough to realize that for all the violence, that's not the only point of the movie, that there is more to it both cinematically and philosophically than beating people up. And it scares me that those people will take the wrong impression with them.

This is the first movie to address that without once mentioning the great clock change. A movie at once brutally disgusting, harshly confusing, and mentally disturbing yet still so beautiful you can watch it with the sound off. David Fincher brings the visual media to a whole new level and challenges the viewer to be more aware of the cinematic surroundings.",Fight Club
2442,Cynical-6,Fincher doesn't cease to amaze,10,17 December 1999,"What to say about David Fincher...Well, Alien3 was a compliment to the series, Se7en was a great serial killer thriller, The Game, although it stretched the imagination like silly putty, was nonetheless a masterpiece, and now, Fight Club.On the surface, at least in the previews, it looked like it was going to be an over-the-top, bloody, violent, fighting movie and, to a certain extent, it was.  But the whole underlying message against consumerism, coupled with a plot twist late in the movie that turned it into a sort of paranoid thriller, not to mention amazing acting performances, made this movie one of the best things to happen, not only in 1999, but to film altogether.It had everything - Cinematography, wonderful direction, a great selection for the cast (whoever decided on Bonham-Carter, commendations are in order), and amazing dialogue.  The script was full of quotes and monologues that will be pilfered for years to come, from the well known ""I want you to hit me as hard as you can"", to the clever ""On a long enough timeline, everyone's survival rate drops to zero.""Some say that the theme of anti-consumerism was enough, and that the plot twist (which I'm certainly not going to reveal, it's one of the best twists I've seen in a long time, and I can't imagine how horrible it would be to have someone *tell* you.) was unnecessary.  I don't usually criticize people, but I don't understand the reasoning.  First of all, the movie is based on a book.  And, while you could simply change the whole thing around and just use the central theme, that would kind of be in poor taste. Secondly, it wasn't confusing, didn't take away from the original theme, and threw an element of suspense that was not present before.  It also made you think ""Wait... is that possible?""  And, for me, literally forced me to see it a second time.  While you could make a point that seeing it again dabbles in irony, what with the anti-consumerism theme, the second viewing was a completely different experience, which only adds to my utter amazement at this film.If you can't stand violence at all, then maybe this isn't the film for you. But if you can deal with some fighting scenes, which were pretty graphic, and some sickening gunshot wounds, weeding your way through that will certainly allow you to reap the benefits of a movie that is definitely worth two hours.",Fight Club
2443,Gumpzilla,"Entertaining, but I'm not sure how it will hold up.",6,31 October 1999,"This movie was highly effective for the first hour and a half or so - I'm a big Edward Norton fan, and he was in full effect here. The film was quite engrossing, which made it all the more annoying when it seemed to go off into another movie for the last 30 minutes. In that final half-hour, it seems a great deal of effort is expended into making the film get sillier and sillier, and although the ending is fun in a silly sort of way, it really feels like it compromises the rest of the movie.People say that this holds up well under a second viewing. Having seen it with several people who were seeing it a second time, I'm not sure how true that is. There are a lot of clues given earlier in the movie as to what the twist is, but, then again, there are also a lot of things that seem like they violate the internal consistency of the movie.There's quite a bit to recommend this movie, but it can be (for people like me) also irritating in the end.6/10",Fight Club
2444,AJS-7,Brilliant. Stunning. Soapy.,10,26 May 2000,"Geared toward the young professional male and the sheer despair in the search for meaning in life, this film exposes the lies of both consumerism and so-called ""spirituality"" that so pervades middle-class life. Instead of turning to meditation, crystals, chakras, self-help groups and other New-Age dreck, *Fight Club* unflinchingly turns toward the material--meaning is found through mutually-consentual physical suffering. In a life so anxiously inured from any physical discomfort as the yuppie life is, the narrator (Edward Norton) seeks refuge not in enlightenment through spiritual uplifting, but through material degradation.The one thing that most Americans hate to face is the very fact of their own materiality and mortality--*Fight Club* forces them to acknowledge it without resorting to time-worn situations such as war, economic hardship, or old age. Only when one gives up the narcissistic fascination with one's own comfort does one truly confront one's mortality--and, by extension, one's vitality.Why the choice of soap for Tyler Durden's (Brad Pitt) trade? If, as Freud (and others) noted that soap is the marker of civilization, this film exposes that this marker is at base just as barbaric as the civilization on which it purports to depend. If one is not utterly revolted by the scene in which the raw materials for Durden's trade are gathered, one isn't human.Brad Pitt and Edward Norton give outstanding performances, and David Fincher's astonishing technical mastery and excellent penchant for dark moods (as well as dark humor) takes what could in others' hands be a moralistic didacticism and crafts a magnificent document of both despair and hope (although not the kind of hope one would expect).This is not a film for those looking for mere entertainment nor for those who are satire-impaired (i.e. those who, after seeing the film want to start a fight club of their own); but those looking for a film that is both visually stunning and thoughtful should view it immediately.",Fight Club

2446,TheDman,The comparison to Clockwork Orange makes me puke,1,11 June 2001,"Please.This is a dismal movie.  I'm going to spoil some stuff, so don't read if you don't want, but read on if you want to save some time and money.
After I sat through this abomination, I knew I'd come on here and see that it got great reviews, because it tried to be so artsy that weak-minded people would say they liked it just to try to convince themselves that they have advanced taste.  Midway through I told myself that if I heard that ""I am Jake's this and that"" line again I would get up and leave, but sure enough I kept hearing it and I stayed.  Maybe I'm as dumb as the filmmakers. The fact of the matter is that I haven't seen a plot this full of holes since ""Slugs"".  So if I start a fight club, the participants will just start showing up at my doorstep out of the blue and turn into mind-numbed drones that do my evil bidding???  Not only that, but this movie also taught me that if I stick a gun in my mouth and pull the trigger, not only will I live but I'll be able to talk to people in my normal voice, as long as I put a gauze pad on it.If you still don't know, this movie is about a clinically-depressed guy who's search for therapy leads him to Brad Pitt, who teaches him that beating the bejeezus out of people will brighten his spirits.  More guys find out about this, and they all join the ""fight club"" and then naturally go live with Pitt to become his evil minions.  Of course! This must be how the Wicked Witch found all those monkeys.  Their evil deeds get worse and worse, and the supposedly still-sane Norton inexplicably keeps hanging out with this bunch.  This leads to one totally inane scene where the evil monkeys return from a gunfight with one of their members dead, and all Norton can do is whine ""C'mon guys, cut it out"".So after this movie backs itself into a miserable corner, it's only escape is the equally awful ""It was all a dream"" ending, where we find out that Brad Pitt was just Norton's evil imaginary friend, and that Norton had been committing all these acts himself.  Please audience, forget the fact that the ""imaginary"" Pitt managed to pull Norton from a burning car wreck and pick him up off the ground and hurl him down a flight of stairs.  I don't care how psycho you are, your imaginary friend cannot physically pick you up.Plot hole #9233 asks us to believe that during this short time, Norton had been in EVERY MAJOR CITY in the US forming more armies of mind-numbed robot monkeys, and that every male over the age of 18 in the United States was now a member of his ""secret"" evil gang.  So anyhow, Norton finally realizes that he's been crazy all this time, and to kill Pitt he sticks a gun in his own mouth and blows his neck off, a wound which apparently isn't as debilitating as you would think, since he manages to get right up and make up with his girlfriend and watch peacefully as his evil plot comes to fruition.  But wait, you thought he was sane now and would be horrified at what he did? So would I, but that apparently also is not the case.Before you typically think that my movie tastes aren't as cultured as yours, let me tell you that I loved the masterpiece that was ""A Clockwork Orange"", and this movie was NO ""Clockwork"".  If Clockwork ended by telling you that the old man in the wheelchair was actually the killer and that McDowell was just his evil imagination, then we'd have a comparison, but Kubrick wasn't that horribly stupid.I am Jake's bad movie review.",Fight Club

So when I opened up my paper on the opening day of the movie, I expected to see the same review. Sure enough it read: ""Fight Club: Not the worst"". I thought that this movie deserved a least a 4 out of five. It had an orgional plot and as always Brad Pitt did a great job.

The script is great and the directing makes it even better.  The acting is superb.  Ed Norton is great as always (has he ever been bad in a film?).

For the first time in my life, however, I was motivated actually to get up and to leave the theatre in the middle of the film. Yes, the movie has a message beyond ""fighting is good"", but it is just so in-your-face that I couldn't take any more after the first hour. It did not help that I didn't care what happened to any of the characters, even though I don't have a problem with Brad, Edward, or Helena generally. Anyone who saw this movie and came away wondering exactly what the director was trying to say must have been asleep. I don't think that a film has to be completely offensive to make a point. Of course this is only my opinion! I know there is supposedly a plot twist at the end, and whatever it was, it just could not have been worth another hour and a half of this film to get to it.By the way I have seen other ""offensive"" movies and enjoyed them, Natural Born Killers being one of them, so I am not just being a weenie about the whole thing. I liked Se7en, and I completely loved The Game, but this one just is not up to their standards. See one of these movies instead if you have never seen a Fincher film before.",Fight Club

This film not only had a good cast Edward Rorton did and incredable job and even Brad Pitt as a beleivable, although intense character. Fight club used a lot of older tricks that I had not seen in a while, like breaking down the fourth wall with a monolouge directed to the audience specifically. while the effects where not the best I have seen the added to the film and by no means were the basis of the film.

2454,Ga-3,A twist I would never have guessed.,8,17 November 1999,"Fight Club was nothing like I was expecting.  I think based on the name I was expecting something more like Blood Sport.  It does not concentrate on fighting and who is the best but more on the freedom, release and desire of a man to fight. It is about a strange friendship that helps liberate a man from the regular bonds of life.  The formation of the fight club leads to bigger and grander schemes - all aimed at trying to free men in general from their normal passive responsibilities.  The club has a powerful far reaching affect. I think it is a very clever movie and introduces things I have never seen in any other movie.  It was refreshingly different.",Fight Club
2455,Eagle-31,Fresh,10,17 February 2000,"This film is a deeply felt experience for certain types of people. It encapsulates a mode of thought which exists amongst a number of individuals (all ages) to whom society and global economics are a realised force in their lives. This is not to say that this is the consistent conclusions amongst people who are disaffected with globalisation, but the type of imaginative creatures who are not lured by the consumerist dream. That this film is seen as unreal to many happy homemakers is testament to the level of engagement one can have with the film. If it is viewed as a piece of art in which disbelief must be suspended, it can not be felt. For some, this twists the soul in a way in which one wants to be manipulated. The response to this is not to start up a 'fight club', this surely misses the point, but to prod and push at the claustrophobic blanket which may veil all degrees of self. It may become a violent and bloody experience but ultimately emancipatory.",Fight Club

Who says that we don't like to fight too?Number Two: Don't expect to comprehend all details of the story during the first viewing.  The plot twists so hard at the end its enough to give you whiplash.  Just absorb all you can, talk about it for days afterward, and then go see it again.Number Three:  For the love of all things holy, see the film.  You will either love it or hate it.  Period.

2457,eksten,pure perfection,10,29 December 1999,"definitely the best film *i've* seen 1999!i saw it when it opened up here in malmö (se) on december 25th, and since i rarely go to the cinema and even more seldom on opening nights, i have to admit it was a deliberate choice. i did not want to get influenced or hear about the movie from other people - it often destroys the experience.however did one friend manage to get through to me and tell me about the film before i went (since sweden probably was one of the last countries it opened up in) and he said ""excellent"" so i tried to keep my expectations low...it was not nearly as violent and bloody as i'd expected, nor was it as abusive or offensive or over-all as revolting as i'd read. but, when you hear it you expect a lot and let's face it, today it takes a *lot* of violence and disgusting effects to surpass reality. i did *not* expect all the funny and humorous remarks and comments and laughed heartily at each and every one of them.from minute one until minute onehundredandforty (i wonder which minute they've cut out from for example the americans?), i was stuck to my seat, only my fingers moving as i tapped at the pace of the beats of the music (what an ace soundtrack as well, now that's what i call film-music!) and i was unable to speak or think when my brain and senses fought to imbibe what was going on up on the screen.apart from the ending (which *i* think could have been a bit more polished and perhaps made out to be more of a twist) i am in awe.
all actors did super becoming their characters, special kudos to ED NORTON (of course!) BRAD PITT (of course II!) and HELENA BONHAM CARTER (of course III!) - so refreshing to see HBC in something so different from the british costume movies.slick filming, slick performances, slick music and as i said at first - the best movie i've seen in '99. don't think it would go all the way to win an oscar for best movie, but that doesn't mean that i don't think it deserves it.and for those who say that it might start off / increase violence amongst youngsters and gangs and such - you better go see it again 'cause that's not what this film is about.as soon as i left the cinema i wanted to go straight back in and see it again, and i will go see it again. am certain i'll find even more hidden under the layers.and oh, this is definitely a film for those of us who wants to get the brain activity to rise - not just during the film but also afterwards when we think about the film.i encourage women to go see this film - it's not about men but about the society and about our lives.quoting tyler durden: ""It's only after you've lost everything that you're free to do anything.""SEE IT.

2458,dwillens,The most exhilarating movie ever,10,17 October 1999,"This was the most exhilarating movie I have ever seen. I sat in my seat for the whole movie, and I could feel this constant adrenaline surge. After I left the theater, I had a desire to go out and do something. Not even something violent. Just to do something. Anyways, some of the scenes were rather gory, but if you have a strong stomach, you can handle it, and if not, you can look away and not miss much.",Fight Club

However, it is still better than 99 percent of the crap that comes out of Hollywood. Norton and Pitt are amazing, and the direction of Fincher is visually dazzling. See it and remember not to let the last bit taint the preceding brilliance.",Fight Club
2460,Mr Black-4,"Awesome book, movie should be equally so",10,27 September 1999,"I bought the novel and 24 hours later, it was finished. I read the first chapter five times before moving on. With David Fincher directing this dark and bizarre tale, and Ed Norton and Brad Pitt in their respective roles of the Narrator and Tyler Durden, there is no way this movie cannot completely rock. To keep with the rules, I won't talk about Fight Club any more....",Fight Club

2462,RaycerX,Better the Second Time Around,10,26 May 2001,"This movie operates on so many different levels that it really takes at least two viewings to get a grasp of what's really being said. It's a great study that demonstrates the ""evils"" of consumerism and the loss of one's self. The dialogue is witty, the pace excellent and the direction flawless. It will make you think about who you are and what your priorities in life are and should be.",Fight Club
2463,Ken-027,Male-Centric fantasy land,7,1 November 1999,"Don't get me wrong, I enjoyed the film. But on it's second viewing I started to question the content behind the stunning art direction and the ever brilliant direction. I started to think that this film was targeted towards the 15 - 25 year old males out there that are struggling to find themselves in this world, MEN-X if you will. Not that that's a bad sector, who says any other demographic has found themselves, and certainly the social messages that the film is addressing pertain to every one of us.But...If this film is indeed targeting that specific group, young men, then what can be said about how the film portrays their would be female partners? Certainly Helen Bonham Carter's character is just as screwed up as Edward Norton's but we never delve into how she tries to resolve things. She is merely the punching bag for his characters emotional outburts, his lust, his basest desires and tirades. She comes back to him time and again though he treats her with no respect. Is that the best message around? Certainly she states that he is 'the worst thing to ever happen to her' but Nortons character laments the fact that he hadn't gone to watch her die, which of these is the stronger statement and which is the audience lead to sympathize with? The latter of course.Looking back on Fincher's other films, all of which I have loved and count 'Se7en' as one of my all time favorites, I have to say I am a little disturbed about his portrayal of women. Certainly Sigourney Weaver was a strong character but that was a franchise film that was based on Ripley being a strong character. Then we have Gwenyth in 'Se7en'. The sad powerless howsewife whose brutal death leads to the Pitt's main characters ultimate confrontation. In the game the lead female is certainly part of the 'crew' but when we meet her she is playing the role of a waitress. Her character does possess some bravado but she never the less is relegated to a subservient role in the film.Now, I'm certainly not calling Fincher a misogynist, and I'm definitely not trying to create a feminists 'operation mayhem' against this brilliant directors work. I just find it a little distressing that a director as in touch with the psyche of the times as David Fincher is can, in one of the best films of the year, portray a woman with a 1950's sentiment.Again, I loved the direction and art direction of this film. I think David Fincher is one of the most creative directors working today. It's just that in this film, a film that is destined to be viewed as a rallying point for allot of young men, he grossly abused his female character, to the detriment of all of us who truly admire his work.",Fight Club

2465,turntwo,Not What You Expect,10,17 October 1999,"The commercial advertisements for Fight Club portray a different movie than the one that is shown in the theater. I went expecting perhaps ""Lionheart: Part II"", a bunch of fighting in the streets, however I was instead giving a twisted plot with a brilliant(as usual) performance by Ed Norton. Brad Pitt also is amazing as his usual off-kilter self. This isn't a movie that you should pass up. I am impressed that they didn't let you in on any of the main points in the commercials, like most movies do these days- you are in for treat.",Fight Club
2466,Occupant,"Jarring, shocking and very, very true.",10,17 October 1999,"""How much do you know about yourself if you've never been in a fight?"" Switch the words ""been in a fight"" to ""pushed yourself to the limit"" and you've got one of the most true statements of this century, and the general basis to this movie. To say anything more would give most of the movie away. Brad Pitt and Ed Norton give stellar performances, as usual, and Helena Bonham Carter fits in perfectly with them. The only flaw I find is the lack of character development, not so much with the aforementioned, but the supporting cast.Much like 'A Clockwork Orange', this movie's use of 'ultra-violence' is not purely for shock value. It is used to portray the escape from ordinary life, and an underground revolution. It is not a drop-in boxing group. All in all this is an excellent film which reflects today's society and the release of male aggression.",Fight Club
2467,Anil-10,For Guys Only,9,24 October 1999,"One of the most ambitious studio movies in a long time. I will not give away plot details or for that matter review the movie. I will however say this: I'm not sure how well many women would understand and appreciate the predominately male themes in this film. Then again, its not a film for the guy who sits there with his mind turned off. It is a very visual film but the essence of the film is contained in Edward Norton's voice overs, particularly in the first 30-45 min of the film. Many people I am sure will comment on the violence but they are missing the point - it is a catharsis of that evil which has long lurked in the hearts of men.",Fight Club
2468,Reechmon,Fight Club had a lot to say,8,14 November 1999,"Saw it, loved it.Norton is something else. Fight Club had a lot to say, and did so in an interesting manner. The movie really explored what it is to be a man in this pre-millennial era. Never occurred to me that it was nearly 3 hours long.Project Mayhem showed that men are desperate to follow anyone who is a strong leader, even if the ideals espoused by that leader are totally wacko. In a time when lots of men are chained to their desks at mid-level boring jobs; where women seem to want a sensitive, intelligent, bad-boy, psycho biker; the film did a great job of highlighting the contradictory messages about power, strength, machismo, and the male self image.The movie was not perfect, however. Bonham-Carter's performance was great (and hopefully will help dispel her Merchant-Ivory image), but her character was not used to its full potential. Meat Loaf was fantastic as ""bitch-tit"" Bob -- just the right mixture of humor and sensitivity. The movie did lose a little in its pace during the height of the Project Mayhem weirdness.However, I will not soon forget Norton's final confrontation with his auto-exec boss. That scene was priceless. I highly recommend Fight Club.",Fight Club

I can say that Fight Club is one of those rare films. It's an intelligent, thought-provoking and shocking film that challenges the viewer's ideas and beliefs. This is what the art of movie making is all about. Using this movie as a yard stick, you realise just how bad most movies being produced by Hollywood these days really are.And to all those American kids weaned on MTV and Friends; do not go to see this film. You will need an attention span of more than 30 minutes to understand the plot. Go to the mall, buy some overpriced poor quality clothing produced in sweat shops in south east Asia instead. You'll probably consider it a better way to spend two hours of your life.Carpe Diem.",Fight Club

Fight Club is more of an experience than a 2-hour way to forget yourself.  It could of been 5 hours, I would not have known the difference. Although dark, it is truly the best film I have seen, period.

This movie contains some very revolutionary and scary ideas.  Your reality may never be the same.  Mine isn't.",Fight Club
2474,BlueMonk-3,"all style, no substance",1,3 October 1999,"Just came from a sneak preview of this movie, Edward Norton was nice enough to bring the movie to his alma mater, Yale University, but unfortunately it doesn't live up to the preliminary hype, or to the quality of his other work. The problem here isn't acting- he is still good in a demanding role that merited top billing(rather than being put under Pitt), and the rest of the cast does admirably as well, although Brad Pitt has played a role much like this before(see 12 Monkeys) and Helena Bonham Carter's role is pretty much as demeaning to women as it gets. Jared Leto and Meat Loaf, yes, Meat Loaf, are also in this movie, although you may not recognize Leto with a badly scared face or Meat Loaf with breasts(no, I didn't stutter). This film owes a lot to The Game, David Fincher's last movie, in that it ends up with a complex plot that is solved a little too easily and non-logically- I won't destroy the film by explaining how exactly, but the movie basically builds up to a climax that just doesn't resolve much, and then resolves that with a further illogical ending. The laughs along the way are not for the faint of heart or those who don't appreciate black comedy, but they are the highlights of the film, from the odd humor of Norton and Carter being addicted to help sessions for diseases they don't have, to Pitt's interesting use of liposuction byproducts. There's never too much appeal to the violence of the movie, but the combination of nihilism and comedy doesn't send the movie into mediocrity. It's when the movie turns serious that it starts to turn sour, as the plot twists out of control and a strange comedy turns into just another movie in the Seven/The Game/The Matrix genre of stylish, mindless violence without much purpose, point, or original plot. The script shows elements of literature that may have just been better in the original book, but otherwise, this is a movie with not much going for it except its cast. Answering questions, Edward Norton joked about how working with Brad Pitt was easier for him because he could always rag on him about Pitt's bad movies- ""Whenever he'd get on me, I'd just have to say 'Cool World'""- and also said he thought he had yet to be part of a ""stinker"". This may just be his first, and Pitt's latest.",Fight Club
2475,Oomps,"A good concept, I suppose.",3,15 October 1999,"This movie was interesting because it tried to make a physical struggle out of the main character's mental struggle. The only problem with this is that looking back you realize too many inconsistancies, although a mediocre attempt was made to cover this up.  I also thought that the ""moment of realization"" in the movie wasn't as quite as shocking as others because the movie gives way too many clues.",Fight Club
2476,kiera437,One of the greatest films ever produced,10,21 November 2000,"When I was first told by a friend to go see ""Fight Club,""  I rolled my eyes. Why would I want to go see a movie about men beating the hell out of each other?  But thankfully, I decided to give it a try.  As soon as the tape ended, I immediately rewound it and began it again.  As an employee of a Video Store, I see countless numbers of movies each week, yet made a conserted effort to watch Fight Club at least once every few days until I finally purchased it.  The depth of this film is so much more then any initial criticism may have revealed.  ""Fight Club"" is a comment on gendered socialization.  It comments on the evils of capitalism and the selfishness that rears its head daily in the rat race which Americans see as the norm. This film manages to analyze and interpret our entire civilized culture in all its complicated aspects in just a little over 2 hours.  And even amongst the critique and powerful messages, it manages some of the most intelligent and witty dialog that Hollywood has seen since ""The Usual Suspects"" in this critic's eye.  As a 22 year old feminist, many people look at me oddly when I proclaim ""Fight Club"" as my favorite film.  But those cynical individuals have yet to see Fincher's masterpiece. *****",Fight Club
2477,Daywalkr-6,Not as good as you think..,8,18 October 1999,"Overhyped, overlong. This montage of bloody spit and broken bones gives new meaning to the word excess. For the 2 hours and 45 minutes, you finally realize that violence doesn't solve anything especially in a story that begins to tailspin to celluloid death (which was the downfall of The Game) after the most intense scene in the film(the chem-burn).  The twist here is nothing compared to the Sixth Sense.  It's a cop-out, in fact, so that it could end.  It's disgusting to see masses of Americans gobble up anything Fincher offers.  Overall, this film is pure audience manipulation. Its subtext is like Three Kings (not subtle but blatant, overemphasized, and numbing).  One wishes that there is anything to see in a second viewing. To me, this isn't filmmaking for the sake of art or entertainment.  It's filmmaking leaning towards the lines of propaganda. Has Fincher desensitized you all?  And if Fight Clubs exist or are starting, are you going to blame the movie for starting them???  5/10.  Don't bring the kids.",Fight Club

The lead performances by Edward Norton and Brad Pitt were both excellent.  The movie was very entertaining and quite funny in places but also had it's serious moments and still has me thinking about it today.  I also liked the fact that the commercials didn't tell you too much about the plot, I was honestly surprised by a lot of the turns this movie took.  Although the movie's probably not for everyone I think there's a large segment of the population out there who will love it.(P.S.

I anticipated the opening of Fight Club for several months, mainly for the superficial reason of seeing Jared Leto on the big screen, that's my true confession...however, I was bowled over, blown away and left physically shaken by this powerful flick! I was captivated from frame one and never blinked until the final credits...what a brilliant work, masterfully written, acted, shot, edited--it's all good!! Lucky enough to see a sneak preview the night before the movie actually opened, I was a bit apprehensive about the violence--I typically don't see films that are laden with excessive violence but, this form of violence in it's most primal form was not offensive to me! The only film that came to mind as I watched Fight Club was A Clockwork Orange (much more disturbing to me) but this one takes you so much further...all the next day the images were still etched in my mind or on my eyes, I felt like I was looking through them as I went about my day...brilliant social commetary, great acting, and interesting twists that are at once foreign to us yet hit so close to home!! see it now! :)",Fight Club

I hear it's supposed to appeal to my generation (I'm 22), since we've been brought up on a diet of senseless violence and MTV.  Now, I don't automatically think there's anything wrong with violence in movies, as long as there's some justification for it, and I like watching MTV (when they actually play videos), but I found this film terrible.  Up until about the middle of the movie, there might have been a chance for this movie to find itself and deliver some real social commentary (which is the only possible reason other then pure, sick voyeurism that might justify the horrific violence). Unfortunately, ""Fight Club"" then took a turn for the worse, not for the better, and delivered an even more bizarre, more violent ending.

2485,taswell,I am Jack's Film Commentary,10,16 October 1999,"Fight Club may very well be the best movie of 1999. It is also a film that requires multiple viewings to gather the full scope of. Just watch the surface of this film, all you will see is gratuitous violence. Most of you will be offended. You probably won't last through the length of the film. Get past the brutality, you'll find a story about consciousness, how you have to fight to achieve it, and how easy it is to slip right back into unconsciousness. There's no doubt; this movie blows minds, p***** people off, and gets a good rise out of anyone who sees it. With lines like ""That's the best f*** I've had since grade school"" peppered throughout the movie, how could you not?Down to the technical stuff.Jack can't sleep. He works a job he hates, lives a life he hates. Jack needs out. Jack meets Tyler Durden. Jack & Tyler make Fight Club, a place where men hurt other men. Fight Club grows, and spreads across the country. Tyler begins recruiting men from Fight Club for an amped up project, Project: Mayhem. Jack doesn't approve. That's as far as I can take you and still be able to sleep at night. Visually, the film is almost tactile. Textured. You feel the rusty, grimy dirt of basements, squatter houses. Your eyes sting at the harsh florescence of cubicle life. The score, by personal heroes The Dust Brothers, fits the film to a T; dark, twisting ambient electronic sounds and break beats. Completely appropriate for the times. The same can be said for this movie as a whole. Few films manage to address timeless issues, and yet be one of the most socially relevant films at the same time. Fight Club does.",Fight Club

I mean, look at the title, could it be any less creative?  As it turns out, I was dead wrong.  Fight Club is the best movie I have seen in quite a long time.After seeing the movie, I looked for reviews and continually found people who did not like the plot twist at the end.  I personally think that it was the best part.  The first half of the movie for me seemed to be long winded and not really going anywhere.  The story didn't really come alive until the twist was revealed.  Once that happened, it made you think of all that happened in the first part that you may not have picked up on or saw differently before.  This made the whole movie experience exponentially more interesting.Maybe I liked this movie because I like the kind of plot twist/unforeseen ending that I first saw in movies like The Usual Suspects (my favorite movie).  Now, the absolute ending was a bit implausible, but it did not in any way detract from the whole.  The ending cinematic was great and the plot twist, totally unexpected, made the movie what it is: The best of the year.

2489,Aftenpot,A disturbing tale of the modern man,10,17 October 1999,"Fight Club is without a doubt the most interesting film to come out of Hollywood in years. What it's saying about men today, about the consumer society, religion, and the point of our existence is rather frightening. We were originally cave-animals, but we now live in a society where we don't have to hunt, don't have to fight to live, we don't even have to get up from the couch to change channels on the TV. As humans, we are not ""designed"" to live like this, and so it is no surprise that a lot of men today find themselves not fitting in. That's what the movie so disturbingly talks about, and being a David Fincher film, in such an incredible way.I just feel sorry for the LA Times critic who obviously did not get the point of the film.",Fight Club
2490,AdamD1,Holy.,10,18 October 1999,"I know I sound like a pandering idiot saying this (that or a marketer for Fox) but this was simply one of the best American films I think I've ever seen.David Fincher has intrigued me since I saw Alien3. At the time he was an untested talent and was largely known for making music videos. Wow have times changed. Everyone knows him best for Seven now. Which is a pretty great thing to be known for. Fight Club should change that again.I would make the comparison that we are seeing in the Fincher / Pitt partnership the same elements that have made Scorsese / DeNiro so timeless. This movie should cement that perception. (And don't get me wrong: Ed Norton is nothing to sneeze at. He was amazing as well.)Anyway if you haven't seen it, my recommendation is: see it. Yes it's violent. Yes it's gritty. But you won't see another thing like it for some time to come.",Fight Club

I walked out of FIGHT CLUB thinking to myself that David Fincher could be the next great director of all time.  I'll go out on a limb and say it.

2494,Demassey,Don't listen to negative Critics,10,19 October 1999,"This is the best movie I've seen this year, hands down.  If the critcs disagree, ignore them.  Half of them label Edward Norton's character as ""Jack"", which is completely incorrect -- Jack is a reference to a book, not Norton's name.  Anyhow, the point is that Fight Club is an amazingly crafted vehicle for some realistic sentiments on the life of today's 20 year old men.  I don't expect the film to be embraced by all, but defintiely recommend people to see it to judge for themselves.",Fight Club
2495,wpl107,Experimental Mayhem,10,20 October 1999,"The movie was one of the most visually stimulating movies I have seen to date.  The play on reality and space make this film one of my favorites. It is a film where you can look at it as being shallow and just an action flick if you want, and you can also take it on as a deep insightful movie of the times we are in.  I strongly suggest everyone to view this tremedously entertaining film.",Fight Club
2496,marc-131,A rabbit punch to the brain.,9,21 October 1999,"This is an excellent, thought provoking movie. Fight Club will make you evaluate your priorities in life. If you hate your job, see this movie. It's a mental kick to the crotch.This movie is a breath of fresh air in a very stale industry. The visuals are fresh, the script is raw and honest, and the ideas in the film might actually change your life.Don't be scared by the 'violent' content. The violence in this film serves the story well, and is used 'honestly.'  It is far less disgusting and/or titilating than many Hollywood blockbusters.Overall I would say; see this film if you are looking for a new visual experience, or a film with guts and brains.",Fight Club

This is that film.This film is not about a group of men getting together to get the c**p beaten out of them. This is not a film about sex and violence. This is a film about the very fabric of our lives today. I am in my mid 20's and I very seriously identified with the main character, although I've been told his name's not Jack. His desire to make more money, to fill his apartment up with ""things"", his feeling that there is something missing from his life. I can identify with all of these.I would highly recommend this movie to ANYONE. It will give you a real insight into the way that the world is evolving around you.",Fight Club

Double Jeopardy, anything that's different, questions the status quo, ridicules our society and leaves the audience wondering what did it really mean, gets thumbs up. Just like ""The Matrix"" this movie left me wanting more. Loved the camera work, angles and supporting soundtrack. The Dust Brothers dark technoish tunes are perfect. Gotta love when a movie becomes more than 2 hour event that you sit through munching your popcorn and sucking on that pop. More, more, more!I am still ""digesting"" what I saw and I'll be going back soon. Was the imagery offensive? Yeah, but I think we've all seen worst. Conrats to all parties involved.",Fight Club

With an original story line, great performances from Brad Pitt and Ed Norton made this a very memorable film! In a nutshell, the film is about one man's descent to becoming Anarchy's poster child. After having his apartment and his life destroyed by an ""accident,""  (Ed Norton) begins a new life of self discovery by living in a run-down dump of a house, and beginning and underground organisation featuring fist fights as a release for the common man. The film builds to a much larger plot which keeps you guessing up until the very end of the film. Some raunchy humor and truley unique charecters make this a great film.My rating: 4 1/2 stars. An excellent film! Go see it as long as you don't mind crude humor and LOTS of violence.",Fight Club
2502,spansule,"Cool, yeah, but good?",5,24 October 1999,"I think that the place that Fight Club was headed in the beginning was much more interesting than the place where it wound up in the end. It's almost like the producers saw Sixth Sense and decided that they needed a cool twist ending too and threw one in as an afterthought. Suffering from the same disease as The Matrix, three very good movies could have been made from ideas in Fight Club. Instead, they tossed all of them into one film, cheapening each of them and diffusing what focus the movie might have had. While the film does have a very hip look and a great feel, I couldn't help feeling cheated at the end.",Fight Club
2503,cleg,Must see movie. 10 out of 10. Go see it right now.,10,27 October 1999,Fight club in my opinion is a must see movie. The acting is great especially by Meat Loaf (yes Meat Loaf - he did  a good job) and Edward Norton.  The visuals cinematography and special effects were fantastic. David Fincher is now short-listed as one of my favorite directors due to this movie and Seven. The ideas that are presented in this film are by no means new but pop culture is evil isn't it. The writing is uncompromising with some very good points about society and how we have come to view ourselves in this modern day.  10 out of 10. Four stars. Go see it right now.,Fight Club
2504,Lofwyr-2,"Outstanding, but not necessarily for the common movie viewer",10,8 November 1999,"I originally wanted to see Fight Club due to the fact that I'm an obsessive Pixies/Frank Black fan, I knew ""Where Is My Mind"" was in the film. I was not, however, prepared for the treat I got.Fight Club was probably the most disturbing movie I have ever seen, but in a good sense. By the time I left the theater, I couldn't think straight do to the ideas literally shoved upon you. I don't really want to give much away, but I spent days talking and arguing about the various concepts dished out in the film.Edward Norton's unnamed character (who I'll refer to as Jack for obvious reasons) is complex and thought out. His constant voice-overs and narrations are actually quite captivating. Brad Pitt was not bad (and pretty funny) as Tyler, and Helan Bonham Carter did a decent job as the chain-smoking Marla.The real star, though, is the plot. Everyone raved about how great the plot twist of the Sixth Sense was, but I honestly think Fight Club's little secret was even more stunning. I had to watch the movie again to pick out some of the tiny details that I missed.Many of the people said they did not like Fight Club, do to violence, or the fact that they did not understand or like what they were saying. This film IS NOT for the common movie-goer. You definitely need an open mind to enjoy this movie, as well as a stomach for some of the gritty contents.

2506,akaBander,Too much to say.,9,28 October 1999,"It would be hard to do this film justice in just a few paragraphs... In short, I'd just like to say that Fight Club is one of the rarest of things -- relentlessly thrilling and deeply thought-provoking. Even better, it doesn't moralize or instruct the audience on how to react to the issues it forces into the open. The ambiguity of the ethical issues combined with the graphic and gritty violence makes this film much more powerful than the trailer could possibly convey.The only unambiguous judgement made in the story allows Fincher to play a consumate irony on the audience. He at once harshly criticizing the ""Ikea""/yuppie value-system, and puts the attack in a package that will appeal to the scions of just that aesthetic.",Fight Club

His films, Fight Club, Seven, The Game and whatever comes next are all decisive brillant films!  His work is never ignored and never put down like a mindless movie is.  People love his films and people hate his films.  The thing is, people never ignore his work. People don't shrug it off as some mindless dribble that they don't care to have an opinion on like most films these days.  If they hate his films, they have a strong reason and opinion on why they hate them.  If they love them, they have a strong opinion on why they love them.  Like I said, no one shruggs them off as not.  Decisive his films are!  Decisive and strong opinionated Fight Club is!  Majorly(sp?) atmospheric and strange yet compelling and never dull or uninteresting!  Fincher knows what he's doing in filmaking.  I say he'll go down as one of the greatest filmakers of our time!  He'll deserve it too!  Fight Club is a great story!  Probably the best story I've ever seen or read!  Fincher took Palahniuks deep character descriptiveness & applied it to film perfectly!

Don't get me wrong, Fight Club is violent but not that much, it has some action and suspense but deep down it is an amazing black comedy. Edward Norton is brilliant and his performance is even better than that of American History X. Brad Pitt is equally impressive proving that he is not just a pin up boy and Helena Bohnam Carter is a great surprise in a role few people could imagine her performing. All in all Fight club is the best film for the end of the millennium, that only requires an intelligent and unbiased audience. Even if it doesn't become a great box-office success, it is destined to be a generation classic. And that's enough......",Fight Club

2515,datkins-2,A misunderstood film about the way things ought to be,9,12 June 2000,"Fight Club has been described as social satire, black humor, or just plain trash.  The fact is that is is none of the above.  Fight Club takes on the subject of the diminishing male role in todays society.The setting of the film, the characters obvious mental and social anxiety, and the popular twist at the end are simply secondary plot elements.  In it's core it is about men finding themselves in a society that has nothing to do with them and in fact is against everything men hold dear.The film starts off with Ed Norton searching for meaning in his life.  His search begins in the current acceptable manner of support groups where discovering feelings and crying with one another are considered effective treatments.  This is especially obvious in the main support group shown, the testicular cancer group.Perhaps a bit of explaination is in order here.  Men hold their genitals as their only tie to a bygone era of masculinity, nothing takes away that feeling like the loss is a man's testicles.  (The same is true for women who undergo hysterectomys)  While this isn't quite obvious with Norton's character, Meatloaf's character Bob is truely hurting in a world where he has lost his balls and has to cry to feel better, both which served to immasculate him further.Eventually even this world is invaded and Norton has to find other avenues to explore the masculine tendancies that he cannot ignore.  Enter the Fight Club.Many people have written on the subject of this film.  Many with comments that they couldn't understand how men could pound each other to a bloody pulp and still be friends afterwards.  The answer is simple.  Fight Club is therapy.  Fight Club gave everyone involved a sense of self-respect that other forms of therapy couldn't or wouldn't address.  The mutual poundings that you received weren't to rob or maim or kill, but to prove to yourself and to others that despite your role at work (notice that most of the participants were waiters and busboys, very immasculating professions) or at home they were still men.  Men who could fight and sweat and get beaten and still be alive - in fact finally be alive for the first time.Fight Club wasn't about anarchy, it was about solidarity.  Fight Club wasn't about destroying society, it was about rediscovering a lost feeling. Regaining that lost feeling made the participants willing to destroy that which had taken that feeling from them.  They weren't killing people, they were destrying property and ideas.  Property from institutions that gave ideas that said what they were doing was wrong, and had been telling them this since they were born.From a personal perspective I didn't enjoy the plot twist.  I found it both a bit difficult to swallow and found it to be lacking in it's ability to explain what had happened in the movie.  However it doesn't matter. ***POSSIBLE SPOILER***  The twist was designed to show that such a sport could only be created by an insane mind - which is probably the only reason the film was allowed to be made by a studio.The basic plot wasn't destroyed though.  Take away a man's chance to be a man and he will attempt to destroy whatever took that away.  A great film about the male psyche.  I for one look forward to copycat clubs forming in my area.  I for one intend to join.",Fight Club

The surprising twist at the end is more than enough reason to see it twice.If you have never seen the movie or have only seen it once, don't read this next part.Upon watching the movie a second time, I noticed very clearly the subliminal images interwoven throughout the movie to remind the viewer that they are seeing things in flashback from the shattered mind of a man suffering from the stress of everyday living exacerbated by out-of-control consumerism intravenously fed to him on a daily basis.  These subliminal images take the plot to a completely new level, transforming the viewer's perception of the events unfolding before them as if watching an entirely different movie for the first time.This is a movie that makes you wonder if we are all a little ""nuts"" from the media perpetuating our unrealistic view of the ""ideal"" American from the moment we were born.  Kudos to the director for capturing the subtle details of ""Jack's"" fragile state of mind from beginning to end without making it campy, clinical, or forced.

2520,Marla-7,Character Analysis (Partial Spoiler),10,3 December 1999,"An amazing example of what happens when we let actors jump outside of our expectations of who they are.  Brad Pitt (Tyler) is amazing.  He is (in my humble opinion)the most perfect actor to play Edward Norton's alter ego. Good looking (but not pretty), tough, crude, loud and deliciously disgusting; these are qualities that I see a shy, Ikea-loving nerd (like Jack is at the beginning of the movie)wanting and needing enough to create Tyler.  (Edward Norton is also perfect for his role, being able to portray the average joe-schmoe and progressively becoming believable as a ""tough guy""). Tyler could have an attachment to Marla because he didn't have to hold her to the norms of society.  Jack could never date the social outcast Marla represented even though they were perfect for each other.  If he wanted Marla, he had to become Tyler.  If he wanted to keep Marla, he had to destroy Tyler and keep the ""new"" Jack as he sees himself.  This movie represents (to me at least) what we have to do to ourselves to break down the constructs built by society.  Often we have to build our own constructs and then when we want to relate to others, aggressively destroy them again.",Fight Club

The last act is idiotic in itself-- but it doesn't stop there, it reduces the rest of the film to a worn-out joke.  The climax literally took me out of the story. A missed opportunity.",Fight Club

2524,Anonymous (big brother is watching)-3,A movie with a superb begininnig and a brainless ending,4,16 December 1999,"This is not a movie that would have normally raised any interest in me. However, when The Fight Club first arrived in Spain, the reviews and critiques that it received in the press where extremely negative, perhaps the worst critiques i have ever heard towards a movie. This raised my curiosity substantially, and after watching the movie, I did agree with some of the things the critics had warned about.Nevertheless, I must say that the movie begins impressively, the analytical depiction of our western culture and the lifeless void that surrounds it, with some great touches of humour, is very impressive. One cannot help but to relate to the movie, because the emptiness under which Edward Norton's character lives is something that most people in our modern day societies can really identify with; it depicts a society in which materialism and consumerism are our only sources of pleasure, from which we get short-lived doses of excitement delivered from our material purchases. The director managed to display the most average man who had a normal job, flat, decoration, etc, someone who we could see as our equal, someone on our level. The familiarity one feels towards him should really be disturbing, yet it is not, mainly because after a re-count, he is a normal, integrated, productive member of our western society. He is what is hoped for and expected from all of us.The sad thing is that the director who started a movie, which I (up to that point) would have awarded 10 of 10, ended up delivering a movie, which I rated with a 4 of 10. The beginning is excellent, but half an hour into the movie or so, it is as if the director had introduced a completely different movie. From that point on it goes from bad to worse, and turning into another typical mindless Hollywood movie, with an unnecessary level of violence and a storyline which deteriorated by the minute and a precipitated ending that delivered nothing and just fouled those magnificent initial 30 minutes.",Fight Club
2525,Coop-29,An Excellent Film!,9,16 December 1999,"Fight Club, in my opinion, was an excellent film, and it should be as it comes from David Fincher.  Mr. Fincher has a phenomenal way of confronting materialistic issues with this film.  He is able to entertain you yet teach you a valuable lesson at the same time.  I think there is a little bit of Tyler in all of us.  We all have these urges to exclude ourselves from society and do what we feel needs to be done to help society along.  Tyler was a way in which we were able to use our imaginations.  The twisted way in which all of the characters are involved is typical of David Fincher. Just as in Se7en, Mr. Fincher causes us to really think through all of the events that are happening and see the whole sum of the plot at the end.  However, Fight Club is a movie that needs to be seen more than one time to completely grasp the meaning of the movie and its purpose.  I encourage anyone to watch it again...you will definitely see more than you saw before.  Great Job Mr. Fincher!",Fight Club
2526,cgonza,BEST MOVIE IN A THOUSAND YEARS!!!,10,17 December 1999,"I've seen this movie four times. I bought the book, the score by the Dust Brothers and The Pixies' Surfer Rosa for the ""Where is My Mind?"" tune. Yeah, the movie talks about consuming obsessions, but this stuff worths it. I actually bought three books, a first copy in Spanish for me, which I read twice, another one for a present and then the third one in English, the original version language. Never had a film hit me as hard as this did, Fincher direction is perfect, Edward Norton is perfect, Pitt is perfect, Helena Bonham Carter is perfect, everything is perfect!! You can see a movie twice and then begin to recognize some error, but in this one you keep yourself discovering, every time you go to the theater, a new detail to marvel at. Now, it is a movie that doesn't let you think, even though it was made for clever minds, because it hardly let's you breathe. This is, it is totally unpredictable. The plot grabs you and won't let you go till the very end; the result is dizzyness, an obsesive desire to see it again, insomnia and a smile that'll last for a week. It is shocking and terribly good. If you haven't seen it yet, YOU GOTTA GO!

My friends told that this movie was great but I definitely didn't expect what I saw.  FIGHT CLUB IS WITHOUT A DOUBT THE MOST ORIGINAL MOVIE I HAVE EVER SEEN.  While I was whatching Fight Club I forgot it was just a movie.  It grabbed hold of me and didn't let go till it was over. After the movie was over I sat at my seat for thirty minutes thinking about what it all meant (the movie has many deep underlying points but, you do not get a chance to think about them till after the movie is over).  I won't tell you my conclusions about the the overall point of the movie (partly because I haven't completly decided on them yet).  This movie is not just about a club for fighting as I originally thought, it is a gripping, deep drama about the disillusionment of generation X. It was acted out wonderfully by Edward Norton (the narrator).  I believe and sincerely hope he gets an Oscar for his performance.  Brad Pitt also did an excellent job pulling off the part of Tyler Durden.  I loved him in this role (and i dont even like Brad Pitt).  I feel his performance in fight club is his best performance ever!!  Helena Bonham Carter did a role unlike any she has ever done before (she plays a likeable slutty druggy) and she pulls it off great!!  David Fincher has made a masterpiece.  Fight Club is by far his best movie by far.  The way he directed this movie and the camera shots he got alone make this movie worth watching but, the acting and story make it the best movie I have ever seen. In conclusion this movie is wonderfully acted and gripping.  I watched it for the first time and couldn't stop thinking about it for three days so, I went and watched it again.  I am going to see it one more time and when it comes out on video I am going to buy it.  I feel this movie has a good shot at next year's best picture award and I certainly hope it wins it.  In conclusion all I can tell you is GO SEE IT TODAY.",Fight Club

This is going to be regarded years down the road as a very important film, not only for it's acting, writing, and directing, but for it's sheer and blunt honest truth. Forget all of this talk about, ""Is it too violent?"" No, it isn't. The reason they (the government/media jack-offs) didn't want you to see it is because of the truth that it told. And the anarchy that they thought that it would cause. This is a perfect film. Well, almost perfect. There was one line in the film that made me cringe (the whole lead salad comment). Other than that, it was beautiful.",Fight Club
2531,jurekf-2,People miss the point that the movie is about split personality.,7,16 July 2000,"SPOILER ALERT In the era in which Hollywood turns out piles of trash one has to look carefully for any sparkle that a movie can provide. Out of about twenty comments, out of 700 plus, I have read about this piece none makes the point which I consider central to this picture: it is a novel, and hence, fresh, take on the timeless theme of split personality. In other words, a variant of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde. Trying to give it political or philosophical subcontext is futile; thank goodness, given Hollywood's left-wing bias. While I have only rated the movie as ""7"", which is below its over-all IMDb composite, I am certain that, when viewed in the above contex, it will provide great entertainment in addtion to getting viewers to think. And that's an accomplisment in itself.",Fight Club
2532,wilhelmK,Search for male ego derails,6,4 February 2000,"What a disappointment. Strong performances by Norton, Pitt and Bonham-Carter could not save a flawed plot. The twist in the tail was not as calculated and cunning as the one in ""Sixth Sense"" and leaves countless answers begging. It's hard to believe that even the most perturbed and lost of men would want to follow a man that beats himself up in a parking lot and supposedly talks to his alter-ego frequently. What could have been poignant commentary on male angst in an ever increasing female dominated society is negated in the movie's final scenes. Men might feel emasculated and angry, but so much to want to return to a more primitive state of society? I doubt it.",Fight Club
2533,vedmak,This movie induce you to think,10,23 January 2000,"I was very impressed by this movie. It gave me a lot of thoughts to cogitate. I think this movie is similar to Matrix, but not in plot but in idea - we are all slaves of SYSTEM (or government, or customs) in which we live. We are NOTHING to system, but it can not work without us, so we have rights (and must have strength and will) to overpower system and make it work for OUR purposes. This is how i understood the idea of the Fight Club. I support idea, but i don't support methods of it realization.

2534,klousijc,Fincher scores again!,10,26 January 2000,"David Fincher has to be described as one of the best director of the 1990's and beyond.  The lighting used in ""Fight Club"" (florescent lighting) was perfect for the movie.  This movie is yet another success for this young actor, and it is great to see him continuing to use his trademark 'darkness' in this movie.  With a brilliant cast of characters, this just adds to the reasons why it scores a 10 in my opinion.  I continue to anticipate his next directorial project.",Fight Club
2535,wykoffkb,f***....,10,31 January 2000,"so i've been trying to figure out what disturbs me so much about 'fight club'.  it of course is not the social implications that i see critics talking about; i couldn't give a shit less. It's all been said before and don't think anyone can give a new angle on that one.it's that here's a guy all on his own.  no close friends, no close relationships.  business trips for a living.  i don't think, like a review i've read says, that he is frustrated by a boring job; his job isn't boring, it's absolutely revolting.  it's not an impersonal, mechanized society he lives in.  it's soothing and smothering and completely analyzed.he's very intelligent and probably has a good heart. he lives his life in a detached state; watching, mildly alarmed, lazily but enthusiastically performing his duties as a consumer.  there's a sense of emptiness in him that i immediately recognize.  it's been ever-present but growing lately in my own life.
on top of the emptiness there's an intense feeling of loneliness.  not just the absence of people, but the absence of anything greater than ourselves.  i surround myself with people, but the feeling never goes away.why was tyler recruiting idiots?  i don't think he gave a shit about fight club or about society.  i think he was trying to make the narrator someone else.  the person he could be. maybe it's the ultimate in self-love (although i don't understand the ball-cutting part.  you'd think i was in tyler's best interest not to have that happen).  maybe that's what was so disturbing.  he ultimately saved himself.  nobody else could.
maybe it was more a story about living.  so many of us are spectators now, i often wonder who is doing the producing, the generating, the creating.unlike the matrix (which i loved also, but for different reasons), this movie was very personal.  it gets under your skin.  so the matrix produces an 'oh shit' feeling.  fight club gives me a shaky, murky, heavy, turned-on feeling.it saddens me a bit that this is seen as a 'guy' movie.  i'm very much a girlie-girl and this has to be my favorite movie ever.  the images and the overall feelings it left me with are going to stay in my dreams for a while.  i don't even like brad pitt who didn't disappoint - he played the same role he always plays - the aloof, mysterious, enigmatic guy.  it's edward norton that won my heart along with the brilliant script and the kick-ass cinematography and the narration, the narration, ...",Fight Club

However, I was sorta disappointed by the final part. However, after seeing the movie several times now I REALLY, REALLY, dig this movie. It is simply put one of the best social commentary films I have ever seen. It is really brilliant stuff. Fincher has proven himself as an amazing visual director. This movie is truly well executed. You know this is actually the first time I have ever commented on a movie here at the database. I have rated alot of movies (I plan to go back and comment on those too), but this is the first time I have wrote about them Simply put this movie deserved WAY more success than it saw at the box office. It is brilliant. There are those that hate it. However they are few in number and many of them have turned around like I have. If you want to see a movie that is different from the average mainstream crap, but also good. This is one to DEFINATELY check out. You'll be thinking about it days after you see it!",Fight Club
2540,kemical_kid,Gotta be the best.,10,3 March 2000,"I guess the only thing that I want to say about this movie is that it is absolutely spectacular.  The pairing up of Norton and Pitt is superb.  I urge anybody who still believes that this movie is only about Neanderthals punching each other in dirty old basements to actually watch it learn that it is an amazing story about those grey sludge puddles in ourselves that people like to just walk around.  Best black-comedy ever made, and in the time of twisted endings there is no way that Fight Club can be beat.",Fight Club

2542,SFA,Why this film is so good!!!,10,18 March 2000,"This is simply put one of the best films I have ever seen. The actors are excellent, the script is witty and uncomfortably accurate at times, and the direction is amazing.This is probably David Fincher's best work. The direction is good enough as it is, but he still pulls out visually audatious effects that make the film even better! Take the opening scene, where the camera zooms out through a human brain until we're staring down the barrel of a gun. And that's just the first shot!Pitt is good as Tyler, in probably one of his best performances yet. He comes across as both a bit insane and very smart, at the same time, under a mask of coolness. That has to be impressive!Bonham-Carter is also very good as Marla, and you have to give her credit when she is basically the only female character in the film.However, it is Edward Norton who really excells in this film. One of the best acting performances I have ever seen. He is just so cool, which I know it hardly a good way to review it, but it is true!I was quite surprised that this film was snubbed by the Oscars, but I guess that a film that attacks society is hardly going to be rewarded by the Academy - wealthy people who believe they have more of a right to decide what is good than us! Besides, don't let the lack of box-office success bother you. In a few years time, this film will have cult status and be a modern classic.The one negative point I can offer, is the film will never ever be able to give you the initial rush you get when you see it for the first time. I entered the cinema with little background knowledge, and pretty average expectations, which helped to enhance the film in my opinion.
Perhaps the biggest irony though, is that this film provokes debate and conversation so much. My friends and I still talk about it now, months after seeing it!The first rule of Fight Club is you do not talk about Fight Club.See the film, and I bet you'll be breaking the rule the second it finishes.",Fight Club
2543,maple-moose,Fight Club - Everybody a Tyler Durden,9,3 July 2000,"""Any art that doesn't reflect the dysfunctional side of the society is an art in denial.""  Edward Norton said something to that effect about Fight Club (you can read the transcript in the DVD version).  I think it sums up the essence of Flight Club pretty well.  Confucius said that man is born virtuous and another great Chinese teacher said the opposite, man is born devilish.  It has been under great debate for hundreds of year which one is right.  And I said they are both right and Fight Club illustrated both doctrine, more about the devilish one though, in style.This film is about what people do to survive in today's world.  We have to be pretentious, dishonest, deceitful, fake etc and all such to get through our day to day life.  And what do we get in return, as Tyler said, ""to buy things we don't need.""  So we put on make-ups, perfume, designer dress, IKEA furniture to define ourselves and to portrait an image of ourselves that we want other people to see.  Ironically, our society cannot function without all these phony smiles and bogus outlooks.When asked what we want to become in grade school, we all said we want to be professors, doctors, dentists, accountants, and lawyers.  But the reality is our society doesn't need 50,000 professors, doctors, lawyers and such. Someone has to clean the street, handle the garbage, wait the table.  We are brought up thinking we will all be rich and famous and not the inevitable that some of us, a good portion of us to be exact, will fail to be anything of any significant purpose.Some people might envy the condo life (I do) Norton has in the movie but Fight Club told us that Norton is actually a member of the bottom pillar of the society (all condiments and not food).  These are only few of the main points Fight Club wants to get across to the audience.  It  recited the other side, the dysfunctional side of our society that we live in everyday but fail to see.  We fail to see it because we don't think about it.  ""We accepted the world of which we are presented.""  Said Christof from the Truman Show.I could image people not liking Fight Club, the old people who grew up watching Audrey Hepburn, Cary Grant will probably not liking it.  But for young people not liking it, they probably just don't understand it.  They don't understand it because they don't think other then the obvious. Buying a pair of Nike won't make you jump higher, drinking Gatorade won't make you Mike and getting one of those platinum credit card doesn't make you a millionaire but only knee debt in credit card debt.If the movie has a flaw, it is the disappearance of Tyler at the end.  The writers use it to explain the main plot but I think it could be done in a better way.  And I really like the apocalyptic ending.  Not every detail of the movie makes sense and audience probably shouldn't expect everything make sense anyway.It's really hard to review a movie like Fight Club, Roger Ebert gave it only two stars out of four which I think is way too low.  Personally, I will rate it as high as Pulp Fiction which is 3.5 out of 4 stars.  I would recommend young people go see Fight Club, you will discover more about yourself and the society after watching it.*Edward Norton, whom I believe has been involvement in the script is becoming a gem of the American movie.  He might turn out to be another Woody Allen somewhere down the line.",Fight Club

2545,chrisf1111,One of the best movies ever made!,10,30 April 2000,"Fight Club is definitely one of the best movies ever created for the big screen. It is totally worth seeing because the movie is completely original. You will never see another film that is quite like this. The acting is absolutely superb. Edward Norton is fantastic as the narrator and Brad Pitt is in peak performance for the film. Anyone that loves a twist at the end of a movie will be blown away by this movie. I know that I was. I sat around for at least 3 full hours just pondering all the events that went on leading up to the big surprise.Perhaps the best part of the movie is its views on life. I think that every person can find an emotion in one of the characters that he/she can relate to. Everyone that sees it should have a special connection with one of the characters or the way they think. Also, the fact that the movie lashes out against conformism makes it even more special to me. I pride myself on not being a corporate slave to the Man and this movie sticks it to him.  I loved this movie and I think that everyone should see it and try to somehow relate to it. I think it can change your life if you let it. To those who did not enjoy the movie, I urge you to go back and see it again. Not because you may be tortured by it, but because you may have not gotten the message that the movie gave off. If I could put this movie on a 10 point scale, It would get a 9.5/10. It's really that good. P.S.- If you see it, rewatch the last 10-30 seconds of it in slow motion and you will get a surprise!",Fight Club

Most people didn't realize it's theme wasn't ""Men love to destroy and maim"". It was about modern man's inability to distinguish himself from the global market. It was about the loss of individuality to consumerism and assimilation. And it's about the fight to revive basic, primal emotions long buried. Perhaps the mirror was a little too clear for most of America.",Fight Club
2549,beedeee,the best of the best,10,6 May 2000,This movie is absolutely the best one I've ever seen. It doesn't have only good characters and people to act them but it also has a great story with an excellent ending. As the name Fight Club tells it has fighting in it so it's stupid to judge the movie because of the violence. The fact is if an actor like Stallone would have starred it there would have been much more violence. Fighting gives only the settings to things that really happen in the film. I don't find the movie as an action film. It's much more than that.,Fight Club

Just after you finish watching fight club you'll wanna see it again and again. This movie seems to have everything. At first look at the trailer you think the movie to be just a mindless bloodfest movie, but after watching the movie you realise that the trailer only gave away the first 20 minutes of the movie or less. All in all the most pumping movie ever and it deserves much attention, even though the bloody old farts at the Academy Awards didnt seem to think so (only getting 1 nomination and that was for sound) its about time they got some new people to review the movies for Academy Award Nomination.

2551,rootychick,"mind blowing, pure genius, a film for the dis-illusioned thirty something.",10,12 April 2000,"Simply the best film of the last (and probably next) decade. I was blown away by this movie. A work of pure genius. In equal turns I was entertained, moved and ultimately affected by it. As a somewhat dis-illusioned thirty something I really felt that it had special meaning for me. I don't agree that this is a 'bloke' movie. I think that if you take such a narrow minded point of view then you are missing the point and ultimately the underlying themes created within this cinematic masterpiece. Edward Norton is simply incredible and is rightly described as 'one of the few truly great actors of our generation.' Brad Pitt was also outstanding actually playing with an honesty too often denied a film actor of his type. I would like to see more Norton/Pitt collaborations in the future. In conclusion Fight Club is an experience that no-one should miss. It is truly awesome.",Fight Club
2552,mark-515,A movie that hits you in all the right places.,9,5 April 2000,A dark satire on the bombardment of consumerism in todays world and the reaction against these constant distractions. With sly digs at Starbucks Coffee and Ikea furniture the fast but witty script is crammed full of throwaway one liners with Brad Pitt being excellent as Tyler Durden. Equally good is Ed Norton who lost weight especially for the role as a man beaten down by life so much that he resorts to being physically beaten up by people to lift him up. The film is shot with alot of style and the accompanying soundtrack by the Dust Brothers compliments the dark urban setting. Fight Club is a must see movie that grabs you by the throat at the start and drags you with it all the way to the end. Excellent. Oh and if thats not enough Meatloafs in it with breasts!!!!(it's true),Fight Club
2553,Krash Kow,Harsh. Driven. Smart. Poetic. Beautiful. Misunderstood.,10,7 September 2000,"In a year dominated by The Matrix and American Beauty, Fight Club seemed to slip by with little attention paid to any aspect than it's much over-hyped violence. However past all that non-sense is movie that is simply the one of most daring, challenging, original, smart and MEANINGFUL  movies to come out of Hollywood in ages. When I saw the first brief trailer for Fight Club at the opening of Star Wars Episode 1, I heard several in the audience remark audibly comments like, ""Aw, this is gonna be stupid."" I was inclined to agree. The trailer made it look like a convention underground fighting club movie like Bloodsport. Having little interest for typical action movies, I didn't think much of it. However, a friend and I decided to see it anyways on a larth. How wrong I was to assume that this was going to be a simple action movie! Instead of seeing 90 minutes of kung-fu, I saw one of the most intelligent movies I had seen. Fight Club tells the story of a nameless narrator(Edward Norton.) The Narrator lives out the advertising dream, attempting to find solace in material possessions and status symbols, defining himself by what he owns. Yet he feels trapped and unfulfilled in this mass-media approved neo-yuppie work-a-day life. His only relief comes from a series of support clubs he crashes. This is where Tyler Durden(Brad Pitt) comes in. I'll say little more. This is just the set-up. I don't want to ruin the plot for the first time viewer. In fact, the less said, the better. Simply put, Fight Club has a lot to say about a lot of subjects like the media, consumerism, sexual politics, self definition and most of all freedom. And yet, so many critics seemed to NOT GET IT! Instead of seeing the true points of the movie, critics decried it's violence and what was seen as Fascism. It DOES NOT advocate violence. It simply doesn't outright criticize it. And to those who say it is Fascist, I say you don't understand what fascism really is. I believe the negative reviews stemmed from two things: 1)People not getting it and 2)How UNCOMFORTABLE Fight Club can make people feel as it points major fault with our society that many of us blindly buy into. Guess what?! Any good social criticism is uncomfortable!!!!! Fight Club is in the league with films like A Clockwork Orange(Yes, you little Kubrick purists, I dare to compare them) and Blade Runner. Not truly valued or understood in its time, it will become a film classic and required watching in college dorms of the future. Meanwhile, the pedestrian piece of fluff that is American Beauty (Not to knock Kevin Spacey. He's great.) will sink into obscurity. In closing, no amount of review of this movie is enough to cover this movie without ruining it. See it for yourself. See what you can get out of it. If you have an open mind, you'll be pleasantly surprised.",Fight Club

This movie solves that ""problem,"" and gives the studio license to shoot a film veiled in psuedo-philosophies and violence.It's just dumb.  Don't try looking beneath the surface, because nothing is there (maybe that's the point).  It provides that men are imasculated and shackled by modern life...  their spirits crushed by their jobs and their possessions.  In order to escape, you fight.  It's so simple!  Give up the banalities of ordinary life and find your individuality in a black t-shirt fight gang.  Makes sense.  Teenage males will certainly think so, since it is filmed in the MTV style...  bright color palette, fancy edits, blood... mesmerizing (and simple philosophies tend to go over well on that demographic).It actually starts our promisingly.  I loved the first quarter.  Only when it attempts to provide us with answers that are, sorry, far out of the grasp of the writers, does it fail.Film buffs may want to view it simply for one of the sloppiest, tacked-on ""surprise"" endings in cinema history.

How wrong they were, and how wrong I was.  The actual ""Fight Club"" itself is a prop for the characters to explore the seamy underbelly of the shallow existence of 1990's corporate America.  I remember years ago a film by the name of Blade Runner opened up to bad reviews and eventually flopped at the box office, but now it is hailed as a revolutionary, groundbreaking piece of sci-fi cinema.  I feel that as more and more people become exposed to fight club it will achieve this status as well.

Few movies stays in my brain for good, they got their own real estate, without asking me that is.Fight Club is such movie, that sneaked in, grabbing real estate. I knew nothing about the movie, other than my friends told me it was a 90' classic. Already in the beginning, this movie made me focus on it. Like I was going down a alley, and this man jumps out in front of me with a knife asking me; ""what do you want to do?"". I was in such constant state throughout the movie.Yes it's a very violent movie, with lots of gore, but this violence isn't there just for ""fun"", it's there because it plays a very important role.

But on the whole I think that this is a very clever movie and has a strange twist at the end and if you watch this then you'll know what I mean.The basic story is about the life of a man called Tyler Durben (Brad Pitt) who is a single self employed soap seller. He is into soap, sex, explosives and fight club. Fight club being a club where men can release their stress by bare fist fighting in cellars and back alleys all over American which becomes an anarchist group who reek havoc across America and try to break away and destroy the system. This film portrays the dark side of America. This is a film which is really worth watching as it is in a league of it's own. I would compare this film to Brett Easton Ellis' American Psycho as they both focus on the dark and dreary side of life which is not much a part of films today.

It was really witty and very funny as well making an incisive comment on society today. What it said about the role and problems of men in todays world were most thought-provoking.I had been quite prepared not to like the movie after many most unfavourable reviews which would lead one to expect the violence to be most offensive. But this was not the case. The violence was quite subsidiary in many ways. It was only  used to support the main premise of the story - that men are cut off from real feeling by the life that we all lead today.
We have been encouraged to believe that men and women should have no differences. This is plainly ludicrous but society and education have built up this myth. Men have been undermined from their natural role and in this been emasculated. This really comes over in the film. Wonderful  -  all this and Brad Pitt too!! - too much!!",Fight Club

Let's begin with the acting. Edward Norton should be nominated for playing his character, because he's great as always, while Brad Pitt is just OK. The story is fabulous. Almost every sentence said is a memorable quote. And the directing! David Fincher is better than ever, with the coolest, never seen before, camera moves. As it is becoming a Fincher standards, this movie, has a surprise ending, even though it didn't needed one to be good, like The Sixth Sense. But that ending leads to a problem. It's an ending, that you don't believe, cause it's so weird, and strange. But it adds some fun to the movie, so it's ok. The soundtrack is good, basically techno by Dust Brothers, but the most fascinating thing about this movie, is that there are no good guys, neither bad guys.

I am not a film critic and cannot say, but I did enjoy watching the film.What I think many have missed is the statement the film makes (either intentionally or unintentionally) about the moral and spiritual status of modern society.  Depicted in the film is a society without a higher sense of itself, a society without faith.  Throughout the film the people depicted are struggling to validate themselves, to discover a purpose in their lives. These people, however, are unable to see beyond the culture of materialism in which they live; a culture that is defined, not by spirituality, but by catalogs, creditors, and corporations.  What they are left with is hopelessness, feelings of loss of control, and ultimately despair.In situations such as these in which despair prevails, people tend to react with violence and destruction, either directed inward to the self or outward to the environment that they believe to have failed them.  Fight Club demonstrates both of these.  In the actual fights, these poor bastards are so full of despair that they value having someone beat them to a pulp because in that way they have shared their pain and become less isolated. In the acts of juvenile property destruction and outright terrorism we see these same people striking out at the cultural icons they believe to have controlled and deceived them.  Either way, we are given a glimpse at the final stages of despair where destruction is viewed as more positive and uplifting than growth.Ultimately, I believe Fight Club offers a valid picture of our current society, a society that lacks spirituality and provides ample opportunity for people to despair.  All it takes is a quick look at the news to see much of what was in the film; purposeless violence, wanton acts of destruction, suicide. Take a close look at Columbine and I think you will see what I mean.",Fight Club
2563,soulman735,Fight Club is the best movie of 1990's,10,19 May 2000,Fight Club is one of the best movies of all time. I have seen it well over a dozen times.  This movie is an intriguing look at the mind of a button-down consumer who gets fed-up with the material ubsessed world he lives in and starts FIGHT CLUB with the help of his new found friend.  FIGHT CLUB is a place where other blue-coller men can express their rage in voilent but satisfying fist fights with other men.  This movie is a MUST SEE!,Fight Club
2564,Manonnie,Best of the best!!!,10,24 May 2000,"I saw this great movie about a year ago, and I'm still waiting until I can buy or even rent it. Here in Holland every other movie is brought on video after a month or two, but I'm still waiting for Fight Club!!! Anyway, you must understand that I really like this movie. The story is brilliant and the actors too. I can't think of anything negative, so I just say: Best of the best!!!",Fight Club
2565,sdk23,masterful piece of craft,10,1 August 2000,"How could the academy overlook this movie?  If you thought the surprise twist of Sixth Sense was groovy, you haven't seen what true craftsmanship can do for a movie.  This is this best piece of acting, scriptwriting, cinematography, and sound editing I've ever experienced.  Superb.  Be prepared to watch it twice to even begin comprehending this flick.",Fight Club
2566,roshie_anne,This movie rocked my world!!!!!,10,21 July 2000,"I was totally impressed by the technique and attitude of this great film. I loved how the film was always in motion, I did not at all feel bored during the entire show.  A little terrified at the ideas put forth but never bored. Pitt was excellent in this film, as was Norton and Bonham Carter.  Though the was a little hard to follow at times, it was a great flight from everyday boredom.  This movie has just been put into my favorite category.",Fight Club
2567,NotThatJamesHolmes,"Too good to be bad , but it is",4,29 June 2000,"Fight  Club  begins  with  a  promising  half  hour  and  falls  downhill from  there . Edward  Norton  gives  a  brilliant  performance  as  a depressed  office  worker  driven  by  capitalism . He  narrates  the film , guiding  us  through  his  pathetic  and  hopeless  life . I  was immediately  taken  in  by  the  movie's  slick  visual  style , and Norton's  performance  is  especially  convincing . It  is  here  the movie begins  to  crumble . Funny  how  it's  possible  to  pinpoint  the exact moment  when  it  starts  to  turn  sour . It  is  when  Norton  meets Brad Pitt's  character  on  an  airplane . He's  a  neo-facist  who  teaches self-liberation  through  violence . Norton  is  intrigued  and  joins his group  of  recruits  who  act  out  their  rage  by  pounding  on  each other  in  dark  cellars . Once  Norton  moves  in  with  Pitt  the  movie begins  to  pander  and  get  off  track . It  becomes  more  like watching a  very  bloody  remake  of  The  Odd  Couple . I  was  still  hopeful though , until  the  film  self-destructs  with  a  contrived  suprise ending  that's  totally  contradictory  to  many  of  its  earlier  events . The  suprise  endings  of  Magnolia  and  The  Sixth  Sense  worked , because  they  interlocked  with  their  themes , but  the  ending  in Fight  Club  looks  like  it  was  added  on  just  to  give  it  a  kick . Then  there's  the  final  scene ,  which  is  illogical  and  serves only as  a  cop-out , as  the  movie  ducks  responsibility  to  its  real theme , Norton's  unstable  mental  condition . The  material  was  here  for  a compelling  film , but  Fight  Club  never  explores  it . Instead , it falls  into  standard , formulized  Hollywood  mush . Seeing  Fight  Club , I  realized  you  can  have  great  ideas  for  films , but  unless  you use  them  well , and  find  just  the  right  note , great  ideas  do not necessarily  make  great  movies .",Fight Club

Unlike some movies which totally break away from the book, or don't exhibit the same sense of feeling, this movie delivers almost completely. David Fincher has come a long way since Alien 3.",Fight Club
2569,Porl D,I am David Fincher's brooding genius...,10,6 June 2000,"It seems quite fitting that during the opening credits of Fight Club the audience is taken on a tour of the human cranial organ. This is the ideal introduction to the gritty journey of a man who is trying to come to terms with his own impending self destruction. Gritty being the key word of course, for this film is grungy and darkly funny. Some of the ideas it seductively thrusts into your head you will find yourself grinning and agreeing with - I can easily see why this film has upset some of the more conservative (IKEA shopping?) punters out there. When it comes to freedom-sapping or or ""rat-race"" lifestyle choices Fight Club does not pull any punches. Brad Pitt & Edward Norton give amazing performances and are supported by equally amazing supporting roles from Helena Bonham Carter (finally outside of her ""period piece"" typecasting) and Meatloaf (who quite frankly needs some underwire support!) My advice is to disobey the first rule of Fight Club - tell everybody about Fight Club...",Fight Club
2570,woody_allen_is_god,Best Film of 1999.,10,14 June 2000,"""Fight Club"" was probably the biggest surprise for me last year.  I went in and expected ""Fight Club"" to be alright but not as spectacular as it was. It is the greatest male bonding film to ever be created.  The acting was kept realistic, the scripts dark and humorous tone was right on contact, the cinemtography was beautifully done using guralla camera-work, the editing had its good effects, sound-effects and sound effects editing (only catogory nominated) were awesome and wonderful to hear on THX, and the visual effects didn't have the fake wet look and looked really accurate when used.  ""Fight Club"" is the best film of the year of 1999. Christopher Scott Knudsen III",Fight Club
2571,MistaBrown,Long live Nietzsche,10,18 June 2000,I just love this movie. On the surface its very funny and entertaining. But the psychological and philosophical meaning of this movie goes much deeper. You can watch this movie over and over again and talk about it forever. To deal with the deeper meaning of this movie go read some Nietzsche.,Fight Club
2572,ebrocatto,my two cents,9,24 April 2001,"Well, first of all I think this was an amazing movie, yes the end is kind of trip , but I think its pretty original and interesting. The film is filled with social satire, and dark humor.Second I love and hate tyler durden. He has so many good points, specially about society in the modern era, but he ends up just being a hypocrite, he doesnt want to ""free"" mankind, he wants to be the leader of his cult, a god to all those who want to follow him. Also I dont think this movie promotes violence, the fights show you the true brutality of fighting, and ""Fight Club "" is nothing more than Tyler's little game to gain control over people. Last but not least, whether you hate or love this movie, realize one thing, at the very least,I makes you think, Think for youre self, dont let an IKEA catalog do that for you, or even tyler durden, or even me.",Fight Club
2573,Pea-6,"Outstanding film that proves the worth of Pitt, Norton and Fincher.",10,2 March 2001,"After first reading the novel I was initially apprehensive about the film as it is almost a rule of thumb that film adaptations never really come close to achieving the message that the book tries to get across. This is where Fight Club is a soaring success. The casting is almost flawless with Pitt and Norton delivering what are arguably their best performances to date.The scene is set with ""Jack"" our lead man (Norton), trapped in a dull, lifeless existence where his apparent lack of importance on this earth leads him to seek refuge in self help groups, posing as a victim of testicular cancer and tuberculosis to name but a few. This gives him the release and sense of importance he so longs for. This is where we meet Tyler Durden, a mysterious self destructive man who shows Jack and others that we are not unique or special through the means of secret underground bare knuckle fights where the mayhem spreads like wildfire. Without giving too much away this movie pulls some punches and a major twist (as per usual with Fincher films). Fans of ""Se7en"" and ""The Game"" will not be disappointed in this truly classic (and thought provoking) look at modern day life through the eyes of a man.",Fight Club
2574,jgranade,Where is My Mind?,9,7 July 2000,"The Pixies' song, ""Where is My Mind"" (from the Surfer Rosa album) provides a perfect soundtrack to the final scene of Fight Club.  I was already convinced of the movie's greatness, but when I heard the first few notes of ""Where is My Mind,"" my opinion was confirmed.  What a great artistic choice to have the buildings collapse to that song.  Bravo!",Fight Club
2575,Carlos Medina,Anarchy and Nihilism ... at its PURE,10,11 July 2000,"The first rule of fight  club  .... You know whats next. One of the better , most shocking movies of all time , unfortunately because of the lousy publicity made for this movie not many people got the chance to appreciate this movie at the theaters. With a very unique story , a fantastic first person narration (provided by Norton) and a great visual storytelling , fight club tells us the story of one more of us , a consumer , whose biggest fantasy is feeling that sensation of ""Being Complete"". That is until he meets Mr. Durden , thats Tyler Durden , who shows him the ""real way"" , and quoting directly from him : ""Its only after you lose everything that you are able to do everything "". Our Narrator (Norton) starts living on a downward spiral of decadence , culminating in ... well youll see it for yourself. Many people did not see ths movie because they thought it was some kind of action , too much violence kind of movie , well it is in fact a violent movie , but the word Fight , from Fight Club quickly fades out of your mind when you discover the true nature of the movie. So i recommend this movie to everybody who appreciates a great movie , with great actor , a brilliant direction and , plus , based on a great novel. ""People always ask me if I know tyler Durden...""",Fight Club
2576,fxchase,Highly underrated and highly original: Don't believe the violence hype...,9,21 July 2000,"I, like most people before seeing this film, was led to believe by the trailers that this film was going to be another feeble attempt at legitimizing a ""Mortal Kombat"" class of B movie.  After seeing it for the first time it became obvious that this was not the case.  Fight Club is undoubtedly one of the most original and entertaining film I have witnessed in quite some time.Virtually every aspect of this film works: the direction, acting, script, dialogue, and even the streamlined non-plot that somehow becomes an interesting one out of thin air.  Unfortunately the absolute ending does prove a bit weak but by the time you have reached that point in the film it really doesn't matter.  By the time the ending has arrived I found myself more entertained than I would have ever expected from such a frankly, sophomoric title.  I was very pleasantly surprised with every aspect.The unfortunate aspect of this film was very likely the title.  A few besides myself may remember mild protests and talk shows berating the irresponsible behavior of the producers of the film for making such a violent, repulsive piece of work.  I feel quite sure after seeing this film that the verbal tirade-tossers had not seen much of the film other than the trailers.  This film has half of the ""violence for the sake of violence"" type of sequences than The Patriot or an even better example The Gladiator contain.  Oddly, no one has complained about the multiple beheadings in either of these films who clearly had to have the violence to fill the void the plot and the script couldn't manage.  This is not the case of Fight Club.I find it disappointing that a lot of people will not see this film based purely on its title.  Violence is not the moral to this story: It seems to be more of a consequence in the lives of the characters.  This film is about finding yourself and ultimately realizing you are what you are and learning to deal with it or decide to step over the edge.  And it's actually quite funny at times as an unexpected bonus.I have personally heard quite a bit of grumbling about the ""impossibility"" factor of some of the events of the film, and honestly can't whole-heartedly disagree.  The question I would ask those who stake this claim as a reason to call this a bad film: Did you believe that monkeys could fly after seeing The Wizard of Oz?  I would think that the virtual IKEA catalogue would have triggered most to accept this movie as something other than a documentary.The Verdict: Funny, slick, smart, angry, original and memorable. The first rule of Fight Club: Don't let a few media-hyped naysayers push you away from an extremely original and entertaining film.",Fight Club

I'm usually not fond of Brad Pitt however, he did an excellent job in this film. Helena Bonham Carter also does a great job.

But when I was finally convinced to watch it my expectations were proven wrong. I was at the edge of me seat not knowing what to make of it until the end. Its a hilariously funny movie, with outcomes, and thoughts that  I could easily relate to, which made it much more interesting. I know that being only 14 probably makes me too  young to understand the movie, but I can, even though I'm actually not supposed to see it...

Me saying that this film is ""depressingly claustrophobic"" is not to put it down, as I am so tired of films that do not draw you in or engage you in any way. Just moving wall paper. This film is probably quite different to most films you will have seen, so I can not insist strongly enough that whoever you are you see this movie, for an experience that may change your perspective on films if it doesn't alter what you expect from films.SEE IT!

And who makes him the expert on people's thought in the next century? All I hope is that he should be born in the next century,so that I don't have to see his face and hear his name all the time while I am alive.I am feeling increasingly that we as movie-goer are becoming snobbish all the time. It seems, nowadays movies are intended not for you to watch,but for you to interpret.Then, instead of taking coke and popcorn into cinemas, we should have a notebook and pencil at hand.What this movie is all about,I don't know.And I am wondering how many of you people out there DO know what it is and why it is so ""great"".Are there really so many extreme situations and times in our lives? If it is,then staying normal should be viewed as something abnormal.After all,what is wrong with the ordinary men's life and feelings?Shouldn't movies display these instead of showing people the extreme cases all the time?As to Mr Norton, I have but just one feeling:truly admiration.Of all the movies I have seen him playing, he is always suffering from a split personality.He must either be a complete nuts or the toughest guy alive,psychologically.And what is funny about people's high appreciation of him is that there must be so many of you who are living experts on abnormity of personality, otherwise how can you truly appreciate a thing weird as that.Honestly, I HATE movies like this.It's so called ""taste""only makes people snobbish.To me,it is far more noble to go to a movie,because you want to see a certain actor or actress,then because you are told this is one ""DEEP"" movie by those sick film critics.",Fight Club

2586,Charlie L.,"Technically fascinating, but muddled message-wise",4,8 September 2000,"""Fight Club"" is worth seeing for its technical feats. Like ""Three Kings,"" it heralds the digital revolution that really emerged in 1999 and promises (or threatens, depending on your perspective) to radically alter cinematic language. But unfortunately, it's mostly style over substance. You'll find fans here and elsewhere praising the film for its message, but it's sometimes hard to tell what ""message"" they're talking about. Is it the rather easy attack on consumerism? The constant griping about lost machismo? The thread of generational conflict? All these underdeveloped ideas are simultaneously celebrated and undercut by the film, especially as the ""fight club"" phenomenon started by Tyler Durden/The Narrator spins out of control. Are we to accept anything that comes out of Tyler's mouth? Or are we to see through his rants as the product of a muddle-headed (and maybe crazy) wannabe culture critic? By the time the film's twist becomes clear, its story and philosophy have become so jumbled that everything falls apart. We're left with an impressively made movie without any real heart or soul, as empty as the consumer culture it supposedly critiques. (I can't help but note the fact that this is a big studio, big budget movie with big money stars and a big ad campaign. How sly that it in the end it props up the culture that gave it life.) It's a screen on which angry young men can project their pet obsessions, but for the rest of us it's hollow.",Fight Club

Moreover, it features Norton, who perfectly fits the character of a bored worker who looks for a way out: this way out is Brad Pitt... Very original is also the main starting title.

Also, some people didn't really catch what this movie is all about; some people just think it's a dark, bloody, violent movie.  The movie has so many good points about this generation.  It has so many good lines too, and every time I sit down to watch any part of it, I just can't take my eyes off it, it's just so interesting and well made.

2590,daniel-265,The Best film of '99,10,31 October 2000,"Fight Club IS the best film of 1999. It has more meaning than 'American Beauty,' a better twist than 'The Sixth Sense,' cooler than 'The Matrix,' better characters than 'Magnolia,' the acting is better than 'The Green Mile' and the directing is better than 'The Insider.' David Fincher has proven to be a great director with the masterpiece 'Seven.' However 'Fight Club' shows us how much more skill this director actually has and that he is not just a one hit wonder. I'm eagerly awaiting his next film. Edward Norton excels again as the narrator. Hot off the heels from 'American History X,' the actor shows us what a great character actor he is. The character shows us how much our society is falling apart. His life is a nightmare. He finds a new meaning to life when he meets Tyler Durden. Tyler is a crazy and wild guy that loves anti-social behavior and believes everyone can only truly live once they have lost everything. This film will have you thinking for days and days. It is an underrated masterpiece that was rudely ignored at the oscars because it was too violent. What about all the nudity in 'American Beauty' or all the violence in 'Saving Private Ryan.'

It is sheer brilliance in every single way, from the acting, to the sound editing (should have won the oscar!!!)... the music was perfect, the lighting was just write, but above all the script was.... did I say brilliant already? There are no other words. What impresses me the most is that aside from being entertaining, hilarious, sexy, exciting and surprising (no doubt there!), the movie delivers an important message about what is really important in life, and about how we let image and material things control us. The movie is about regaining what we as a society lost many years ago- it's about staring over... hitting rock bottom and that feeling you get when you have nothing to lose.This movie introduced a whole way of life to me and millions of others, and it changed who I am, how I think and the way I live my life.

2598,RedBinaural,Hitting Bottom,10,3 January 2001,"I've read a lot of these reviews that people have put on here.  I agree with the fact that this movie isn't about a bunch of guys getting together and beating the snot out of each other.I believe this movie is telling every individual person to stop and think about what his/her life is, and where it's going.  We need to take a look at ourselves and see what our society has become.  We've created this big corporate America.  The love of money and how we get it is what our lives revolve around.  It's sad; it really is.  Some people would give their lives for money and very often lie, cheat, steal, and kill to get it.  Sure we need it in society to survive and eat, but all in all it's not that important.  It doesn't make you happy or put your soul to rest.  Why should we be ""working jobs we hate so we can buy sh** we don't need""?  Perhaps that's why Tyler wanted to blow up the credit card companies, to show the people that the world's not going to end if you can't use your credit card. Life goes on with more important things to worry about.  Money is so interwoven into our society that we really can't live without it, but it surely isn't everything.  We are no better than the next guy just because he's poor or lower on the social scale than we are.  As the pearl jam lyric states, ""You are who, who you are"".One of the main themes of this movie is the concept of hitting bottom.  I just got done reading a very good book for college, St. Augustine's Confessions.  One of the things that Augustine addressed was the fact that we truly can't look at life honestly until we've lost just about everything and suffered.  We can't help but to be biased in our opinions when we're sitting on our own little pedestals happy and content.  When you haven't suffered hardships, you only see one side of yourself.  How do you know who you are when you've only seen one side or yourself.  Hitting bottom, truly hitting bottom is the only way.This is just one of the issues that Fight Club addresses.  I'm not trying to preach here, the last thing i want to do is tell people how to think or feel.  We should all do that on our own without the opinions of television, or anybody for that matter.  One of the main reasons why i wrote this review is in reply to ""radiofreeadam"".  I hope this helps you in your understanding of this movie.

If the Director had chosen anyone else besides Brad Pitt & Ed Norton this movie would have been a flop! This is the type of movie that you have to watch several times. The more I watch it the more things I pick up. Ed Norton plays his character so well that you are sucked into believing this guy's state of mind as written by the Director. Truly Incredible! Of course he wants to be the guy all guy's would love to be...Brad Pitt! My favorite scene, of which is Pitt's best yet, was in the basement with Lou.

As if the twist and turns weren't enough, Chuck Palahniuk (the author of the book) and Jim Uhls (screen play), create an aura of a motivational dementia. With discipline, a man can learn a great deal from this movie. It serves as a reminder of just how crooked the human condition has become, as we strive for perfection through means of materialism and we look for humanity in commercialism.As for the actors, what can I say!? I feel a real loss of masculenity when I say Brad Pitt is one of my favorite actors, but this movie highlights his excellent acting abilities.

2613,souleymane-27065,"Fight Club, a Powerful Satire on America's Unquenchable Desire for Materialism",8,6 May 2019,"Is there any extent to which ordinary lives of annoyed individuals could be exciting? Fight Club is one of them. The movie is about Edward Norton, the narrator of the story and an insomniac who encounters a weird soap salesman named Tyler Durden to establish an underground fight club with some unorthodox strict rules. The partnership between the two characters works well unless Marla Singer, the leading female character, intervenes and grasps Tayler's attention.The critical tone of the movie against America's innate obsession with consumerism is certainly one of the strongest themes as it was the factor that helps audience to understand what the narrator and Tyler were fighting against. The narrator seems to be grasped in the system doing mindless purchasing of pieces of furniture. This is a widespread trap of materialism being promoted through advertisements. Buying useless stuff is the source of pleasure for people. The rich in the movie spend a fortune over trivial items like perfumes while the poor part of the society starved for basic needs. This thirst of consumers is unquenchable unless they control it on their own.The same theme is mingled up with the notion of perfection and beauty in things. The narrator acknowledges the fact that people like being healthy and are obsessed with things that are ""perfect."" The contemporary American society defines a perfect man to be the well-dressed one, owns many pieces of furniture and sustains a pleasant attitude all the time. The consumerism and this need of looking well-off are rooting in the same desire of appearing ""perfect."" The Narrator implicitly states that he was himself a ""product"" and he struggles to sell himself.None of the characters in the movie appears to be believing in God or any religion as those concepts are totally fragmented in contemporary American society where consumerism is the new ""religion"". This provides them a deeper and emotional satisfaction that one may find in prayers or submission of one's will to God.The theme is spiced up with the jaw-droppingly impressive performance of Edward Norton, the protagonist of the plot. He puts himself in shoes of a traditional common man doing his regular job. His attire and entire mise-en-scene of the movie speaks volumes for the distinction of Fight Club doing a great justification with the central theme. David Fincher used his camera and lighting for the character development of Tyler who is often shown in dark and stronger points of the frame. This makes him a strong character like lucifer stimulating Edward's ego. He is imaginary but his impact makes created through cinematography makes him more real than the Narrator himself. Fight Club stands out of the crowd among all the movies criticizing consumerism like American Psycho and The Wolf of Wall Street. This fact makes Fight Club a cult classic and one of the best movies ever made on the planet against the greedy nature of man.",Fight Club

2615,kingrichard1983,One of the greatest movies of our generation.,10,25 January 2001,"""Fight Club,"" directed by David Fincher, is one of the greatest movies in modern cinema history. Like Citizen Kane (not that Fight Club is in the same league as Kane), Fight Club is both misunderstood and loved. There are those among us who despise the movie for it's violence and political views, and there are those who love the movie for it's look at the effect of violence on society, it's style, and the wonderful acting by Pitt, Norton, Carter, and Aday. I am one of the latter. The movies also stands true to the messages in the novel of the same name by Chuck Palahniuk. Violence is not the answer. (This is one of the best lines in the movie: ""Self-improvement is masturbation...self-destruction is the answer."") Anyway, I hope that others will discover this film for what it really is: a wonderful piece of art.",Fight Club
2616,mwn42,Male identity in the 1990s,10,25 October 2002,"No spoilers here, but this may be a comment for those who've seen Fight Club and are thinking about watching it again.After looking past all the violence, extreme cinematographic techniques, computer-enhanced images, and other tricks Fight Club plays on us, we see another level to this film.  It's a show about young men trying to find their place in society at the end of the 1990s.Edward Norton and Brad Pitt play a couple of typical guys in typical situations for men of their age, with no idea where to go with their lives. (Okay, you can argue that Pitt's character isn't so typical, and that he has some idea what to do.  I'd say he's only about a half-step ahead of Norton.) These guys went through school, graduated college, and got normal, thoughtless jobs (jobs, not careers) because they felt it was expected of them.  Now they don't know what's expected of them.  Their fathers are gone--can no longer tell them what to do.  They've been confronted with opposing images of what constitutes a man all their lives--the cold, power-hungry yuppie; the sensitive, caring friend to the environment; the politician that cheats and lies to the people he represents; the attractive actor/model who don't seem to be capable of having an original thought.They're finally coming to a point (and this is where Pitt is ahead of Norton) where they have to figure out what _they_ want to do with their lives, or give up live by these images society presents them.
Convinced that real life and growth come about from conflict, they start fight club.  Norton and Pitt's characters discover that in this repressed, politically-correct society, the best way to really know yourself, the only way to really grow, is through conflict.  They fight to see what they're capable of giving out and taking.  They fight to conquer each other, but more importantly to conquer themselves.  They fight to recognize each other as human beings and to gain respect for themselves and each other. Whether you're offended by the violence or not, you have to appreciate the symbolic importance of the conflict here.",Fight Club

Saw this movie first in high school and no other movie, to date, has made the impact on me that Fight Club has. It's a philosophically insightful critique of western society. Not to mention the camera work and dialog are superb. When I first saw it I didn't even have to look to find out who the director was, the lighting simply screamed Fincher. Fincher will always be one of the best modern directors but this film is undoubtedly the high point of his career.

2626,Bested,Solipsism hard at work,1,8 September 2008,"It's amusing to see all the ""brilliant"" comments about this crap film. Fincher, a smoke and mirrors hack who is convinced that more is more, wants to sell you on the idea that we're living shallow lives. The proof's in the pudding here folks. He bashes you over the head with his ""themes"" like a college sophomore. He is a master of the odious, puerile 'wouldn't it be cool if this happened' school of story construction. The film is filled with desperate attempts at comedy, mostly of the gross-out, toilet variety - so no doubt the sub-20 dilettantes are enthralled - but the film is wall-to-wall form over substance. Most annoying are Fincher's pet signature moments - you'll see them in all his worthless work: mention a pilot light - and voilà, the camera flies around a stove and shows you a pilot light. Presumably he finds this is magical as he repeats it everywhere - but we know it's simply his unleashed attention whore personality being imposed where it doesn't belong. There's no need to 'spoil' the ending - it's obvious to any thinking person within the first 10 minutes what's going on. F-",Fight Club

Without giving any spoilers, they have two different endings. One thing that makes this an instant classic is the use of lighting to set the mood throughout. Another thing is the repeated dialogue motif's, that help craft Fight Club into its own bleak ideological environment.

In other words, I was disgusted by just seeing him, I couldn't stand being in my seat, I wanted to stop and change the movie. And that's saying a lot. There is a Mexican novel that I thought was the worst in history. I was wrongStarting with the disastrous script that was not going anywhere, someone tell the director that he is making a movie, the dialogues looked like those of a book. I never read it, but it shows that it was copied faithfully. I felt as if the author was smoking marijuana while writing the book, there is quite a chance that it is true. It was an insult to writers who at least know that someone is going to read their works and they take seriously the construction of the plot by making a beautiful rise and fall with the subplots. Arriving at a conclusive climax.Contrary to the fight club that throws up the viewer showing random scenes without relevant content and sex scenes or related things without context that did not contribute to the plot just because, ""I am very depressed and edgy""In the end it is only a film that was the most popular because certain stupid Yanks had never seen any work related to depression and went to the first film they saw of that style and called it a masterpiece to reflect their pathetic life in that. 1/10",Fight Club
2641,felixpoirier-76579,"A mix of duality, anarchism and human nature.",10,3 August 2019,"Before my eyes, stands a masterpiece. Unlike any many other movie, this one provides an experience in which the viewer can totally submerge himself in the body of the narrator. Edward Norton (the narrator) is working to buy, buying to live and living to work. He is the product of a mechanized society that values things more than self accomplishment, a society that makes you associate items with success intelligently keeping you submissive to your employer and the system as a whole. After what seems to be a coincidental encounter, he is forced to put aside is slave-like mentality to meet his inner-nature's requirement.
The reason why this movie is so inherently good and continues to pollute everyone's top 50's is not for the brilliant acting, or the brilliant story, but for the philosophical deep rooted message creeping behind the screen, ready to twist your whole perception of Edward, as you slowly and innocently associate with him.

2658,karbuncle,A great depiction of post-modernity's rise against modernity,10,10 December 2001,"Fight Club is a movie capable of being viewed on multiple levels, one of these is it's post-modernity vs. modernity stance. Thinking that the miracles of technology and working for the greater good so in 50 years we'll have robots to walk our dogs and flying jetson cars has already been proven to have failed. we're not solving our problems through science. we're not as individuals happy for the work we do. post modernity is what's taken it's place. stick with more natural things, believing in instinct for once instead of what society has programmed into your brain as to what's right and what's wrong. men can be men. one line in fight club is ' we're a generation of men raised by women. i'm starting to wonder if another woman is really the answer we're looking for.' in a time when everybody's hands seem tied in one way or another, it's exciting to see a movie where the characters decide no more. they take it to the nialistic and anarchist extremes, and it's very fun to watch. more than once of course, because everytime you watch it you see something new. and the ending in my opinion was the biggest surprise of it's year, not Sixth Sense. watch it, own it, love it. it's Fight Club.

2660,geodezio,Incredible,10,18 May 2001,"Fight Club is one of the most complex and most visually amazing movies of the last few years. It manages to be funny and shocking, thought-provoking and crazy, appealing and repelling usually all at the same time. The plot revolves around a truckload of concepts, one being a fight club (I think you figured that out). However, to think that this movie is about bare knuckle fighting would be wrong.Some of the praise has to go to Chuck Palahniuk, who managed to address criticism at the capitalist society without being preachy. And most important, without trying to give out his own solution, but asking the reader (and then, the viewer) to think. But surely Fincher didn't disappoint: filling the movie with creative special effects, subliminals and nonlinear timeline, he made sure that the viewer fully experienced the story in the first person. More, the performances by the cast are all excellent.Apparently, a couple of reviewers didn't like the twist, feeling that it was there for shock value. I couldn't disagree more.Apart from the fact that these viewers obviously didn't read the book (if you read it, you would have seen that the movie had to develop its story like that), they missed the fact that the twist adds a whole new layer of psychological complexity to the movie, and most importantly reverses many concepts that were taking for granted until that moment: where complete control over the events was taken for granted, through the narrator's eyes we realize about how irrational his approach had been; we realize that where he thought he had already won over society, society had instead already hit him very, very hard. And, most important, we understand how the narrator developed a solution, albeit irrational, to his desires of friendship, revenge, and becoming a new man.Comparisons to A Clockwork Orange are often made for this movie.

2661,jthompson-33,My favorite movie of all time,10,31 May 2006,"I'm not very good at describing movies. But Fight Club is movie like no other. Its a movie where you have to constantly pay attention or you might miss something and not understand the rest of the movie. It took me two or three times watching it to get the full gist of it. If you haven't seen this movie and are looking for something different then the norm,I highly recommend!!!! If this movie isn't already considered and cult classic then it will be once its age increases. I know this doesn't really give you any details but this movie is very hard to explain. It is definitely something you have to watch to understand. ""Its not until you have lost everything, you are free to do anything.""- Tyler Durden",Fight Club

2663,elizabeth_maulhardt,Bravo! E. Norton,10,2 June 2006,"By far the best Edward Norton performance ever! In this film he gets out of his usual parts, he really has a great chance to show what he can do and achieve. This performance combined with his part in Primal Fear, and American X, are the absolute confirmation of his talent. I'm allowing myself to say that any movie with a part played by Edward Norton is worth seeing. Just to lay back and enjoy the countless personalities he can show, and the enormous menu of expressions and emotions he can play. Any of the above named are strongly recommended. In fight club he manages to compete with Brad Pitt, which is not an easy task and ends up proving he is a better actor. Norton is clearly playing a more rich character. And I think this overcomes Pitt's cuteness",Fight Club

Nevertheless, directed by David Fincher, the""fight club"" became one of my most preferable movies of all time. The promise that was taken by film was more vital that it firstly seems as. The plot reveals the life of depressed man Edward Norton, who searches for peace in different type of clubs which are based on meetings sick people. A little time later, he faced an individual after whom his life had changed.
Under the direction of phenomenal producer , all the way of the film was interesting to watch. The breathtaking scenes and thrilling phrases that are directly connected with the contemporary world, which made a tremendous impact on my view to everything. Nevertheless, the movie is not easily accessible to community, due to the reason that not of all part of society are really understanding the position of director. I personally did the same at the beginning. After the passage of several time I managed my time to rewatch the movie, and felt an opportunity to comprehend my lifestyle.
To recapitulate, this is the most influentials movie which has powerful meaning in the background( even bizarre) that Fincher had ever filmed. I strongly recommend to watch it until the very end.",Fight Club

Along with Office Space(1999), The Matrix(1999), American Beauty(1999), and Being John Malkovich(1999). The office movie subgenre was born out of the fear caused by the Y2K crisis. The films all exemplified an era of good feelings, overshadowed by an impending crisis. Fight Club is the story of a man who is unhappy with how the capitalist system forces his hand and actively seeks freedom from this system, creating a community of like-minded individuals.

It's a shock on some levels to see not only the delusions that one person can suffer from when they've had enough, but to see so many other people buy into his delusions.  The tricky plot is pulled off to perfection by a trio of great performances by Pitt, Norton, and Bonham-Carter.  I highly recommend for anyone who enjoys a movie with a riveting and surprising (and even occasionally disturbing) story line (i.e., if you enjoy Van Damme films, you will not like this one).",Fight Club
2678,allenwm-65463,Movie Review: Club Skirmish,8,1 January 2020,"The ambiguity of the frustrated striker characters is the first reflection on Finch's elaborate run. The violent spirit of an unsuccessful, helpless gray employee, against the soft and societal practices of work, makes him a lawless and cruel man. Alone alone and narrator of the story, he escapes with his imaginary rebellious symbol and escapes the cell of taboos and moral and social fears. The two are missing and the other is a guide. The battle for victory is one that leads them to ultimate victory. Victory is the same as overcoming the two long-standing companions of helplessness: pain and suffering. Physical pain and mental suffering. The two should not be afraid and the two should not be commanded. Physical pain should be packed into fists and knocked over. Every blow they make must foster a rebellion within them - like the germ of a lamb in the face of the death of a helpless fetus. Suffering but not from the skin. All from within. It must be burned in the spleen whether it be pain or pain. You have to stare in the mirror and say, 'I have no pain, so I can get away with it even with pain.
The exciting and energetic play of Pete and Edward Norton himself makes this the path of suffering for the film viewer throughout the tension. The tension that places the viewer in the spotlight like a lazy after work. The Challenge and the Whole Viewer Demands a lot of inside work along with the crude images of the viewer. You have to live inside the net to admire watching and touching on the story of the film: the complex psychotic journey of helplessness, fear and frustration.We said that the main character in the story is unaware of his duality and rejects it. It is with him that the story begins and is a manifestation of frustration, revenge, and pointlessness. The protagonist of his character is a leader who knows nothing but pain and suffering in this field and has found the path to victory: skirmishes and deadly physical exercises until no force can stand up to him. Have. But the story does not just flow like a zigzag, but into a dreadful basement. The underground I was born in the sixties to remember was the fertile soil around the world that had a garden of happiness and happiness in it. And there are still many who do not come out of this basement.The two, one firm and the other hesitant, set up a club for training. The leader who kills himself, both in the offensive and in the defender position, confesses to his opponents with impatience. It teaches them that power in the hands of the spirit is hard and fearless, not in heavy fists of hesitation, and ultimately in thought. Doubting winning or losing everything is the key to winning every scary battle. The club fosters youth. It makes them ready to face the toughest of pains and threats. And at the same time, he teaches them that the path to ultimate victory is not just the struggle to the death but the undisputed obedience of the leader. The method of training is also brainwashing. The disbelief of the club members becomes a certainty that they dare not look out from the corridor through the basement. Everyone is on guard.The club leader, now distant from the staunch pretense of being frustrated, is determined to experience a combination of power. The clash now has the potential of a whole underground group. What was fascinating about the experience of fear and violence now turns into a roaring train of dreams and desires. The dream of power, along with the order of blindness that calls for compulsory obedience, makes the club ready to practice hostage-taking, ransom and terror. In the long run, however, the club is awaiting inconsistencies and disagreements. As long as the two original founders of the club face each other. A frustrated rebel who no longer even knows his own sex stands against his brave orbit counterpart. The bloody controversy is watched by the secret cameras of a parking lot. A young man is shown by the cameras, who are mad at him. He is the film's first helpless employee.
The winner of the bloody controversy at the end of the film is on the rigid and inflexible character of the story. He continues the pretense of disgruntled power and humiliation to the point where it leaves only one option for the opponent, suicide. The loose and shaky character of the movie Now, in the presence of his ardent pretense, he pulls the gun tube and pulls the trigger. One who dies and dies is one of them: a hard head pretending to have shattered his brain. The moment he stands in the face of the violent personality, disgusted with violence and assassination, is the one who is the ultimate victor and ends this story.It's not boring to break into other themes of the movie. Including making soap from human bodies and the role of women and the status of women alongside these story characters.",Fight Club

2682,Morten_Kaa,A very original film.,10,2 April 2015,"After reading the book by Chuck Palahniuk I thought this book would be impossible to make into a movie. But Fincher nailed it. He made a really good and very disturbing picture, about society falling apart. What many people forget to mention about this movie, is that this movie, as most other Fincher films, has a very very very good soundtrack. I'm not talking about the music, but the sound design as a whole. If you are looking for at good movie to test your surround sound system with, look no further!The film is thought provoking, and would keep you on the edge of your seat, for the entire running time. The visual quality of the cgi work in this film, is kind of outdated, but since Fincher choose to use the graphic in a more artistic way, than those effects are normally used for, it do not ruin the film in any way. This movie is a perfect example of Hollywood meeting the Art-house. And it made it into my top twenty of best films ever.",Fight Club

Becasue of its 18 rating it didnt get to much attention at cinemas, but dont let the violent theme put you off, its an amazing film and once you have seen it once, it will be a different film the sencond time round.

I had preconceived notions of what the movie was about prior to watching but was pleasantly surprised to be wrong. I expected a movie similar to the 2009 Channing Tatum movie called Fighting but instead was given a film that help push me into the love of cinema and movie storytelling. As a teenager I liked Fight Club because it was different and I like the idea of rebelling against the status quo but 15 years later I enjoy it because I can better understand the feelings of a person searching for purpose and meaning in the modern world.Cast:
Edward Norton was fine in the lead role but I often wonder what other similar-age actors like a Christian Bale, Matt Damon, Ethan Hawke, or Leonardo DiCaprio would have brought to the character and if the tone of the movie, the narration, and twist reveal may have been more entertaining.Brad Pitt maximizes his supporting role with the necessary confidence, seduction, and controlled mayhem that makes Tyler Durden a legendary character. I always wished more dialogue or screen time was included (without plot being sacrificed) for Tyler Durden.Helena Bonham Carter is a successful actress but definitely feel she was miscast. I've read the rumors that Sarah Michelle Gellar was almost cast for the role of Marla Singer. I don't know how her acting would have translated to this film but would guess that both The Narrator and Tyler could have convinced me of their mutual chemistry.Overall:
Great film and has stood the test of time.",Fight Club

The acting cannot be better, funny at some points, and a very good movie! 50/10! Four thumbs up! (I know, impossible, but still, it's that good :). Also, if you look closely enough, then three times before Jack the narrator meets Tyler Durden, Tyler will flash for a split second on the screen. The only thing I didn't like was that Tyler died at the end, but, if you think about it, he really didn't, because he was an aspect of Jack's mind, who was an insomniac(spelling?) and a schizophrenic.

Norton and Pitt simply ace their roles by far, and show that they both are world class actors.Not all credit goes to them, as the movie is very good by itself, and the great acting only boosts the score. It's masterpiece, and one of the absolutely best movies in the world, ever, seriously.Honestly I cannot understand why Fight Club 2 hasn't come out, but then again, it might destroy the first one because it's that good, and I don't think the producer would want that, and it'd most likely take a lot to get to those standards set.If you want to see Norton and Pitt at their best when it comes to their acting skills, then look no further, this is it.",Fight Club

2713,prantikmjm,A Thrilling Ride,9,6 May 2020,"Fight Club is simultaneously one of the most thrilling and harrowing journeys of stories told through the cinematic medium. The mind-bending perspective of the creators of the film makes it a must-watch. The protagonist of the film is an average office worker with no unique talents or notable traits other than a dull work life and corporate travel. This opens up a mental chasm within him which propels him to seek asylum for peace and stability. This craving pulls him down a rabbit hole and he becomes more unstable till he meets the deuteragonist of the story. From this point onwards, the story is rife with twists and plotlines that keep you on tenterhooks, trying to guess what will follow. Subtle hints are given to reveal the plot but those can be pretty easy to miss. The only complaint is that the violence is at times over-the-top and the subtle cues are not-so-subtle to the keen-eyed watcher.In any case, the film adaptation of the book of the same name by Chuck Palahniuk does it justice, and I would whole-heartedly recommend this film to watchers who love twists.",Fight Club

2725,Zemus Golbez,a cynical and intelligent cult classic.,10,28 May 2001,"Fight Club is like a mix between; American Beauty, 12 Monkeys, and The Sixth Sense (but better). If you rented this movie for its title, you probably realized it wasn't what you expected about five minutes in. This movie has more to offer than a bunch of guys mutilating each other. It is narrated(in a dark monotone way) by the main character played by Edward Norton(American History X). Norton realizes his life sucks and his only way to unwind consists of purchasing furniture from catalogs, until Tyler Durden (played by Brad Pitt) comes along. I don't want to spoil it for you so I will just tell you, Fight Club is a definite cult classic with an ending that proves you can't watch it just once. This movie; is extremely well written, well acted, and contains many quotable lines(not to mention some very appropriate cinematography). If your looking for a dark, intelligent movie you must see Fight Club.",Fight Club

If you find it irresistibly trendy to let go of any hope or optimism, preferring to celebrate disappointment with the no-show ""perfect world"" some idiot parent promised you, and wallow in self-pity presented with a facade of fashionable violence, then this film is for you. Knock yourself out. I'd stop now if IMDb didn't require a longer review... Production quality, acting, editing, etc. for this film is all first-rate Hollywood.

2731,aaronhweiss,Masterpiece,10,4 June 2001,"From the astonishing visual style, to its stinging satire of American culture, never has a movie made me laugh so hard, or drew me in so completely. It is said that every generation has a work of art or an artist that represents the feeling and conflicts of its time.  Fight Club is just such a movie.  Although considered to be a statement on the impoverishment of white American males, Fight Club is just as important as any piece of art trying to portray the sufferings and ailments of a society, culture, or demographic.  Critics who dismiss the movie as some type of attempt to portray white males as having problems that they just should not complain about, simply refuse to be open to the fact that everyone has problems, and issues that need to be faced.  Fight Club illustrates the issues of its generation with great clarity.  It is not a matter of agreeing with the issues.  It is a matter of resolving the problems. Some of the themes in the movie such as consumerism, loneliness and nihilism only serve to illustrate the ""lost"" X generation, and are only means to illustrating a dead and lifeless society.  What is great about this movie is it does not provide all the answers.",Fight Club
2732,lukewarmskywanker,A film to love or hate.,9,9 June 2001,"Alot seems too have been written about this movie already! Which, I suppose, would please Mr Fincher whatever the content of those words.And perhaps that's the whole point about this film. It's not necessarily about any single topic.... male isolation, mental illness, violence, a sense of belonging etc etc..read all the possible and probable 'messages' that this film delivers elsewhere. This film is designed to make you THINK.If you don't want to think, fine, I too like to watch Bruckheimer's rubbish for pure entertainment. But if you want to walk away feeling  ""Wow, I truly have seen a masterpiece "", then see it!
You don't have to 'get it'. Don't feel lost if you think you ARE lost in the plot! Just wallow in it. Movies like this happen rarely.Watch it twice, three times. (The impression is still there for me.) This is simply one of the best movies ever conceived and delivered.",Fight Club
2733,mikeatp,The Greatest Movie of all time!!!!!,10,11 September 2006,"This is by far one the best movies that has ever been made. This movie ignores the guidelines that Hollywood has set down that a movie should be, a completely slaps ""Americas"" idea for the perfect and expected life style in the face. Edward Norton wasn't just right for this role he was made for this role. And teaming him up with Pitt was priceless. I would recommend this movie to anyone with eyes. To those who don't like this movie I hear there making another 50 cent movie maybe that will strike your interest.

2734,chetanc,"One of those ""Rewind!! I want to see it again!"" movies...",10,2 July 2001,"This must be the first time that I've seen a movie simultaneously hating and loving it. My first reaction was to rewind and start watching it again.The characters are dark and depressing, and they despair about the life they live in. And there are points in the movie when you cringe at the starkness. The film has a frank brutality which i haven't seen in a long time. You'll refuse to understand why men would want to beat each other up and feel good about it, why people get self-destructive, why anyone would want to live such depressing lives.But gradually, as the Fight Club progresses, the enormity of it develops and you'll begin to see the strength, the power and the message of the movie. The climax, of course, is the topping. Simple and precise. It cuts clean and blows your mind away.Edward Norton is brilliant. Brad Pitt just as good. Helena Bonham Carter's character makes you want to hate her, shake her and say,"" Get out of the life you're living in!!"". And of course, David Fincher ensures that the movie is a cinematic treat. Fresh, spunky and original. You'll know what I mean when you see the start credits and the 'shopping for furniture scene' with Norton.This movie is soon going to become a classic. You'd better watch it now and have the pleasure of anticipation of seeing it happen rather than the awe of retrospection of it having happened.",Fight Club

2736,trivialvoid,People really didn't get it,9,21 September 2006,"So people out there still don't know how to read between the lines? As I read some of the posts about this movie it dawned on me why I am still feeling spoon fed by most movies out there. There are postings here around pages 4 and 5 that confirmed to me that spoon feeding is still greatly needed. So since 'Fight Club' didn't do it, I'll try.First....to those of you that didn't get the ""meaning"" of this pic, I'll give you the quick in's and out's of what you missed. In a few posts people didn't see the correlation between ""Project Mayhem"", Tyler and the actual fight club itself. If you listen to whats being ""preached"" by Tyler, it's all relative to the rebellion that is fight club. The club and the project are one in the same. The platform for the rebellion. Why is this Club? Because there is a dumbed down society where people are like blind, deaf and dumb sheep following the likes of tabloid centerfolds. A world where e.mail and internet sex has replaced human contact. Where emotion has gone and numbness ensues. A world where people are so starved for human contact and restrained from one another by cubical walls that the response is ""G** D*** it.....hit me so I feel SOMETHING."" The ever over done metaphor that compares humans to rats running thru a maze; cubicle's are the walls of the maze and Starbux is the reward around every corner. Taking down the structure that creates this sense of irrelevance is the concept of the project. Like getting hit in the face, an act of rebellion is simply a natural, primal cry for the attention that has been replaced by ads that represent your demographic and plaques on benches after someone has died. Is it a far cry for anyone to try and imagine a world where we as Americans work the same hours and have the same value on family and friends and humanity as other cultures do? Can we get back to the time when we felt a bond with our earth and not that guy in the Dockers commercial? Can we ever reconnect with people and do less in the way of super-powerdom and more in the way of living the life that we only live once? Tyler.....What he is, that so many missed, is an enraged subconscious that allowed a man to break free of the mundane. Not because he was middle aged and not because a middle aged man needed to appeal to the younger demographic, but because a man was driven insane by the inhuman world we live in needed to break away. This character wasn't calling out the economic structure....but the sociological structure of the United States. He and other characters were made to be living strange and ""sleazy"" lives because that seems to be a common way for people to try and live outside the restraints of the ""socially acceptable"" since the socially acceptable is the only way to fit in to the cookie-cutter mold. Have you never felt so spoon fed that you just wanted to ""roam the halls"" and show and tell people that we are living a fabricated life in a prepackaged world.I understand that there are a lot of people that haven't been as exposed to the phenomenon of plastic wrap and cup-cozies as others like myself. Big city life, and the everlasting fight to keep commerce on its feet because Paris Hilton told us that that is what's ""hot"", is unfortunately what we've become as a culture. What should be important to us is gone. Don't believe me? Ask your kids these two questions: What does Starbux do for you? What do blueberries do for you?",Fight Club

2740,we_are_not,"Fight Club is, if not now, will be a Cinema Classic",10,26 June 2001,"When watching ""Fight Club"", you realise that this movie is a very twisted movie. By twisted, I mean that it isn't one of those films you expect everything to be clearly laid out in front of you in black and white. Very much like the time I saw ""The Sixth Sense"", I was sitting on the seat saying to myself, ""So what's the fuss all about?"" Ok, the film had just started so I had now idea what to expect. But did only agree to watch cause people fussed about it. The said to me, ""Watch it, man! You'll worship it, afterwards!""And quite predictable, as it seems, ""Fight Club"" evolved and developed into one of the most awe-inspiring films I've witnessed. It oozes with the essense of a superb film. It follows a plot format that every movie should follow, beginning with something quite ordinary and turning into a full blown opera of suberb acting, cinematography, lighting, and story telling. What also turned the movie into the gem it very much is, is the plot that is not so much complex but more taxing on the mind, so it doesn't leave the viewer like a stunned mullet, much like the absolute huge disappointment of ""Godzilla"" (1998).Edward Norton is perhaps is one the most talented actors of recent times and in his recent role in ""Keeping the Faith"" only statisfied thanks to his contribution to ""Fight Club"". Norton plays Jack, our hero, who's life isn't going to great at this time. While trying to handle severe sleeping problems and attending a post-testicle cancer rehab group on false pretenses, he meets Tyler Durden (played by Brad Pitt)who together they start a fight club, to ease their troubled minds. Brad Pitt churns out a another dazling performance as the ever so convincing character of Tyler leads Jack into deeper and deeper trouble.The highlight of the movie is the approach to climax, where everything is revealed, in perhaps the greatest plot twist ever put to screen (well almost, though it's up there with ""The Sixth Sense""). David Fincher movies always have had great plot twists, such as The Game and Se7en. His efforts as director ensure the beauty of this film and his magic touch leaves that tingling feeling as the credits begin to roll.""Fight Club"", may not be the movie for everyone. It may be too wierd. It may be too stupid. It may be that your not the one for those crazy pscyhcological-plot-twist flicks. For what ever reason you may or may not enjoy this, it is worth seeing it at least once for the experience. ""Fight Club"" is an extremely important landmark as pscyhcological thrillers go. I'm very sure ""Fight Club"" will become a movie classic alongside films like ""Se7en"" and ""The Game"", in a era of mind game thrillers.",Fight Club

2742,lardbucket,Changing your reflection...,10,28 June 2001,"Upon seeing this giant of the film world there was something that sparked inside me.  It was only until afterwards, plently of study and looking at many of others' comments have I been able to truly justify my reason for liking this film.  I don't like it, that would be an understatement, I love it, I go to bed with it and believe me I can last the full two hours.It is not only I that adore this film, but there are many who hate it, but still would add it otno their all-time top ten of greatest films. Something they can admire is my justification for people reasoning it in this kind of way.  It is true, what is there not to admire the all-out vulgarity of the film, but at the same time it has an intelligence and elegance.  It is a six feet tall slim blonde model who can defuse bombs and cure cancer type movie in the metaphorical sense of the words.And who ever thought that a film would get made by a corporation like Fox? is this paving the way for future films by the large studios that are pushing avant-garde ideas into the mainstream?  Let's hope it is, because it is not just being appreciated by us, the people who read film in an analytical sense, but it is appealling to the general film-going audience.So many criticisms that I have heard, such as the levels of exposure in the film.  I can see parts of people, and who ever said that we need to see all of them.  I heard David Fincher's comments about it, and him saying that we see too much of the eyes.  Relating this back to the primal state of the film and the self-destructional aspect, Apes have black areas of the eye where we have white so you cannot follow their gaze.  Now maybe that was unintended by Fincher for me or anyone else to pick up, but still it is true that we always do not have to adhere to rules when making a film, rules are there to be broken and this is something we have to hold in ourselves.To say one last thing about Fight Club, you can enjoy it onany level you want to, noticing every detail and really considering the effort that it takes to give it this much depth, or just sit back and soak up this original (in terms of commercial cinema) aesthetic we have been offered.",Fight Club

The idea that things we own own us is well expressed. However, as some of you have commented, it seems silly that Brad Pitt is remarking on how society expects all men to look fit/handsome etc. Not only is he ripped, but his hair is constantly styled in such a way that it is obvious that this character cares enough about appearances to put time into gelling his hair.

This film is one of my top 5 to say the least, everything about it just works so well its beautiful to watch.The characters are fantastic, intriguing and brilliantly acted by two of the most under appreciated actors around in Brad Pitt and Ed Norton; the two are brilliant as they are so contrasting but at the same time the chemistry between them is palpable which draws you towards them even more.Simply shot with no head hurting panoramic artistic wide frames or abstract shots which makes the film as a whole seem so linear... until the twist which just gives this film something so magic it can't really be analysed or explained.Enough babble, in summary Fight Club is top notch and does over most of the processed crap which comes out in the cinema month after month!

2761,caterinaferrera,trying to find the meaning,8,17 December 2020,"While I did not enjoy the inappropriate content in the movie, I still believe Fight Club was a masterpiece. I initially found it really confusing but as I continued watching I was completely hooked. I wanted to understand its message, and to do that I pieced the small reactions I heard from my friends as they were watching it with me such as: ""I really don't understand men"" or ""men are truly wild"". I also read other people's opinions and watch a video of someone's explanation of the film.
The best explanation I could find, and the one that aligned with my thoughts the most was one written by Matt Goldberg titled ""'Fight Club': Over 20 years Later and Bros Are Still Missing the Point of David Fincher's Satire"", which basically stated the movie was criticizing modern toxic masculinity.
As you can see throughout the story the narrator has trouble finding a way to expressing his emotions and is in pursuit of his true meaning in life. His inability to convey what he feels and his lack of personality both lead to the conflict of this film. He begins as a consumer, buying things is what gives him purpose. His furniture from IKEA is his most prized possession. Soon he realizes this is not good enough for him, so he sets off an explosion in his condo (or rather his alter ego does) and becomes a complete anti-capitalist. He believes he needs to become a true man, unlike those who have to go to the gym to be ""strong"". He finds his new purpose in the fight club, which seems helpful at first, but violence does nothing to help find himself or find a significant place in the world.",Fight Club

And it is amazing that it ever materialized. It has a huge budget for a film of this type, well actually there has never been anything quite like this before. When I first went to see it I though ""Oh great some beat-them-up that stars Brad Pitt."" After I came out of the theatre I knew that this is a miracle.

2779,eriko_berry,One of the most entertaining yet brilliantly confusing films I have seen!,9,4 November 2006,"The thing I love about Fight Club is the way it kept you entertained with wonderful... I mean brutal violence. Yet amidst all the fierce tackling and killing, it makes you think so much! The story line was brilliant and the twist quite amusing. I have to thank Brad and Edward for there wonderful acting because I hate nothing more than a great film being destroyed by tragic acting!I couldn't find a single bloop in the creepy film, except I guess for Meat Loaf's pants falling down. It contained violence. It contained Jared Leto ( with freaky BLONDE hair, but its not that that destroys his good looks). It contained humor... I loved it!",Fight Club
2780,hirak99,Has been hyped a lot over it's true worth,3,5 November 2006,"I gathered from some sources that this is one of the movies that people like. So I rented it, watched it.It begins with a man narrating his story with some witty lines, but in a very monotonous voice. The movie starts with this man having a life which follows a set routine. However, soon it turns out that this life turns into a whole journey of unconventional and out of the ordinary events, and a wild life which this man seems to like better. However, too many things happen and that gives an effect of a missing flow in the movie.The major twist that comes at the end is unbelievable. Don't get me wrong, I don't mean that it is unbelievably good. I just mean that - unbelievable. It is like after having done with the whole movie, they had to put some twist - so they put something totally bizarre. And that leaves the movie with lots of holes. It does not explain, for example how the narrator knows how to make bombs, or soap for that matter.And god only knows, why all those men were following Brad Pitt's vandalism team (I say vandalism team, but it has been referred to as a terrorism group in the movie. You judge.) Was the team imaginary too?Also I never found the reason why they would like to flash a picture of a man's penis once or twice in the middle of the movie. The fact that it doesn't serve any purpose makes it one more reason to make the movie distasteful for me.The conclusion of this movie seemed to me as a very pathetic attempt to create a twist. In my opinion, even if they had a conclusion like one of the characters was an alien from another planet, that would still have been more interesting and more realistic than this amateur 'twist'. Not sure which part of the movie is exactly so good that some people have given it a 'cult' status.If you like this, then perhaps you haven't seen A Beautiful Mind, or The Sixth Sense yet.

I don't think that this is a life-changing film, but one that makes valid points at the problems that many people experience in their lives.Visually, it is both brilliant, and very clever.  I don't think there is anything negative that can be said about this film, except that it is too complex for some people to understand it.If you can stand a more difficult film go see it.

This is one of those movies that would never fall in a top ten list, yet it is memorable in the same vein as ""The Usual Suspects.""One can fault Brad Pitt, perhaps, for a bit of overacting. And the female characters are underdeveloped. But, after all, this is touted as a ""guy's"" movie. Yet, the concept is so unique...I wish I could give it away.

2794,rouman,One Of The Best Film Ever,10,16 August 2001,Fight Club is not a film that you may like on the first watch. The more you watch it the more you like it. It has so many details and symbolism that it's impossible to catch them all on the first time. It also has little surprises on it that appear as flashes (for example in the end and the flashes of Tyler on the beginning). In my opinion it is with Snatch (also starring Brad Pitt) the Best Film Ever. Hope you watch it (more than just one time),Fight Club

2798,ricsilvestre,a wake up call,10,21 August 2001,"This is what movies are made for, make you think, make you feel alive. Edward Norton is just magic in is role. Brad Pitt does a very nice job also. Fincher claims the status of being one of the most important reference in modern motion picture. This movie is bigger than life.  ""I want you to hit me as hard as you can"".",Fight Club
2799,thefruitofchance,My all time favorite movie,10,30 November 2006,"This movie is incredible. The plot is great, the characters are memorable, and the fact that Brad Pits character doesn't even exist just throws you a curveball at the end.From the beginning, Edward Nortons character is a no body. On the way home from a business trip, he meets a guy named Tyler Durden. They have a ""fake"" fight in the back of a bar and start a club about that, fighting without purpose.Sounds like the makings of a terrible movie right? WRONG! The story line is so unique and twisted, you just have to keep watching. The fight scenes are incredible and hearing the whole story through the mind of guy with skitzofrinia is the most interesting part of the whole movie.So things are going great for Tyler and Edward Nortons character, (I can't remember his name) right. Then Tyler starts turning Fight Club into a criminal organization. He starts out with easy assignments, homework assignments he calls them. Start a fight with a complete stranger. Then things get complicated. They start to do extremely harmful things to people, city monuments, and themselves. This is about the time that Edward Nortons character figures out that he has been friends with himself the whole time.It all makes sense up until this part of the movie. When Tyler reveals that he is just imaginary and Edward Norton is insane. In blatant terms, he has a big fight with himself and ends up shooting himself (in a very gory and awesome sequence) to get rid of the insanity.Over all, after watching this movie, you will look at the world completely differently. You will find new light in unexpected places, new hatred for people around you, and sense that you can take on anyone.",Fight Club
2800,ronixis_kenni,The perfect film to relieve your stress,10,21 August 2001,"After seeing this movie, I am an official Ed Norton fan! Whoooooooo!

2801,mohamadjouzouib,Astonishing but left me empty inside,8,6 May 2021,"This movie wasn't at all what I expected it to be; it started out a bit slow but gathered traction fast as the main character's (Jack) situation deteriorated. It includes multiple themes including violence, corporate greed, consumerism, isolation, and societal breakdown. The contrasts made in the film between the Jack and his new companion (Tyler) really bring out the theme of isolation, as Jack works in an large insurance company that has a secret scheme that basically steals money from people (highlighting corporate greed & consumerism), whereas Tyler is a mysterious character that works random jobs where he has a higher degree of freedom. Jack feels isolated in a world where he can't find meaning, so he feels more alive and connected to others when he creates an underground bare-knuckle fight club with his new friend Tyler. The club eventually expands into a terrorist organization wanting to rid the city of credit card companies. What I concluded by the end of the movie was that Jack is schizophrenic and he created Tyler in his head in order to liberate himself and act on how he really feels about big corporations and governments controlling him and everyone around him. This ending was done in a truly immaculate manner, where there are small cues all throughout the film pointing out the fact of Jacks schizophrenia, but by the end it becomes obvious, so Tyler turns on Jack violently, but it is then made apparent that Jack was actually just hitting himself the whole time. This movie put all thoughts in my mind on pause for the rest of the night before I fell asleep.",Fight Club

It is also amazing how we are intrigued from the very first second, when the credits are still running, the film begins with a classic dark screen and a melodic melody, when suddenly a second later the music changes to a nervously beating melody, and the picture to moving impulses in the head of the main character.",Fight Club

2806,Esther011,Unexpected Brilliance,9,21 March 2008,"When my brother first told me to watch this film, I dismissed it as another all-action no-storyline movie. It was only once I got into film that I decided to give it a go, and I proved to myself how wrong I had been! At times the violence was hard to watch, but the great acting from Brad Pitt and Edward Norton, among others, had me hooked. The film also had a brilliant plot, which I really didn't expect, which made the film even more appealing; from the very beginning, the characters and relationships are intriguing and yet realistic.The film follows Jack, (Norton), whose totally average life means he's pushed into total boredom. That's until he meets Tyler Durden, (Pitt), a charismatic character who seems to represent to Jack everything which is appealing in one man. Soon, the two are locked in a violent fight, and find it surprisingly refreshing. And so 'Fight Club' is born - a secret organisation where people go to have friendly, yet often brutal, fights.However, it's only as the club grows to great success and Jack becomes happier in his newfound importance as joint club-founder, that he comes to realise a shocking truth that will challenge everything he thought about himself and the new life he and Tyler created.I'ts one of those films where you can watch it over and over again but it just gets better, because you can then realise the subtle hints throughout which make the film brilliant, which you can only fully appreciate once you know the ending.It's an overall excellent film, and I give it 9/10.",Fight Club

The writers, Chuck Palahnick and Jim Uhls, are brilliant. The fact that Tyler Durden really is Tyler Durden is intense. There are tiny hints that you really have to look for through out the movie. When you do find out what is really going on it is intense. Brad Pitt and Edward Norton are amazing and the talent of Helena Bonham Carter is genius. Having Norton narrate the story made the final outcome insane. The message from the plot is phenomenal and the idea of Project Mayhem is brilliant. Having everyone being equal within the group sends a strong message to the viewer. I think that everyone that doesn't like the movie really hasn't sat down and ""watched"" it. When you do watch it if you haven't already, this is a movie that you have to have an open mind about. You will also have to follow the whole thing, this isn't something that you want to watch then walk away this is a movie that you have to sit down and watch the whole thing from beginning to end, no interruptions.

Yes, there's lot of fights and blood, too much for my taste, but I take them, so as final twist, as (and only as) a metaphor. Excellent casting, superb acting, brilliant direction.

2821,retlaw_lawry,Fighting your problems all by yourself? .Call Tyler,10,9 February 2007,"I wrote this review for school and thought i would post it on IMDb to see what people think.It may contain spoilers Im not really sureFor six months he couldn't sleep. When a desperate insomniac (Edward Norton) tries everything to fight his perpetual state of sleep deprivation he meets the nihilistic renegade, Tyler Durden (Brad Pitt). Tyler solves his problems by having him fight something else late at night at their local bar. But Tyler has much bigger plans for them both and these club nights are only the beginning of a criminally anti-social sequence of events. This thought provoking thriller/black-comedy will keep you hooked up until the very last frame.Fight Club, Directed by David Fincher, based on the novel by Chuck Palahniuk, (Pronounced Paula-Nick) is set in the modern day in an average American City. The feel and overall look of Fight Club is very dark and cold as the majority of the film is set at night and mostly indoors. The Director does this to create a dark and at times, an unsettling raw atmosphere which can also be seen in Fincher's previous film, Seven (also starring Brad Pitt). The plot unravels at a constant and understandable pace which keeps you guessing until the end and even after the film has finished.Edward Norton's character is the narrator of the film as well as the central character. He comes off at first as a pathetic and lonely man who suffers from insomnia and a desk job. He then develops into a person who realizes that he is capable of a lot more. Edward Norton's performance is brilliant as he portrays the quiet and confused office worker. Brad Pitt (Tyler Durden) plays the other main character in the film. He is a rebellious nihilist who is much more complex than he seems. Brad Pitt plays Tyler very accurately by staying true to the character in the novel.Overall, Fight Club is a very dark but thought provoking film that, when first released in 1999, was seen just as an excuse to show violence and criminal activity on the big screen. Although the film is violent and at times somewhat disturbing, now that it is out on DVD, I hope more people will be able to see it and appreciate David Fincher's adaptation of Chuck Palahniuk's best selling first novel. I thoroughly enjoyed every scene of Fight Club and rate it 5 out of 5 stars.W.Lawry",Fight Club

It's also one of the funniest, most well-written, well-acted pieces of cinema I've ever had the pleasure of viewing. Ed Norton truly was snubbed by Oscar, as was the writer, director, and cinematographer. It was good to see Brad Pitt get his hands dirty with this role.

2832,tmshlz,no Exit,10,12 February 2007,"When watching a movie what sets it apart from other films? is it its style, its story, characters, moral or message?I like style, but when the rest sucks, it feels like a designer cupboard with no space to put something in, and you're left with something nice to look at but with no use... Well fight club is A DESIGNER CUPBOARD with plenty to put in.First of all the visuals are stunning and top notch all of them.Colours are balanced the editing is clever and well placed, wardrobe and settings all urban,beautifully realistic without glamorizing its emptiness or its decay. This is what ""we"" live in, everyday.Then there's the story and its messages and morals...frustration, boredom, emptiness and the feeling of being the 2nd born in history...no direction to go, but to go ahead in a society that takes all but doesn't leave but the option of being a customer, a lifestyle obsessed doing jobs we hate copping things we don't need.Break out, start a revolution, don't give a damn, and become... Tyler Durden. Smart, witty, good looking and willing to sacrifice anything for point zero. Don't hold on, let go...what makes you ain't got no use at all. Don't solve nothing...for what anyway? Learn society and learn how to trick it, learn how to live without it, give up all be free and survive on its edge. Start a fight, get punched and get to know you, go on shave your head, bomb a building, sacrifice status and lifestyle become a brain dead space monkey and find out you've been punk ed again this time by Tyler and his world view.Like Brett Easton Ellis wrote: ""No Exit"" for none of us.",Fight Club
2833,HockeyHayden28,Under rated,10,4 November 2021,"This movie should be seen by all young men. There isn't a lot of movies for men today. There's Dead Poets Society & the Sandlot (Lol) but every year it seems like a coming of age movie for women comes out (not that, that is a bad thing) the problem is that young men don't have many movies that explain our frustrations like fight club does. It shines a light on what it feels like to be a young guy in our generation, while telling a wild ride of a story. Not only is the first time u see this movie a mind blower and a twist, you get even more out of it the second time around, with things you might not have noticed the first time.

2835,stevensmith_82,Highly Recommended,10,6 December 2001,"Being a big fan of the actor-director combination of David Fincher and Brad Pitt in Seven, my expectations for Fight Club were very high and I wasn't disappointed. Add to the Fincher-Pitt combination the talents of Ed Norton and Helena Bonham Carter and you have a recipe for success.Fight Club is a tremendously dark comic thriller that keeps you guessing from the moment it starts until the very end. I must admit to being very confused after seeing it for the first time but, after the second viewing I was totally taken by this incredible piece of work. And after seeing it a few more times since the subtle plot points that aren't noticed the first few times just become clear the more and more you watch it. I'm sure there must still be little points that I haven't noticed yetTo those who haven't seen it, the title is slightly misleading in that you may believe it is just a very violent film but don't be fooled, although there are scenes of violence, the film has so much more to offer than just fighting.In short another great film from David Fincher",Fight Club

This foul piece of crap is one of the worst films I have ever seen.I get more pleasure out of deliberately bad films like "" Plan 9 from Outer Space"" "" Fight Club "" actually masquerades as something artistic. Meatloaf discarded any dignity or self-respect he might possess by accepting this pathetic role.Aside from the sick( I don't mean the current vernacular) premise and the idiotic plot, the fact that morons are out there now, beating the hell out of each other in basements, as a form of mimicry and tribute, is disgusting to me.An abomination of a movie.",Fight Club

2844,justible,"Least understood, most brilliant movie of the last 20 years",10,13 January 2002,"This movie captivated me.  It explores masculinity in a way all of society seems to have avoided, preferring rather to pretend men don't have violence and passion twisted up inside them, sometimes in horrible ways, more often in beautiful, dying ways.People have railed about the violence of the movie, and it is close, very close violence, yet only one person dies (less than in _Thelma & Louise_!). The movie is not about violence, yet makes unflinching use of it . . . in many ways, it condemns violence, but doesn't waste breath on that cliche.This movie succeeds in all the ways _In the Company of Men_ fails, yet transcends the myopic scope of that film.  We've watched Thelma and Louise break away, discussed Denise Duhamel's ""Barbie"" poetry, been startled reading _Reviving Ophelia_, lamented so many difficulties and trials that women in American society face, and yet paid no due to society's asphyxiation of male identity and worth.  Fight Club is the most honest, ground breaking movie of the last twenty years.",Fight Club
2845,edemir-3,Summary of all,10,2 June 2007,"Maybe it's me and some close friends who believe that this movie is above all. First, as my Buddie Sitki puts it, this is a men movie. Females of all ages(at least the ones I know), do not get the point at all. The ideas presented, losing all hope being freedom, slavery to consuming, how we were pumped all with the idea that we are all going to make pop stars and movie stars, were somehow in my mind and finally someone told it for me to the rest of the world. I am always troubled with the ideas like, that we are getting old and we need to do the things that we have not done before, we need to catch up with life, we must try everything we can, and we need to go on a vacation whenever it is a public holiday, we need to get a house, a car, a pension fund, after we have a house and a car and a pension fund we need to get a bigger house and a more luxurious car and a pension fund with greater pay. What is all the rush? Does every one have to sky dive? Does every one have to visit the Bahamas? Is there an end to having better of everything? Why don't we have the chance to enjoy the present status as it is, with our convenient house and car and PC and what ever?... We can not, because they need to make money. We are their paying population. Like the people stored in the ""Matrix"" for the electricity they provide. The same goes here. Everything around you has a purpose of utilizing you. At what ever level of making money you are, you still have financial troubles. I recall dreaming of making USD 5.000 a month will be fantastic in my early work life. Now I am making more than USD 5.000 a month and it is still not enough. I am 37 now. I remember the first commercial PC's. They used do come with 2 Mb of RAM, 120 Mb of Hard drive, with a 386 processor @ 200 Hz. Could you believe it? We could well use spreadsheets and word processors and do almost everything we wanted. Now ordinary cell phones have memory cards for 2 Gb. Why do we need all that memory space? Why can't we live without the cell phone itself? Do we really need to take pictures any time, do we really need to have tons of music walking with us? Why can't we simply use telephone boots to call people? We used to like a decade ago. Now I can't think of meeting with someone with him or her not having a cell phone. How can we find each other, the exact place and time? It seems impossible. How did we visit someone for the first time in any place. Now I am making like 5 calls, before finally finding the spot. Were we more clever in the past? Do we really need 12 million pixels of picture resolution? Are our eyes sophisticated enough for that? We could survive without 50 inch plasma or LCD's, which still could not deliver the picture quality of a moderate regular TV with the good old technology however cost like 10 to 20 times more. I don't want to be taken in a wrong way. I like technology and find it useful and support it. However, I think there is a fine line, where consuming becomes the major objective, beating the need. At that point I feel fooled. I went to a cell phone dealer the other day. Asked for a cell phone without a camera, no MP3 player, no blue-tooth. The guy looked at me, trying to understand if I am for real or not. Colleagues at work criticize me saying ""How could you even think about purchasing a cell phone without a camera at this time?"" It is the same in car industry as well. Why do we need Air conditioners, that could blow cold on the driver side, and hot on the passenger side? What kind of circumstances would require that kind of operation? If the passenger finds it cool, simply turn the passenger blower off. That 3 word abbreviations in the recent makes. Do they really help us to survive? There are like ten of them I heard, and none I really heard someone telling me helping them in a way, apart from anti-lock brakes. Can't we like have a car, which is an airbag itself? Once it senses the crash, it goes off and the car is totally surrounded by the airbag. This will cut the number of airbags in a car to one, from 20. The makes go bigger with each new model. The cars classified in mini segment have reached the dimensions of the middle segment of a decade ago. Writing long, I might have passed a comment on the movie, however I believe Fight Club, puts all these and much more into question. This is why I find it as the best movie ever.",Fight Club
2846,Neverbnormal4,Style,10,20 July 2013,"Its hard to find twists in movies quite as exciting as fight club, or as well done. At the time it was amazing and it still holds it own as one of the greatest due to the style it exudes , you don't need me to tell you this just go watch it. I hope no one ruined the ending for you the first time you watch it, the first time I saw it I instantly knew it was my favorite movie. Also The first time I listened to the pixies and now they are one of my favorite bands! Even watching it a second go around it is equally interesting and the characters never get old.

2848,Errix,Overrated,7,1 February 2008,"The biggest problem of this movie is that it is so overrated. For years and years I have been hearing how amazing this film is. Two times I watched it, two times fell asleep. Was too tired probably. Today I watched it again, once again expecting something great, and again fell asleep. I started watching it two hours after I woke up after a 9 hour sleep!Face it, this movie gets really boring at times. Pitt is often mumbling useless phrases, dull story (after the two get together) and there is an illogical ending.But for me the most disturbing is the whole idea of changing your life, becoming sensitive again(what??) by engaging into bloody, futile fights. Who would do that? You wanna fight, go to Darfur and fight for the starved women and children getting raped and killed every day. Trust me, you'll make your life interesting, you'll escape this ''stinking'' consumer society and on your way might just save someone's life or raise a few eyebrows. I am not from USA and not really aware of this ''horrible'' life of the American white collar worker, but if this movie has ''opened your eyes'' then my friends you really are in it deep.On the good side the movie is very stylish and the acting is first class. 7.5/10 just for these attributes. However since the movie in my eyes never lived up to the hype; ''different, disturbing, entertaining'', its a 6/10.",Fight Club
2849,maddie_biehl,"Fantastic, A must see",10,8 December 2010,"Chuck Palahniuk creates thrilling, captivating works for the mind of his readers. He is the author of 14 novels, two of which have already been made into movies and three other novels being considered or already in production to be major motion pictures. The first of Palahniuk books to move to film was Fight Club. Fight Club is a gripping page-turner unable to be put down until you realize you've read through the entirety of it in one sitting. Luckily, the movie held true to the book and might've even done a better job telling the story of Tyler Durden. The twisting thriller keeps you suspended until it blows your mind. The actors in Fight Club carry the movie fantastically; Edward Norton as the narrator, Brad Pitt as Tyler Durden, and Helena Bonham Carter as Marla Singer. Norton narrates as a character in the movie that moves in a run down house with Tyler Durden and then shares the life of Tyler Durden with the viewers. Marla Singer, the antagonist works her way into their lives, driving them crazy. To unleash their building frustration and deal with their excess testosterone, Norton and Pitt create what they call ""Fight Club"". ""The first rule of Fight Club is do not talk about Fight Club."" The subtle hints in this film foreshadow beautifully. Small special effects and the ability to physically see the raise of an eyebrow or hear the narration while watching a fight scene actually happen add up to effectively blow your mind and make you question how you didn't see anything coming. The director, David Fincher, certainly shows his skill through this film. Seeing Fight Club and another of his dark, intense movies, Seven, it's simple to day this man has a unique vision. Fight Club is a must see. 10/10!",Fight Club

2856,pennydowd,Out of the Ashes,10,20 August 2007,"Did anyone notice? I don't have this film memorized but what I saw was confirmed by clues in the writing. The main character has the perfect material home of his creation. A job that allows him to have the perfect material home of his creation. He attaches himself to the dying in order to feel. He meets the girl, who is she? a kindred spirit -- is she his spirit? Then gets in touch with his inner source. At first, it is an icy cave and a cartoonish penquin (humor). Then it is the icy cave and the girl -- his spirit. Then he meets the other character -- his rage. His rage has sex with his spirit. The spirit of his sex is rage. His rage beats the crap out of himself. Then he rejects his rage and feels kindly towards his spirit. At the end, the City blows up. It is his mind, his thinking. A song plays -- What has happened to my mind.I thought the movie was very easy to follow because of the good writing.

The perfect actor for the job. Many people say the movie is too gory, but I disagree. It has its gross parts but it is not as gory as most action films and whatnot.

The Fight Club is about a man who has everything you need to be considered successful in today's society, but somehow his subconscious realizes how empty he really feels. His subconscious creates a fictional alter ego that guides him through several scenarios that increasing lead to an anarchistic view of society. At the end of the film, the main character, Tyler Durden, played simultaneously by Ed Norton and Brad Pitt has his mind blown when he comes to grips with the fact that he has a second personality. The film itself is well made, with excellent cinematography, and realistic dialogue and scenery, The action scenes involving the Fight Club are riveting.

2860,nnqq,An Incredible Film,10,16 April 2002,"Fight Club is a brilliant and brutal look at consumerism in a modern day and age. The film features magnificent acting, a wonderful plot (with a great twist at the end,) and many other strengths, but the area in which it really impressed me was its unique, original style. It is very hard to describe the visual techniques used in the film, but if you've seen it, you know what I'm talking about. There are some truly wonderful CG scenes (you can see how they were made in the TERRIFIC DVD.) I just wish all films could feel as unique and artistic as this one does. Although violence does play a strong part in the movie, it is a very necessary aspect, and shouldn't be too discouraging (unless, of course, you're particularly squeamish.) All in all, Fight Club does a lot of things right. It addresses an intelligent moral and social issue using a very unique style, and it does all this with nearly flawless acting and wonderful directing.By the way, one of the few other movies I have enjoyed recently that has a really good, original style is Run Lola Run. If you get a chance, check it out - it's also a really good film.",Fight Club

I don't know if the director's intentions with Pitt was to show his famous muscles. This movie was not about to be the sequel of Troy! While Norton captivated the attention running with ridiculous underwear and a beaten face, Pitt appeared to be a god with a perfect body and with a not very beaten face, given the circumstances.

The plot makes no sense and the 'clever' finale is drivel. To absorb any meaning from this would require the classic media studies student who, used to not understanding and undeservedly praising most cretinous films, takes this abstract twist to be a clever comment on the state of society (or something of the sort). In term of enjoyment, fight club undoubtedly gets a 0, surely even for those supposedly engrossed in the nonsensical intricacies of it, and a small role from meat loaf heightens the sense of disappointment in conjunction with a slight feeling of nausea.

Everyhting about this movie is perfect and 100% flawless. Not only is the action in the movie bloody and violent but it is an action movie with a rich story-line and great plot development as the movie progresses. Edward Norton and Brad Pitt make a great duo for a movie that I was surprised that theses two did not do any more movies together. They also played a great performance in the movie and it is definitely Brad Pitt's greatest role. This movie leaves you on the edge of your seat as the story progresses and as the Fight Clubs turn into more of a cult and later a terrorist unit. The twist at the end is also amazing because you never really see it coming but if you watch it more than once you see clues towards it and you feel stupid that you didn't realize it earlier. This movie introduced director David Fincher to me and he is without a doubt my favorite director. I would have never known about him if it wasn't for Fight Club due to the fact that I had no idea he directed Se7en and Panic Room, two great movies as well. Seriously....see this movie.

A dramatically intelligent film put together by one of the true artists of his time.  Fincher's track record speaks for himself, with the likes of Seven, The Game, and The Panic Room.  An extensive and impressive resume, Fincher is a true filmmaking genius. Tyler Durdan and crew dazzle audiences with stellar performances to compliment a fabulous storyline and plot.

2874,fannar1,Not Brilliant,9,19 May 2008,"Okay Fight club is a very strange movie. But non the less it's very good but i just don't get it why people are always saying this is such a brilliant movie. It's very good but it's not brilliant. The conversations in this movie are very well written and the actors are terrific but Helena Bonham carter could have been a lot better. Edward Norton was very good as always. Brad Pitt proved that he can act. The fights are very cool. But i still don't get what is so brilliant about this movie? the first 45 minutes he's just talking to himself and then after that the action begins. But i really think that this movie is very overrated but it still a movie anybody needs to see before he dies, i think. It's very good but not brilliant. What more can i say about this movie... Oh yes the ending was very clever but i'm not going to tell you (who are reading this) the ending because than i would be ruining a very good movie for you (but remember it's not brilliant) but go rent this movie or buy it because it it worth it but don't think that when you are going to watch it , than don't think you're going to see a masterpiece. okay?",Fight Club

And it seems that the latter is more common than the former.  It is often described as disturbing, violent, and confusing.  Typical comments from spoon fed movie goers that would rather see Lucas destroy a legacy by Disney perportions.  Fight Club makes you think.  If you don't walk away questioning, yourself, and s**t you've accumulated to make you feel better about the state your life is in, then you're beyond convention help and need to have your ass kick.  Fight Club is disturbing.  It's one of it's stronger attributes.  Sometimes it takes something that makes us uncomfortable before we can see things for how they really are.  The words of Tyler Durdan are only now coming true; Martha Stuart, f**k Martha Stuart.  Martha Stuart is shining doorknobs on the Titanic.  Only now do we see how true that is.",Fight Club

Believe it or not i couldn't take my eyes of the monitor. when it finished,i replayed and watched it again and up today i've watched this movie 11 times and it never makes me bored. Before fight club i was familiar with David Fincher with The game and Seven and i realized that Fincher is really a director but in my opinion his fight club is something else and his best work. The movie has a great start and the actors Edward Norton and Brad Pitt were really amazing in the film. About the story i have to say we don't see a lot of good movies with a deep and interesting story like fight club but here we have one of those unique stories. The just brothers does it great for the music, it is really matched with the story and very effective in their parts like when Tyler left the wheel in the car, at that scene music gets me blown away. I think this is one of the best acts of Pitt and he was really into his role, the same as Norton. And the camera moves were totally good. This is a block buster so don't miss it.",Fight Club

2880,mrich2424,"Relevant upon release, relevant today",10,18 March 2018,"When a depressed, restless man (Edward Norton) looking for a solution to his problems meets a soap salesman named Tyler Durden (Brad Pitt), the two join up to form an underground Fight Club. Along the way, they meet and recruit other men in the same boat, all looking for an escape from their mundane lives. Together, they set out to accomplish much more than just your ""ordinary"" underground fighting ring.We initially meet the narrator as he describes his life with a less than enthusiastic attitude. He monotonously describes his apartment and contents as the things he was taught by society to want. With every purchase, he is seemingly filling a void that continues to grow with each purchase and is never able to be satisfied. After meeting Tyler Durden, the narrator begins to question whether or not he has to accept what he has been taught as fact, or whether he is willing and able make a change. After a significant event forces the narrator to vacate his IKEA catalog-filled apartment, the narrator decides to take Durden up on his offer as a way out of his excruciatingly boring life. As we follow the narrator and Durden through uninviting environments beginning with his apartment and transitioning to dilapidated houses and after-hours bar basement brawls, we see a reflection of the narrator's internal mood in each place. All of the men the narrator and Durden recruit along the way have fallen victim to becoming worker drones and feel as though their lives have no purpose, just like the main character. They are living as they have been told to live, buying what they've been told to buy, and unconsciously adapting to ideals in which they themselves do not believe. Eventually, the fight club develops its own set of laws and ideals far from those of modern society. The men feel they have purpose and as such, come up with a plan to change the world and their own lives forever.Fight Club emphasizes the modern American consumeristic culture and the feeling of feminism it forces on men. As a result, men like the narrator are forced to suppress their natural masculine tendencies in lieu of adapting to the mainstream way of living. When these feelings are repressed for a length of time, males become depressed and search for the remedy. The fighting, although a turn-off for some viewers, is a necessary component of the film as the men in the club attempt to regain some semblance of the manhood run off by our culture.The cinematic elements of this film are top-notch in creating an environment that is as grim and depressing as the thoughts inside the narrator's mind. The production staff make excellent use of lighting and camera lenses to create dimly lit rooms, camera angles that make the audience feel though they are part of the club, and sound that transfers the pain of the fight right to the viewer. In fact, in a particular scene which utilizes some forbidden materials to create bars of soap, we can almost smell the horrific aroma created in the room through the extensive audio and visual elements used. While mainstream culture dictates much of our lives even today, 20 years after production, the narrator and his club allow the viewer to decide whether the consequences are worse to follow the herd of consumerism or to make our own statement of masculinity and create a little mayhem.",Fight Club
2881,aleoconamor,Great movie about violence,9,20 December 2009,"I love when movies shows how violent are the f@cking Americans.Some can be surprise and don't admit that all that you can see in the movie happens everyday in Yankee-land.Some say its a crappy trash, well you should open your eyes a bit. Comments like this one ""A day after the experience, I am still trying to reconcile how the man who was responsible for the magnificent subtlety of ""Seven"" could create such garbage. Yes, the violence was gratuitous and excessive, but oddly enough that was the least of this films worries.Where to begin? The plot was ridiculous on it's face, absolutely incoherent and nonsensical. The various themes of the movie were amplified and remarkably shallow, showing no real insight into the problems of our society. Ours is an overly commercial culture? This is neither original nor especially interesting, especially when repeated ad nauseate.Fincher's direction and sophomoric MTV-style presentation did nothing to help a script that never got any further than ""live free or die"" (with minor variations). Most of the dialog reminded me of something my high school English teacher used to say when her students ventured out of their league: ""That's so deep it's shallow"". This succinctly describes the handling of every major theme in the film.Then there are the performances. Edward Norton, an otherwise gifted actor, does little with the simplistic character he's given. There is no complexity to this character whatsoever and Norton can do nothing to help define him. His early attempts at playing the neurotic are particularly unconvincing. Brad Pitt has more to work with in the Tyler Durden character, but his tendency to overplay absolutely everything about his character (even beyond what the script calls for, or should have called for) makes Norton's performance seem that much more vapid. Helena Bonham Carter simply showed up; throughout the movie, one had the feeling that she desperately wanted to be somewhere else. It seems hard to blame her.Had this been the work of any number of other directors I could name, it would be easy to dismiss the overheated message of this film. Fincher is capable of such subtlety and craftsmanship that it is hard to believe he could put his name to such a juvenile, simplistic film. One hopes that ""Seven"" is not the only thing of beauty we see from Mr. Fincher."", makes me want to vomit.",Fight Club

That is, until he meets the intriguing Tyler Durden (or so he thought), played by Brad Pitt, who teaches him a philosophy he never thought plausible. There begins a partnership determined on developing an aggressive way for men to vent off emotion: a fight club. Most scenes were repulsive to me, seeing as I'm a minor who, in the first place, shouldn't have seen those scenes but hey, all the roughness was worth the patience for the ending did not disappoint.

2886,vovhunden,"Action movie with an infantile, rubbish plot.",1,17 August 2002,"In short, Fight Club is a movie that attempts to give a distorted portrait of society as an evil in order to facilitate showing violence and yet more violence. But since the protagonist's disbelief in society is not substantiated, the movie has a hard time explaining the destruction plot. So, time has to be spent watching people fight. And of course, the disbelief cannot be motivated: The protagonist complaining that: ""God damn it, an entire generation pumping gas ... We have no Great War. No Great Depression."" is both romanticizing over events in Western history, that made absolutely no sense to the people living it, and at the same time mocking our grandparents and the life and society they fought for, ours.The main character continues: ""We were raised on television to believe that we'd all be millionaires, movie gods, rock stars, but we won't"".Well, learning to differentiate between yourself and ""movie gods [and] rock stars"" and learning that life is not all beer and skittles is what growing up is about today.So, Brad Pitt et al., grow up. And go read a book or something.The rubbish quote sums it up pretty good: ""I see in fight club the strongest and smartest men that have ever lived. I see all this potential, and I see it squandered. God damn it, an entire generation pumping gas or waiting tables; slaves with white collars. We're the middle children of history. No purpose or place. We have no Great War. No Great Depression. Our Great War is a spiritual war... our Great Depression is our lives. Advertising has us chasing cars and clothes, working jobs we hate, so we can buy s**t we don't need. We were raised on television to believe that we'd all be millionaires, movie gods, rock stars, but we won't. And we're slowly learning that fact. And we're very, very p***ed off. """,Fight Club
2887,davebish,Inside Jack's mind.,10,20 August 2002,"From the opening scene of a man with his gun in his mouth you realize that Fight Club is not the action film you thought it might be but rather dark and surreal. His voice echoing out like a deranged man in the midst of personal conflict and struggle. This is not a happy man rather he is one with intense problems and a unique perspective.Fincher's cinematography is breathtaking in this highly misunderstood film. From the title you imagine a film about street boxing and violence and yet this is far from the center of the film. The film is deeply disturbing but not for violence (truth be told it is not that violent a film) it is disturbing because it exposes some of those things about the human condition that'd we'd prefer to forget, as well as the consequences of violence that Hollywood normally glosses over. Most shocking is it's expose of life - of the drudgery of society and normal life.Faithful to Palahnuik's novel we're shown the failure of a society that has lost it's vision. Engulfed by the rat race that drains the life out of us and leaves us seeking to merely survive the system with cynicism rather than making our impact, finding what we long for and asking the big questions.
In one of the striking scene shopworker Raymond K.Hessel, a man who has lost his grip on his dream, gets the wake up call. Tyler Duerden forces his way inside our society like a virus to destroy it and wake us up to the mess we're in. Does Tyler have the genuine solution or merely the potential to self-destruct?We've fallen short of the standard. Our modernistic utopia has failed. We're merely chasing the wind.

And let me tell you: I was not let down at any point. This movie is far, far more than I expected. Instead of the movie being ""let's beat each other up because we have no direction"", ""Fight Club"" has a message of socio-economic change.

Just after 2000 I had watched lots and numerous movies existing in the world, but so far no single comments are available here in this IMDb. Now I am in bound to express my personal feelings about this unnecessarily overrated movie. I find nothing special in this dumb and irritating Fight Club starring Brad Pitt and Edward Norton. Why did this movie got good stars and many comments? Just because others are dancing and so they too blindly dancing with them after getting into the story of Tyler Durden?David Fincher - I think David is good at making movies based on mental sickness, human illusion and social understanding. He could have used the actors in better perspective to make the whole story clearer than it is. Fight Club - This movie was actually flopped when it released theatrically worldwide. So can we really consider it as a hit or blockbuster? No doubt, it got momentum when it later came out in DVD. I was mostly displeased with the twisting climax, which has nothing special to thrill the human mind. It is just simple to predict in some points of the story. There are some scenes which make bored and eagerly wait to move forward in the next scenes. This is not a case with good thrillers like The Bourne trilogy series, The Peacemaker, Collateral Jeepers Creepers, The Recruit, Paycheck, The Shooter, The Departed or say Impostor . For my 8 years of continuously watching different types of movies and analysing the choices of the audiences, I came to confusion why audiences really admired this movie! Well, it might have became a cult-film for creating the ideas of building 'fight club's but this movie actually has a negative and improper purposes. The twisted ending seems to be much dissatisfying in catching the truth. But in fact, the movie has no concern with the world's reality.Brad Pitt - I wonder why Brad Pitt accepted the role as an illusionary Tyler Durden who rule the narrator's way of living. Surprisingly he turned out as non-existing person who appears from schizophrenic narrator Jack (Norton). I like Pitt a lot his role in Kalifornia and Se7ven and Mr & Mrs Smith, but not here.Edward Norton - I was really impressed by his role in only 2 hits - Rounders and The Italian Job. But this time also he won my heart for his innocence and ignorant role as Jack. He did his role as demanded by the script and the director or the producers. He was a right choice for this role better than others.Helena Bonham Carter - She does not have the necessary looks to become a star or celebrity, but by chance she got good remarks for her role here. No impressions exist from her role as Marla Singer but only to look once.",Fight Club

What can be said about the film that has not been said before, positive and negative comments sufficing. Each person however interprets things differently. I see a film in a different light to you. Therefore there can be a never-ending source of praise or criticism for fight club. If you have not read the book then read it. If you have not listened to the soundtrack then listen to it. If you have not watched fight club then watch it. Mr. Palahniuck portrays a narrator in the story who has deep seeded problems to such an extent even Sigmund Freund who be baffled by him. Or not. The narrator is someone who could be you or me. ANYBODY. Perhaps that is why he remains nameless because he is a personification of all humans. Someone who works his 8-8 shifts at work. Goes home and does jack s**t. Somebody who has no meaning in life.

2901,alperefe,The Best movie I've ever seen...,10,24 November 2002,"Some people hate it, some people adore. To me, Fight Club is the best movie I've ever seen. First, the scenario is great, based on Chuck Palahniuk's great novel. The characters, (Marla) Helena Bonham Carter, (the narrator) Edward Norton & (Tyler Durden) Brad Pitt (Yes, in Tyler we trust!) have done a great job. The movie contains some anarchist conversations, those all made me think about the way we live (you may think like afterall this is only a movie, but after you watch it, you would feel the similar way I do) also amazed me, as it is very hard job to make those kind of films working with some big Hollywood Studios, and companies (Even that was mentioned in  Jim Carrey's best film, The Majestic). Other than that, the scenes, the story excluding the anarchist parts are also great, with its psychological points. Fight Club, should be David Fincher's best effort, also would sign its name on ""the best movies ever list"". If you haven't seen this fascinating movie, you are not even living...

And the last reason this film is an astounding work of cinematography is its unwavering plot and themes that are self referential, deep and difficult to explain. And have nothing to do with fighting.In closing, Fight club wont appeal to everyone, as the graphic violence and gritty nature keep it back, but anyone looking for a unique, funny film, filled with odd moments and overflowing with originality needs to watch Fight club, as it dose things I haven't seen in any films so far, and never so stylishly.",Fight Club
2903,brazidas,So many Topics,10,25 December 2003,"Once I read a critic that states this movie as ""a deep inside view in the strange universe of fascist groupuscles in America"" . No other view could be more limitated about this astonishing movie. The detail is: I live in Brazil and that critic was a brazilian one. My country is not specially known for having a deep inside about world and existencial matters, but most of the time, they follow the limited tendency of analysing what they see for some ideology, without consider different views about what they are seeing and saying.I wonder why David Fincher has not much more big hits like this and Seven. First you got some of psychological immersion, with the double personality scheme stressed to the most. Second, you got views about the system against itself: through characters with little plans about their own destiny and lifes...through the creeping details of a job, of a house in decay, of the merchandising abuse. The question before 11/09 was like: What we will do about ourselves ? Where to go ? And this movie thinks exactly about this. Third, and beyond the point just wrote : it got male groups ritualistic discussion. Tribe thing. Somewhat on that remember me the Robert Bly parties but much improved. Violence on the movie is just a vehicle to discuss more important topics, like the role of the male in a society that got no scape exit. That showed no great chances of heroism. And mainly: no answer to the male role anxiety in a world where women became more and more the ""heroins"".More than all that it's a movie that discuss philosophy by showing the example. The scene where they menace an official is pure Marx...""we feed you, clean you, take care of you..."" and Marcuse "" we got jobs we dont want to pay for things we don't need"" . This is an exciting minimalism . And all of this is said resentless. Fincher discuss the system but knows very well we'll live inside it.The final sequence has 2 main questions. The 1st one is somewhat a freudian one and disappointed me. The role of Helen Bonham Carter is like the answer, the easy answer to complex matters. It's like saying sex is the solution to all the problems discussed. It seems like the producers and big hats messing on the final result. Second, the ""revolution"" made to turn things harder and make people think got a final project somewhat ridiculous. I see this as a strong irony to political groups that like to hyperdimension their roles in life.It seems that Al-Qaeda members saw this picture and didn't understand specially this final point.",Fight Club

2905,soundgarden720,Fight Club Review,8,9 December 2008,"Fight Club (1999) directed by David Fincher and based on the book by Chuck Palanhiuk, contains no nonsense rules which Brad Pitt as Tyler Durden delivers with serious conviction, ""The first rule of Fight Club is you do not talk about Fight Club. The second rule of Fight Club is you do not talk about Fight Club."" However, you don't learn these until later in the movie. Instead, you're first greeted by Edward Norton's monotonous voice, which as the movie progresses becomes even more depressing yet funny at the same time. ""I am Jack's smirking revenge."" ""I am Jack's complete lack of surprise."" Norton's character utilizes these sayings at random times throughout the movie and makes himself appear even more deranged and dark.Norton plays a nameless insomniac who seeks solace and fulfillment in his life by attending random support groups for illnesses he does not have and by filling his apartment with useless IKEA furniture. You start to feel sorry for his characters pathetic existence until he meets new people who give his life a sort of twisted meaning. First, is Marla Singer played by Helena Bonham Carter, a fellow ""tourist"" of support groups who has some serious mental and emotional issues. Second is Tyler Durden (Pitt). Tyler is everything Norton wishes he could be, fearless and provocative. He can read Norton's character like a book and spits out ideas about anti-consumerism. These two pair up and form an underground fight club where dissatisfied men go to beat each other up in order to regain their masculinity and ultimately their freedom in life. The fights are not about winning, they serve as a device to men to prove to themselves that they can take a hit. The fight scenes can become very bloody and gruesome, making this the ultimate guy movie. The plot takes a turn after this and the original fight club transforms into something much more sinister and rebellious, thanks to Tyler's secret ""Project Mayhem"". The movie ends with a final conflict between Norton's character and Tyler. This reveals just how twisted Norton's personality had become, just before showing his revelation of change.The entire movie is shot in dim light, making some of the setting obscured. We do get a good view of Tyler's house, which is a dilapidated place where not even rats would dare venture. This reflects Tyler's scorn of material objects and his hippie-like attitude. Most of the camera angles are shot at middle range, where we can see the upper half of the actor's bodies, but during the fight scenes the camera pans around in order to view the fight better and also to catch the reactions of the other fight club members. Some exceptions are when Norton's character is lying awake at night; the camera is normally above him, so we can see his whole body and therefore his struggle with insomnia. The first shot in the movie was excellently crafted, a shot of Norton struggling to speak with a gun in his mouth, to give a glimpse of that final confrontation between Pitt and Norton's characters. Overall the director, David Fincher, does not focus so much on the setting or costumes (excluding Tyler, who wears eccentric clothes like red leather pants and fur coats) but rather on the characters actions and especially Norton's wonderfully sardonic narration that will keep you chuckling throughout this 4 star movie.",Fight Club
2906,krish0784,Hits u like storm !!!,10,2 December 2009,"I just have one thing to say for the movie --- mindblowing , no other adjective can better sum up my views.A brilliant storyline with a relevant message coupled with memorable performances from A grade stars and lo what have you got -- one of the best made movies you would ever come across.Most of us who are in the so called ""service economy"" would identify with the main character and his frustrations at rampant consumerism,boring/meaningless jobs and a world where man's fundamental instincts for aggression are all subdued.It is much a tirade as a sad commentary on the present/future of humanity in which human beings are treated and behave like cattles with the society setting the norms on what is supposed to be good or bad.The movies removes the veneer of civility and exposes what human beings really are - animals.",Fight Club
2907,mjkim-3,Absolutely Fantastic,10,28 February 2009,"I saw this film two days ago and it has to be, without a doubt, one of the greatest movies I've ever seen. The entire movie is fast-paced, with both Brad Pitt and Ed Norton playing deep, interesting characters. However, the ending completely blew my mind. After watching it a second time yesterday, I can truly admit that this is one of the few movies that is actually better the second time. The little things that were confusing the first time around made complete sense when seeing it a second time. The compilation of all of the elements and themes found throughout the entire movie make Fight Club an instant classic. In my opinion, it is one of the most underrated films on the top 250 list.",Fight Club

Dispite of being very well made, the most important thing about this movie it's his message, his theories, his contents.

2909,andersmatell,"A 1st person story about a man, who has trouble sleeping",10,10 January 2014,"This movie is by far one of the best movies of the 90's. It has everything: A fantastic story, amazing actors, a killer soundtrack and one of the most amazing twists in modern movie history. It has that special, undefinable feeling to it, which makes it a movie to remember forever. If you read the book, you will probably notice that it is a quite short book. Besides from a couple cuts and the end, the movie actually follows the book very well. It is not a book filled with loads and loads of action as much as it an view point on modern society, and how we live out our lives. Kind of a long essay. David Fincher seems to share Chuck Palahniuk view on the western civilization today. Fincher has captured the special vibe and critique in Palahniuks book and works brilliantly. Fincher has added an element of humor to the story, which it is not obvious in the book. But it works very well. The end of the book is much more dark than the end of the movie, but it does not matter. Fincher has not made typical ""Hollywood ending"", and when a director does that it is always liberating. This movie is dark, exciting, funny, unique, inspiring and fascinating. I would like to end by writing: If you liked movies like......and then namedrop a couple of movies, which resembles it, but it is impossible. This movie is UNIQUE.",Fight Club

But in case you have not yet noticed this movie was a no-brainer, 10 stars for me. I have watched it over 25 times and have not yet got board of it. Before this I have not yet seen Edward Norton and Brad Pitt in anything really good. But now I think their geniuses... There are movies that have their twists, but not usually ones these big. And not only that but there are little clues along the way that it is coming, then eventually everybody in the room gets it and it is just shocking. If you have not yet seen the movie then go out and get it right away, in fact just go ahead and buy it!

Every twist and turn goes the right way and comes at the right time. That's David Fincher for you. The pacing, the acting, the directing; it's all perfect. Everybody in the cast truly delivers their A game. The movie is smart, witty, self-aware, and doesn't take itself too seriously. From the very beginning the movie is telling you what is happening. Only when the characters themselves figure it out does the audience clue in. It is masterful story telling at its best that makes this movie viewable over and over.

2912,mcathers,How much can you know about yourself if you've never seen this film?,10,14 March 2009,"As odd as it may sound, this film will make you want to fight. It will leave you gritting your teeth, clenching your fists and wanting to experience the thrill of fighting (no matter how effeminate you consider yourself to be). Without being too sexist, i would not recommend this film for women, but for all of the men out there who have not yet watched David Fincher's masterpiece - you need to see it as soon as possible.Furthermore, beneath the fun outer layer, there are thought-provoking messages illustrating ideas of consumerism and attacking modern day society as a whole. It will alter your perspective upon life, which is something not many films possess.The acting performances also need a special mention, as i can not think of another film that rivals the acting masterclass shown by both Edward Norton and Brad Pitt. The two contrasting characters are deranged, erratic and wonderfully ludicrous all at the same time. Helena Bonham Carter isn't too bad either.You will not be disappointed.",Fight Club

It has absolutely raised the bar, and so far no other film I have seen has met that standard yet.Anyone who says this is a 'guy movie' is absolutely wrong. It is truly unique, and in my opinion an important and almost life changing film. It has definitely changed my view of the world a bit. It's a must see film, and my advice for anyone hesitant to watch is to ignore the title and cover and just dive right in. It will far surpass your expectations. It certainly surpassed mine. I would also recommend watching it more than one time. I can't even count how many times I have watched this film.",Fight Club

Everything in it just looks like poetry in motion.The direction of Mr.Fincher is at is finest (better than in Seven, as if that was possible), to a fantastic photograph, great soundtrack and finally an incredibly well written, honest, rude and brilliant script.The Acting: Edward Norton does basically two roles in one film; starts at a slow pace, he remind me of a lost and broken soul until he let's himself go by the steps of Tyler Durden, without a doubt one of his best work.Helen Boham-Carter always does a good job, very secure with no flaws and very credible.Finally, Mr.Pitt does an outstanding job as Tyler Durden, the bad ass that everyone wants to look a like. Tyler's lines are the best thing in the whole movie and the way that Pitt puts his charm into tell it and the way that he makes us fall in love for Tyler Durden no matter what he says, no matter what he does is unique. Great work!This movie is passionate, wrong, serious but most of all REAL! Hands down the best film of 1999.Fantastic work from everyone that was involved!My all time favorite 10/10",Fight Club

2916,ihatejackblack234,Relation of Tyler and the narrator the world and to man,10,25 April 2009,"Fight Club is a movie that claims that the norms and goals of Americans are not meaningful; a nihilist's life of revolution does have significance, and that everyone has some Tyler Durden in them. The narrator and main character that goes nameless throughout the movie in a way represents all of mankind. He has the typical job, is obsessed with the material and is nothing more than a thing to the world. The Narrator is someone not fulfilled with life; making is way in and out of AA and other support groups in order to maintain himself emotionally. His counterpart and associate is Tyler Durden. Tyler represents something that is greater than man, an unreal ideality that lives on behalf and threw the Narrator. Tyler is a character that inspires man to be more than just man. There is a relation between Tyler Durden and man, and the role of Tyler in the world.What Tyler Durden has is ability and power. For example, there are many fights throughout Fight Club and the fight that Tyler Loses, he actually wins. Tyler Durden stands on a plane with Jesus and Nietzsche's Overman, a crossbred between God and man. What is inspirational about Tyler is that he and the narrator are the same person. The narrator, who is a man, crosses a barrier and becomes something greater than man. Tyler is not human; he is more an idea, and a symbol of revolution. The Narrator's relation to Tyler is a role of assistance. Tyler inspires the Narrator, gives him a place to live, mentors him and together they start a revolution. The two characters are more productive together than they are separately, though they are dependent on the other. The Narrator suffers from insomnia and later the audience realizes that he suffers from a split personality disorder. Through his mental disabilities the narrator turns himself into Tyler. The narrator is able to break away from the boredom of everyday life by being Tyler Durden. The idea of a club where people fight without protection and at their own discretion, where the first two rules standout as fight club being a club of secrecy, becomes a form of therapy for men, then a way of life for society. The narrator realizes the unnecessary of materials, and then realizes that work, water and other basic needs are not needed. The narrator frees himself from the security that food, shelter and water provide. Where at one time he was consumed by the material, trying to fill his apartment with the perfect Liz Clayborn piece that would capture the perfect mood for his kitchen, the narrator realizes the meaninglessness of projects that only seem to serve a purpose of life. The blessing for the narrator comes when his apartment gets blown up and everything in it destroyed. The narrator falls to apathy, but from his apathy comes freedom. He doesn't care if his teeth fall out or if he has to wear the same clothes to work every day. His actions toward a fight club have purpose and meaning, because what the fight club eventually does is starts a revolution. Toward the end of the movie the audience as well as the narrator discovers that the narrator is Tyler Durden. Through this realization the narrator becomes aware that Tyler, though his mentor was destructive, and had to be gotten rid of. In the end who ends up prevailing? Though the narrator ends up living, he causes himself to shoot himself, in order for Tyler to perish. Furthermore, Tyler's legacy lives on, Tyler never physically existed, and if he was never physically he can be disposed of physically. The narrator attempts to get rid of Tyler in an ideal way, by physically attacking himself. Though he does disappear, again, he never existed. At the end of the film, the credit card companies are destroyed and the beginning of the end comes to a close as the chaos prepares to unfold on the earth. These actions, these doings, are because of Tyler Durden. The idea of him lives out physically through the destruction of earth. The effects of Tyler become more real than Tyler. At the same time the narrator overcomes the superman, Tyler. Showing that it is capable for man to not only surpass mankind, but at the same time to overcome himself. In conclusion, Fight Club deals with the desire of man's quest for power to be fulfilled to the point where revolution can be achieved. That man is not limited to living a repeated, boring life of meaninglessness. Tyler Durden Stands as one of the best characters to ever be on cinema. Tyler was able to achieve greatness with ease, leaving the question of why he even waited as long as he did to change the world.",Fight Club
2917,secretagentsmith,Fight club gets two thumbs up.,9,14 June 2009,"This is one of my all time top films. It was incredible and very thought-provoking, contains some of my favourite movie quotes: ""It's only after we've lost everything that we're free to do anything"".Edward Norton was fantastic and I can't believe he didn't win an Oscar.Before I saw this I thought Brad Pitt was some pretty boy with no real acting skills, but now I understand that he is a very good quality actor and a bit of a legend.Brilliant soundtrack too-which helped one of the best endings ever, with my favourite band, the pixies and their brilliant 'where is my mind?'.If you haven't seen this film... GET ON IT!!!",Fight Club
2918,karlo92,Very intelligent,10,31 January 2014,"Very intelligent movie,with smart characters. Visually it has dirty neon vibe. The plot is written in a very clever way. Cast could have not been better;from Ed Nortons' narrator to Brad Pitts' anarchist view of life. Cinematography and soundtrack are really top notch. But my biggest revelation was Helena Bonham Carter she was really off the wall character. Interesting thing is even the writer of the original book Chuck Palihnuk said the movie is better then book. For me that is the highest praise that movies and movie makers can get. This is David Finchers' best movie so far.

2920,dynamight,A great movie IF YOU UNDERSTAND IT,10,25 January 2003,"Don´t listen to people telling you this movie is bad. Since those people saying that probably didn`t understand it. EITHER YOU LOVE IT OR HATE IT it´s as simple as that. This is not your classical action-movie where you know how the film will end before the movie starts.Story: Its about a man (Edward Norton) being bored at being a slave under the system. So he starts going to meetings for people that are terminally ill just to see that someone has a worse life than him. But one day he meets Tyler (Brad Pitt) and they start a club where people can fight each other, the fighting is not for glory or something like that its just because they want to do something different, lose some aggressions etc.. the club grows big and they get hundreds (thousands) of members all over the USA. So they start giving the members missions to get back at the commercialism in the world..But its a lot more complex then that and i´m not so good at English so i cant write what i really want to say.I give it 10 out of 10.

The title make the film looks like another fight/action film, but, this film made all my assumptions worthless as its one of the BEST films ever. It gives a message that your life is worth living no matter you like it or not. The character Tyler Durden played by one of favorite Brad Pitt shows you how to make life easy. The character portrayed by Edward Norton is another example of how to make a silly looking average man into something more than that, his look and mannerisms shows he is the best for the role.

There is still much to improve in our societies for gay people and this movie does respective efforts not any good (to say the least).Most disturbingly one can observe this tendency in the female lead which is cast as a sex- and brainless rag-doll useful only for the release of sexual aggression (which she actually likes and deserves because she is ""a predator posing as a pet"" - a role model for women in general?).The final scene does not imply anything else, because in the end it is Taylor who prevails - as can be inferred by his last splice-in.",Fight Club

I have to say, i thought the plot was so origional and so different from  anything i had ever seen, and i also love the fact that the name of the movie ""Fight Club"" isn't the main focus of the whole film. I was so surprised at the ending, i did not see that one coming! The second time i watched it everything fell into place, and i enjoyed it the second time round rather than the first!It made me realise there is more to life than just people who put on acts to please people, and people who work their asses off to please people too. It made me see the whole movie world in a different way, as in things may not always be what they seem, and this applied to what goes off in the real world too.I love how in the first half an hour or so you see Tyler flash in and out of parts, and you see him in the back ground, but you wonder y?!

2925,twadd1,"A satire,with dark provocative comedy.",10,8 October 2009,"In the summer of 2000, when I had absolutely nothing to do, Helena, my neighbor knocked on my door. When I opened the door she excitedly asked me if I had seen the movie Fight Club yet. At that time I was sure that I had never heard of it, but I became interested after seeing her be so enthusiastic about it. So I went next door and watched it with her. Since then, this film has become one of my all time favorites. Tyler Durden's character is insanely likable, because he is full of enlightened information. He is obviously a sociopath making him seem terrifying, witty, funny and brilliant. He is not a one sided character as some would think from the title of the film. Tyler makes you question some, if not all, of your conservative beliefs. I've actually found myself quoting some of the things Tyler has said, years after I've seen the film. Tyler believes the world has turned into nothing more that a commercialized way of life. Some of the things he does will blow your mind and will definitely make you a little squeamish. Unlike many of us, Tyler wants to hit rock bottom, because he believes, ""It is only when you have lost everything that you are free to do anything."" His dreams are for the world to go back to a more primal state. His outlook on human life itself may be somewhat disturbing, but it makes you stop and say to yourself, ""Wow, that makes sense."" The cast of Fight Club is superb, and Brad Pitt's performance as Tyler Durden is incredible. He makes you believe that Tyler is a part of his personality. Even Brad's twisted laugh through out the film makes you believe he has a loose screw. Also, I could not help to hang on every word that Edward Norton said through his narration. His acting ability many would say is always worth seeing. In the beginning of the movie his character is an insomnia-tic zombie living the mundane corporate life. He transitions his character right up to the end when you can see that he is a changed man. Marla's character is someone that really doesn't care what anyone thinks about her. Her philosophy of life is that is she might die at any moment, and the tragedy was that she didn't. Helena Bonham Carter is a perfect fit for her part, her statements make you want to laugh, but also make you feel a little uncomfortable. Some of the scenes are ad lib-bed and Helen definitely contributed to some of the taboo aspects of the film. The time line for this film is done in a way that jumps along through different parts of the story, but is so fluent that even the most average movie watcher will know what's going on. This film also has everything a seasoned movie watcher comes to see. The imagery and the cinematography are done flawlessly, the witty irony will make you laugh out load, and the dark and grimy scenes go hand in hand with the dark comedy.. Just remember that this is a satirical work and once you get to the mouth dropping explosive surprise ending. It cohesively brings the whole film into perspective. I believe that this film should be watched more than once, simply because you will be able to see the imagination and effort behind every scene. To me I honestly think that this is one of the most incredible films I have ever seen. My opinion of this film is that it is a dark and honest poem that speaks directly to my male generation, and I urge you to give it a chance so that you may witness the genius behind it too.",Fight Club

Copies and remakes were made elsewhere, fell flat on the face, taking the tip of the iceberg and lolling around in the fight scenes. But Man, this is one helluva movie, even after 10 years nothing has diminished, message is crisp and clear.. rest of it better left unsaid.Acting is top notch, direction is even better, for some reason the DVD was released in India and withdrawn subsequently.

2927,dwarfsockstealer,In response to someone who had barely scratched the surface of the meaning of the film,9,18 November 2009,"Well, for starters (and this may not necessarily be a reason for your son's infatuation) - I love Brad Pitt. He is highly attractive and usually puts himself in good, entertaining romps. that said... It is a unique role for him. the movie is a literary adaptation too, which you may have known, and I happen to like the author's work as well. Back to Fight club itself - I am not a fan of meeting in a basement to beat up other people intent on beating me up to relieve the tension of a monotonous life. I think it explores interesting questions about what is right and wrong, good and bad, acceptable and taboo. For instance, the main character /narrator,(edward Norton), is, throughout the whole movie, schizophrenic, and actually is imagining Brad Pitt's character, ""Tyler Durden"" the entire time. He just can't accept himself fully which is clear by the way he is always fighting, physically or not, against Pitt's character's existence. I found it entertaining to watch the struggle, the success of fight club, the unexpected consequences of living this hard, man-tough, do anything and live to the max lifestyle. The idea is I guess that in a modern world, men cannot test their strength and feel fulfilled unless they've survived grueling challenges.. and participate in unchecked anarchy. Durden puts the main character through a series of grit-testing experiments to determine if he is worthy basically of being a man. I guess the real message is a little fuzzy but by the end you're rooting for Norton just because you feel for the guy, you want him to live a happy healthy life but you know he can't, he's doomed, and burdened, a true tragic hero to the end when he blows his head off (literally). This seems like a bit strong of a statement, but it was bound to happen. The vandalism the 20-odd group of violent, full grown men (""project mayhem"", durden's big master plan) starts attracting the wrong attention and he feels trapped... and really no one could release him from his alter-ego. So, he pulls the trigger, knowing finally that he's crazy, and thats the only way to get rid of chronic-insomnia-causing Tyler. Sadly it takes him the whole movie to realize he shouldn't be listening to the voice inside his head but its a real head trip when you realize whats going on as an audience. I dunno.... I don't tend to be entertained by many movies unless its wickedly hilarious (like a Mel brooks classic), involving lots of epic scenes (300 for example), really challenging subject matter (my sister's keeper) or some absolutely mind bending stuff ( fear and loathing in las Vegas, the labyrinth, no country for old men). I also enjoy all other Quentin Tarantino movies --- sickly satisfying, since some people in this country have a weird appetite for brutal take-no-prisoner modern kung fu epics.Like me. Not like i'd like to shave someone's scalp off with a sword myself but in a movie, anything goes really, and the bigger the better, because if Im going to pay 10 bucks for a movie ticket or 20 bucks for a DVD it better be like nothing i've ever seen before. I think Fight club achieved that.I probably rambled on about it but I tried not to just blindly defend the subject matter... its not a family movie but its good. :)",Fight Club

We've all been raised on television to believe that one day we'd all be millionaires, and movie gods, and rock stars. But we won't. And we're slowly learning that fact. And we're very, very.........."" David Fincher has created a masterpiece based on Chuck Palahniuk's novel.This movie photographs our entire generation,analyzing the dead- ends of our society.The narrator(Edward Norton) has become a person who basically has everything,but nothing.Subconsciously,he tries to find an alternative way to go on with his life but this is not possible cause he has already a wrong perspective.Therefore,he invents Tyler's character as a defensive mechanism.Nobody can realize that they are the same person,until the story shows who Tyler really is and the plot follows a different direction.A great thing about this movie is that Fincher keeps a neutral perspective as the movie ends concerning what is right or wrong.Bombing large buildings is a solution to our society's economic problems?Inventing an alter-ego character is a solution for everybody's personal issues?Creating a fight club is really a way to solve your daily problems?It's up to everyone to make his/her own conclusions at the end of the movie.The director does not preach,he just presents both sides of the same coin. I have read that Brad Pitt has become the only choice for Tyler.I totally agree.This movie would be different with another actor playing this character.It's a brilliant performance.I also think that it wouldn't be among the 10 best movies,if the director was a different one.David Fincher has this ability to deeply analyze a situation and all movie characters.All scenes have his own perspective and the plot never reveals the double character.Norton also gives a unique performance and becomes completely his character which is quite difficult considering that he grows a psychotic behavior. In general,fight club is definitely one of the best movies ever made.It demands more than one viewing in order to be understood completely,but after that it creates lot of discussion.A real masterpiece.",Fight Club

2932,mrforever,Very unique.,10,19 January 2010,"Now, believe me when I say, Fight Club is hands down one of the most complex, thematically-rich films of the 90s. It's this decade's most profound piece of movie making as well as being one of this decade's most original. Unfortunately, due to its uniqueness, an audience will be hard to pinpoint. The same target audience that it speaks to also might not understand its deep-seated themes. Fight Club is one of those rare films that has so much to say that one viewing will not be able to absorb all of it. The acting is superb and enviable. All of the characters in the movie have something to say that adds to the development of the story. The camera work and graphics are outstanding. The effects are useful at grabbing the viewer's attention. As I said earlier, this movie is truly unique. It's not a corny underdog story about some man fighting to get a girl or prove a point. But it is the uprising of one particular class of underlying men who feel they are ""the middle child of god"". Fight club relies on it's wit, shock value and dialogue to create a controversial atmosphere that holds the viewer's attention. There are so many underlying morals and messages in this story, it's almost impossible to pin point all of them. I truly recommend watching this film, I give it a 9/10.",Fight Club

2935,KennyKillek,Fight Club is an amazing movie.,9,20 January 2011,"I just got done watching Fight Club, and I have to say it is one of the most content-packed films ever made. By saying that I mean you have an exploitative, fun, mindless action movie shell that everyone enjoys, but at the same time there are so many underlying themes that literally EVERYONE can come up with a completely different interpretation. But like I said at the same time the movie is so much fun, poking fun at itself with lines like ""We can't all be movie stars"" spoken by Brad Pitt, a movie star, and of course, the dude's junk spliced in at the end is just beautifully hilarious. Overall, fantastic movie that I recommend to anyone and everyone that can stomach some rather harsh violence",Fight Club
2936,cspsnsdd,Awesome,9,11 April 2003,This movie was by far the best movie in years. It pulls you into this strange world and holds you by the balls and then turns it upside down. Brad Pitt's performance is amazing and deserves a definite oscar nod. This may be my favorite movie only behind Requiem for a Dream and American History X which stars Edward Norton who was great in this movie. A fresh idea and ingenious script mixed with two riveting performances make one hell of a film.,Fight Club

2938,maisnon13,Even better than the excellent book.,10,21 March 2003,"Fight Club as a movie is a masterpiece. Wonderfully played : Brad Pitt is perfect in that he plays an archetype, and that's exactly what he represents, Edward Norton is, well is one the most competent actors alive, you won't realize he plays and his play won't attract your attention and that's exactly what his character is supposed to be. Inspired by an excellent book from one of the most promising American author (Chuck Palahniuk), the film achieves what is almost never achieved in books adaptation : it respects its spirit, its complexity, and even makes extensive use of the books strongest sentences. I loved the book, but I find the film even stronger. Note that the film has a different ending -more delighting, but less inspiring than the one from the book (which is definitely worth reading to).But there is much more to it : it is not only a masterpiece, it is an experience, an opportunity to challenge your self, your life, and your world. Do yourself a favor : watch it -and put your mind to it.",Fight Club
2939,blisterswitch,Fight Club is disturbing. . . in a good way.,10,26 March 2003,"When I saw Fight Club for the first time it didn't really hit me; the significance wasn't immediately apparent to me, but upon viewing it several times, I began to appreciate its relevance and humor.  I purchased the two-disc DVD version and watched all of the commentaries and was amazed at all of the things I had missed the first five or six times I saw it. I know without a doubt that I am a part of the intended audience and will never view my life, or my reality for that matter, in the same way.  I feel I am one of the generation that Tyler is trying to reach and even though misguided and extreme I agree with the character's philosophy.  I began to question my motivation in life and the measure of success in it. This movie may be labeled as one with gratuitous violence, but it is a comedy; and if you don't get it then you don't get it, but if you open your eyes you will see its evidence all around you.  And if you allow it, it will improve your life.  It is just a great film that works on several levels; Fincher's vision of Palahniuk's novel is a perfect match.",Fight Club

The subject matter and ideas are soo beautifully and painfully accurate to a generation who thinks that nobody else understands.It's one of those movies that articulates the things that everyone feels but have never talked about. It opens doors to new possibilites in life, by identifying and bringing about awareness to the roots of our desires and hence our misery.Never has there been such an amalgam of technical, aesthetic brilliance, direction, performance and subject matter.

You know who I'm talking about, the ones that are stuck in dead-end jobs, stuck with a commanding wife that treats 'em like dirt and want something better, and the ones that are alone with no one in sight to comfort them.The material things do not help 'em feel better and that's why the narrator feels like he does...until he meets Tyler DurdenThe fights in fight club only help release all the male rage inside. which would help most of us.If there are chick flicks, well now you can say there is a dude flick.(I know all these comments have been posted before, but this is MY first post)",Fight Club

The writing, the score, the acting, the directing, the cinematography, even the lighting is done just right. All these elements working in concert make this movie easily one of the best movies ever made. Brad Pitt and Edward Norton together make for an outstanding performance. This is a movie that you can watch over and over. I catch something new each time I view it. It also leaves you feeling that everything is resolved, yet still wanting to see more. Brad Pitt's performance is another one for the books. Like in Snatch, Kalifornia, and 12 Monkeys, he has gone beyond the normal standard of good acting to bring one of the best performances of his lifetime. This movie is a real treat.

2950,ashleywain,Fight club..... maybe the best film of the century,10,12 September 2012,"Fight club is a film that portrays the perfect image of 21st century men. The tale is long and twists several times before jumping to the perfect conclusion. I believe fight club is a near perfect film with two of the finest actors to live, Brad Pitt(Tyler durden) and Edward Norton (narator). These both play an in depth part and keep the film alive throughout; with the help of David Fincher. The film is set on a dark toned down genre making the film feel perfect and set on an accurate mood. If your looking for a film that will keep you entertained and an depthy twisting plot then this is for you! So my advice is to sit back and enjoy the finest display of film you will ever see!",Fight Club
2951,Kaiysen,Positive,10,5 May 2003,"I view the movie Fight Club in the same way I do the book, I felt as I a had witnessed something revolutionary.  With some exceptions, movies in the past two decades have had a somewhat formulaic design.  Although I find it difficult to explain what this design is, it's easy to tell movies that deviate from this by the general feeling they leave after viewing them. For example, most people after watching Pulp Fiction or Memento probably feel somewhat disoriented and confused, but in a good way.  These films are examples of deviation from the norm in a chronological manner.  Fight Club deviates by making us question not only perceived reality, but the ideas and norms that society values(very similar to American Psycho).  Are we too materialistic?  Are we a generation of disillusioned men looking for a right of passage? Movies which questioned reality and challenged the viewer to see things in a varied prospective were much more common in the seventies, such as Apocalypse Now and even Harold and Maude.  I want the movie to make me feel uncomfortable and question the way I view things.  More movies should be like this.",Fight Club

Well that is a very good question answered by Tyler and listened by Jack for us. Before answering this question, Tyler wants ensure that people listening him are individuals and not the machine parts of a big system called the corporate.He fights (and organizes fights) to remind them their original individuality. Tyler's answer is : you want something because you are conditioned to want it.you are a consumer.the thin line between need and desire has been blurred by the spectacles of modern living.he wants the modern living structure to be destroyed (credit card companies), and take it to the post-apocalyptic world. However i do not endorse this change,but realizing that you are bound and it is the source of all your misery is the first step to freedom and that is most important.By the way great acting,mind blowing cast,excellent direction and obviously outstanding content.",Fight Club

Unfortunately, it was released with the debut of Matrix,The. It was a very very big mistake for a producer to release a movie at that time. If it hadn't come to the market at that time, it would have been more successful. From beginning to end the characters, roles, story etc. all the things are in balance in this movie. I have watched it several times (i don't remember probably 50-55) and if somebody comes to me and says let's watch this movie, i can watch it one more time.

2955,DSco,The emasculating social commentary,9,1 January 2015,"It is seen through many Academic readings, that this film is a fest of emasculation, the fight of regaining masculinity and the abundance of consumerist ideologies. The way in which Fincher tackles these issues, are in the visually ferocious fighting or the 'fight' to escape the feminist culture, that is pressing their masculinity to the ground. Furthermore, it is the way the main character is portrayed, as a man with feminine values, emasculated to the point that; he indulges in buying the petty things from Ikea just for social acceptability, or for 'fun'. It is evident that this film tackles these issues and, it is of great interest to explore them, arriving at new interpretations of the film's social stance and what its commenting on, are actually issues of the contemporary capitalist culture. I would additionally state that this film is exactly what it says it is, a fight club, it sets out to fight social issues through clever construction. It is certainly worth the watch, and then possibly to read about. It is one of David Fincher's best works to date even if it has been tarnished with the Cult film status. It is visually compelling, and with plenty to take away from you won't have wasted your time.",Fight Club

Colors, editing and overall style are just beyond. Of course the twist of the plot is also amazing and it is one of the most shocking experiences you can get from modern cinema. Also the cast couldn't have been better. The chemistry of the roles in this movie is astonishing. Apart from all this the soundtrack by chemical brothers is of course rated high.

2957,ZdravkoPetrow,Fight Club,9,30 August 2013,"I know, I know. The first rule of fight club is we don't talk about fight club. But I'm going to break it anyway, because I really, really liked the book, and I just read it for the first time.I watched the film adaptation of Fight Club several years ago, and there was a very strong motivation for doing so in the first place. I think we can guess what that might have been.Brad Pitt was a majestic beast, Edward Norton brilliant, and Helena Bonham Carter spectacular, but for some reason, I neglected the original book. But, since I'm on a great quest for American authors (especially men), it seemed to make sense to include Chuck Palahniuk. And I'm glad I read Fight Club.In short: the narrator is living a rather dull existence, and he can't sleep. He goes to several terminal illness support groups to feel something (and ultimately to find the nothingness he hopes death can bring him). But he meets a woman named Marla Singer, as well as Tyler Durden, a mysteriously compelling figure who starts a fight club with him, as well as a soap-making industry that turns its eye to more anarchistic endeavors.It would be oversimplifying the novel to say that it's about anarchy. Rather, I saw Palahniuk examining our relationship to authority, and the male perception of masculinity, masculine hierarchies, and gender, using violence as a rather extreme means to Seuss out how men feel about themselves and each other. I think for that reason, especially considering its publication in the 90s, Fight Club is a must-read for anyone interested in contemporary American fiction, masculinity and fiction, or responses to violence in literature. This is my academic perspective.My reader's response was sheer enjoyment. Yeah, it's not a super polished text. But I'm okay with that. It's entertaining and at the same time a little uncomfortable. And I think that's great. If you liked the movie, you should definitely try out the book. Or if you've been avoiding the book because you think it's immature or over-hyped, I'd really urge you to give it a chance.",Fight Club
2958,ikoiko27,"Great movie, well worth the time.",10,16 December 2010,"When I watched Fight Club it was totally on whim, after hearing all the hype about this I decided to give it a shot and I was not disappointed. The film is primarily about emasculation, how we have come to live in a world of shopping, with there being nothing left to hunt, and the dull lives we lead because of it, ""slaves to the IKEA nesting instinct"".The film is a dark, stylish thriller and, despite the movie's film noir facade it gives off the feel that you're not watching your garden-variety detective movie. There's a deep sense of foreboding that's never completely realized until the last forty minutes of the film and after it you're left with the near-uncontrollable desire to watch it again.To sum it all up, the movie is impressive and will undoubtedly leave you with something, whatever it might, after it's all over. The acting is great and it is ,without a doubt, one of the most unforgettable films I've ever watched.",Fight Club

When I first watched the movie on cable TV, I was young and although my shortage of age and experience, I benefited a lot from the story-line. I was inspired even more in my ambition to become an author and thus worked harder in my efforts. The nature and setting of it is one of a kind, despite my long period of watching movies, i haven't come across one with so much thrill and zeal.

Perfect movie to distinguish between actors, real-life, and combining them both into this action-packed film.""Badass"". Yup that's word that comes to mind when I think of this movie. Brad Pitt emulsified the rendition of pretty-boy meets tough. Not only did he depict himself in a whole new light, but he enlightened my opinions on Edward Norton. Edward Norton's American History X and Fight Club have become the core film's that have gained my utmost respect for his work.When I met Pitt, he wasn't any different. He brings the family man he is to the table, that dedication and loyalty to set, and most of all; trust and 110% effort to his career and colleagues.",Fight Club
2963,sdcgraterol,My Favorite Movie,10,23 April 2011,"Fight Club is like no other movie out there. The brilliance of everything in this movie is just amazing. Brad Pitt, Helena Bonham Carter and Edward Norton give outstanding performances. But what makes this movie so perfect is the idea and plot. To start off id like to say that i think this is Brad Pitt's best performance to date. He becomes the character in such a deep level that it makes him more believable that even in ""twelve Monkeys"". This Movie focuses on how we, consumers, live our lives in this corrupt world. The narrator(Norton) is troubled by his insomnia and finds a way to deal with it by lying to get into support groups and being around other people that suffer as he thinks he is suffering. After it is ruined by Marla Singer (Bonham Carter) he mets Tyler Durden (Pitt) and creates ""Fight Club"", which makes his life the best its ever been. The various messages the movie gives you are so well thought of and shocking that it makes this movie a must-see for everyone who doesn't mind some more than mild violence. Finally, the ending. The ending for Fight club is probably the best movie ending ever. It blows away any movie ending you have ever seen. This movie should've won Best Picture for 1999. Trust me, everyone should watch this extraordinary movie. It just goes above and beyond any expectations you can give it.Also: ""Where is my mind"" is best song choice possible for the movie",Fight Club
2964,jeremy31091,A Knockout Satire,9,26 April 2011,"Fight Club: A Knockout SatireThe first rule of Fight Club is ""You do not talk about Fight Club"". For a film that depicts its characters breaking all the rules, we will ignore this statute and delve into a world where punching someone in the face is considered a favor and nothing is as it seems. Released in 1999 by director by David Fincher, Fight Club is a film adaptation by the novel of the same name, written by Chuck Palahniuk. Having read this novel, it is not very often I get to say, the movie is much better than the book, due primarily to the superb acting and interesting cinematic techniques, which completely, yet pleasantly, surprised me. With a heavyweight class including Edward Norton (American History X, 25th Hour), Brad Pitt (Se7en, Inglorious Basterds) and Helena Bonham Carter (The King's Speech, Big Fish), Fight Club is sure to deliver a lethal unexpected right hook sure to knock you on your ass.The film focuses on two men, an uptight insomniac yuppie (Norton) trying to hit rock bottom in life and a carefree soap salesman named Tyler Durden (Pitt), who attempts to make Norton's character reevaluate his values and priorities. Through a new form a therapy that includes viscously brawling with strangers, the values of our society are addressed. Eventually this testosterone-fueled violent therapy evolves into something truly sinister yet celebrated amongst this underground men's club. This whole plot is tied together by the relationship between the two main characters, their opposing views on a unique woman in their life, Marla (Bonham Carter), and the disintegration of a once-promising life.If you think that this movie is simply another senseless violent movie like Fighting or any other teen angst movie where the main star has to fight a bully for a better life, I urge you to think again. Unique cinematographic techniques and at times a nonlinear story line, part of the original Palahniuk novel, it leaves the viewer somewhat disoriented and detached from reality, which ties in perfectly with the feelings of the characters. Addressing the state of the United States, and most industrialized nations, in its consumerist state, far past the necessary components of life, the film makes the viewer ask themselves what they truly need in life instead of ""What sort of dining set defines me as a person?"" The film satirizes the world of consumers and culminates with a big bang, fittingly set to the song ""Where is My Mind"" by the Pixies, sure to leave viewers awestruck. This idea of consumerism taking over is something that most, if not all, of us can relate to.I would not recommend this movie to anyone with self-esteem issues, which repeatedly informs the Fight Club participants, as well as the viewer that ""they are not a special unique snowflake"". That, paired with images of Brad Pitt fighting shirtless is enough to make any self-respecting person's positive self-regard waver. Also if anyone is a fan of Martha Stewart steer clear because let's just say Tyler Durden does not think too highly of her, and lets the viewer know this in a scene with some very colorful language. The film is rated R, because of scenes like this, for disturbing and graphic depiction of violent anti-social behavior, sexuality and language. There is possibly no better way to summarize the film more quickly than the rating of ""violent anti social behavior."" The film is filled with ultra-violent realistic fight scenes; though they are very bloody at times, they serve a purpose and propel the story forward, instead of other films in similar categories where the idea of the film is simply violence for violence's sake. This film is something much more than that.For those who have never been in a fight, those who do not want to die without any scars or anyone who has recently developed insomnia based upon an unfulfilled lifestyle dedicated to collecting various consumer goods, I truly recommend this film. A fast paced film that hits you and hits you nonstop and does not quit until the end when you are forced to tap out, question your beliefs and values and, experience premature enlightenment, Fight Club is a truly remarkable and unique film. The film can change your entire idea about the life you lead. It makes you question yourself and more specifically who, if given the option, you would fight. Gandhi, Lincoln, William Shatner; in the world of Fight Club everyone is a potential opponent and nothing is out of bounds, so long as there are no shoes and no shirts.",Fight Club
2965,kanthj,awesome movie,10,30 April 2011,"It is a movie with excellent screenplay and story. I love the way Bradpit as Tyler Durden and Edward Norton, the narrator of the movie acting together. Its mind blowing movie when you see it alone. David Fincher who is one of the finest director in Hollywood done no mistake on this film.This film is about forming a club by Tyler Durden called fight club to fight each other. Almost all folks can relate to the main character, and he feels to be a real human, not a character in a story. This, is partially due to the excellent directing by David Fincher.Please do see this film. It is no miss film ever made in Hollywood.I honestly loved this film, the story is awesome, and the execution from novel to motion picture is brilliant by director.",Fight Club
2966,mohsenhangover,Impeccable Movie from the last year of 20th century,10,16 September 2015,"Strong points of FIGHT CLUB:First of all the screenplay of FC is so unpredictable and it has a lots of details.After that great directing of my favorite director David Fincher that make this film Mayhem.Edward Norton is undeniable beside Brad Pitt, and filming of this masterpiece is so perfect ....I suggest this film to my friends those who want to see a movie with so many lessons and brain blowing things.this features make this movie my 1st EVER.at the End:THIS MOVIE IS MY KIND OF MOVIES.",Fight Club
2967,jaredman277,I thought that this movie was awesome!,10,9 August 2003,Wow! That movie was incredible. I really like Edward Norton so that made it even better for me. I was very surprised at Brad Pitt's performance. I thought he did very well. The plot very good too. The way the movie played out from the beginning to the end was done very well I thought. The ending was awesome! I don't think that the writers could have done a better job. I give it a 10!,Fight Club
2968,rezes_2010,Wow,4,19 May 2011,"There are three main characters in this film. Brad Pitt plays Tyler Durden, who is Edward Norton's imaginary being. Edward Norton plays the narrator and has no real name due to he is really Tyler but doesn't really think so. Helena Bonham Carter plays Marla Singer. She meets Norton's character at addiction meetings and help groups. She is sleeping with Brad Pitt's character of Tyler Durden, but in the end, we find out she has really been sleeping with Norton's character. The only character's name that could give something away would be Edward Norton's character due to him not even having a name; they just call him the narrator. Brat Pitt's character always looks nice after a fight, like it didn't even happen, and that is how most girls imagine an attractive man to look like. Edward Norton's character always looks tired, run-down, and like he doesn't care about anything. Carter's character Marla looks crazy. Her hair is always messed up, as well as her make-up.The setting is mysterious and dark. It takes place in a city, but the viewers are never given a specific city, which lets them know that a fight club could be started anywhere. The mood of the film was depressing and gives off the feeling that no one cares about anything you do, and everyone's lives suck. I feel the setting and mood make Norton's character show his true colors. There are a lot of crime looking areas and run down places in the film and it could be foreshadowing how Norton's character is feeling inside. The point-of-view is the narrator, Edward Norton. Imagery I took from the film was the way Brad Pitt and Edward Norton looked. Pitt's character always was in great shape while Norton's character always looked worn out. Pitt's character is the typical standard for women of what a man should look like, and Norton's character is the typical crazy looking person people imagine. The camera angles in the film show you who is talking and, in a way, from whose point-of-view we are in at the time. In a few scenes, Norton's character breaks the fourth wall when he looks directly into the camera and talks to the audience. The music is music directors put in to add suspense and to let the viewer know when something big or important is going to happen. The movie ""Fight Club"" was an interesting and confusing movie. There were many twists in the plot that kept me watching and trying to figure out what was going to happen next. This movie gives viewers an insight into what it's like to have a mental health problem like Edward Norton's character has in the film. Overall it was a good film because it kept you watching and intrigued by everything that was going on.",Fight Club
2969,brtlacrosse,Fight Club is a story about a man who is trapped in his own life who escapes through his creation of a fighting club for men,10,19 May 2011,"In the beginning, Norton's character displays himself as being a very meek and pitiful character but he creates Tyler to show who he wants to be. The story takes place in a large metropolitan city in the 1990's. Norton's character shows the plight of the increasing number of desk jobs that people were getting throughout the 90's. This setting motivates Norton's character to step outside the norms he is trapped in. Fight Club is told from the first person view; that person being Norton's character. He narrates his personal thoughts throughout the entire story. An image that stands out in the film is soap. Selling soap is how Tyler makes his money but it is also the beginning to a recipe for the dynamite used in their out-of-control fight club plans. In terms of camera angles, Norton's character is shown as a lesser individual when the camera looks down on him from a higher point of view and Tyler Durden is looked up to. These camera angles put Tyler on a pedestal above Norton's character. However, later in the movie the camera angles even out and both Tyler and the narrator are viewed as the same. The music in the movie is used to get the audience excited during certain scenes but there is no music to bring the audiences mood down. The movie is always on the up and up until the very end. Overall, this film is very exciting and will keep your adrenaline pumping for the entire two and a half hours.",Fight Club
2970,albb92,When a young man of the city who is trapped in his own boring life,9,19 May 2011,"Edward Norton's character is the main character of the film. He speaks throughout the movie through 1st person point of view and is Tyler Durden's sidekick. At first he is a well-dressed, tired, and hardworking man who is quiet. He transforms into a ""manly"" man when he meets Tyler and becomes contented with life. Tyler Durden is the other main character who technically forms fight club and leads the narrator to become what he always wanted to be. He is rough and tough. He smokes habitually and is harsh. He is portrayed this way to be more of a man than the narrator. He will fight anyone, and never takes no for an answer. The other main character is Marla. She is a cigarette addicted, suicidal woman, who also attends the support group meetings for amusement. She is dark and dirty, which contributes to her psycho personality and messed up life. The stuck in life woman has a love affair with Tyler and continues a tense and awkward relationship with the Narrator. Most incidences in this film occur in the basement of a bar, a giant decrepit house, or strings of other bars across the country. The basement of the main bar in which Fight Club is practiced is no finished basement. It has concrete floors and walls, and rickety columns. It was dirty and dark; perfect for fighting bloody fights. The big and crumbling house is the two main characters' home. It becomes the base of Fight Club turned Project Mayhem and gives the same effect as the basement of the bar. Something that really sticks a picture in your mind would be when narrator relays how Tyler believed that making soap with fat from the plastic surgery clinic was a great way to serve American Women, ""their fat asses back to them."" It was satisfying to see the look of women's faces if they ever found out that they were rubbing their own fat back on to themselves. It was a hilarious way to get the audience into the mind of Tyler Durden; a truly sharp and entertaining character. The camera jumps around constantly. It helps the film with the action and the confusion that the characters experience throughout the movie and was therefore a good choice on the producer's part. The music is a mix of rock, metal, and dark techno. It adds to the overall confusing and dark theme of the film along with the camera angles. If you are looking for a great movie that will make you sit down and think about a crazy man's words or if you are just looking for something action packed, Fight Club is for you. It is a superb film that will have you thinking long after viewing.",Fight Club
2971,BrentwoodLegacy,"Brilliant, one of the best movies ever.",10,22 August 2003,"I remember back in 1999, I saw a commercial for this movie on TV. Like many others, I blindly watched the commercial and somehow assumed that it was some stupid action flick that somehow got popular actors in it. "" Fight Club? What kind of stupid movie title is that?? Why would you want to hurt yourself like that"". While it did only okay in the box office, eventually it became a cult classic. I saw part of it on a Movie Channel a few years after it was released, and really liked it but I hadn't seen the whole thing. A message board I went to ranked it as the best movie of all time. I had seen it on many top 100 movies list and I hadn't realized until then how loved it was. So then I saw it again, and I was blown away.  This is now my favorite movie ever.The movie mixes genres....it's like a crazy mix of a Drama, Black Comedy, and a Thriller. And that's one of the many reasons why it's so great. The beginning of the movie shows the Unnamed Narrator ( Edward Norton) struggling through life. He is wealthy, but seems to think his life has no puprose. He works in the day, goes home, and spends all of his money on possessions and expensive things that he does not need. He is a slave. He is also cursed with insomina. Eventually, he finds freedom and hope by going to support group meetings for people with diseases. This helps him sleep and makes him go on with life like a normal person. Until Marla Singer ( Helena Bonham Carter) starts attending support group meetings, and like the Narrator, she is a faker. With another faker, the Narrator can't cry at the meetings to be happy or sleep at night. So they agree to split up there meetings. One day, he meets an odd but flamboyant fellow named Tyler Durden ( Brad Pitt) on an airplane. Tyler is everything he isn't, but in many ways is everything that he wants to be. The Narrator's condo blows up, and has no where to go, until Tyler lets him live at his delapitated house where he makes soap ( He is a soap salesmen and other jobs include a projector who splices porn into children movies and a waiter at a hotel). On one night, Tyler asks the Narrator to him..."" as hard as you can"". The Narrator finds this dumb, but they enjoy themselves and find out that fighting is the cure from society and coporate consumurism. They eventually start "" Fight Club"" together..and meet in basements of bars to free themselves.
Things are perfect for a while, until Tyler loses control and what was once a Fight Club turns into what could be compared to a terrorist organization , and it's up to the Narrator to stop it all...you will find this out when the shocking twist is revealed, as it changes the movie forever and turns it into one of the most re watchable movies ever. The second time you watch it, hidden messages and subtle references are made vivid to the viewer , and therefore, to me it's one of the best movies ever. It's brutal , funny, and touching at the same time. Fight Club is also one of the most quotable movies ever.."" Things you own...end up owning you"""" This is your life..and it's ending one minute at a time"""" Put a gun to my head and paint the walls with my brains"""" On a long enough time scale, the survival rate for everyone drops to zero"""" Without pain, without sacrafice, we'd have nothing"""" You are the all singing, all dancing crap of the world"""" It's only after we've lost everything that we're free to do anything""",Fight Club
2972,arbaz00,Top 5 movies of all time.,10,11 June 2015,"Even if you ignore the movie's awesome twist ending, some best performance ever on cinema, gritting background music and the most unique screenplay; you will still have the most witty and intelligent narration ever, one of the greatest character (Tyler Durden) and a whole new way of perception towards thing. For those who have read the novels, I can say this one of those brilliant adaptations which are made into a better movie than novel. The thing which irritates me is this movie is always remembered for its absolutely mind blowing ending, but though the ending was fantastic, the character Tyler Durden and his ideology was even more spectacular. Combine that with the most intelligent narration and brilliant star-cast, you have recipe for making the greatest movie of all time. AWESOME !",Fight Club
2973,paulymaybury,Dead,9,20 October 2016,"Hands down best psycho thriller EVER! From the start, the film is a skittering, self-aware explosion of sight and sound, buoyed along by music from the Dust Brothers and the pleasantly resigned voice-over narration of Edward Norton. Norton's character is simply known as the narrator, but he remains unnamed as the film gets under way. Refusing to name him works on a structural level as well as philosophical one, withholding the twist about his identity until the final act while also allowing him to serve as the ultimate blank slate for the modern male consumer. Both functions are vital to the film's success, since it has to - - and does -- work both as an intelligent, darkly comic drama and as an essay on the culture of its time. The narrator works as an claims adjuster for an automotive company, mindlessly flying around the country to examine crash sites and determine the cost-benefit ratio of recalling badly manufactured cars. This is the world of Fight Club: Society is killing us, but we're still not sure we want to give it up. The narrator's fractured, white-noise existence is wonderfully captured by Jim Uhls' screenplay and Fincher's rapid transitions and cuts and the compelling use of CG effects and digitally overlaid text (most notably as the narrator strides through his apartment, the dollar values for his living room set appearing as he passes). Plagued by insomnia, he winds up crashing support meetings for men with testicular cancer, riveted by their desperation and drawn into their world of struggle beyond repair. Crying into the massive chest of Bob (Meat Loaf), whose pecs had swollen to ""bitch tits"" from hormone therapy, the narrator finally discovers the peace that comes with running out of options. ""This was freedom. Losing all hope was freedom,"" he says.",Fight Club
2974,misskassidee,What is Fight Club?,8,12 January 2015,"Personally, I rate this move a 7.5, but I'll round it up, since that is not an option. What is Fight Club? Maybe a dark comedy. I think that's fitting. But, it's also a drama when we see how (in some parts) it truthfully presents a type of modern living. This movie brings up the issue of substance: are the things that make up many of our lives--our work, our possessions, even our relationships--substantial. It comments on these areas through the main character, who is emotionally numb, yet keenly critical. This movie is stylish, in the way that it's shot; however, it does not distract from the film. It's thought-provoking and perplexing. The subjects Fight Club brings up can be appreciated by all.",Fight Club
2975,igotthemunchies,Spectaular. Simply Spectaular,10,11 January 2012,"Fight Club is by far the best movie I've ever seen. Plot is well done, characters are executed perfectly and keeps you guessing till the end. Its full of twists and memorable quotes, as well as a completely different way to look at life. I have recommended it to all my friends and they too have enjoyed it very much. Edward Norton does an excellent performance as The Narrator as well as Brad Pitt in his role of Tyler Durden. If you have read the book then you will be most pleased at the quality of the movie that director David Fincher has done for it. For those who enjoy a mind bending movie, or one that would make you say ""What no, no way"" then Fight Club is a definite choice for viewing.",Fight Club

2977,Gustaffson,Nice detail about the music used,10,10 September 2003,The song that goes along with the titles at the end of the film; where's my mind is from the band the pixies ( as some of you might know). Another song from The Pixies is 'monkey gone to heaven'. Jack (Norton) and Tyler Durden (Pitt) are talking a few times about spacemonkeys. The term covers the idea of the film actually completely. That is: without struggling go sit in a spacecraft and be shot to space.(metaphor for life in modern society ofcourse).Any reactions?,Fight Club
2978,JohnTussolini,A Masterpiece,10,29 August 2017,"Every time I watch this movie, it gets better. The first time I watched my mind exploded with one of the best plot twists ever imagined, the second was an experience entirely different, but was only on the third time that I understood the movie was not just a critique to consumerism but also to the toxic masculinity. If you think the movie is glorifying mindless violence and the creation of real life fight clubs give it another try, this movie is so much more than this. David Fincher is a genius and maybe this is his masterpiece.",Fight Club
2979,naeemriaz2007,Classic,9,20 November 2018,"Superb, and truly one of the greatest movies of all time.It starts with the screenplay. Adapted from, and very faithful to, an excellent book. The book by Chuck Palahniuk was perfect for a movie: vivid, powerful, challenging, original, unpredictable. Considering how perfectly formed the book already was, the screenplay would have been a doddle.Some very interesting themes are explored - consumerism, class warfare, multiple-personality disorder, male bonding, terrorism and anarchy - without being judgemental.Direction is spot-on. Perfect cinematography, pacing and editing. The twists and nuances of the book are captured perfectly.Edward Norton and Brad Pitt are perfectly cast as the two lead characters, and deliver in spades. Helena Bonham Carter is a strange selection to take on the role of Marla, as she tends to act in Shakespearean dramas and other period pieces. However, despite this, her performance is very convincing.An absolute classic.",Fight Club

I cannot understand how some people don't like this movie. It's incomprehensible. This was a stroke of genius, and so was the book, by Chuck Palahniuk. In fact, the book was much better than the movie, but the movie was still really good. Reading the book only after having seen David Fitcher's base, I can only say that it has not ruined it for me AT ALL. The book gives a different insight and by God, if you don't like this movie, I'd have to guess you have no philosophy or morals or values you live by, which would pretty much make you... an animal? :P""Look! Two women f***ing a polar bear!"" Hunter S. Thompson",Fight Club
2981,VinoJoe,Outcome after seeing this movie,8,8 November 2013,"This movie shows what the office goers are feeling deep inside. Its basically a freedom fighting movie. Freedom from our boundaries, from society and our morals. Our worlds's rules were drawn by cowards who can't think out of box. This movie is a real encouragement for all young office goers to make their future spicy.Tyler shows you the path, you must take the decision to follow it. If you want yo make you life interesting follow your heart says. Just let it all out. Don't care about anyone other than yourself, ultimately you are the one who has to suffer the consequences of you activity anyway, so just do whatever you want and don't regret for doing nothing in the future.",Fight Club

I was surprised, a movie that was marketed as a your regular fighting movie was actually a smart, edgy, new movie that kept me entertaining.  However, the ending made no sense, and seemed out of the blue and unexplained.  The movie had kept me riveted, so when this happened, it was a major let down.
Still, I completely recommend watching it.  It's a smart movie that deserves more acclaim then it's received.",Fight Club

So much so, it has been inducted onto very, short list of mine. Short, only because it is rarest of films. The kind that I don't mind watching over and over. (Why waste such precious time, when I have so many other films I want to watch/discover?)I should also mention a totally unabashed guilty pleasure of mine that happens only with this film. I admit. I am utterly compelled to hit *pause* so that I may take in one of the most captivating, memorable images of Brad Pitt's ethereal beauty.I most certainly should make note of one more thing before I wrap up my ramble. #Applause To Whomever performed the casting for this wonderful gem, as well. Not just only because one of my favourite actresses, Helena Bonham Carter, was cast as the films lead protagonist. A role to which Helena obviously totally immersed herself into it's character. Especially since she almost became unrecognizable to me, in a good way, I second guessed myself throughout the movie. Only at the end of the film, during the scroll of the credits, was I made totally certain that it was indeed Helena. Meatloaf also is worth mentioning, for the role of 'Bob', needs giant kudos as well. Meatloaf is captivating in his performance of the most tortured of characters named 'Bob' which is brilliant and totally unforgettable.

Well, let's just say this film could save the NHS a fortune in sedatives! Edward Norton, an amazingly talented actor! His talent is mirrored in films such as American History X and so on. Films where his talent is actually apparent! I sat until the end of the film thinking ""Ok, anytime soon it will get exciting!"" It was so obvious they way the film was going to go and took a very long time to get there. Why anyone would cast Helena Bonham Carter is also beyond me! Brad Pitt is an OK actor, but is blessed with looks (apparently) more than he is talent! So many people have claimed how amazing this film is but I just do not see it!

We think a movie can have certain limitations on its effect and direction but this movie shows you how awesome and well-directed a movie can be. This movie is about male aggression, not just aggression, it is a wrong word, it shows how much non-alive we are. So a guy starts fight club to have some sort of aliveness in a person. He is a visionary man, tyler durden, who has a plan and an entirely different approach to the modern generation. What follows is a roller coaster ride and a one which you wont possibly forgot till you die.The acting is brilliant and so are the one liners.Even before the ending you are tightly gripped by this movie and i assure you at the end you will be overly surprised.

2988,Wes_Candela,"David Fincher's ""FIGHT CLUB""",10,30 August 2013,"When I look forward to a film, then see the film...It never lives up to what I had imagined the film would be. I walk away critiquing , then hating the film (because I love film and television, my standards are through the roof). However, I have come to learn that there are times I need this process...the process of dissecting and critiquing a film/TV series to death...as it is what allows me to fully appreciate the work later. I find that I have to dissect what I don't like about it and I have to get all of those notions out of my mind. It's a cleansing process really, It's where expectation and reality meet in my mind. They battle each other... try to scratch each others eyes out, Then they sit down and have a feast together. That allows me to dispense with my expectations, all of my preconceived imaginary notions about what the film ""is going to be"" ....and then enables me to accept ""what the film actually is"".The reason I start my review this way is to explain the following comment;I hated FIGHT CLUB club when I first saw it. My buddy and I saw the film the Saturday after it was released in the morning. He was surprised that I didn't like it, saying ""this movie is amazing and it's your kind of movie...I'm surprised you didn't like it.""I remember my initial take on the film was that it existed only to show off the trick ending. I felt this because a year prior in 1998, ""The Sixth Sense"" had come out and that ending man. It floored people. Then it was imitated, poorly, for the next 5 years. It seemed like every film HAD to have the trick ending. I didn't realize that this ending was in the book, I should also probably explain that I had taken a tranquilizer or 2 before the film and missed 2/3 of it. Therefore, waking up here and there, then coming to and catching the ending....I didn't know what the hell I was talking about. So...I learn that the films ending is from the Novel by Chuck Palahniuk... I take my friends words to heart & I return to the theater two weeks later to re-watch (watch) the film.My love affair with Fight Club began immediately. The photography, the dialogue, the violence, the pacing, that Fincher cinematic style...introduced to many of us in the 80's & early 90's via epic game changing music videos (MADONNA ""VOGUE""), to refined with the film SE7EN ...then driven into the skull of the film industry with a jack hammer in FIGHT CLUB. This was the film that would define the Fincher style from that moment on.The message. The message. The message. From the amazing cinematography of Jeff Cronenweth, the iconic performance Brad Pitt gives in the film. Knowing how it ends, dissecting how well this single fact is woven and hidden throughout the film...it was masterful. Also the scale of the movie. A film with this type of content, this message...to be presented as grandly as Fight Club is...that's a feat. It's an anomaly. It doesn't happen often. Hollywood filters what gets through to us, they guard their reputations closely. It's a billion dollar institution that doesn't normally invest $70 million dollars into an anti-establishment piece. And yet...there it was, clear as day (well, not really day as Fincher's is the master of nighttime photography) on a movie screen. ""You are not your job. You are not the contents of your wallet."" ""The things you own, end up owning you."" ""I wanted to destroy something beautiful."" ""I don't want to die without any scars."" ""Did you know if you mix equal parts of saw dust and frozen orange juice concentrate you can make napalm?""And now, accepting the movie as a whole, I saw it for what it truly was...genius. A masterpiece. This movie took a lot of beatings when it came out. It cost a ton of money, reviewers who didn't get it or were scared of it and the message it sent gave it poor reviews. Rosie O'Donnel complained about it on her talk show then spoiled the ending for everybody in the audience a week before the movie came out. No mechanized member of the Hollywood machine would have green-lit this picture for $70 million nowadays. Can't recall the name of the man responsible for championing the film that 20th Century Fox , but I believe he was fired after the films release. The filmmakers got away with murder honestly. It was a gift. To us, the audience, the film lovers, the truth seekers. A brilliant story, masterfully realized on the screen. Fight Club is not a safe movie. The fact that the film exists is a miracle. That it is ranked number 10 movie on the Internet Movie Database ""Top 250 Films Of All Time"" list is a testament to its power and the respect it has earned, despite the initial misgivings...my own included...with the film. Certain films changed my life. JFK changed my life, Malcolm X changed My life...FIGHT CLUB changed my life.I would never be the same after that film. I have since read the book and seen the film repeatedly...maybe 25 times.... And it's one of the best films I've ever seen. You know nothing about be, but for me...that is saying a lot. I encourage you to open your mind and see this film promptly.Then watch it again. It's extremely important to celebrate the accomplishment that Fight Club is. Celebrate that it exists at all.

A person's lease on life, can be improved so much by this movie. For example if you don't like something (consumerism), don't pay attention to it. And once you've had beers with your very best friends, it never hurts to have a friendly fight in the front yard. The fights aren't usually long, but you remember the best parts.

2990,cherget0987,Fantastic,10,23 February 2012,"i turn on my xbox at 230 in the morning to play a couple games of gears of war, and this movie just started and playing, and within 1 minute all i knew is that Edward Norton was hugging a man with bitch tits. i instantly started the movie over from the beginning hoping to find some explanation as to why this happened or what the hell this movie was. i was introduced to fight club. a few minutes after the opening credits i look at the clock and it was 5 am. as i picked my jaw off the floor and changed my ruined underwear i realized that i must tell the world about this film. unfortunelty it had been out for about 8 yrs but i didn't care. i showed probably 12 friends of mine and soon enough, you guessed it our own fight club. this movie is amazing. great acting, funny, memorable scenes. every line in this move can be quoted. a great plot twist, and a the perfect ending credits song to wrap everything up. this is a must watch",Fight Club

2992,CinemaCrazy,Not the film I thought it would be.,10,8 November 2003,"For several years I avoided ""Fight Club"" because I was under the impression it was a blood and guts Van-Damme type film.I was wrong.This is a psychological horror film.The opening credits and the music that accompanied them are among the most rousing film openings I've ever seen.  I remember thinking, ""If the film lives up to the excitement and urgency of the credits, we're in for a ride."" And I was.I took a lot away from this movie. Lots of little truths that make you squirm. ""The things you own end up owning you.""I gave this a 10 because it is infinitely re-watchable and - like any great Hitchcock film - the more you watch, the more you see.",Fight Club
2993,kalel22,A wonderful piece of pie for our generation.,10,30 January 2004,"When Fight Club first came out in 1999 I wasn't sure that I would be impressed with the film. Brad Pitt was OK and I wasn't really sure who Edward Norton was. Regardless I purchased my ticket and went to see the movie not knowing how much this film would impact my cinematic view. I left the theater with one of the weirdest feelings I have ever felt towards a film. The way it just was, the way it deeply explored the male psyche through such physical and mental turmoil. In my opinion, Fight Club is an excellent cornerstone in cinema history. It's gritty, dark, and bitter sweet. To me, it's the one film that all other films afterwords will be compared to. I think it will be a movie remembered as one of the great films of our time; perhaps not ""Schindlers List"" or ""Forest Gump"" great, but much better, more like ""A Clock Work Orange"". Previous Generations won't try to understand it, and future generations will view it as a ""Classic"", but only for it's hype. It's one of the movies that I truly feel belongs to us, and what a movie to own.",Fight Club
2994,ozdook,Probably the best film ever.,10,27 November 2003,"I want to start by saying that ""Fight Club"" is, in my opinion, one of the best movies ever made, if not THE best. The plot is fantastic with the revelation at the end dotting the i's. I don't want to write a lot about the story/plot, because one word can describe it: Perfect. The acting is FANTASTIC, with a capital F. Both Brad Pitt's and Edward Norton's acting is mind-boggling. I think that Brad Pitt should have received an oscar for his portrayal of Tyler Durden and Norton at least a nomination. But, unfortunately the academy doesn't award provocative in-your-face movies (at least not usually), although Fight Club should have received at least one oscar. Helena Bonham Carter is ""bloody marvellous"" as the chain-smoking Marla. The entire cast, down to the guy at the airport talking about a dildo, is fantastic. And the writing. My god! It is the best writing in a movie, ever. Lines like: ""With a gun between your teeth you speak only in vowels"", will forever remain in movie history (in my books at least).If you get Edward Norton, Brad Pitt and David Fincher in on a project... well, that's all you need. You have an instant classic.",Fight Club
2995,OverlordRonakus,Great movie,9,10 October 2016,"This movie has great character development and go some twists in it that you don't expect! 9/10 recommend it!One of Brad Pitt's best movies. Same goes for Edward Norton.In Fight Club young urban professionals are just empty, white-collar drones desperate to find meaning beyond cubicle walls. One (Norton) embarks on a deranged personal odyssey when he learns he can get an adrenaline rush by engaging in bare-knuckle brawls.His mentor on this journey is Tyler Durden (Pitt), a philosophizing psychopath who denounces consumerism and individualism in favor of pain. A rebel, he splices pornographic images into family films, urinates in people's food and sells soap made in his kitchen from liposuctioned fat. He's also a budding terrorist.The friends start Fight Club, a secret society of men who meet in the basement of a bar and beat each other to a pulp. It is described as a religious experience. ""Homework"" includes picking fights with strangers, vandalism, arson and leveling high-rises. Norton plays Jekyll to Pitt's evil Hyde.",Fight Club
2996,yuppieshk,Negative,2,11 March 2012,"I think the movie is worth 2 or 3 at most.What the whole movie really brought to the viewers is a mass of violence, destruction, illogic, impossibility and obscurity.I am not going to describe the violence and destruction here because everyone can easily understand what I am talking about. These things are obvious. I want to point out the latter three.First, if a person don't know how to create explosives, how come after becoming a psycho he/she can? ...illogical and impossible. Second, without Brad Pitt, how could a fight club exist? ...illogical. Third, what did the other members of the fight club do to earn a living? They appeared as jobless or tramps. ...impossible and obscure. Actually there are other points I am tired of pointing out.If all these things are good in our world, what is the bad? As a result, it was not awarded any prize.",Fight Club

On screen you will see Edward Norton and Brad Pitt in one of their best performance. Plus a lovely performance of Helena Bonham Carter. Their three characters will involve you in a crazy relationship, that you won't be able to choose any of them, you will love them all. The music by The Dust Brothers gives to the movie an amazing rhythm and dynamic, their music match perfect with each emotion the character is going thru, each scene and each move on the story is perfectly scored, this will keep all your attention into it.The story will catch you instantly and will keep you until the end with an unexpected twist. All of this directed by one of my favorites director David Fincher, the storytelling of this movie and the use of the camera is great, and is no the exception to all his movies.",Fight Club
2998,Erik_Lund,"Really good movie, i did not see that coming!",10,24 July 2013,"Brad Pitt sells soap. An unlikely kick-off point, perhaps, for a film whose graphic violence and apparently amoral attitude has once again sent certain publications and media outlets into a lather over issues of censorship.Freelance soap-seller Pitt (Tyler Durden) begins his relationship with insomniac insurance analyst Edward Norton (The Narrator) on a business flight. For Norton, the trip provides at least minor respite from his normal routine: nights spent haunting a variety of self-help support groups for diseases he doesn't have. He's searching for some sort of emotional connection with his bleak, soulless world.And then his apartment explodes into little shreds of burning domesticity, and the only number he has to call is Tyler's. But having shared a beer of solace, they indulge in a bizarre car park scrap, and though bruised and bloodied, The narrator has never felt so alive. Before long, they have established an illegal, bare-knuckle boxing club in the bar basement for men of like mind. And from this growing band, the anarchist army is gradually recruited.All of which doesn't even begin to scratch the surface of this dark, disturbing and superbly vivid thriller.It's very evident that director David Fincher (Seven, The Game) is obsessed with paranoia and the murkier side of the human soul. Very evident, too, that his stories are layered, distinctive and arresting, and every frame is considered; calculated to feel at the edges of mainstream film-making.Which means a strange, special effects-heavy opening credit sequence flowing into a pastiche of home furnishing adverts, jostling in a film with stark, bone-crunching fight scenes (superbly directed) and a gradually converging master plan of some extreme mischief.And once again in Fincher's hands, Pitt is on top of his game, a wildly charismatic presence at the seething, blackly comic heart of this picture, and not afraid to put his pretty boy chops through the ringer. He's matched blow-for-blow by another impressive turn from Norton, who has shown this brooding, dark-undercurrents-just-below-the- surface performance before in Primal Fear and American History X, and takes it to a whole new level here.And for all the flash and thunder and visual novelty, it's the unpredictable, irresistible qualities of the two leads - supported very well by a striking Helena Bonham Carter as trampy love interest Marla Singer, and rock monster Meat Loaf - that makes this film clutch at your senses, and hold fast.So, as a wise man once said: you cannot be told what Fight Club is; you have to see it for yourself. But only if you think you're hard enough.",Fight Club

When I read this book, I thought 'I have to see this. I have to connect to it more so than I have. I need to see the things I've thought up, so I know I'm not imagining its magnificence'. When I finally did see Fight Club, I couldn't move from my seat. I had to listen to The Pixies singing about the loss of a mind, and I thought 'this is magic. this is beautiful'.I was not uninterested at any point in this movie. I didn't find their to be anything inadvertently wrong with the movie. I liked it. Do I like the book better? Of course.

3002,chefrederickpaul,"Excellent, favourite movie",10,28 November 2011,"This film was a contrast of the sheltered life and the life we all wish we could live, but can't do to societal restraints. Ed Norton is a very boy-ish looking person, which is perfect for the role of the sheltered Narrator. Tyler Durden, played by Brad Pitt, is an excellent contrast because (after some obvious training behind the scenes) he is muscular, taller, and a great deal more sure of himself. I suppose it's a bit ironic that Tyler, played by Pitt, was advocating the fact that we are all the same decaying matter as everything else, and that we'll never grow up to be movie stars, but he is a movie star. Just something that always struck me as strange. The casting, despite that, was perfect in my opinion. The comedy and the action mixed perfectly to keep you interested enough to know exactly what was trying to be said. The duo between Pitt and Norton is perfect in executing this comedy-action style. Even the choice of cars being used, a Lincoln (all Lincolns look more or less the SAME) is used and is comparable to the fact that everyone is (should be) equal. The goriness of the movie during the fights were perfect, and they were very realistic. Fights were never made to seem glamorous, but raw and bloody and painful. They did not sugar coat any of the movie in any way. Tyler's decrepit house where they the Narrator and Tyler lived was perfect. Isolated and broken, relative to the Narrators psyche at the time. If you haven't seen it, you should watch this film. If you have seen it, you should watch it again! Strong message, and strong acting accomplished it well.",Fight Club

Incredible performances by Edward Norton and Helena Bonham-Carter, and a delightfully psychotic Brad Pitt. The movie does tend to run a bit long, but you can easily overlook that.

I think the film is wildly inventive and i'm not denying that it's controversial. But the cast is exceptional and the directing on this is amazing.

The twist in the film was spoiled for me so I won't spoil it for any of you guys. It took me way too long to finally watch this film and I regret not watching it earlier, it stars my favourite actor, Edward Norton, who's performance in American History was jaw dropping and another great actor known as Brad Pitt who stars in se7en which is also directed by David Fincher. Fight Club see's a no named man known as The Narrator (Edward Norton) go through his life dealing with insomnia. During this remarkable journey he meets a man called Tyler Durden (Brad Pitt) on plane. After an accident which causes The Narrator's apartment to explode, then leads to him living with Tyler. After a night of drinking, the two drunk friends then start to fight each other, however, it isn't a fight to do with hate, the two remain friends. They fight once again after another night of drinking but this time they are spotted. The two that found Tyler and The Narrator fighting then ask if they can join in, this leads to more and more people joining in. They decided to call it Fight Club. I won't go any further as I don't want to ruin the story for anyone. Fight Club is probably my favourite film of all time and it should be watched ASAP. The acting and story make Fight Club arguably one of the greatest films ever made. I give Fight Club 5 stars.",Fight Club

It makes through the situations showed by the story and you can think: Is the life I lead is really good?There are many catchphrases presents, common in modern literature and gives a good result for the script of the film.David Fincher follow all the parts of the book, giving a special touch in the scenes, he select a excellent cast for the movie, like Brad Pitt and Edward Norton.""Fight Club"" is a good movie, talks with psychological and philosophical questions, as existence and death.

3019,himanshusridhar,An exhilarating journey in understanding consumerism through aggressive events.,9,1 June 2015,"Fight Club is one such rare movie that deserves to win many nominations and awards,clearly and literally.It is one the best films of 1999.This dark story takes place through the unnamed protagonist-The Narrator essayed by a brilliant Edward Norton.He delivers a power-packed,energetic,deep-in-the-character performance which is immensely commendable.Although most of the movie is shot in dark,lurid atmosphere and there is no glitterati or lights.Edward Norton suffers from chronic insomnia and cant sleep for days together.The only way he can find peace,solace and ultimately sleep is by going to various body- afflicted problem groups where seeing people suffering a plethora of pain makes him calm and retains his composure.Here he meets a weird emo-like woman named Marla Singer portrayed equally well by a weird- looking Helena Bonham Carter who has a lot of uncanny(peculiar)idiosyncrasies.He creates a virtual and visual alter-ego or a persona named Tyler Durden acted by the most exuberant,jovial and boisterous Brad Pitt.He clearly gave and electrifying,stellar performance that deserves sheer accolades.How he takes on the monster of Tyler Durden forms the crux of the story.Tyler is a nihilist who creates a ""fight club"" to ease the tension,agony and anguish of the people living boring,mundane,robotic lives.A clear must-watch if you want to understand consumerism in a novel but violent way.Thumbs UP!!!MY RATING-9 ON 10.",Fight Club

3021,cshadid,Fight Club review,8,31 January 2012,"Fight Club is a bold film and an attack on the consumer-driven life-style adopted by many people in this world. It is an original piece of film work that never ceases to surprise and never bores. Fight Club is a very well made film. Most viewers might think this film is simply about men beating each other up from the title and what they may have heard from other viewers but it is much deeper than that. This film has underlying themes that make you think about the life you are living and our consumer-driven world and is in fact relevant to our present times. Edward Norton is the Narrator and protagonist of the film. Brad Pitt plays ""Tyler Durden"" and is a figment of the narrator's imagination and is the antagonist. Both of these roles are well depicted and portrayed by the actors. These two are very talented and fit their roles well. Fight Club is rated R by the MPAA for disturbing and graphic depiction of violent anti-social behavior, sexuality and language. This movie has several scenes containing brutal fights that have their fair share of violence and gore and it also shows uses of alcohol and smoking by the actors. There is also brief nudity throughout the film. Combining all of that with the F-word being used 76 times in the film it is no surprise that it is rated R. But that does not take away from how well this film has been made. Most audiences will have a hard time identifying the visual effects of Fight Club from the film's live action. Many of the visual effects sequences literally fly past the viewers, in one smooth and continuous motion. These spectacularly realistic sequences keep the story moving forward. David Fincher and the film's Visual Effects Supervisor, Kevin Haug, chose to work with BUF Inc. for most of the CGI-based effects sequences in the film. These groups of artists worked well together to achieve very artistic options for the films visual effects. They furthered the filmmaker's vision while advancing their own visual effects expertise. Fight Club is a film worth seeing, but is not for the faint of heart due to its violence and profanity used in the film. It is a artistic masterpiece and a memorable and superior motion picture. It is a rare movie that does not abandon its quest to jolt the viewer.",Fight Club
3022,amberdon,A psychological political thriller that Uncle Scam does not want you to watch.,10,21 February 2004,"Viewing this film is like making love for the first time. You think you know what is happening but until you have experienced it a few times you just don't get it.Just exactly what are we and where do we stand in the world? Are we living or are we plugged in to a machine that is draining us dry? This Quentin Tarantino film asks some psychological questions and hints at political reasons for the nature of humanity today.Have you reached bottom yet? Maybe this film will help.If you did not give the film a 10 and you watched it only once I can see your true nature, you would have made a great Munich cheerleader in 1938.This is the strongest social commentary I have seen in a decade.My hat is off to you Quentin, this is an amazing piece of work.

3023,barbasthegreat,You just have to watch this... three times.,10,25 April 2004,Well what can i say about the movie i consider the best i have ever seen? First of all this is one of those movies that are probably going to have an impact on you and maybe even change the way that you think about some stuff. It tackles many social problems known to everybody but not really discussed and offers a new view on the capabilities of the average man. The directing is done in a exquisite way with fast shots and some shots where Fincher's expierience from shooting video clips is obvious. The storyline is near to perfect very focused and tight a great story told in a great way. One other thing i'd like to not is the excellent soundtrack.I've only bought two movie soundtracks this and for The Matrix. The Dust Brothers do a really great job making the movie more alive with some great strong music. Of course the acting from Norton and Pitt is excellent and i could say one thousand more things about what is great about this that you won't be able to understand before you watch this movie three times. So go and get it!,Fight Club
3024,amoremerlo,Inspired our real Fight Clubs at girls camp,10,24 February 2012,"When I was at camp, we were all twisted and started our own Fight Club inspired fights after the counselors went out to party in the town nearby. We would pull down our mattresses to create a cushion near the edges of the bunk beds. No one was suppose to violate the three rules of Fight Club, but it did not work out as well in the film, as after several nights of our fights, boys from the nearby camp sneaked into our camp so they can watch our bouts. No one seriously got hurt like the fights in the movie, Fight Club, but in retrospect our fights were far sexier. Our Fight Club was brought to an end, due to the one time one of my bunkmates got injured. After being pushed and wrestled to the ground, one girl tried to kicked the other girl, but instead kicked the steel frame of one of the bunk beds. Her toe began bleeding, so we took her to the infirmary. She told the nurse she tripped on a rock, while walking to the bathhouse, but the nurse alerted the camp director. When the camp director went to investigate, she found a cabin in disarray with teenagers in underwear surrounded by mattresses and boys. The next day, parents were called, and we all blamed our behavior on Fight Club. For the rest of camp, the director made our counselors stay in our cabins at night. They were upset they couldn't go out anymore at night to party, so as punishment, they made us watch Fight Club every night for the rest of the summer.",Fight Club
3025,hakon-bri,Beautiful and Brutal,10,3 June 2013,"Known for its intense, brutal violence and ideological themes, Fight Club is considered by many one of the greatest films of the last two decades. With it's great narrative, quirky humour and compelling characters it is truly a film to enjoy. It is based on the novel by the same name by Chuck Palahniuk and is directed by David Fincher. Edward Norton portrays the film's protagonist. Norton's nameless character - which is only referred to as ""The Narrator"" - is stuck at a dead-end job living in his small apartment full of Ikea-junk. He's working at a car company where he spends his days filling out forms, making copies, drinking coffee and getting yelled at. After a long day at the office he comes home to his Ikea-infested two-room apartment, watches TV, eats his microwave-heated dinner and goes to bed. The narrator describes his life and his view of the world through dialogue where he uses sharp satire and direct social criticism. The narrator is a depressed social outcast that needs something – or someone - to get his life going. He also suffers from insomnia, which doesn't make his life any more manageable. He eventually finds a rather odd ailment for his illness. He attends a support group for men who have suffered testicular cancer. This quickly becomes an addiction. He finds himself attending to several different groups a week and being unable to sleep without them. He does this undisturbed for some time until he meets a woman by the name of Marla Singer. Marla, played by Helena Bonham Carter, is a so-called ""tourist""; a person - who just likes the main character - attends self-help and therapy groups to make herself feel better. Knowing that there is another faker present he fails to open himself up emotionally. As a result of this the narrator fails to sleep once again.He eventually finds himself on a business flight sitting next to Tyler Durden. Portrayed by Brad Pitt, Tyler Durden is a genuine menace. Tyler shows strong disregard against society and the materialistic way of life of the western civilization. He believes that in order to truly be free you first have to lose everything. He is also an avid soap-maker. Through a various turn of events the Narrator and Tyler starts to organize a weekly fight club for men. More and more people hear about this and the club quickly expands. But as the fight club grows and becomes more organized the narrator starts to ask himself new questions: what exactly is happening around him and is there more to Tyler Durden than he is aware of?David Fincher has made a number of great films throughout his career (Se7ven, The Curious Case of Benjamin Button) and Fight Club is no exception. He has done an excellent job transferring the book to the silver screen and has gained much admiration for it. Fincher's use of violence in the film is not something to shy away from. The brutal and graphic fight scenes were strongly criticized when it first came out in 1999. Not unlike Stanley Kubrick's A Clockwork Orange from 1971, it was condemned by many as a film that glorifies violence. In many ways these two movies are not very different. The use of violence and the human psyche is an on-going theme throughout both films. But the movie is not all about physical fighting. The film also focuses on emotional, mental and ideological fighting. It's about finding yourself and finding out what you really want to do with your life. There are a lot of factors that makes this film great; it is funny, it's brutal, and it's inspirational. It makes you question your own existence and what you are really supposed to do. Brad Pitt does an exceptionally good role as Tyler Durden, which is without a doubt one of his greatest performances to date. He is mesmerizing, and he really does a believable role as the charismatic and revolutionary sociopath. Along with Pitt is Edward Norton, who does an excellent job as the gloomy and often confused narrator. Elena Bonham Carter also does an avid and amusing role as the suicidal Marla Singer. The leading actors work really well together and it is plain to see that they have a lot of good chemistry throughout the film. Meat Loaf also plays a refreshing and fun part as the testicular cancer-victim and former bodybuilder Bob.Fight Club is a truly great film with a social message that many will sit and ponder over. The film combines violence, social criticism, masculinity, human relations and psychology in a mix that is sure to make an impression. It is without a doubt one of the most noteworthy films that has been made the last couple of decades. It is a film that many will enjoy, but some may occasionally cringe at some of its scenes. But no matter how you feel about this film you must not forget the first (and the s",Fight Club

3027,dmbegptn,"a bold psychological thriller, not something you would think of everyday",10,13 November 2004,"Fight Club has great acting, cinematography, and a great story. If you look into the story, beyond the fight club itself or operation mayhem, you can see that Marla Singer is actually the one who brings this story to its epitemic halt. Notice that the Narrator (Norton) and Tyler Durden (Brad Pitt) are never in the same room at the same time. This obviously means only one thing; the Narrator's fed up with his life and introduces himself to a thought up character to make his life more interesting. Tyler says in the movie that he is the Narrator and that Tyler has taken over control of what his counterpart can do to limit his destruction. To destroy all the beauty in life the Narrator created a monster that cannot be controlled. The world is destroyed and everyone can start over.",Fight Club
3028,shreddedddd1818,Excellent film displaying the split-personality psychotic journey of a man gone mad,10,22 March 2012,"If you love action movies then this is right up your alley. On top of that, this film incorporates a very deep plot, combined with a shallow yet satisfactory form of humor. Besised the brilliant acting performances by Pitt & Norton, it had a really down-to-earth vibe about it...almost like you could see yourself in the main characters shoes. My favorite quality about this film is the wickedly unexpected twist at the end...absolutely awesome to say the least! It made the movie into something totally different and shed light on dim questions one may have had during the movie up until the final scenes of it. Whoever thought this plot line out did a good job. Not too mention they did a remarkable job of blending action,suspense, and a little bit of drama and comedy into the masterpiece entitled Fight Club. I think I've seen it 4-5 times and I've yet to get bored of it: it seems like you notice something new about it each time you watch it. Most of all I love the fact that everything seems to be quite dysfunctional for these characters in this movie, however, instead of moaning and groaning about it, they instead do something about it the only way they know how and fight back against the norm of society and stereotypes of society. Good for them. They may not have used the standard, conventional, by-the-book way of getting things accomplished, but nonetheless, it worked...well, I might add. But without giving too much information about the finality of the film, I will say this: up until the last 10 minutes or so, the viewer thinks one thing and one thing alone. But as the ending plays out it sheds a TOTALLY different life about every single aspect of the movie. Really was a classic and ground-breaking finish. This is a must see in my humble opinion. Enjoy the masterpiece, it is delightful and very different than one may originally expect. Kudos to the individuals who directed, produced, wrote, and had anything else to do with the production of this film. It is indeed an ageless classic.",Fight Club

Please : watch it and don't forget that you are the destinatary of the message, don't think it's only for other guys. The Fight Club provides us a new vision of our world and helps us to understand it better. Check that movie out and come back to the IMDB vote chart and let your neurons explode.

3031,TuesdayPisces,Essential for all Nietzsche students and readers!,10,16 April 2004,"Fincher's ""Fight Club"" is an essential work of art for all Nietzsche students and readers. As it really takes the story to its completion, something that the novel is unfortunately afraid to do, the movie is the most amazing and compelling illustration of Nietzsche's most famous concept: the will transforming itself into power - 'Wille zur Macht'. As Tyler Durden immerses himself in the search of his individuality, he progressively rids himself of anything that is not him and goes back to the essential: will and his desires. Until he finally experiences the nietzschean achievement of transforming his will and desires into pure power. The movie doesn't stop there though and in a superb ending offers to the viewer the most important question once you've reached the transformation and purification of your will and instincts, which can only be done by overcoming the fear of death: will you use your power for destruction (nihilism) or to build a future (love)? Or both?A masterpiece and a ""must"" for all philosophy students!",Fight Club
3032,nataliepxx-355-725497,Excellent with hints of indie,10,29 April 2012,"I really loved this film the soundtrack complemented the warped plot very well. The plot was well thought out and very clever and portrayed the side of society we don't get to see and it didn't shirk away from the side Hollywood doesn't do. Fight Club had lots of aspects of Indie films and the cinematography was amazing. Ed Norton was in my opinion the best in the film and Helena Bonham Carter really delved into her character deeply. I think the fact that only halfway through we understand who Brad is, is clever as we don't want to find out to early on as it ruins the suspense but it was nice to be able to be clued up for the ending which made it more dramatic The only aspect i didn't like was the scene where Helena is visited by Brad and i though it could've been explored some more",Fight Club
3033,oreopankakes,Best Movie Ever,10,5 June 2004,"Nothing will ever compare to the works of ""Fight Club"". From the one-line quotables to the philosophy, pure sublime. Even the filler could work as a movie itself. Then there are the in-depth, layered aspects of the film, not to mention a supportive, outstanding score from ""The Dust Brothers"". Brad Pitt and Edward Norton give the best performances of their careers, scoffed by the Academy for obvious reasons. Chuck Palahniuk even agreed that the film was an above and beyond adaptation of his novel. The cinematography is dead on, enhancing the essence of this film. Anyone who says they do not like this film simply does not understand what it is. But there is nothing wrong with it, because those who do understand will love this film.

His doctor refuses to give him medication and advises him to visit a support group to witness more severe suffering. The narrator attends a support group for testicular cancer victims and, after fooling them into thinking that he is a fellow victim, finds an emotional release that relieves his insomnia. He becomes addicted to attending support groups and pretending to be a victim, but the presence of another impostor, Marla Singer, disturbs him, so he negotiates with her to avoid their meeting at the same groups.After a flight home from a business trip, the narrator finds his apartment destroyed by an explosion. He calls Tyler Durden, a soap salesman whom he befriended on the flight, and they meet at a bar. A conversation about consumerism leads to Tyler inviting the narrator to stay at his place; outside the bar he requests that the narrator hit him.

One of the most compelling and intelligently written stories to come out of a Hollywood production ..........EVER!!  This rates higher than Pulp Fiction or Se7en for me and that's saying a lot.  This and American History X really made me see Edward Norton in a different light. I don't want to ruin it for you but suffice to say it's on of the best twist endings ever.  Should you see it, I also recommend picking up the book as it explains more about project mayhem and provides a completely different ending but one just as satisfying. I don't want to make this review too long so I will close with this.  If you see one new movie this year, make it Fight Club.  You won't be disappointed.",Fight Club

It has everything. Great performances, great character development, fantastic direction, wonderful twist. Just fantastic.There are clues throughout the film that suggests the end of the film which on a 2nd watch are so obvious its unreal. ""its like Tyler's words came right out of my mouth"".Overall i would give it Full marks.",Fight Club
3038,plague336,Best Movie ever,10,2 May 2004,"This movie is still my favorite movie. I have seen many great Movies, but Fight Club has always bin even greater.When you add David Fincher (Director) + Brad Pitt (Tyler Durden) + Edward Norton (Narrator) + Helena Bonham Carter (Marla Singer) + Meat Loaf (Bob) + Chuck Palahniuk (Story) you get the Best Movie of the 20th Century.For me the main issue of the movie is that money alone won't make you happy, neither will the things you own. You should rather stay with your buddies and live your life instead of wasting it all at work (Not that I'm against work, I just think it's bad being a workaholic). Or like Chuck Palahniuk said it in his follow-up novel Survivor, that if no one had seen it, any action would be pointless. When you work 12 hours a day behind a desk, you don't accomplish anything real,you're life was only about getting money, it was pointless.",Fight Club

I was just wondering if anyone else read the book...i can't believe that this book is Chuck Palahnuik's first book...wow! I thought it was funny where the narrator and Tyler meet in the book versus the movie. I also think Edward Norton is an AMAZING actor...he was so good in American History-X too!

3042,AlexanderKinter,One of my all time favorites for sure!,10,16 September 2016,"This film directly inspired me to become involved in entertainment as both a director, filmmaker and an actor. The entire execution of the story is one any filmmaker would be honored to even come close by, David Fincher, one of the greats. The character development as the plot is revealed throughout the film leave me in awe and on the edge of my seat time and time again. Such a real and raw gritty film with unique perspectives. Truly brilliant low light lighting techniques really makes the film stand out and as well as the incorporation of some of the VFX composite shots. The film is extremely relatable to those who live a normal 9-5 in corporate America who may feel that every day is the same and there has to be something more out side of that realm. The lead character definitely has a transformation throughout this film and it has several twists and turns to keep anyone entertained. The fighting action scenes have great cinematography and impeccable timing with the story. Brad Pitt's character is full of unconventional truth but laced with a bit of antagonistic disaster. This film has earned its way in to being one of the best all time classic's in my thoughts.",Fight Club

I can say that I have seen this one prolly way too many times that any normal man should and have a copy of the script as well. It would take me forever to explain all of the intelligence and pure genius generated throughout this film. Fight Club hit me on so many levels,unexpectedly I may add. I first viewed this in my Senior drama class via the best drama teacher ever Mr.Wheeler. He said he was disappointed that this movie didn't get the awards that it deserved. He couldn't have been any more right. This film is superbly directed by David Fincher,who I thought never did a better job than Se7en and I was wrong until I seen this. I don't have to explain its plot just that if u haven't seen this one, I highly recommend it. I doubt many people will be disappointed. I have seen and heard of all of the ""overrated"" labels this one gets. And if I jumped on the bandwagon for this one, then so be it. This one makes you think and there is not a boring second in this to me. Although it does have some rather noticeable goofs(Bob dead and easily seen still breathing and the ever popular goof,the bench that was rammed into the glass door that moves a good 3 feet or so suddenly in the shot after its used to break the glass. LMAO.!) Other than that I say watch this and be ready to be hit with great fight scenes, a love story, a friendship story if you will and of course its ""bruising comedy"" as put on the movie case.

If not, then I am sincerely grateful for your existence in our world.On a side note, despite the plot holes, I figured out who Pitt's character was since the end-of-the-apartment scene.

I just gotta say it - this is my least favorite movie of all time.",Fight Club
3046,j-silvautor,"Interesting, strange... and unsatisfying",6,30 August 2012,"I began watching this movie with no expectations. I knew it was rather well-rated on IMDb, so I was hoping it was average at the very least. I wasn't disappointed, but I wasn't pleasantly surprised either. Fight Club struck me as a interesting idea, but somehow I felt the script wasn't completely able to capture it. During the first two thirds of the film, I felt slightly intrigued, reasonably upset about the message that was being sent and yet, somehow, I was thinking. I really enjoy thought- provoking movies, and Fight Club is a fine specimen. This isn't a visual masterpiece nor an all-action movie picture, and the development is slow, sometimes too slow. But it keeps you tuned (at least it kept me) because everything feels so strange that you just want to try and understand it. I felt a little bit like I used to feel watching Alice in Wonderland while growing up. So, I forced myself to sit through it, simply because I wanted to understand what the point was. Some action scenes made the movie flow better, but they weren't at all that interesting nor that much of a visual experience. I felt like some of the fight scenes' violence was over- exploited, but that didn't bother me all that much as I'm a tolerant watcher. The fact is, when the major plot twist occurs, I was thrilled for a moment. I thought: ""hey, that was clever. Didn't see that one coming. Now I get were all that slow, bordering boring plot development makes some sense. This might actually be a good movie"". So, I hoped. And I was let down, because the one idea that formed in my head that seemed to me worthy of saving this film wasn't explored. You see, when I finished watching the movie, there was one big question just flashing in my mind: ""Now what?"". The ending is so brutally unsatisfying in the way that it makes the film all about people relating to it (which is important, of course) but completely forgets the plot, forcing you to enter in such a state of acknowledging that the film is meant to be a wake-up call about consumerism and rotting lifestyles and not a reflexion about it that you end up feeling unsatisfied. Although this isn't a fair comparison, what I love about Chris Nolan's films is that everything just seems to come together so perfectly in a plotwise masterpiece time after time after time, while presenting amazing thought-provoking premises; and David Fincher, in my opinion, failed to do exactly that, leaving an idea floating in the air but somehow failing to grab it, make it his and build a coherent, believable plot around (our about) it. All in all, Fight Club is a movie worth watching. It starts from an interesting premise and explores it, it has one significant, believable and interesting plot twist, the acting is brilliant and the directing is very reasonable. It captivates you because it's strange, and ends up making you wonder. However, it develops very slowly and it ends up forgetting it's own plot and will leave you with a bitter-sweet scent on your mouth because, even if you must recognize this is a good movie in most aspects, you end up thinking it could have been so much more if just the script was just a little bit more satisfying. 6/10; Pros: interesting premise; great technical aspects, directing, acting, some very enjoyable scenes and a great plot twist Cons: Besides the plot twist, the plot is rather weak and the ending is unsatisfying and bordering on ridiculous.",Fight Club
3047,SlowGirlFastLane,Fight Club-A movie that keeps you thinking for days.....,10,31 May 2004,"Fight Club is an excellent movie that keeps you thinking about it for days....at least that's the effect it had on me. There are elements in the film that make you laugh, (such as the dialogue between the narrator and ""Tyler Durden"" when they're on the plane. ""Do you know why they put oxygen masks on planes"" ""so you can breathe"" ""Oxygen gets you high........calm as Hindu cows"" The movie can also make you confused in the way that The Wall does. It can also make you gag with all the bloody fight scenes. In short, Fight Club is somewhat a comedy and action film with a touch of creepy. Fight Club isn't for everyone, especially those who lack satirical humor. When you watch it the first time, it may be quite confusing until you reach the end where you get a better understanding of it. When you watch it the second time, you begin to notice more things (""subliminal Brad"" appearing for instance, when the narrator's doctor turns away or the quick flash of a penis as the movie comes to an end lol ) I watched the movie, trying to figure out what the message was. You think, is Fight Club the form of therapy for men? Is it about denial and self hatred that drives a person to imagine themselves as another person-someone who they'd like to be, but could never be? Is it about the conformity of society...or cheating death so that you can live tomorrow as though it were the best day of your life? You are alive the most when you're almost dead...and that was my take on the film. Marla never looking both ways when she crossed the streets...Tyler Durden and his acid burn...the men of Project Mayhem and their near death experience, and Tyler Durden giving the liquor store owner a chance to live so that he can accomplish his desire to become a vet. Whatever the movie was about, it's all in perspective, and every time you watch it...you manage to think of a new opinion. Fight Club is truly a great film, and without a doubt, an interesting one! But of course-The first rule of Fight Club is, you do NOT talk about Fight Club...so I guess you'll just have to watch it and see what it's all about!",Fight Club

This plot is the same as many psychological thriller movies, maybe the fact of challenging the world system (the way the world moves: money, etc.) is quite interesting but redundant anyways.The points I give it is because of the theme of violence, no many directors or people in general use it or even present this as a way of living or not even as a alternative, you all know execute violence is such a taboo, that is why no one has the courage to do it but this movie does it.

Believe me when I tell you that you have never seen a film like this. In my opinion Fight Club is about someone who wants to change his life, but in the process he goes to far and crosses the line. ""Fight Club"" is just a name, the philosphies and theories of this film goes beyond Rocky-like hitting people or anything you ever imagine. The impact of this movie is gigantic, it could change the way you see the world forever. The ending is nothing but phenomenal. The sixth sense and Memento would wish to have a final scene like Fight Club 's. Pitt 's and Norton's performances are unrepeatable, the best ones they will ever have.

When I saw that this movie is among the best movies of all time I decided to watch it and I don't regret 2 hours spent watching this movie at all. The title is misleading, this isn't about fighting at all. Many people are disappointed by movie just because they hoped for more action or they thought that this movie is all about sweaty men fighting which they don't like. However, the whole Fight Club thing is just a side story. Actually, it's about nowadays values: Tyler, main character, wants to tell us that we just are wasting our lives doing crappy job which we don't even like so we can buy things we don't even need. He just wants to set people free by demolishing today's system. Tyler's thinking really differs from average person, but he is more free than anyone else. Narrator, the other main character, doesn't understand that, he's just everyman working in the office, but after meeting Tyler, he really tries to change. Once you understand what is this movie really about, you can't stop watching it. I watched it many times and I still find it interesting. What's more interesting that this isn't all, there is one major plot twist, which makes this movie a masterpiece.In conclusion, really enjoyed this film, recommend it for everyone else. It makes you think what the life is really about and what should we value.",Fight Club

And my favorite one.Excellent job by director, script writer nd mostly actors! Story nd plot will keep you stunned until you see the reality of movie.the movies came to my attention in 2013 because in 1999 I was like 7 years old kid and I was not aware of Hollywood movies.than one day I was browsing movies on IMDb and saw the ratings and it had very pretty good ratings than I decided to watch it at any cost. I bought a DVD and finally watched in 2015 and was very much impressed to watch this masterpiece I shared my DVD to my friends and started talking about how good the movie was.I just can't stop watching the movie over and over again .I really like to appreciate Mr Edward Norton and Mr Brad Pitt.

3054,sarine-,To be or not to be?,10,11 June 2004,"Just watched the film on TV, I have seen it now about thousands of times and it still gets better and better all the time. David Fincher is one of the best and leading directors in the world, and this movie is a great example why. I'm not sure what is the main lesson of this film, but my opinion is that this film is showing how boring it is to live a perfect life, when everything is bought from IKEA. A shallow life is not a good life. Fincher shows what is needed to do when you are bored and want something new and exciting for your life. This ""Fight Club"" is just one example for the new life. Every actor is doing a marvelous job so it's beautiful to watch them move and talk to the camera. This film is not just another ""violence"" film, violence of this film is different, it's art not just blood and sweat. Everything in this film just clicks, very good job Mr.Fincher.Joni",Fight Club

3057,fboccazzi,the two-sided soul of the no-generation,10,28 April 2005,"first: sorry for my English... This movie is one of the most important ones of the '90: it is a sarcastic portrait of the no-generation, the generation that has been educated by the television, the first generation obsessed by advertisement and futile consumer items, the generation obsessed by body care. The main character is split, as anyone who belong to this generation: on one side the cynical integrated assurance worker, on the other side, the wild soul of Tyler. The most interesting thing is that the critic is not only spotted on our ""inhuman"" consumer society, but also on the ""social terrorist"", the trained monkeys. A generation with no hopes, no dreams and no goals but the ones described by TV advertisement can be easily manipulated: you only needs to show them a ""leader"" (as Tyler) and they'll do anything for him...just like Germans during the NAzi era, or the Italians during fascism. It is a movie (and a book) that makes you think a lot about our society, but doesn't give you any answer...very interesting.",Fight Club
3058,iheartjesus88,NOT ABOUT VIOLENCE,10,25 June 2004,"This movie is among the best that I have ever seen. It is witty, humorous, and thought provoking. The reason that I, personally, love this movie, is that there is a bit of Tyler Durden in every person. This ""free man"" is suppressed within the confines of taboo and society, and there it suffocates and dies. But that is beyond the point. What I am feebly attempting to say about this movie, is that it is a satire on all of the meaningless blue collar lives of the middle class of America. I have heard critics that this movie is ""dark and cynical"" because they are perhaps missing the crucial undercurrents of the purpose and depth of this masterpiece. To say that this movie is violent and (I've heard some people say) scary is completely missing the point. It isn't scary...it is enlightening. It represents a world that we are all too scared to be in, a life that we are all to scared too live. This movie is nothing new, it isn't original or unique. Fight clubs have been alive and kicking since the first time a man experienced the rush of adrenaline after he asked his buddy, ""I want you to hit me as hard as you can"". As I quote, ""Before young men started scarring kisses into their hands with lye or Superglue [...] Before you could walk through airports and hear bogus public address announcements paging 'Tyler Durden...Would Tyler Durden please pick up the white courtesy phone...' [] Before all that...there was just a [seven page] short story."" (Fight Club, the novel-introduction. Chuck Palahniuk). The book started because Chuck Palahniuk needed a way to pass the time. The book never was intended to go very far. The critics hated it, and people were not interested in a book called 'Fight Club'. Mr. Palahniuk said that he would have done better with a book entitled: 'Barn-Raising Club'. But it doesn't matter what the critics think, does it? It matters what the people thinkand they loved it. This book, I feel, is a work of genius. The type of literary genius that is so carefully avoided by John Steinbeck and Albert Camus has taken the minds of young boys and conformed it to think, ""We are the all-singing all-dancing crap of the world"".There have been realists in the past, but none so believable as Tyler Durden. When one sees the movie you cannot help but believe Tyler when he tells us 'You are not what's in your wallet, you are not your f**king khakis'. You cannot help but revere him when he tells the store clerk 'In six weeks, if you are not on your way to becoming a veterinarian, you will die'. I don't think that they could have cast the movie any better, either. Brad Pitt is amazingly real. When I saw the movie, I couldn't help but think that is the way that he truly is. The narrator plays the sort of pathetic person that would dream up an imaginary friend to make himself feel better. An unbelievable part played to perfection. Marla is not a bombshell but seems to be the perfect fit for a lecherous lady that is the cause for the anguish. It is a work of genius as far as I'm concerned. I am not a critic, I have no PHD and I am not anyone who truly matters to anyone's personal opinion. But this movie isn't dark, scary, or cynical if you listen to what Tyler Durden says. A world where all people are equal, a world of freedom, a world where you actually live and are not just ""a copy of a copy of a copy"". The fighting is a minute part of this movie in all actuality. This movie is not about violence...it is about the bonding of men, the trials of love, the torture of being a bit crazy, but most of all it is about a world that is not concerned with your status, your sofa, your cornflower blue tie. THAT is Fight Club, my friends. THAT is the essence of Tyler Durden.",Fight Club
3059,nikola_metallica,First,10,9 August 2016,"This is my favorite movie ever. I watched it like more than 10 times and still it is never boring but yet more and more interesting cause I constantly catch new things that I haven't noticed before and most important I listen to new things and I put them in training in my personal life, for an example I really love the line ""This is your life and it's ending one minute at a time"". Because of this line, I do things without much thinking and I actually enjoy in whatever I do. I also like the line ""The things you own end up owning you"". For me, this means that we should not focus on having the material things like the newest phone or the newest whatever.. We should all focus on the spiritual, of what is inside of all of us. We should love, care and do things for each others and for our selves, to be relaxed and to be happy.",Fight Club

On screen you will see Edward Norton and Brad Pitt in one of their best performance. Even though if you know the Edward Norton's and Brad Pitt's characters are of single person still you will enjoy the movie.It's okay... you don't have to tell me about it. But when you see this movie you might be more willing to talk about it. I mean, who hasn't wanted to be somewhere else or be someone else, even if only for a moment.As much as it's about fighting, its about the way we live our daily lives. It's quite philosophical in a way. It discusses consumerism, capitalism, crisis in masculinity and all other themes.Final words : A fantastic story. Amazing actors. A killer soundtrack. One of the most amazing twists in modern movie history.",Fight Club
3063,GellyJayM_,What a beautiful story!,10,30 January 2016,"Be forewarned. This is a film chest-deep in violence. It begins with a man pointing a gun into another's mouth, and it ends with the bombing of a skyline of urban office buildings. In between, you'll see a lot of young men bashing in each other's faces as blood freely flows all over the place.Americans are used to covering up the nation's defects as much as possible. When some unfortunate tendency surfaces with tragic results, as in the school shootings, we look to teams of experts interviewed on the media to explain the problem and suggest how we might remedy it. Fight Club spits in the face of all such grand projects of self-improvement and national justification. This fast- paced, clever, and visually stunning drama reveals the shadow side of America — one that is impervious to moral bromides and easy answers.The screenplay by Jim Uhls, based on a novel by Chuck Palahniuk, is chock full of witty and cynical takes on self-examination, the New Age, Martha Stewart, mail order catalogs, law and order, and sexual politics. Here corporate culture and consumerism are identified as the excesses that give rise to the darker side of the American personality.The narrator of this mesmerizing film is played with spooky intensity by Edward Norton. He has an odious job as a recall coordinator for a major automobile company. When he tries to get some relief for his insomnia, his doctor suggests that to really feel pain, he should attend a group for victims of testicular cancer. The narrator soon becomes addicted to a variety of support groups. For the first time in his life, he gets in touch with his emotions and cries freely. However, Marla Singer (Helena Bonham Carter), another tourist in the land of genuine suffering, spoils this therapeutic release for him by holding up a mirror to his dishonesty.The narrator's life is radically changed when he meets Tyler Durden (Brad Pitt), a very mysterious fellow who is a philosophical nihilist. His various jobs comprise a concerted attack on corporate America. Durden makes soap out of human fat retrieved from liposuction clinics and sells it to posh department stores; the enterprise is actually a cover for making nitroglycerin for bombs. While moonlighting as a projectionist, he splices momentary pornographic images into family films. Working as a waiter, he urinates into the soup of unsuspecting customers. He lives in a boarded-up abandoned house on the outskirts of town, a place where nobody would think to look for anybody. The narrator moves in with him.Before long these two alienated young men have found a new outlet for their pent-up anger-all-out bare knuckle fist fighting. They establish Fight Club, after-hours gatherings of men who share their pleasure in masochistic pain. The secret movement spreads until there are clubs all over the country. These then evolve into guerrilla war units in a project Durden calls ""Mayhem."" Through various acts of violence and vandalism, their goal is the downfall of corporate America. Because business-as-usual only benefits the rich and the powerful, these frustrated and unfulfilled men are determined to level the playing field-literally. Their devil-may- care love of violence is more evidence of the shadow in America.",Fight Club

I know that it generates a mixed reaction, but its my favorite movie for so many different reasons. It kicks ass on various levels and it has action, drama, suspense and lots of twists and turns along with some dark comedy. It has some great ideas which make you think about things and open your eyes, especially to our society and world today, and mainly, consumerism. My opinion may be biased as Edward Norton is also my favorite actor, but Brad Pitt does a fantastic job in it too, as well as the rest of the supporting cast.

3069,dionisio-carvajal-526-210993,Bravely experimentally creative movie-making,10,11 March 2013,"One of the best movies ever made: An exercise in ""visual philosophy"", using all technical resources to illustrate and narrate a mental- imaginary-and-machinations based plot line. Fight Club is a fable of the id, ego, and super ego interacting, to revive the main character (""Jack) from his stupor. This lethargy and detachment from his bodily needs and id instincts, prevents him to sleep and mate. His sexual drive and need for love have been channeled into consumerism. He buys things he doesn't need compulsively, to escape his misery without success. The solutions he (or his psyche segments) comes up with are evolutionary, but basically of the same substance he longs and aches for to awaken him from this lethargy. He starts off visiting shockingly bleeding heart - support groups. Used to the corporate politically correct, neutral and aseptic dialogues, this candidness rattles him up towards vitality, recognizing his own humanity, enlightening the steps to come in the path. Nirvana is his desired path, the path at the very core of all human being that looks for religion, drugs or any perception of god or what is beyond words and things, and ultimately that ghost inside us. His Id/super ego is Tyler Durden. He shows him how to escape from fear. That fear that drove him to drown himself into things, in work and vapid banality. Then there comes the Fight Club. ""Fight club wasn't about winning or losing""... ""It wasn't about words"", says Jack. It is not about violence in the sense of hurting someone else out of anger, I would add. Jack is detached from the animal we are, that eats, defecates, has sex and breathes. Jack is detached from the caveman we have been for thousands of years, that ""civilized"" men despise, but is rooted in our DNA. Jack is an extreme case of the dangers of excessive consumerism, individuality and materialism of our culture. Jack fears loosing (a fight, his job, anything that threatens his ego or causes him pain) and longs for human contact and intimacy. Searching for a relationship is a big stretch. Baby steps, the support group first. Then fighting furnishes him with all this. I would like to address the movie's critics like Robert Ebert, who fail to seize the zeitgeist and how fight club relates and how the violence is tangential. The story is about a very particular individual with a very common pathology who seeks a very unorthodox solution in a very dire, desperate situation. This masterpiece exercises and puts forth ""visual philosophy"", displaying what would be a modern version of Zen enlightenment's exercises or Koans. There is no doctor that treats greed and Ikea fetishes. This dude is on his own. He needs to get in touch with his masculinity and loose the fear at the root of all fears, the fear of death, and so do the other attendees of the Fight Club. Fighting is a start; the fear of physical harm is in the same line. Guys don't go to Fight Club to win, everyone is a winner, because the target is to unload the burden of fear. If you desensitize yourself to the fear of punches and blood, abstract fear triggers, as being fired diminish by contrast. Our culture is plagued with fears of the unknown, the what ifs that blocks us from taking risks that could change or enhance our life. Tyler Durden, the superego is boundless and moves forward unfettered to things that are not realistic for the ego, the pranks and crimes against possessions of the project mayhem. But before that he confronts Jack with the fear of death using chemical burn. Crazy, unorthodox yet effective, and more important in a movie: entertaining. Finally, Jack evolves towards love, the main driver from the start. The movie is a love story. His relationship with the woman is abrasive, because his sexuality is twisted, hence is expressed through unexpected outlets and forms at the start. He develops his personality and is able to express caring for a female and start a relationship and integrates his psyche, destroying his overpowering superego. Metaphorically expressed by the dissolution of Tyler. A beautifully aesthetically stunning crafted movie, fluid as our thougth processes are. From the start it displays a voyage through the brain's fear center. As a fable that it is, the use of special effects and creative, aggressive, edgy cinematography suspends your disbelief into a journey into a very human experience, a tale about our war. As Tyler Durden says when he puts the finger on our greed/consumerism epidemic: ""our war is a spiritual war"". Interwoven masterfully are the elements of a man's struggle with this disease and fighting our war. It never stops being an action film. The rant that Tyler delivers to the fight club, encapsulates some of the concerns the movie wants to bring the audience to brood upon. It is one of the few easy lines thrown in your lap to understand the movie and the issues brought to light. Issues related to living lives without meaning, in mechanic jobs we hate, to buy stuff conditioned by the media to, but that we really don't truly need. We've become consumer droids. Space monkeys conditioned to press buttons towards oblivion. The media offers its carrot: fame, fortune, and every Ego-booster conceivable. And if the entanglement is rooted on the ego logic, ego perception and egotistic behavior it only messes up the problem further. All reinforces the need to gain awareness of the influence of the ego. The movie doesn't wrap up nicely the majority of the answers to these questions, and throws them on your lap. This movie left me with the strong impression of watching one of the most aggressive criticisms towards the dangers of excessive consumerism, of my generation. It is difficult to believe it was made by the director of Seven and two of the most prominent actors of our generation,who put their necks on the line to express these concerns.Bravo!!",Fight Club

The film was immensely enjoyable for me, as it gave me an even closer look into the male psyche. An immeasurably blighted male psyche but, one all too typically male. It wasn't until the close of the film, when it is revealed that the whole experience was merely a lapse back and forth, much like Bipolar Disorder psychosis events, in the lead character's mind. Personally having been blessed with psychiatric illnesses, the film stabbed into my conscious for weeks on end with fear of myself moving that far into psychosis on a lengthy, violent and absent from my conscious thought processing cycle. The film is the most petrifying and fear invoking work I have yet to date witness as a psychiatric patient, myself. Incredible work to present the pre-dispositions to serious mental health issues and, a prime example of the things that can and do happen all over the world in the minds of 1 in 4 people with mental health disorders and illnesses everywhere. After only one viewing, I have not been able to view it again for worry that it will cause a setback in my own struggles in my daily life living with mental illnesses.

3075,tadams06,Celebrating Masculinity,9,2 December 2013,"Both a criticism and celebration of masculinity. The narrator (Edward Norton) looks to (Brad Pitt)Tyler Durden as an anarchic role model and takes on his nihilistic view of life.The film is gritty and displays the male primal lust for violence. This acts as an outlet or breakaway for the narrator from the stagnant regime of office work. People who have seen this film before will understand it's mastery in foreshadowing.My favourite scene is where the narrator beats up 'Angel face' a relatively handsome blonde character. The audio makes the scene brutal and the narrator is dubbed over declaring these nihilistic statements of ""I want to breathe smoke""There are lot's of messages in Fight Club, there is a sense of anti- capitalism. ""We work to earn money to buy s**t we don't need."" There is a desire for everyone to be equal ""you are the all singing all dancing c**p of the world."" There's progression from rebellion against societal expectancy that turns to terrorism. The film can be seen as a critique of totalitarianism, where people's humanities are blurred.

3081,bryanmarchese,Darkly Comedic Pain,10,11 July 2013,"A brilliant diatribe of the end of the century loss of humanity, soul and meaning in the cubicle world of ""Everyday is Exactly the Same"" existence that had been drilling itself into so many people. Fight Club was a beautiful portrait of loss of self in cathartic psychosis and art bomb civil disobedience as well as love for what we hate the most, ourselves and those that remind us the most of that. Often shrugged off as a film just about men punching each other the deep and painful understanding that as a species if we don't go a little insane about somethings and soon, it's going to get a whole lot worse than blowing up a few buildings to stop the elite few from constantly ruining the lives of the rest of society. In the extremely profound words of those involved in ""Project Mayhem"" ""We watch you sleep, we take out your trash..don't f with us"" A must see for the children and especially for family gatherings.",Fight Club

3083,naturalbornfarmer-1,Strength across the reel,10,7 October 2004,"To give a 10 to a film is something that should be done for more than just a few reasons. Thus, I don't give a 10 to just any movie I happen to like. But Fight Club has everything that a ten must have. It has a message, an intricate plot, characterization, depth, and watchability. The messages are many and mostly come in the form of social satire and broadly philosophical questions. The most flamboyant message that fuels the movie is ""how much can you know about yourself if you've never been in a fight?"". This question does not ask the question it at first seems to. The question really is, ""if you've never been in a spiritual conflict, if you've never had to stand up and defend your life and your beliefs, how can you really know anything about yourself?"". This is akin to Plato's claim that the unexamined life is hardly worth living. Intertwined with Taoistic and Marxist based chantings and existentialist background, the various voices of Fight Club do not make it easy for the viewer to see the message. Some claim it's Nihilistic, some claim it's Naizist propaganda, some claim it's a totalitarian supporting film. I see it as none of these. In the same way that people labeled Nietzsche with these terms (and incorrectly, I would argue), so have they done to Fight Club. Another reason this film is a ten is because of its depth and reviewing value. A movie that has depth can be rewatched. And with every viewing, even by the most strict viewer, something new is discovered. This is true for Fight Club. I have seen this movie over 100 times, watching it on almost a daily basis when it first came out on DVD. Even when I could recite whole chunks of the movie accurately, I was still watching the end credits having discovered a new dimension in the film. Whether it's a subtle piece of acting or a device of symbolism that was subtely placed in the many layers of the film, there is something discovered in every viewing that adds to the movie's strength. This strength is total and full. There are no weak points to the film. From the acting to the cinematography, from the symbolism to the plot twists, and from the writing to the repetition of keywords, there is a full and vibrant connection that gives every single part of the film purpose.A film like this is something that creates a new kind of film. It takes the concept of a dark comedy and makes it something that has meaning and structure. It has revived satire, as certain works in each generation do, to apply the old messages to the new situation in which we find ourselves. If there was one thing that I took away from this movie, it is this: we are not made unique or special, we are not ordained with purpose to strive for. We are only human when we make oursleves more than just the slowly decomposing bodies that we are. Paint a self-portrait, build a house, make a mark that will help mankind evolve.",Fight Club
3084,Heisenberg79,"It is the Greatest, indescribable & The BEST Movie i've ever watched",10,25 February 2016,"It's not original anymore to like this film and cinephiles often roll their eyes when they hear this film mentioned for the millionth time, but I still think Fight Club is 100% pure awesomeness! It's easy to see why this became such a cult favorite after its initial failure at the box office. It's just a very good and completely crazy film experience!Fincher directed this film with a lot of confidence and wasn't afraid to do some very strange stuff. The result is a weird, but oddly satisfying film with a lot of violence, a rebellious philosophy, three great leading performances, a plot full of odd twists, a whole bunch of memorable scenes and an occasional male genital that suddenly appears in the corner of the screen for a very quick moment.The first rule of Fight Club is to not take it too seriously, though. It may sometimes be tempting to relate to the main character's apathy and disconnection from the world and be convinced by Tyler Durden's appealing speeches against our contemporary society (especially because they contain certain inevitable truths), but at the end the film actually criticizes every single idea it has promoted during its course. Fight Club works best as a very well made satirical dark comedy. I mean, the third act must be one of the silliest things I've ever seen on a screen, but it's so well made and so hugely entertaining and freaking hilarious, that I can't help but be engaged every time I see it. It has become known as one of the greatest and most notorious endings of all time, and rightly so. It's fresh, it's cool, it's wild and it's funny as hell. This is also my favorite Fincher movie .I am not ashamed to say it out loud: I LOVE FIGHT CLUB! It's one of the most spectacular filmmaking achievements of recent years and the fact that it has now become part of our mainstream pop culture doesn't change that for me.",Fight Club
3085,vvarno,A movie misunderstood,10,3 December 2004,"To the people who see ""Fight Club"" and dismiss it as just another violent movie need to watch it closer. Or better yet, go out and read the book it is based on by Chuck Palahniuk.Warning-Spoilers includedTo say that this movie is only about a group of men who seem to enjoy beating themselves up for no reason is completely off the mark. ""Fight Club"" is in fact an examination at the lives of people who wish to release all of their anger and stress and the way that they do it. Of course, this involves beating the crap out of each other in the basement of a bar.But that is not the focal point of the movie. The true nature of the movie is revealed when Tyler, played very convincingly by Brad Pitt, pours lye on the narrators hand, who is played very well by Edward Norton. The resulting scene stays with the audience, and this is where Tyler Durden reveals what he truly wishes to do, and that is a new world order. Enter Project Mayhem.This movie is amazing if watched with an open mind. Sure it is violent, but the true story does not involve only the violence, but what is spawn as a result of the men doing this to each other and their belief in one man-Durden. 9/10",Fight Club
3086,matej_chelsea,Sorry I watched this,1,5 October 2004,"I was not going to watch this movie because the pre-views did not appeal to me and I am probably the only woman living who does NOT think that Brad Pitt is sexy. However, I have heard several people tell me what a good movie this is and more than half were women. So, it came on cable and I decided to watch it. At 2 hours, I turned it off and I was sorry that I waited that long. I kept hoping that it would get better. I understand the ""materialism is bad"" theme. I also understand the concept of Ed Norton's character having everything but feeling so lonely and depressed that he starts fight club with Brad Pitt in order to get attention and feel wanted. What I don't get is after starting the fight club, why start making bombs and blowing up buildings? So, the point that I get from this movie is that it is OK to start and/or join terrorists organizations because someone is unhappy, pathetic and generally miserable with their life. I guess that all the folks that found this movie appealing and humorous, did not have friends or love ones in the World Trade Towers or the Pentagon.

He finds hope in support groups but they are soon ruined by a girl named Marla Singer (Carter). Soon after he meets Marla, he meets Tyler Durden (Brad Pitt) and starts living with him, Tyler's view on life is that we are all bi-products of a lifestyle obsession, he believes self-improvement is a load of bull but Self-Destruction is really what we need.

The movie's philosophy on Capitalism, the monster that ultimately devours itself after eating the rest of the world, resounds strongly after several years of worldwide economic crisis.

3099,askarali-ibrahim,The amazing thought,10,21 October 2013,"In this darkly comic drama, Edward Norton stars as a depressed young man (named in the credits only as ""Narrator"") who has become a small cog in the world of big business. He doesn't like his work and gets no sense of reward from it, attempting instead to drown his sorrows by putting together the ""perfect"" apartment. He can't sleep and feels alienated from the world at large; he's become so desperate to relate to others that he's taken to visiting support groups for patients with terminal diseases so that he'll have people to talk to. One day on a business flight, he discovers Tyler Durden (Brad Pitt), a charming iconoclast who sells soap. Tyler doesn't put much stock in the materialistic world, and he believes that one can learn a great deal through pain, misfortune, and chaos. Tyler cheerfully challenges his new friend to a fight. Our Narrator finds that bare-knuckle brawling makes him feel more alive than he has in years, and soon the two become friends and roommates, meeting informally to fight once a week. As more men join in, the ""fight club"" becomes an underground sensation, even though it's a closely guarded secret among the participants. (First rule: Don't talk about fight club. Second rule: Don't talk about fight club.) But as our Narrator and Tyler bond through violence, a strange situation becomes more complicated when Tyler becomes involved with Marla (Helena Bonham Carter), whom our Narrator became infatuated with when they were both crashing the support-group circuit.

3102,Forestprimeval,"Brightly inventive, great acting, a volcano of hyper-creativity about ordinary people, and The TRUTH.",10,17 October 2005,"I chose this as the best film I'd ever seen for two reasons: the script and the acting, both of which are without peer. We've come to expect greatness from Edward Norton, who can make us gasp with the slightest change in the blood vessels of his eyeball, but Brad Pitt provides Norton with the perfect acting foil. This film demonstrates why Pitt needs better scripts, because it proves he is in the top tier of American actors. He needs to stop hanging around Clooney (although after ""Good Night and Good Luck"" we may all be rooting for Clooney to get writing and directing Oscars) and start seeking out non-genre scripts. Working together cemented a close friendship between Norton and Pitt -- it's a compliment to both to say that they deserve each other. The movie is hilarious and dead serious and a sharpshooter when it comes to urban male psychology. I'll bet you can't watch it just once! You'll want to watch it the second time with the subtitles on, just to make sure you get all the verbal sorcery. What great dialog! Some people are afraid of this movie because of the fight scenes, which are indeed realistic and bloody, but that commitment not to soften or dumb down the film is completely right and part of what makes this such an intelligent, watchable, and, finally, a ""moral"" film that occupies the ethical high ground without going anywhere near the pulpit.

3106,markellats06,Why Fight Club is the greatest movie of all time,10,26 November 2014,"I wasn't really into movies until my brother showed me Fight Club. I was so influenced by that movie, I loved cinema on the whole. Yet, it still remains me favorite movie. Tyler is by far the most amazing character ever invented. He is so crazy, yet genius, so wild, yet percipient, so vain, yet altruistic. Moreover ,I believe that Brad Pitt was absolutely the right guy to play Tyler. Apart from his undoubtable acting skills, he is an astonishingly handsome man and especially at the time the movie was made ,he was fire hot. In my opinion ,that man on that role was the rightest choice ever made and the result the sexiest thing I have ever seen in my entire life. Not to mention the unbelievable Edwart Norton, whose acting is flawless. I consider Norton to be one of the most gifted actors of the last decades. Just to give you the idea ,the first time I was watching the movie (and as I said having seen less than 10 movies in my whole life) when I saw the scene in the beginning where the Narrator is lying on the couch ,watching TV because he is unable to sleep ,I told my brother ""This guy here can act"". And of course ,such a movie wouldn't been successful without director David Fincher. It's more than obvious that he worked on every detail until everything was made the way he wanted it to. And the outcome was really of unimpeachable greatness. This movie is extremely influencing and I feel sorry for every person who is beyond 18 and hasn't seen it. It radically changed the way I see the world. After listening to Tyler's revolutionary opinions that even the Narrator, the personification of an ordinary man, can't refute, I realized how things are from the opposite perspective.

3108,bfitz2484,Fight Club's Cinematography,10,28 September 2017,"Fight Club, a confrontational, fierce, often ruthless parody is a mental thriller that follows the life of two apparent antagonists which almost fully echoes the narrative of the respectable Dr. Jekyll and the formidable Mr. Hyde, being that they are the same person, David Fincher externalizes an alter ego in a unique filmmaking style. The setup of the scenes also accommodated the emotions of the actors. Fight Club employs numerous styles of lighting that are used throughout the film depending on the mood and emotions felt at the time. By using low-key lighting, the scenes that are filmed in the basement emphasize the vibe that's felt in the room. This is also used when Tyler is alone, or Tyler and Jack together to portray an overall darkness, by creating higher saturation, a higher contrast, and heavier shadows. This helps characterize Tyler as highly masculine and having a perilous personality. Conversely, with Jack, we noticed the lighting is more high-key, often with low contrast and little to no shadows. This helps describe the narrator's consumeristic personality and mundane life. However, it is evident that Finch chose to utilize the tone and mood of low-key lighting more throughout the film, while both types of lighting appeared throughout. Nonetheless, on the off chance that the unmistakable difference in lighting was not used, the emotional distinction amongst Tyler and Jack's identities would not have been as apparent. Despite the fact that it is an extremely stylized approach, the lighting of the film, still somewhat seems sensible. The locations chosen accompanied their own inherent lightning. Examples include streetlights for backlighting, and fluorescents, which illuminated an off-color hue, that was cold and suits the tone. This is what created the realistic effect of the differentiating miss en scène used amongst character's and settings, and emerged as clues for the narrator's different identities. The placement and angle of the camera also played a critical role in the cinematography and guided the perception of the audience. The filmmaker chose to shoot most of the scenes in which the actors in close proximity of each other. This includes shots that were intimate, personal, and social. Fincher also utilizes camera angles to differentiate the contrasting personalities. When Tyler and the members of fight club are in the basement, Tyler is in the middle of a low angle shot. This type of camera angle is used to show us that he is the authoritative member in which everyone admires. Another scene in which Tyler, with his abettors behind him, is in a close-up after they jump an official. This suggests power and dominance over the audience while allowing us to feel how threatened and scared the official must be. Another brilliant example of the cinematography and editing coming intertwined with each other was when jack brutally beats up a member during a fight. Again, this was another low angle shot chosen by the filmmakers. The placement of the camera forces us to look upwards at him, all the while making him seem more capable and deliberating. The filmmakers chose this angle to make the viewer cringe at this intense moment. We also notice that the camera is often stationary during many of the scenes in the first half of the film. But as we go on, the camera starts to position itself as a first-person view of the character. This is another clue given to us that Tyler and Jack are the same person. David Fincher chose these various camera angles, lighting, and colors as a technique to deliver the audience clues, crucial information, and hidden motives throughout the film.",Fight Club

Not enough can be said about this film; its style and music set the tone in a way that echoes the vibes of the novel to near perfection.Most people would not see the film as a love story, but is in fact self described by the author as a ""modern day Great Gatsby.""

Carter has been casted perfectly for the role of the damaged girl damsel, and she delivers on every level.Timing is everything, and Marla forces herself into the insomniac Narrator's life (Norton)at his various weekly support groups, a community he has found to seek some sort of solace. Her presence ruins these meetings for him, which is when he meets Tyler and discovers fight club -- a different type of therapy. The fight club, and the relationship between these three characters and the world that surrounds them, undergoes a twisting journey that becomes more than could ever be expected. Their narrative, not unlike Gatsby, provides the context and examination of modern society and American values in the form of a psychological thriller that is certain to raise questions, eyebrows, and testosterone levels whenever watched.Enjoy this movie, just be careful who you talk to about it.",Fight Club
3112,sophieturner1-691-171001,amazing,10,19 August 2013,"this is one of the best films i have seen in years, the plot twists the whole way through and it is amazing, just watch it, you will enjoy it, and it has brad Pitt in it. brad Pitt is a legend plus he is gorgeous so you get some eye candy as well. it is just so so so good, i don't recommend it as a family film though and it is not for people under the age of 13 probably 15 although i first saw it when i was 14 and i'm still sane :) happy days, just watch it, its so good, you may even need to watch it more than once to fully understand it (like Inception) although its nothing like inception (inception is another one of my favourite films) so enjoy the film :)",Fight Club
3113,jeanfrancoislab,great movie,9,4 January 2016,"This movie is great. it's refreshing. the actors in that movie are superb even with the secondary cast. Brad Pitt and Edward Norton are sensational. This is a new kind of movie for the 90's/2000's. nice cgi and effects for the time as we rarely notice they are special effects. I would love a sequel to this movie even if it's almost impossible to do without destroying this piece of art.Jared leto and ""Bob"" are my most remembered characters from the movie as the are interesting....... in their own ways.the environment is also interesting, it gives a special and magical energy to the script.I hope you all enjoy that movie.",Fight Club
3114,bagleyc,An intellectual thrill ride that has a sense of dark comedy where the movie know what it is.,10,23 March 2014,"This movie is directed beautifully by David Fincher and screenplay by Jim Uhls. It follows the story of a man who hates who he is and is bored of being average, his severe case of insomnia doesn't help. To help his dignity and boredom he is a huge consumer and buys any piece of furniture he feels is unique. He starts going to self help meetings about different diseases and illnesses but he doesn't have any of them. He just goes and cry's there because it helps his insomnia. Although when he meets this woman there, Marla Singer, it stops working. He goes back to being an insomniac and he's miserable again. But when returning from a business trip he meets Tyler Durden, (Brad Pitt). They start talking and Tyler gives him his card. But when The Narrator's apartment blows up he has nowhere to go and he calls Tyler. He moves in with him and they become friends. They start fighting behind a bar just because it's fun and when a couple of guys join they seemingly create Fight Club. Fight Club is a cult like nightly venue where people just punch and get punched and the only rule is ""Don't talk about fight club' but when The Narrator's sanity comes into play and Tyler starts keeping secrets and talking about this ""Project Mayhem"" things go downhill.Now this movie is a amazing and very unique. The tone and dark comedy of this movie is perfect and it's an exhilarating, mind bending thrill ride. I highly recommend David Fincher's Fight Club starring Edward Norton and Brad Pitt.

Not one person could have guessed what was actually going on unless they were told or visited Mrs. Cleo (Remember her ""and don't marry dat fat mon, he only want you fo your money girl"") before the film. Norton and Pitt nailed their roles and even took it as far as making you think the wrong things about the character. What really impressed me what the cinematography. It was beautiful and amazing. At time it reminded me of the things that ""The Matrix"" could have done had they pushed not only their imagination's, but their limitation's. The camera took us places we had never been before. It was like a ride at a theme park. Story = Amazing, Acting = superb and the filming itself = innovative and exciting. I give it 2 thumbs and 2 big toes up.

I'm glad I eventually took time to see it, because this is a film with a message that shoots straight to the heart of the problem with modern society. If you want to know why people walk into schools and malls and start shooting. This movie may give some insight. Fight Club is about a character lost in the corporate grind. Loosing himself with every email sent. Loosing himself with every report filed. Loosing himself to the tune of a copy machine. This leads him to found a club for men only. A fight club where men can find what it is to be human again. Through pain they break from the corporate treadmill and feel again.",Fight Club
3117,vorachoncostumestyling,Fabulously Shot,8,7 February 2014,Lovely movie that picks at your brain. Great cinematic effects with superb performances. One of Brad Pitt's best. Helena Bonham Carter as usual is in her prime performing on screen. Subtle contemporary costume design and marvelous editing. Extremely hesitant of watching this movie but decided to pop it in one day. Very great movie but not exactly one of my favorites. Entertaining enough but definitely not something of my usual taste! Edward Norton is also not to be unnoticed. Far from what I expect with a twist on character arches. Personally I thought this literally would be a movie about fighting. However I learned more about the complexities of the mind through each chapter of this picture.,Fight Club
3118,bayremjb,"Bayrem Father, I failed you Jbali",6,7 August 2015,"""Fight Club"" is the most frankly and cheerfully fascist big-star movie since ""Death Wish,"" a celebration of violence in which the heroes write themselves a license to drink, smoke, screw and beat one another up. t's at about this point that the movie stops being smart and savage and witty, and turns to some of the most brutal, unremitting, nonstop violence ever filmed. Although sensible people know that if you hit someone with an ungloved hand hard enough, you're going to end up with broken bones, the guys in ""Fight Club"" have fists of steel, and hammer one another while the sound effects guys beat the hell out of Naugahyde sofas with Ping-Pong paddles. Later, the movie takes still another turn. A lot of recent films seem unsatisfied unless they can add final scenes that redefine the reality of everything that has gone before; call it the Keyser Soze syndrome.What is all this about? According to Durden, it is about freeing yourself from the shackles of modern life, which imprisons and emasculates men. By being willing to give and receive pain and risk death, Fight Club members find freedom. Movies like ""Crash"" (1997), must play like cartoons for Durden. He's a shadowy, charismatic figure, able to inspire a legion of men in big cities to descend into the secret cellars of a Fight Club and beat one another up.",Fight Club

It's funny as well don't think it's meant to be funny but i was laughing. Its smart the way they made money out of fat.

It's very confusing but some will see what I mean if they have not watched it yet.If you agree with me, write a review, it's on my top 3, with American history x and requiem for a dream alongside it -- those movies are also really good watches as well.For anyone interested in a wake-up call movie or a brain teaser, this is for you, so, take an extra 2-3 hours out of your day and give this movie a watch as you won't regret it.",Fight Club

I caught it again a few months later on t.v. of course like all movies it was (butchered) so it would be ""clean"" enough for the general viewing audience. However, this time I was much more into the movie than before. I thought Marla was too out there for my taste (and she is still a bit ""out there"") I was much more engaged this time around and decided that I would rent the movie when I had time. I was able to see the unedited version a few weeks later and I loved it. Many people just see the title and dismiss it as some dumb fighting movie, but it is a statement of the feminization of the male gender. While most woman (myself included) like the idea of the ""sensitive guy"" men aren't programed that way and this film expounds on that. Some of the best parts are when stuff starts to blow up (and who doesn't like stuff blowing up? ;) ) the anger at the world is truly (and quite justly) felt. It is not just blowing up stuff, but it is a political statement of a generation's repression.",Fight Club

3125,treeanfo,"Horrible Film, Really awful. Just bad.",1,8 October 2013,"This film, has to be different then the book. I notice the production cost and theater gross are way off. Which is what makes the most sense of this film. This makes Kubricks 2001, a Masterpiece. Criminals should have time taken off their sentence, if they can sit through this more then once. Some great movies do need to be seen 2 or 3 times to understand everything, and it is worth it. Obviously not this. Someone thought they were being real dynamic, deep, brilliant putting this ""thing"" together. When they were on LSD it seemed like the answer to the meaning of life. When they came down it was silly nonsense. Too late, the film was ""in the can"". It belongs in an ashcan. I am sure there are many people who put this in a cult classic category. They are on drugs, and not even watching it. The film actually would have been much better, if it was another underground fight movie, without the way overboard trying to be deep and multi faceted art. It is not. The High School chemistry did nothing to help the film. The subliminal message before the credits, was probably aimed at people who spent money to see it.

The whole movie is fabulous, and the fact that there is a mind-screwing plot that you don't realize until the end is absolutely amazing. While you feel you understand the movie from start to finish, you get completely set back near the end and have to rethink what is really true about the film.Both actors Norton and Pitt were wonderful for the roles, and I feel like Norton played a perfectly insane person; it was amazing.",Fight Club

But after you start watching, you realize it's definitely not!Brad Pitt takes definition of ''cool'' to whole new level. Fine piece of acting. And Edward Norton...

It seems rare to me whom leaves the projection without a raw desire of 'destroying something beautiful' and grabbing more hours of sleep. Today is commonly known the twist in the plot. It is used widely as an example for young filmmakers. Anyone who pretend to be someone in the film industry must see this beautiful example of storytelling.

The director and the director of photography also did a wonderful job...I love the scenes in the abandoned buildings...They add to the darkness of the film. This film is unmatched in it's performance and in a class all by itself. The gritty film noir type has been copied, but never duplicated. The dual personality of the lead actor was delivered wonderfully as was the supporting actor. Brad Pitt delivers a stellar performance and makes us believe there is actually another person in the movie when there was not. The only other film I can think of that pulled this off was ""Sixth Sense"" with Bruce Willis.",Fight Club

Watch it alone.Watch it 2 or 3 times, if necessary, because after the end you see it different. Its just like something was going on the whole movie you didn't notice.

It stars with with the last act of the film but then takes us back to the star. We see the Narrator and he tell us about how he has insomnia which has taken a toll on his mentality making him look lifeless and tired. He works for an automotive company with means he has to travel all the time and record wrecked cars from accidents. On one of his travels he mets Tyler Durden, a free spirited guy with a disdain for consumerism and confirmative society. He's views and ideas are appealing to the Narrator and circumstances lead them to live together. After a short time, they started a club where men from different walks of life can join and in this club, members fight each other one on one till one surrenders. Firstly, I would like to say that is one of the best story in film. The script is one the smartest I've ever seen. The first act feels like a dream like world with The Narrator's smooth, simple description of the events of his life. Personally, I could related very well to him, during the time in which I first saw the movie, I was in the midst of an insomniac phase similar to the Narrator. I watched the movie movie with some of my friends and saw them getting lost as the movie progresses. They were expecting some brain dead action flick that has Brad Pitt in it. All of them dose of eventually while I was left glued to the spectacle of events that transitions in the movie. Tyler Durden, Brad's character is such a memorable guy that makes him seem larger than live. The lines in he delivers are absolutely brilliant and make you question the norms of life and exactly how absurd they really are for example "" We're consumers. We are byproducts of a lifestyle obsession "". His view's made us question our life goals and how much of what we do is just society telling us we should do. This is the power of this movie. And when I said earlier that it's not a brainless action movie that doesn't this movie is a bore fess. Its a very intriguing with mixture of action, psychological thriller, comedy(the humor is frequent and well done) and mystery. There are a few questions I had that were answered at the end. Overall, this movie is deserving of the people's praises and cemented David Fincher as a brilliant, unique director who brings a tone and look to this film which complements the story well. The movie cinematography looks awesome and I couldn't believe it came out in 1099 it look more like a 2010's movie.

It is this fact that urged me to actually give it a try a couple of years ago and I got halfway through (roughly) and gave up. Last week though I gave it a second shot, and watched it in it's entirety this time around. What I saw wasn't bad but I found myself curious why this movie gets so much praise.The performances were good, although I think Ed Norton was somewhat incoherent at times of narration. I have no problem with the acting shown here, and I also think as a piece of cinema it is well shot, with good direction. This isn't an entirely negative review.I must, however, stop the praise here. I think this movie gets more praise than it deserves, and honestly I think it may be in-part down to the cast. Ed Norton was endearing himself to a lot of people at this time and Brad Pitt has always been a massive name, and is an excellent actor.Where this movie falls down for me is, it doesn't seem to go anywhere. The story is shown in such a way that I felt like it was merely an excuse to show violence at times. Sure, anyone watching a movie called Fight Club surely can't be shocked at some violence, but I saw it as essential to the driving of the movie rather than the additional section I feel it was meant to be.I also didn't feel like the movie went anywhere in particular. I know it has a plot and it comes to a conclusion, but it never felt like I cared about the ending, a 'twist' that was pretty obvious from early on in the movie, at least for me.I'm not completely slating this movie, as stated above, it has it's merits.

For those of us whose idea of the perfect life was not birthed at the likes of IKEA going home was easy enough but I have to wonder how many people who watched Fight Club went home and kicked their mundane ambitions and style of living curbside. Fight Club is a film that people take literally from screen to heart to home to the mirror asking all the right questions. It is a rare achievement for any film to be embraced by viewers to this degree of cult film devotion. Overrated? Absolutely not! I give this film five stars and a ten because it didn't just linger it invaded the way that people thought about being possessed by one's own possessions and the how and why we eventually surrender to social stigmas and parental direction over our own dreams.

Edward Norton shows emotionally cold man who is emotional vampire and sucks true emotions from other people. The film shows that most of us have no emotions, just crave things (better car, furniture, mobile). Excellent soundtrack - best song at the end: Pixies - Where is my mind!! Maybe this film gave the idea to the terrorists that attacked the Twin Towers = explode just a single building, where the leading financial information and the USA is over! ...and you open the door and you step inside we're inside our hearts now imagine your pain is a white ball of healing light that's right, feel your pain, the pain itself, is a white ball of healing light i don't think so...",Fight Club

It's a classic that is a must see!The story line was very creative and original, it had a mind boggling twist to it, and was a very exciting movie that was very enjoyable to watch.I did not ever read the novel so I can not compare it to the original novel, but the screenplay was written beautifully. They did a wonderful job of portraying exactly what they wanted and Brad Pitt and Edward Norton were the perfect actors for their partsI would recommend this movie to anyone who has not seen it.

I think the only reason I loved the movie was getting in the mind frame of putting it as a separate entity from Chuck Palahniuk's novel. In comparison Brad Pitt definitely took the character and ran with it making it his own. If you have not read the book I highly recommend it. I recommend anything from Chuck Palahniuk! Fight Club (the movie) is one of my all time favorites and has become a cult classic. The following and the message are edgy and fun. Helena Bonham Carter and Edward Norton are incredible together and the fight scenes are satisfying. The only thing I wish there was more of, was details with the actual missions of project mayhem. I also would have liked a little more of the psyche of Tyler Durden. Great Character development and twists. The plot was outstanding. Palahniuk's brain is a dirty masterpiece!!!",Fight Club
3149,mustafaozlu,Mock Cinema,9,28 February 2021,"Yes, there is now a concept called mock cinema. Facing its realities in mockery and spreading it to times when moral values are meaningless ... Many commentators devalue the film by dwelling on stupid things. Acting, flow, plot, visuality and technique are blended extremely well. Crowned with an end that makes the realities made possible for all, impossible. This makes the movie more attractive. I would give full points if there weren't some broken transitions. Regardless, it is an excellent work.",Fight Club

Not to take anything away from Chuck Palahniuk's original novel, this movie is just simply amazing.The screenplay, editing, music, performances, rhythm, and vibe of the film stroke of chord of beauty. They really hit gold with this motion picture adaptation.I keep coming back to watch this as I age and although my general take on the dark message of the film is fairly consistent, I have an evolving and maturing appreciation for it.

In my opinion, the point of Fight Club is to make you ask the right questions rather than giving you the answers directly. The only difficulty one faces when experiencing Fight Club is keeping track of all the subjects it tackles. One can't help ask oneself whether the movie really means to approach all this topics or is one reading too much into it. Well, I can assure whoever may ask that question that there is no doubt that every single line and act of this particular film is there on purpose and for the particular purpose of tackling all those subjects. All in all, if watched correctly this movie can be a life changer.",Fight Club

So we watched scene by scene on DVD and found starbucks in every scene except a couple. I found this type of advertising very strange and was wondering to hear your opinions on it. There are some scenes where there isn't a cup of starbucks and its not like a cup is there the whole scene either. It is more like you will see it once in the scene then you might not see it again.

I give movies a 10 because they are so kick razz that I watched them 100 times and I still love each viewing.Ratings are really relative to the personality of the viewer and/or reviewer. Fight Club is superbly made with the awesome Edward Norton whose alter-ego/second personality is Brad Pitt.They start bad razz clubs underneath bars for men to kick the living crap out of each other to attain some relief. How awesome is that? I won't spoil it too much, but I did give warning. I'm going to skip over most of the surprises within the movie, but will say that Meatloaf has a nice rack.Lastly I do want to say that a weird cult that starts taking down corporate overlords is totally awesome.

Theme of the movie is that in the modern age people are slaves of the system and they have no freedom for pursuing what they desire.They have to walk on the guidelines of the society and at last die. The hero is actually shown suffering from some sort of personality disorder but on the other way around it shows that due to his dull life life he has got no real friend and he enjoys his own company by hanging out by himself.Its the dilemma of modern age.",Fight Club
3160,madinpoland,An engaging and gripping ride that rarely lets up and shines with humor and style,10,15 December 2013,"The action and intensity of Fight Club (1999) starts immediately and rarely lets up throughout this captivating and thrilling ride. The unnamed Narrator (Edward Norton) suffers from insomnia and after his failed attempts to seek medical attention to help him sleep, he finds his treatment in support groups for people suffering from life threatening illnesses. Although not suffering from cancer himself, the Narrator finds himself able to sleep because he's able to cry and release himself during these group meetings. His ability to cry at these groups and in turn the ability to sleep is all but ruined when Marla Singer (Helena Bonham Carter) forces him to stop attending the meetings. The frequent use of voice-over narration is used ""as an expository device to convey necessary background information"" (Boggs & Petrie, 2008, p. 275) throughout the film. A young professional who's a slave to material possessions and expensive lifestyle works as a Recall Coordinator by day and his very existence has been in buying things he thinks he needs and that will complete him. While away on travel, the Narrator, still suffering from insomnia, meets Tyler Durden (Brad Pitt) and exchanges contact information that later leads the Narrator to a complete lifestyle transformation. The newly discovered therapy eventually becomes the underground boxing arena known as Fight Club that exists only during certain hours and is something nobody's supposed to talk about.The distorted and often industrial sounds give a glimpse into the troubled mind of the Narrator unlike any other (Boggs & Petrie, 2008). The growth of Fight Club from an every Saturday meeting, turns into a nightly club spanning the country which takes form and evolves into something much more with plans to destroy the current social and economic system that Fight Club denounces. The action scenes literally provide an explosive and awe inspiring reaction on all fronts in addition to gruesome and visceral fighting scenes. The low-lighting in the grimy basements focus the attention solely on the action in the center and the bone-crunching sounds of men fighting provide frightening realism. Only after the Narrator's struggle to contain what he's started does the choice come for him to make a decision that will ultimately define his and Marla's life for the future. A gripping, stylish, and very cerebral ride through the senses can be likened to the film Pulp Fiction by Quentin Tarantino. The dark humor and ironic themes prevalent throughout take charge in a film that provides a somewhat eclectic timeline but still organized structure and emphasis on action and spoken dialogue. Fight Club will demand multiple viewings not just to fully grasp the story, but to experience the timeless mastering of an all out assault on the senses. By realizing that the possessions the Narrator worked so hard to own end up owning him, Fight Club encourages, inspires, and provokes thought that give the audience an interesting and unique perspective that will not be forgotten.

The whole plot line and the way it was directed made this movie what it is. I loved it. This movie has a lot of different twists and turns to it as well so you really have to pay attention to what is happening other wise you will get lost and have to watch it all over again, but believe me you wont regret it.

3167,polish56,Great Movie,9,11 January 2014,"In this darkly comic drama, Edward Norton stars as a depressed young man (named in the credits only as ""Narrator"") who has become a small cog in the world of big business. He doesn't like his work and gets no sense of reward from it, attempting instead to drown his sorrows by putting together the ""perfect"" apartment. He can't sleep and feels alienated from the world at large; he's become so desperate to relate to others that he's taken to visiting support groups for patients with terminal diseases so that he'll have people to talk to. One day on a business flight, he discovers Tyler Durden (Brad Pitt), a charming iconoclast who sells soap. Tyler doesn't put much stock in the materialistic world, and he believes that one can learn a great deal through pain, misfortune, and chaos. Tyler cheerfully challenges his new friend to a fight. Our Narrator finds that bare-knuckle brawling makes him feel more alive than he has in years, and soon the two become friends and roommates, meeting informally to fight once a week. As more men join in, the ""fight club"" becomes an underground sensation, even though it's a closely guarded secret among the participants. (First rule: Don't talk about fight club. Second rule: Don't talk about fight club.) But as our Narrator and Tyler bond through violence, a strange situation becomes more complicated when Tyler becomes involved with Marla (Helena Bonham Carter), whom our Narrator became infatuated with when they were both crashing the support-group circuit. Based on the novel by Chuck Palahniuk, Fight Club was directed by David Fincher, who previously directed Pitt in the thriller Seven.Great movie to watch 10/10",Fight Club

Before to see it, I thought that Brad Pitt was only a sissy that only makes films for girl's pleasure, but all my mind changed with his interpretation in this movie.When I read the title, I thought ""OK, another stupid American movie with no script and based only in the violence"", but if you watch the first 15 minutes, you will be getting catched little by little by the strange but amazing story.One of the best movies I've seen in all my life",Fight Club
3169,senukezxc,cool movie,8,12 January 2014,"Fight Club is multi-faceted movie about a man who is deeply unsatisfied with his life in the modern age, even with all the trappings of success that much of our society is based on, and decides to go off the beaten path to find his own personal satisfaction. From that point on the movie spirals out of control and into the abyss. This is a good thing. The movie holds many meanings and shows the characters in favorable and unfavorable ways. It does not try to cast things in a typical good and evil view point, nor does it say whether the choices the protagonist and the rest of the cast make are sound ones. One of the things it does do is look into the nature of our past, viewing the structure of our society and analyzing why we do what we do to live. It isn't until the narrator (Edward Norton) begins to destroy himself that he finally comes to realize what matters to him. That is when he meets two important characters, Marla Singer and Tyler Durden. It is during this time that the narrator escapes from his normal life by hosting with Tyler an underground fight club that evolved from the two just fighting outside of a local bar. Taking in Tyler's view on life, which is somewhat refreshing and scary at the same time, they form a close bond strongly resembling a married couple. The two do everything together and the narrator begins to emulate Tyler more and more, all the while the fight club grows stronger and stronger until it has become this cult-like phenomenon with Tyler and the narrator as leaders making rules for conducting fight club. Anarchy and non-conformity is their message, which I believe is meant to underscore the irony of fight club and their non-conformist, fight the man attitude. As the group evolves into something more dangerous, this irony becomes more apparent in the way those who once questioned the established authority, now blindly follow their ""non-conformist"" new group. Its been a little over a decade since Fight Club ""enlightened"" me, but it still gives me the same conflicting feelings about its message and the nature of humanity in general. There are those who would take it at its face value and see nothing but frustrated, grown men beating each other senselessly, and that's a shame because there is definitely much more going on then that. David Fincher has crafted an excellent movie: it's disgustingly stylish in its execution...almost too much, if that's possible. The sound track, done by the Dust Brothers burrowed it's way into my brain and never left. The movie would not be the same without it. As far as the actors performances, Ed Norton and Brad Pitt both have a strong rapport and the scenes come off naturally, while Helena Bonham Carter's Marla is hauntingly tragic, and filled with a desperate, but subtle sadness to her. At the time of the original screening this movie polarized people into the two camps of love or hate, due to it's ability to offended or amaze, but I wouldn't have it any other way",Fight Club

This combined with the large numbers of great actors makes this one of my personal favorites. I highly suggest that anyone who hasn't watched this movie to give it a chance. Among my favorite scenes were the ones involving Tyler speaking about his father while taking a bath, and the scene where he is addressing the members of fight club saying how a whole generation is stuck pumping gas and wasting their lives.

The characters added a sense of relatable drive to break free from oppression and dogma. From coloring to acting this film has it all. As Brad Pitt helps us connect to our rebellious teen years of anarchy and free spirited living, we find ourselves disgusted with who we have become as adults, selling out to the world machine we once fought. An underground fight club full of misfits and desk jockeys should help us find the internal conflict of conformity and going against the grain.

If you like this movie you should also watch clockwork Orange, 12 monkeys, good will hunting, Amelie plain and others. I think one of the greatest things this movie successfully accomplishes is forcing the audience to reflect upon their own lives and take stock of their own goals and passions. the author is very clever in using some of his own experiences with looking hurt and society's narrow minded superficial judgment of people to create a master piece of modern times.

3180,nevtonmotta,Great!,10,15 May 2014,"Dat plot twist!The Roman Empire (Latin: Imperium Romanum) was the post-Republican period of the ancient Roman civilization, characterized by an autocratic form of government and large territorial holdings around the Mediterranean Sea in Europe, Africa, and Asia. The 500-year-old Roman Republic, which preceded it, had been destabilized through a series of civil wars. Several events marked the transition from Republic to Empire, including Julius Caesar's appointment as perpetual dictator (44 BC); the Battle of Actium (31 BC); and the granting of the honorific Augustus to Octavian by the Roman Senate (27 BC). The first two centuries of the Empire were a period of unprecedented stability and prosperity known as the Pax Romana (""Roman Peace""). It reached its greatest expanse during the reign of Trajan (98–117 AD). In the 3rd century, the Empire underwent a crisis that threatened its existence, but was reunified and stabilized under the emperors Aurelian and Diocletian. Christians rose to power in the 4th century, during which time a system of dual rule was developed in the Latin West and Greek East. After the collapse of central government in the West in the 5th century, the eastern half of the Roman Empire continued as what would later be known as the Byzantine Empire. Because of the Empire's vast extent and long endurance, the institutions and culture of Rome had a profound and lasting influence on the development of language, religion, architecture, philosophy, law, and forms of government in the territory it governed, particularly Europe, and by means of European expansionism throughout the modern world.",Fight Club

3186,sonkamblemanish13,Revolutionary !,10,16 August 2015,"Fight Club is a 1999 film directed by David Fincher. This movie is based on a novel of the same name written by Chuck Palahniuk. So the movie stars Edward Norton-the narrator who's pretty much an average schlub. The guy works in an office, hates his job, has a miserable life. If he was in a crowd, you'd never be able to pick him out. He doesn't stand out at all. Then he meets Tyler Durden(Brad Pitt) and his life completely changes. Tyler Durden is one of the coolest people ever put in movies. If nothing else, Tyler Durden's chaos. He's free in so many ways regular people aren't. So the first time they hang out together Tyler asks the narrator to hit him as hard as he can. And that leads to a fight. Narrator enjoys it and they both decide to do it again.Once as they are fighting as usual, people gather around them eager to participate in fights. This small group slowly starts expanding with more and more people joining with time. Tyler names this group as ""fight club"".People sick of their regular life, their jobs, responsibilities fight other guys in the club to get rid of the frustration. This club becomes a sensation and starts developing branches everywhere in the city. Tyler's philosophy of life is - Let the chips fall where they may. That we need to stop trying to control things and just let go. He criticizes all the pretentious and useless things people do in their life to impress people they don't know. He believes that we don't need the jobs we hate to buy things we don't actually need. So he plans to destroy empty buildings in the city to set them free from their miserable ostentatious life. He strongly believes that once you loose everything, you're free to do anything.The movie holds a mirror to the society and shows them how they look and how ridiculous it is. It has all the characteristic fincher trademarks like smooth camera pans, a cool colour palette, nihilism, ambient music. The camera-work is extraordinary. The background score by the dust brothers makes the movie scenes much more intriguing. This was probably the best role of Brad Pitt till date. Edward Norton and Helena Bonham Carter acted really well.",Fight Club

It is a prophetic warning of sorts.. it is screaming in your face - wake up and take a look around you. Coz if you are not disturbed, then you are just not paying attention!

If you want to learn more about Chuck or authors like Chuck you can go to his website www.thecult.net.

I started working out the next day, started reading politics books, became interested in all sorts of anti-corporate protests,and bought all Palahniuk books i could find. Since then i've turned 4 others into fight club addicts. I think this movie really pushes u to do something with ur life or do nothing at all.Teaches u to be brave and always look things with guts.I find the movie to be an incredible experience for any teen and anybody who has taken his life for granted. It shows part of our society and our human nature many had ignored and it serves as a warning for the world and life style some are trying to impose on us.""We are not beautiful and unique snow flakes"".People in modern societies have so many useless items of comfort,that we are distracted from the meaning of life.

Some of the subjects they touched upon and delved into head first opened my eyes. The acting was above par to anything I had ever seen before. Brad Pitt as Tyler Durden displayed some kind of youthful exuberance which will most likely never be seen again. Eward Norton's portrayal of a man heading down the path to an implosion was utterly believable. Only after seeing the film did I realize that all the people trapped in the towers are just like Jack.

It blows other movies out of the water because of its amazing cinematography, brilliant acting, and unique script. Edward Norton, Brad Pitt and Helena Bonham Carter are brilliant. This film makes up its own rules and is a leader not a follower. The reason there aren't any other movies out there like this is because nobody was smart enough to come up with anything like it before, and nobody has the talent to mimic it now. Your genre may be comedy, it may be tragedy, but I have never met anybody who genuinely hates this movie. Once you see this movie, you'll never think the same again.

3200,d-spithoven,I very like this!,9,29 September 2016,"When I first saw the previews for this movie, it had me interested. A movie about guys who fight - it didn't seem to deep, but I thought it would provide entertainment. I had heard buzz about, a few of my friends raved about it for a few days, and I was convinced. I should see this movie. I went to my local video store and picked up the last remaining DVD. I popped it in, sat in amazement until the last credit rolled, and then watched it again. And again. And again.This movie is dark and disturbing, however, it is equally smart and stylistic. I found it hard to watch at points, but I couldn't turn my eyes away. Fight Club makes many bold statements against the modern consumer-driven society, and produces Norton's best performance and Pitt's second best (12 Monkeys).Norton plays an average-Joe who is living a dead-end life. He needs something to change his life. Tyler and Marla will take care of this, and that is all I want to give away. Other comments will tell you more, but I suggest you let it all sink in while watching. As for it's ending, it doesn't rival 'The Sixth Sense' - it blows it away. One of the best movie endings I've seen. Even better if you're a Pixies fan.As for it being important, don't worry. You will be hearing about this movie. When 'A Clockwork Orange' came out, it was met with mixed reviews, deemed too dark and violent, and is now considered a classic. These two movies share quite a bit in common - both were based on great books. If you haven't read either, get to it. Politicians will use this movie as a demonstration of careless and consequenceless violence in movies, and as a perfect example of what today's youth are being influenced by.",Fight Club

Arguably David Fincher's best movie for a multitude of reasons, namely that sweet blend of dark humor, violence, and bad-ass performances by the actors.Cinematography is great, even though the special effects are sometimes questionable/dizzying/cheesy, it never seems to bother me; call me nostalgic, I think it just adds to the overall flavor of the film.People kinda either hate or love this movie.

This movie made me take a thought provoking look at my life and assess what really matters, and take notice of how easy it is to get caught up in the maze of the rat race routine. It was one of the first movies I had seen that really grabbed me, and blew my mind with the plot twist. I liked the statements it made about financial institutions and the corruption of government, bringing attention to the people who are the ones that make everything run, while without them, corporations and government wouldn't be able to function.

3209,stratoaxe,An Intruguing Mind Trip,7,27 July 2005,"Basic Rundown of My Score-Sound-8 Visuals-7.5 Plot-7.5 Acting-7.5Score-7.5Let me start out by saying Fight Club is neither completely about fighting or Brad Pitt. Keep in mind that this is more of a movie about Norton's character, the Narrator, and his discontentment with an every-day middle-class American lifestyle. Not only does Norton play this character with skill, he provides a mindset most everyone can relate too. The basic plot line in Fight Club (as basic as I can make it) is about a discontented office worker (Norton) who, through strange coincidence, meets Tyler Durden (Pitt), a reckless soap salesman with a strange fascination for explosives and street fights. Norton finds an almost religious escape with the fights, and soon they gather a large following that they deem the Fight Club. Fight Club is appropriately rated ""R""-there are some of the most brutal fight scenes in this movie I have ever seen. You'll see more blood on screen here than in most war movies. One scene in particular was highly disturbing, and there are many where men are beat within inches of their life. But therein lies the intriguing part of this movie-the number of people who found a strange euphoric solace in the brutal, merciless atmosphere of the underground fights. There are few personal fights in this movie-and yet the anger that flows from the members of this outlaw club is as real as it gets. The actors with stark realism portray men at the edge of their sanity-needing more relief than any class can provide. So instead of focusing on the fights themselves, Fight Club focuses on the desperation of people in American society. It represents many suppressed desires, fears, and the general curiosity that average people hold. If that was Fight Club's goal, it succeeds. Another area that Fight Club excels in is portraying a dark, desperate atmosphere. Even Tyler Durden's insane antics don't lighten up the mood. You want to laugh at some scenes, yet almost all of the humor in this movie is bitter-sweet. This is kept up from start to finish with amazing pace. You never feel rushed to the next scene, instead the movie flows evenly throughout. Fight Club may not be for everybody, but if you have time to sit down and follow its complex plot, it comes highly recommended from me.",Fight Club

Every time you find details that you missed the first time. Definetly advanced about how society its blinded with stupid consumism and nowadays with social newtworks and all the same ""things"" we still don´t need. Its a movie about real life, about decisions, about yourself, about the dreams you left behind, a wake up call. But as Palahniuk says, its also a love story.
The common error about this movie was that people thought it was a stupid fight movie, when its really a mind blower, philosophical movie.Great performances by Edward Norton and Brad Pitt, definetly a cult film that was and i think its still underrated.In Tyler we trust",Fight Club

3216,WWTD,"Beyond excellence, lies spiritual overtones",10,17 August 2005,"This film is quite possibly the best film in recent history. The original book is a must read for a fan of this top caliber film. A quick, easy read that provides great depth, and amazingly, quite a different story than the film.Both are divine and the author himself actually disclosed that he enjoyed the film's ending more than his own. The film is perfectly structured, featuring a trio of protagonists, of which would normally present disaster, but here the film blends a tango of terror beautifully.The clean cut narrator (whose name is never revealed, but is assumed to be Jack), meets the eccentric wild man Tyler Durden who begins to set up an underground boxing match. The object is not to win the fight, but to realize what it is to be a man.Once the men embrace their freedom, Tyler launches a plan that spirals recklessly out of control, and ""Jack"", who's always been the control freak, can't handle it.Enter the third leg, Marla Singer. ""Jack's"" hate interest. The woman he despises but can't force himself to get rid of. Tyler constantly ravishes her to say the least. The fornication is overly absurd and hilarious at the same time hearing the screaming from three floors down.Overall, Tyler is a man on a mission. He is the ultimate spiritual guru. Who is he? What does he represent or stand for? I'll let you decide. This is as close to a divine film as you will find in today's Hollywood.",Fight Club

3219,Ryanbarnett123,"A depressed, lonely, man meets the charismatic Tyler Durden. Together, they start a therapeutic club where people can beat the hell out of each other. Fight Club.",8,18 October 2014,"When Fight Club was released in 1999, it was critically panned by critics. This remains a mystery to me. Perhaps they did not understand the subtle and dark implications this film has to offer. Perhaps they did not appreciate the eerie and dark tone. Maybe it was the dark comedy that they didn't take into account. Fight Club remains one of my favorite movies for those three reasons and many more. Fincher created a hysterically dark yet emotionally powerful masterpiece that has very little equals. I could go on about the fantastic, career defining performances by just about every single person in this film, or I could go on about the brilliant and thought- provoking third act, ended beautifully by the intentionally incomplete ending, but I'm sure you've heard it all before. Fight Club is a love it or hate it film. It's one that should be watched multiple times for an adequate experience, and it's one that you should keep a topic of conversation for years to come. Fight club demands your attention.",Fight Club
3220,johnossing97,"A thrilling, psychological masterpiece.",9,29 September 2014,"Fight Club is a dark, satirical movie detailing the journey of the Narrator, who remains nameless throughout the movie, to ""rock bottom,"" as the Narrator said. Fight Club uses low key lighting and many dutch angle and hand-held shots to give the viewer the feeling that they are present for the fights. Both Non-diegetic and diegetic sound play an extremely important role in the movie, often accounting for the Narrator's hallucination, which comes on the form of Tyler Durden, whom we later find out is a result of the Narrator's insomnia. Fight Club not only presents an interesting take on modern consumerism, but also effectively takes us to the ""rock bottom"" that the Narrator journeys to, utilizing the aforementioned film techniques.",Fight Club
3221,SeanConway,First Rule of the Fight Club.,9,13 September 2014,"Okay, so I am not exactly breaking the rules in talking about the Fight Club. If you're reading this, you've seen it so there is no point in keeping silent. After seeing this again last night, I decided to share my views on it. As evidence shows on the Top 250 list... Fight Club is one of the greatest films of all time. First, let's talk about the cast: Edward Norton was a great choice, we can see that he has had to loose the beef from his previous credit, American History X, but this gave it an, almost, realistic approach to the film. He wasn't quite how the character is described in the book, but we can let that off, he still looked pretty fantastic, even in the insomniac look. Brad Pitt was an almost perfect casting, he was no longer a pretty boy who couldn't act. He was a great god on the screen, he fitted the role and, in my eyes, portrayed Tyler almost perfectly. We all know that H,B-C was a good cast, she's nearly crazier than Tim Burton... Which fits the role.Now we can move onto the Film vs Book argument. Obviously they have to change certain parts of the book to make it fit into a 100-150 minute film, otherwise they'd do what happened to The Hobbit. The ends of both the film and the novel differ drastically. In the novel, the Narrator does shoot himself through the cheek, just as Jack does in the film. What happens next in both stories is quite different. In the film, Jack is reunited with Marla and they watch the buildings disappear from the skyline. In the book, the Narrator shoots himself but then wakes up in what he believes is Heaven, however it is described that Jack is actually in a mental institution. The Narrator believes his psychiatrist to be God. Now, that is the biggest difference made, yes there are other big changes, yes there are story changing tweaks, but I did this one because it is a stand out difference. In my opinion, I am not too bothered by the change, it makes it more applicable to a film. It brings us into suspense as we try to figure out what happens after: Does the building blow up? Does Jack die by Marla's side? As the transition to the credits appear, it is obvious, though that is only a flash, it may be a reference to one of Tyler's jobs. Feel free to respond and counteract. This is my first review.",Fight Club
3222,butterysandwich,"Edward Norton finds his life a compete loss until he meet Tyler, the soap salesman",9,30 September 2014,"Fight Club is a rather dark drama filled with subtle comedy and with a rather dark ending. The ending is actually the most important scene in the movie and the director decided to begin the film with it too. However, he purposely leaves out the major twist you learn at the end. This is obviously done not to ruin the rest of the movie. However, the fact that you never learn the narrator's real name the entire movie is the most important part of this plot twist. When you learn that Tyler is actually just the narrator's mental projection, your entire understanding of the movie is changed. Tyler is the narrator's mental projection of what he wants to be. During the movie, the narrator's physical appearance worsens while Tyler's actually gets better. This was a consciously made decision by the director in the film. ""We decided early on that I would start to starve myself as the film went on, while he would lift and go to tanning beds; he would become more and more idealized as I wasted away."" The fact that the narrator's physical appearance degrades over the lapse of the film is an excellent choice to show how actually his mental state became worse and worse. This is not only because of his continuous insomnia throughout the film, but also for his own self-hatred for how average his life has become. This is why he eventually creates Tyler as an image of a true man and what he actually wants to be. What he wants to see in himself he envisions in Tyler.Tyler is very masculine, handsome, and confident. All of these characteristics the narrator lacks. Tyler is what the narrator actually sees himself as becoming. He falsely sees partaking in these underground fight clubs to make himself more masculine. This is why Tyler's appearance becomes more ideal, while the narrator's worsens. He only sees himself become this more ideal person while in reality; he is not bettering himself at all. He quits his job, loses all connections to his friends and family, and completely loses track of who he actually is. The reason why the narrator creates Tyler is not only because of his hatred for his own lifestyle, but also how emasculate he felt in society. He has no confidence in his own self-image and who he is. When he goes to these self-help groups, he actually gains little confidence in himself seeing that there are actually people who are less of a man than he is and has bigger problems than he does. The first time he actually embraces this is when he is at the self-help group for men with testicular cancer. He convinces himself that he is also a victim. He is not actually a victim to the same circumstances these men face, but feels just as emasculate as they do. This is actually what relieves his insomnia. It isn't actually until he meets Marla that he sees how fake both of them are by going to self-help groups for their own pleasure that his insomnia worsens and eventually meets Tyler.The physical appearance of the characters in the movie Fight Club is an unnoticed decision the director made that emphasizes a crucial point in the movie. The fact that the narrator projects what he wants to be through Tyler is seen through his appearance. Tyler becomes more attractive while in reality, he becoming worse off and just more battered and beat up as the movie goes on. The narrator never comes to grip with this until the final scene of the movie. Once the narrator realizes that Tyler is just what he project, he sees how far Tyler has taken his role. He finds a middle ground between Tyler's over masculinity and his low self-esteem as 'kills' Tyler once and for all.",Fight Club
3223,corbink320,wonderful classic!,9,6 October 2014,"Fight Club is an extraordinary film that depicts the life of a (not really) average Joe who seems to have met the perfect new best friend to spice up his life. Why anyone would dislike this movie is beyond me. Yes, it's pretty graphic and violent, but it was a new outlook on an underground activity that hadn't been approached much before. Along with that, it touched on the human mind and what it's actually capable of doing. At the box office, the film only reached around 37 million, in contrast to their estimated budget, which was 63 million. Why did this movie bomb? Maybe it was bad promotion, maybe people didn't realize how hot Brad Pitt was (and still is), but whatever the case, it's still a legendary movie. Almost anyone knows the famous line, ""first rule of fight club, don't talk about fight club."" It's widely recognized and changed into many different varieties, even 14 years later. And the ending is a real shocker! You wouldn't see it coming. When the DVD was released, word spread much more quickly about small details in the film you wouldn't have noticed in the theater. People wanted to analyze the plot twist for themselves. The thought that was put into making this whole movie come together is wonderful, and I think many movies lately need to use this movie as an example of how to correctly write a memorable classic.",Fight Club
3224,sercastaneda99,"dynamic, thrilling, intelligent, visceral",9,23 June 2015,"This is a flawless title from beginning to end. Maybe the only i can find that's a little bit unfortunate is the overall theme of child-like terrorism just for the sake of it but even what seems to be an infantile view of the world, this is perfectly justified as there's a social zeitgeist clearly depicted throughout the film. The aesthetic is without fail, it's gross, sweaty, visceral and intimidating. The reason i don't give it a full 10 is because, again, i think upon reflection this is a teenage or young adult oriented movie and what it portrays is dangerous for a young mind to digest, i don't usually take the moralist standpoint but i guess this movie does boarder on immorality.",Fight Club

The story occurs in the United States, during now days. The main character who's played by Edward Norton is a pathetic guy who's working for an insurance company, what makes him insomniac, so he tries to find a way to sleep and his solution is going to meeting like alcoholic anonymous, or a meeting with people suffering from testicles cancer. In these meetings he meets Maria Singer, she is a woman that is totally disturbed, neurotic, and incredibly funny in her own way but we must say that this character is awesome due to the fact that she is played by the amazing Helena Bonham Carter, who's for me one of the best actresses from all time. The Double of Edward Norton Character in the movie is incredibly well played by Brad Pitt. This movie will be remembered in the future such as ""pulp fiction"" or the ""godfather"" are remembered now days. This is a masterpiece in the field of cinema. Despite the quite violent aspect of the movie it is a funny movie in some part. So if I could advise you a movie this one would obviously come to my mind.",Fight Club
3226,patricksteed1979,Great movie.,10,2 August 2015,"Mindbender of a movie and unrelateable to the main character but didn't like the use of bombs or terrorist tactics, nor would attacking credit companies do anything. Come on. Funny how they had a secret society and his supposed split personality didn't know of it. Very M Knight Shamalan-esque type of storyline! It gets a little too weird when the woman enters the scene and starts coming by the house though and you realise that plot will take a wicked twist. The climax is when he realizes the LE are part of it too and try to cut his nuts off. The insomnia stuff was pretty funny too about the IKEA magazine stuff. I've personally never shopped there but his details on Swedish furniture is pretty funny.",Fight Club

Then, when you find out that the hero has a different personality who is planning and supervising Project Mayhem as an alter ego, it doubles the dose and dives into the psyche of the hero and a whole new story. This was honestly one of the only movies I had to watch completely through, and almost a second time, to find out what was really happening and it was worth it. I would say that it could make you think about your life a little differently if you were the kind of person who needs excitement, but never takes action.",Fight Club

It is one of the memorable movies i have seen to date. (for all the right reasons of course.) I didn't read the book- and hope to soon..ish. The cast help carry this film but the true star of the show is the story itself. Thats a rarity in films. However, Edward Nortan, Brad Pitt, H.B.Carter all were best suited for the roles they acquired. The whole package flows as an river down a mountain as there's no sloops of boredom along the way so throughout you always somewhat entertained.I gave it a nine because only the saviour of Hollywood will ever get a ten. **I await their arrival**""Oh say oh can i say?"", go buy this film : you wont be disappointed*. *(unless you have poor POOR taste in films)",Fight Club

A movie about guys who fight - it didn't seem to deep, but I thought it would provide entertainment. I had heard buzz about, a few of my friends raved about it for a few days, and I was convinced. I should see this movie. I went to my local video store and picked up the last remaining DVD. I popped it in, sat in amazement until the last credit rolled, and then watched it again. And again. And again.This movie is dark and disturbing, however, it is equally smart and stylistic. I found it hard to watch at points, but I couldn't turn my eyes away. Fight Club makes many bold statements against the modern consumer-driven society, and produces Norton's best performance and Pitt's second best (12 Monkeys).Norton plays an average-Joe who is living a dead-end life. He needs something to change his life. Tyler and Marla will take care of this, and that is all I want to give away. Other comments will tell you more, but I suggest you let it all sink in while watching. As for it's ending, it doesn't rival 'The Sixth Sense' - it blows it away. One of the best movie endings I've seen. Even better if you're a Pixies fan.As for it being important, don't worry. You will be hearing about this movie. When 'A Clockwork Orange' came out, it was met with mixed reviews, deemed too dark and violent, and is now considered a classic. These two movies share quite a bit in common - both were based on great books. If you haven't read either, get to it. Politicians will use this movie as a demonstration of careless and consequence less violence in movies, and as a perfect example of what today's youth are being influenced by.Watch this movie, and watch it again with some of your more intelligent friends. 10 out of 10.Was the above review useful to you?

At first we really just loved it for its topsy-turvy story line, awesome fighting and anarchy theme. However, each time we watched it we peeled away the layers to see the deeper considerations of this film. When I bought it on DVD we would go over each scene looking for clues and hidden messages in this film to help us better understand it. In the end, this movie pulls you along a thrilling tale that subliminally reaches the depths of your inner rebel. This is one of the few movies that I still learn something new every time. Watch this film, and watch it many times. It is enjoyable every time and I feel you will also learn a lot about yourself, too.",Fight Club

My husband kept asking me if I thought he was as sexy as Brad Pitt and I couldn't quit say yes without cracking up. I have very little to criticize about this flick, except I know my mother would hate it. I liked it's comments on crappy low pay jobs and mindless life sucking jobs and soul-killing ethic suspect jobs related to insurance...who said ""you expect me to hand over my brain for your use for the entire day and expect me to think it will be returned in an unmutilated condition!?""? Oh yeah it was Utah Phillips. I think this movie will always be relevant and gripping and thought inducing...we are all so tied to out jobs and things and vehicles etc. etc. etc....and for so many of us these ties are not a good thing and they stop us from seeing beyond out own little bubbles. Anyway ""self improvement is masturbation"" is a good line, although it makes masturbation look bad. As if any of us would have got through our early years without it. But I agree with the point. I work in a bookstore, and the richer the person seems, the more likely they are to buy a self improvement book. (Not a self help book though! Self improoovment.) anyway watch it, and if you've seen it watch it again. Just not with your mom.",Fight Club

""The Narrator"" (Edward) is sitting tied up in a chair all beaten up. I thought: ""What on earth is he doing there?"", and that's when I realized how good movie this was going to be!

His belief about life and how to live it is the best theory of a modern human it is something remarkable made by Fisher. Also Chuck Palachniuk created not just a minimalist novel but for some people a new way to belief what it so precious in life and what surely the novel want to tell for the reader.

If you pay attention you can hear and see that they tell you the ending but you would have to watch it multiple times to find all of the clues. By the time it is revealed, it makes so much sense. David Fincher scored with this movie. His direction is so dark and weird that it just works for the story and characters. The violence is the film is very graphic but it is part of the story and is spaced into the 2 hour and 19 minute runtime.

Cast with all stars like Brad Pitt, Edward Norton and Helena Bonham Carter, Fight Club's actors bring their A game and jolt the characters to life with incredible finesse. This is a truly original film that should be cast with the greats. Even though I found it a little hyped up before I watched it, I was afterwards impressed.

By the end of this movie I was doing research to gain a better understanding of the film. Movies that have to make the viewers think and try to put the puzzle back together.

This movie is extraordinarily creative in that it portrays a man's struggle with his attempts to cope with society. This man also attempts to draw the fine line between becoming a reprobate that partakes in debauchery but also having a healthy balance of anarchy in representing citizens' opinions, going against the government and all.In short, this movie is perfection.

""You're not your job"" ""We buy thing we don't need, with money we don't have to impress people we don't like"" are only a few of Tyler's quotes.

Edward Norton (American History X) teams up well with Pitt and create a great contrast which keeps you engaged and wanting not to look away. With parts given to music stars such as Meatloaf and Jared Leto (30 Seconds To Mars) it gives them an opportunity to shine and show their more dark and sinister side. A Film for lovers of cults and the undercover anarchists I urge you to look no further for a film tonight other than Fight Club. Brad Pitt improves on his already impressive 12 Monkeys performance and seals his place in Hollywood history.",Fight Club
3254,RiceMaker669,This is a must see,10,20 August 2015,"spoiler alertFor me, it's just as good as the Chuck Palahniuk book it's based on. The story of this potent work follows a nameless narrator who deals with his sad, lonely existence by becoming addicted to support groups for issues he doesn't have, but fakes, mostly because he finds the attention comforting. His addiction changes from support groups to underground fighting matches with other disaffected men after he meets the kooky soap salesman Tyler Durden. From there, things really start to spiral, but I'm not saying anymore, as part of the joy is experiencing things unfolding for one's self.The actors do so well with their characters that it's hard to imagine anyone else playing the parts, and not only that, but they become the characters, and you forget that they are really just actors. Fincher's dark and hypnotic style works perfectly with this material, and the editing is also really good. This movie isn't really about dudes beating each other up in underground fighting venues. It's a critique of masculinity, being marginalized by society, and a major attack against gross materialism and consumerism. This is catharsis at it's finest.I first saw this when I was a sophomore in high school the same week I first saw Reservoir Dogs and Taxi Driver, and I was never the same after that. Those three films are what lead me to become the rabid film buff that I am, and the rebellious and disaffected nature of the protagonist here really spoke to me, and I found myself really able to identify with a lot of the stuff going on here.I suppose the film is perhaps a tad overrated, and, unlike the book, the twist doesn't work quite as well, but even then, this film is a powerful, compelling, and amazing work of art. Also, given the content, it really amazes me (still) that this was a mainstream production. Bottom line, this is a must see.",Fight Club
3255,mariaschouhansen,Horrifying and brilliant - absolutely amazing!,10,19 April 2015,"I first saw this movie in school (Not for any particular reason, we had a substitute), and i loved every minute of it. The violence, that's overwhelming in every single second, at the horror, that makes this movie breathtaking. But the best part, and I think not a single person would disagree with me, is the ending. The movie takes a great twist, that makes it one of the most surprising and brilliant movies, I've ever seen. Because it suddenly becomes clear to all, that this movie is not just about violence, but about a lost human being, that ends over the edge trying to feel, trying to make a difference in the predictable, boring nightmare he lives in. After reading some of the user reviews on this page, its clear that a lot of people don't get the movies message, and actually accuses it for promoting violence and terror actions. While watching the horrifying level of violence, just keep rising through the movie, I'm pretty sure to say, that the directors of this movie thinks violence is a bad idea. Especially, when an innocent man, who you have gone to love and sympathies throughout the movie, dies. I love the way Tyler Durden reacts to the society, by keeping questioning the things we along the way have taken for given. I, for one, highly promotes these kind of thoughts, and i think everybody should watch this movie, and then go out question the world we live in. That's how we grow as a society. So, point of this hole thing is, that if you think this movie is all about half-naked men fighting each other, you're terrible wrong. And just by the record, I'm a thirteen year old girl, so the thing about this being only a movie for men has kind of fallen to the ground. I would proudly recommend this movie to any person I know, because its quite incredible.",Fight Club

This masterpiece will have you 100% concentrated on your screen for 2 hours and you will totally enjoy every second of it. David Fincher created an almost flawless movie based on the incredible novel by Chuck Palahniuk. The Fight Club is a movie that portrays perfectly our society, expressing the boring routine of our lives in the day-by-day, such as working on our boring jobs and doing things we don't like because we don't have control of our lives. The amazing performance of Edward Norton and Brad Pitt will make you fall in love immediately with this film.

Very well filmed, and I myself was surprised to find the main focus of this movies was not guys fighting each other. Delivers a sucker punch to the audience and then pulls the rug out from under it. It is sensational. It is also grimly funny. It's visually surrealistic, acted with integrity, so brutal in spots that I averted my eyes. Keeps film goers wondering what will happen next even as they are repulsed by what's happening in front of them. It always surprises, never bores. It's also just damn good, on every possible level -- so go see it. Now.-Metacritic",Fight Club
3258,markawwallacett,Awesome!,9,16 January 2016,"This movie is truly genius. The way the director portrayed the reality that some people face of having split personalities/alter egos is genius. The acting is perfect. Ed and Brad have a natural chemistry. The narration is on point and captivating. The supporting characters are perfect. The soundtrack, the filming style are all truly amazing. The setting suits the story. The dialogue is beyond perfect.I myself feel as if I have split personalities and whenever I watch this movie I can totally relate. Sometimes we all need something or somewhere we can all just vent and this movie shows us how therapeutic it can be. This movie will always be one of my favorites.

3259,dmaestral,Trough the mirror,9,25 July 2016,"Set of characters in this movie is well designed, developed and then simply left alone to live their lives on the screen. Apparently, even after these few years - they are still well and kicking.Transitions from scene to scene, from mood to mood and similar also fit the bill of the movie's general appearance and eventually suggested direction from the title it self. If you go for this movie, based on your cast preferences or something on that line, you'd be well rewarded for your trust and fellowship. But, even if you go just because of the catchy title, the same would follow. So, what's to lose? In my opinion, this movie is ready for the line of classics and your invested time will pay out. For some, in the afterward thoughts and for others in a pleasant injection of adrenaline.If you have what's needed for a fight, you might find an excellent opponent at the end of this movie - to practice and to fight, occasionally.Warm recommendations.",Fight Club
3260,mikegarmonsway,Cult Classic,10,27 June 2016,"Now don't get me wrong. Fight Club is one of my top 10 favourite films ever, and I don't exactly have any problems with the film itself. What I do take issue with is the extremely limited view of the film that is taken on by teenage boys who seem to view this film as great, but only because of its anti-establishment message and seemingly rebellious views on consumerism. To these people, Fight Club is a rebel's film. A chance to be different and a validation as such, but the issue is that it is none of these things. It is a parody of these messages, a parody of the anti-consumerist culture and grunge movement of the 90's. The message is right in front of our faces for the entire movie and nobody seems to pick up on it. I'll get more into all this after some comments on our director.David Fincher is a genius in the way that he creates mood. If you have seen Seven, Gone Girl or The Social Network you will notice that you are able to grasp the mood of his pieces quite easily. His nihilist style is a definite departure from some of the more visual, Steadicam-like work of other modern directors like Paul Thomas Anderson and Guillermo Del Toro, and he uses this to separate himself from the pack in some ways. He is not poetic in his visuals, but he is subtle. Empty space and profile shots could be filler for some, but Fincher uses them to say something about what he is showing, or not showing in some cases, and I think Fight Club is an excellent example. Now, I'll provide a brief exposition, I guess.Our unnamed protagonist, whom we will call Jack, is suffering from insomnia. He can't sleep, he cant function, and because his life is taken up by his job, products, and TV shows, he has fallen into IKEA oblivion. He finds solace in support groups for diseases he doesn't have, but this doesn't last long. Things finally start to look up after he meets Tyler Durden, who helps him discover there is more to life than consuming products. Or that there is less to life than consuming products. It's hard to tell.The movie takes a lot of turns and if you have seen or heard of this film before, you'll know that there's a brilliant twist ending (which I wont spoil) but I think people put too much stock in it. Fight Club is seen by many as great only because of this twist ending, without realising that almost everything Fincher has done in this movie has contributed to the overall meaning of the film, and the twist ending is merely a distraction, a shortcut to a very simple explanation of the films themes, but with none of the extra flesh. If you want to really get into the nature of this film, you have to take in every shot, every line of dialogue, every trash can, every street name. Fincher has made it harder for us than you think.I think something that many people fail to see in this film is the message it has about masculinity, and our drive to be anti- establishment in order to achieve this goal. The film says a lot about how men feel that their masculinity has been taken away from them by the consumer culture that encourages men to work for others, be domestic, have children and own pets. Men in this fictional world are never encouraged to rebel, they are never encouraged to return to their caveman-like ways and be themselves, free from their trappings. But where people slip up is how they interpret this. The film is not glorifying the violent anti-establishment culture, it is merely parodying it. A real-life Fight Club is such a simple yet flawed idea. The men in this film cannot get past their testosterone-filled psyche and therefore cannot move past such simple ideas. Project Mayhem is a pointless farce, depicted by Tyler as a group of ""enlightened"" folk who reject franchise and work for themselves, yet by the end of the film, Tyler has set up franchises all over the country, and the men are merely working for him, slaving away for Tyler's endless power trip. The film is a giant contradiction, and as it begins to pile back upon itself, the space between becomes warped, and wormholes start to form. Connections are made and the plot starts to connect and disconnect and spin wildly out of control the more you think about it, and it becomes a giant spider's web of emotions and memories, much like the inside of a human brain, which is shown in the opening credits.Fight Club was the first movie I watched that made me more interested in film as an art form, and arguably it was the first film that I ever loved, and my first love has to have a place on this list. This film will always hold a place in my heart as a complex masterpiece misinterpreted as a simplistic masterpiece. Everyone thinks they know everything about this film, but nobody will, and I hope that one day people can look past its distractions and understand the puzzle within it, or at least try to.10/10",Fight Club

3263,AngelPaws89,Fight Club is a psychological movie.,10,30 June 2005,"I believe that ""Fight Club"" is about one single person, Edward Norton's character. There are no other characters in the movie. He made everything up in his mind; Tyler, Marla, the Fight Club. The real issue is a man fighting a psychological battle within himself. The only person in this movie who dies is Bob. This is very significant, I believe it is to show the final loss of innocence within Norton's character. Obviosly Tyler and Edward Norton's character are one person, so that explains a lot. But after I thought about, I began to see how nothing was real. He created a world within his mind where he could be safe, surrounded by material possessions,then his mind won him over;this is where Marla comes into play, Marla is the symbol of his final collapse of reality; evil winning over good. She invades the safe place in his mind which ultimately begins his destructive path. Finally, at the end of the movie, he over comes everything he has been fighting against. Throughout the movie, Tyler was always stressing that he did the things he did in order to set them free. By Norton's character shooting himself at the end, he destroys his mind, killing himself, and finally being free. (When Marla asks him if he is okay, he says that everything is alright). Now, you don't see him physically die, this is because the end of the movie(with the bright lights from the buildings) his mind and soul are being released into the afterlife.(his mind lives on, therefore the event of death is seen from a mental, not physical point of view) Hard concept to accept, watch the movie again, there are many hints that give it away. ""They say he was born in an asylum."" You be the judge.",Fight Club

And the real buzz started when he met Tyler Durden (Brad Pitt),a person who can see right through the soul of Nortan.Now story get twisted, Norton left his job and they made fight club in a old unused building and a hell lot of frustrated people from cubical offices joined this club. And the Tyler became on the the popular personalities in city and country, The end of the movie is dramatic and completely unpredictable and the after effect of movie is long lasting.The build up of story initially seems like some random fighting movie but as story goes on the unpredictability grows exponentially and the kind of excitement binds the audience to watch till the end.

I saw it when I was 25 and it was a very cool flick, but certainly loses its edge when you've actually watched a bevy of hard-hitting dramas.Great performances all round. Great script. Well directed. Some plot points are -energetically- a little on the 'rebelling against straight-laced, sheltered parents', as far as the dark, brooding vibes go at times.As far as Fincher movies go, I probably prefer Se7en which is certainly a brilliant film on all accounts, and if we're talking in this realm of late 90s, early 2000s classics, with a psychological edge, I would definitely put Memento as my favorite.However; all 3 of these movies are a MUST for any cinema-buff, or general viewer of film.",Fight Club

Watch it!,, In this darkly comic drama, Edward Norton stars as a depressed young man (named in the credits only as ""Narrator"") who has become a small cog in the world of big business. He doesn't like his work and gets no sense of reward from it, attempting instead to drown his sorrows by putting together the ""perfect"" apartment. He can't sleep and feels alienated from the world at large; he's become so desperate to relate to others that he's taken to visiting support groups for patients with terminal diseases so that he'll have people to talk to. One day on a business flight, he discovers Tyler Durden (Brad Pitt), a charming iconoclast who sells soap. Tyler doesn't put much stock in the materialistic world, and he believes that one can learn a great deal through pain, misfortune, and chaos. Tyler cheerfully challenges his new friend to a fight. Our Narrator finds that bare-knuckle brawling makes him feel more alive than he has in years, and soon the two become friends and roommates, meeting informally to fight once a week. As more men join in, the ""fight club"" becomes an underground sensation, even though it's a closely guarded secret among the participants. (First rule: Don't talk about fight club. Second rule: Don't talk about fight club.) But as our Narrator and Tyler bond through violence, a strange situation becomes more complicated when Tyler becomes involved with Marla (Helena Bonham Carter), whom our Narrator became infatuated with when they were both crashing the support-group circuit. Based on the novel by Chuck Palahniuk, Fight Club was directed by David Fincher, who previously directed Pitt in the thriller Seven.",Fight Club

The blood and the fighting is so real, it will knock you down in your seat. Brad Pitt will bring out the best of Norton in it. Excellent Direction. Keeps you interested and fuses a bomb in the end.

As he is sleeping, is this when he creates Tyler? That is to say he only believes he is sleeping when actually Tyler is out making soap, doing his night jobs, and so on.Or is it that Tyler has existed for a long time prior to his therapy sessions, and the narrator is just unaware of him until he meets him on the plane in the form of a hallucination?

3281,wstan1,Up to you...,10,27 February 2006,"After reading numerous comments I feel it's safe to say that this film has gained somewhat conflicting responses from its viewers. I honestly loved this film, the story is incredible, and the execution from novel to motion picture is brilliant.The majority of the ""Hated it"" comments (that I read) were somewhat contradictory. It seemed that the people who disliked it did so because they saw a standpoint on western society that they did not like, they saw something that they disagreed with and were discomforted by it. However, I feel that this is what Fight Club is all about. This film shows the discrepancies between those who question purpose and those who don't. This movie affected me because it made me see something in myself and the people around me, something that I did not necessarily like. Not many films have the ability to that that to a person, and I feel that's what makes Fight Club so excellent.I can see how this film could be considered depressing or twisted by some viewers but I feel it's anything but.Chuck Palahniuk uses Fight Club as a vehicle to express his own thoughts and to depict the spiritual struggle of the modern man. Ironically this film provides relief for those feeling mediocre, or slaves to the ""IKEA nesting instinct"" through the catastrophic outcome of the fight club mentality. This film provokes thought by showing that the seditious behaviour of middle-aged men searching for meaning solves nothing but their own psychological battles.Casting, screenplay, cinematography and story, all excellent in my own opinion.10 Out of 10.",Fight Club

The major stars of the film are Edward Norton who plays the depressed main character without a name and Brad Pitt which plays the character of Tyler Durden. What the theme is in this film is so intricately supplied within the title of the film itself which is that of the fight club. Through the beginning of the film the unnamed character was suffering from insomnia and depression and sought relief, what had happened that instead of any actual remedy for his insomnia from which the attendant at the hospital had recommended was that he should witness what he called real pain and that was from a testicular cancer support group. However odd this was, the unnamed character started going to these down-trodden support groups to seek relief although he didn't suffer from the actual illness from which the group was based upon, which in a sick and twisted way had helped him only temporarily forget about his own problems. This is where another character of the movie comes into play and that is of Marla Singer played by Helena Bonham Carter where she had joined the same groups of which the unnamed had been frequenting. Knowing that Marla was a fake just as he was within these groups all satisfaction and relief had ceased.The point in the film where he meets Tyler Durden was on a business flight from which they introduce themselves to each other. The fight club theme seemed to have evolved from an altercation that had happened after a night of drinking at a local bar. From there the actual fight club just seemed to evolve from other people that would gather around outside of that bar to fight one another. Soon there seemed to exist the fight club that took place in the basement of Lou's bar.With regards to the lighting in the film most of which seems to be produced in very dark conditions with only a few parts in the film that were actually well lit. This seems to me to represent the very nature of people and the human condition as it applies to all the strife and trying times that a person can go through in life. On one side of the picture you have the well lit office atmosphere of an everyday normal life and career and on the other side you have the actual realities of human suffering and all the real emotions that people seem to disregard in their everyday business atmosphere which seems to surface when alone and living life outside of their corporate existence that perpetuates the necessity of everyday life. There is one line in the film that represents this statement and that is from the character Tyler Durden ""You are not your job, you are not how much money you have in the bank, not the car you drive, your not the contents of your wallet, you are not your f***ing khaki's."" No matter what someone does for a living inevitably everyone goes through the same turmoil.The other variation of the film would be the motif and the reoccurring pattern of the unnamed character getting beat up. Whether it's from people in the fight club or whether it's merely himself causing bodily harm this is what ties the film together ultimately reaching the end of the story where the truth is finally revealed and completely undoes everything that you knew up to that point about the unnamed and the story line itself. In my opinion this is what makes this particular film worth watching over again. Just to be able to make sense of the film's story to begin with.",Fight Club

Brad Pitt does an amazing job in this movie. Not suitable for kids, but for adults, its a must see! I wish I could watch this movie over and over again, just brilliant. I absolutely love this movie, I was thrown off by how the narrator didn't know Tyler was him, I mean how do you simply not know how you are. But all in all it's an AMAZING movie, I absolutely adore it.

In fact, first time I've seen it i thought he is either dreaming or he is some kind of a lunatic in mental facility. After seeing the movie I was shocked, especially by the fact that such an awesome movie can be made 13 years ago from then. If I'd get a wish of deleting a memory from one movie and seeing it again, this movie would probably get into top 5. Obviously besides that actors did amazing job, their performance was as convincing as illusionist on stage. Eddy N. is one of my favorite actors, he can play any role equally good.

3289,gasmaskbase,The first rule of Fight Club,10,30 September 2015,"FIGHT CLUB premiered in the US with a wave of publicity focusing on its violence and nihilism; some critics countered this with the statement that it was an anti-materialist jeremiad. On a 2nd watching of the film, it seems like neither to me. It's easier to see it as a thoughtful, strong and complex movie. Director David Fincher once again dazzles us with his work, which is as brilliantly energetic as the acting of Brad Pitt and also talented Edward Norton.What's really impressive is the manner in which the film manages to tease us with an anti- materialist, hyper- masculine message even as it suggests that we're all a little too sophisticated to buy into it.",Fight Club

A tiny critic of the society that will make you wonder about your own place in it. Eventually we will discover that the mind could be our best friend or our worst enemy depending on the point of view that we, as humans and citizens, create to fit in the modern society, but where is the real in this virtual and creative game called capitalism?

3291,londonuktaurus,Why I love  Fight Club,10,23 October 2015,"FIGHT CLUB: Hit Me In its incredible simplicity, it's truly wonderful. Cinematically, Norton's first punch is a masterstroke of the unexpected. Another film-maker might have amped up the moment to epic levels – had the fist thrown into the camera, perhaps, or added percussive sound effects or concussive light flashes – but not David Fincher. Filmed from a prosaic position parallel to the bar's back wall, Norton's punch is a flat, undramatic blow, and its unadorned impact allows Pitt, never the subtlest of performers, to bring out all the pain.No, what makes Fight Club so great is the way it transforms these themes into thrilling, pure cinema, and I don't think there's any better example than that first confrontation between Brad Pitt and Edward Norton in the car park behind the bar.",Fight Club

3293,poom-88742,good,9,19 March 2016,"When I first saw the previews for this movie, it had me interested. A movie about guys who fight - it didn't seem to deep, but I thought it would provide entertainment. I had heard buzz about, a few of my friends raved about it for a few days, and I was convinced. I should see this movie. I went to my local video store and picked up the last remaining DVD. I popped it in, sat in amazement until the last credit rolled, and then watched it again. And again. And again.This movie is dark and disturbing, however, it is equally smart and stylistic. I found it hard to watch at points, but I couldn't turn my eyes away. Fight Club makes many bold statements against the modern consumer-driven society, and produces Norton's best performance and Pitt's second best (12 Monkeys).Norton plays an average-Joe who is living a dead-end life. He needs something to change his life. Tyler and Marla will take care of this, and that is all I want to give away. Other comments will tell you more, but I suggest you let it all sink in while watching. As for it's ending, it doesn't rival 'The Sixth Sense' - it blows it away. One of the best movie endings I've seen. Even better if you're a Pixies fan.As for it being important, don't worry. You will be hearing about this movie. When 'A Clockwork Orange' came out, it was met with mixed reviews, deemed too dark and violent, and is now considered a classic. These two movies share quite a bit in common - both were based on great books. If you haven't read either, get to it. Politicians will use this movie as a demonstration of careless and consequence-less violence in movies, and as a perfect example of what today's youth are being influenced by.Watch this movie, and watch it again with some of your more intelligent friends. 10 out of 10.",Fight Club
3294,lankyboyjones,A brilliantly dark film that can change your life perspective,10,21 July 2005,"The film is fantastically directed and created as was Seven also directed by David Fincher. You couldn't have hoped to have a better cast. Each actor has obviously been carefully selected to play each role. Brad Pitt as Tyler Durden plays his part so cool, and i don't think anyone can not be jealous of how he can carry off any look with ease and not really care about anything. Also Edward Norton as Jack, He plays this part so well, he looks really panicky and nervous just as the character should be played perfectly. This is really a brilliant movie and it sounds sad but if you look into it deeply enough, it can change your perspective on how you look at life.",Fight Club

3296,zaparkerx,A Fantastic Film,10,2 December 2015,"Fight Club is a fantastic film. The dark plot is pulled through by amazing character and plot progression. The clever shots and angles of the camera hint toward the plot twist that is revealed at the end of the film which gives the whole complicated plot continuity. This film also has a very important social commentary that is taken to the extreme which I believe has a bigger impact on the story's message as a whole. The narrator, played by Edward Norton, starts out as a typical everyday guy. He has an office job he hates and a beautiful apartment furnished to the nines with materialistic items, but he has one problem, his worsening insomnia that throws off his perfect little world. When the narrator meets Tyler Durden, played by Brad Pitt, and Marla Singer, played by Helena Bonham Carter, they open his eyes to a whole new world. From this point on you can see a dramatic progression of the narrators character as he loses his beautiful apartment and is forced to live in Tyler Durden's broken down and abandoned house with him. We watch as the narrators clean exterior slowly diminishes, as he changes from never smoking to smoking in every scene and as he shows up bloody at work in a state of disarray because of his late night at fight club. More and more he starts becoming like Tyler Durden and soon they start a project to make a difference within humanity. The narrator begins to realize that their Project Mayhem is getting out of hand and starts to unravel that everything is not what it seems. The narrator takes drastic measures to put an end to all the madness but with the help of Marla it is implied that he will be better off because of it all. Fight Club's brilliant twist ending makes you reconsider the entire movie and allows you to watch it over and over again. This is a fantastic film that forces us as the viewer to consider everything that is going on around us and contemplate what true happiness means.",Fight Club

3298,flashfury6481,A refreshing new perspective for those strapped down by modern society and a damn good movie!,10,24 September 2005,"Fight club is an film about abstract concepts and a radical new way to deal with the problems in your life. You take from this film what you want and what you can piece together from it. This film is highly interpretive, in my opinion, and can be taken in many different ways. Some may see it as just glorified violence. Some may see it as just another guy flick. Some may view it on a deeper level, and take as much from it as they can. Personally, this film is an evolved, yet primitive way of thinking that is applicable on many levels to the way we live our lives. It's not necessarily beating the crap out of one another for the sheer gore of it. When I look into magazines and see the ""perfect"" man or woman, or see what one is supposed to look like, I am reminded that that is not a real person. In a sense, it sorta makes those of us without the action figure bodies or the ken doll faces feel a little bastardized. I suppose a more simplified theme of the story would be that there are many things in this life, a lot of bullshit, that frustrates you, puts you down, has you struggling for fading, worldly possessions and grasping for an image that only exists in magazines and on television. Sometimes it may feel that controlled sparring/fighting is a way to separate oneself from those things. Again, it is a primal instinct, and not all may agree with it, and it is not expected to be so. It is, however, one of the ways that those of us who feel alienated from the garbage tossed at us, relieve stress from all that that is dangled in our faces but which we cannot attain. In conclusion, this film is a potentially life changing look at learning how to let go of the tie downs that are fed to us everyday, and the bullshit we deal with on a daily basis. Many may not agree with this perspective, and that's fine, but it's just a different take on what I find to be a very important film that is highly pertinent to our generation and for generations to come. Feel free to leave any intelligent, well-thought out feed back should you so desire.",Fight Club

3300,negromano,Spectacular,10,10 January 2016,"A great movie in itself, with memorable performances from Pitt and Norton besides a charming Helena Bonham Carter in one of her famous dark mysterious sorta crazy characters. The story from Fight Club put it's fist in film history and pop culture (ironically).With a story that does not lack twists, philosofical content and a social crytique, Fight club won't disappoint story-telling fans. But still, even though it's genius and clever dialogue, Fight Club has a bit of action that is enough to make it entertaining for...thicker audiences but not so much to make it dull or grotesque (unless it is necessary, of course)Overall a great movie with great actors and a great story, a recommendation for everyone who can take it and is willing to take it's message with an open mind.",Fight Club
3301,Ultimate_Bad-Ass,"This is not any beautifully written, grammatically accurate review",10,5 April 2016,"but the same worthless piece of writing written by a person's organ just as everybody's else. The movie revolves around a man 'The Narrator' (Edward Norton) who is bored from his life joins a group where people share their feelings, there he meets an annoying girl who plays an important role in the movie named Marla Singer, then he meets a man named Tyler Durden (Brad Pitt), initiates a group named Fight Club where people fight with each other and commit crimes in the city. It changes his life but he gets embroiled in relationship with him. The movie is divided into 2 halves. One that develops the character of 'The Narrator' throwing light on his boring (for him) yet interesting and relatable life (for us). The other part of the movie is psychologically thrilling. The 'thrilling' part of the movie is insanely effective. It can change one's perspective towards life for an hour at least, although that is very short period of time but you would see the world from a much better perspective. In that part of the movie, 'The Narrator' fights with his own philosophy to make the moral choice (stop the chaos in the city). The characters are one the coolest characters of all time. They are inspiring, cool and relatable especially Tyler Durden. The Narrator is an antisocial insomniac, critical thinker. He pays attention to almost everything surrounding him. He uses scientific terms and complex words while framing sentences so as to appear clever. He is bored from repeating his everyday life. He lacks friends and family. The 1st part of the movie is great because it's interesting, it's relatable and the narrator narrates it in his lovely emotionless voice, with humour and sarcasm at times. Tyler Durden is also an anti socialist who have radical methods to spread his philosophy i.e renunciation of modern society, facing pain and death as major part of the life. He hates the fact that people are bound with the laws of sociality & government and cannot do their will. He is like a teacher. He wants people to do what they want to. He does not like all those boring stuffs people do such as watching flashes of pictures bring projected on T.V. You must have got the idea. He initiates Fight Club where people fight to experience physical pain, not to win so as to get people out of stupid socialism. The ideas of spreading ideas through violence may sound idiotic but is beyond awesomeness because it is only when you are tortured that you would reveal your true reaction to something. You wouldn't be afraid to do anything. You wouldn't be shy to remove your pants and when you will adapt to pain, there would be nothing in the world that could frighten you. Tyler Durden is not afraid of anything, he cannot be tortured. That's what Tyler Durden makes of The Narrator. He makes him beat himself ruthlessly without the fear of pain. Both are each other's best friends. Tyler Durden does a lot of things to make the narrator what he wants him to become. He successfully does it to the members of Fight Club but it was quite a challenge for The Narrator. That part of the movie begins when 2nd half starts. The 2nd half of the movie is psychologically thrilling. Although it is one of the best psychological thrillers but since the 1st half of the movie was completely drama, it is not considered a thriller film by IMDb or Google. The scenes of the 2nd half are quite intense, insane, inspiring and disturbing. The background soundtrack played during those scenes are mysterious, noisy representing chaos and confusion. That's why it received Oscar nominations for that category. Sometimes , there is no background soundtrack at all, it's just the solid acting and intense emotions that dominate those scenes. The Narrator, then begins narrating with confusion with all the chaos going on. There's always a psychological atmosphere maintained in that half. It have aspects of neo-noir movies but is not actually one of them.Then comes the plot-twist. If you have googled Fight Club you must be familiar that it is also known for its mind blowing plot twist. Unlike other movies, this one continues even after the plot twist and The Narrator becomes more connected to the audience and the movie becomes even more mind-fuzzing. It's like The Sixth Sense running even after the plot twist. There are tons of hint. In fact the whole movie is the hint. You would never be able to spot all the hints or predict the plot twist. After typing ""hints for Fight Club's plot twist"" (don't do that if you haven't seen it) you would realize that this is one of the most clever movies ever made. Marla Singer is the girl in Fight Club. Although, she may not seem important but she plays a very important role in the movie. It is difficult to understand her, from that statement I am not referring to what people say for girls nowadays, Marla Singer is just weird. She is not afraid of death, she is also anti social and talks weird things. The plot twist could have been even more mind blowing if it included her. Fight Club is actually a moral movie in its own dark way. Dark morality is a much better term for example Joker's quote (The Dark Knight). Some people didn't liked the movie. Some people hated the very idea of the movie, that's the reason why Academy Awards didn't liked it. However David Fincher will never be able to make a better movie, neither will Church Palahniuk ever write a better novel. They both made a masterpiece. Directing skills, screenplay, writing and acting is great too. ^- I am Jack's honest review.",Fight Club
3302,ArslanAtalay,Durden,10,7 May 2017,"Classical David Fincher quality. Like his all films, during the film you are creating lots of theories about the end. But in this film you have no chance to catch that. And ''Where is my mind ?'' could be the best outro ever.

It's an escalation and his childish desires have metastasized. His friend became his father figure and now Tyler is Jacks foe When Marla comes by Jack breaks his promise to Tyler, and mentions him to Marla who understandably is confused by the notion that Tylers not here Tyler went away Tyler's gone Its the very first time in the movie that Jack has been vulnerable around her instead of rudely pushing her away",Fight Club

If you want to watch a typical Drama, probably this won't be the best choice, but if you like these kind of movies you won't regret it. Edward Norton and Brad Pitt's performance are pretty amazing. Through Brad's speeches we can realize a clear picture of about our world.

The protagonist (Edward Norton) is just like all of us: Tired, boring and obsessed with material possessions and the movie satirically and expertly portrays all of those feelings, along with one of the biggest plot twists in modern popular cinema, this makes for a well spent 2 hours of any cinephile's time.",Fight Club
3306,Tranberg-Hansen,Highly overrated!,8,9 March 2009,"""Fight Club"" is a film that everyone talks about, either because they love it or they despise it. My impression of this psychological, violent thriller is of the latter, I'm afraid. The film starts out tremendously, as a small, absolute excitement focused on Edward Norton's character and this works perfectly until it reaches the middle. Here, the film starts downhill when it shifts its point of view from Norton exclusively to the now largely extended Fight Club. And eventually it hits rock bottom at its end. Here it completely betrays itself by neglecting the very exciting, minor psychological story of Norton's character and completely going all in on visual-effects, action-packed sequences and Helena Bonham-Carter's character, whose role until this minute has played no important part in events. It literally develops a sort of cinematic delusions of grandeur, and this does NOT suit the film at all! I'm afraid ""Fight Club"" is not as good as everyone says. Maybe as the Sunday-afternoon- rainy day fun it works, but as a film so critically acclaimed and loved, it disappoints and neglects. The acting is NOT that impressive, the story is well written, but NOT a masterpiece and the ending has plot-holes as big as its megalomania. To sum up, I honestly cannot comprehend why ""Fight Club"" is seeded as the 21st best motion picture of all times on IMDb's Top 250-list. I can't help thinking what marvels and jewels have been ignored in order for this movie to have its undeserved glory  and what a shame that is.",Fight Club
3307,icybluesx,Probably one of my favorite movies.,10,22 February 2016,"I think the plot twist is very particular, it's a kind of movie that plays with your brain, it gives you joy and also sadness, i don't know if i can describe everything you feel while you're watching it, for me it's very important how you're feeling through the movie, and i love it when i can be laughing at something and then feel terrible about a character. For me, it was easy to get attracted to Norton's character, really simple and mundane, nothing special. I've not read the book yet, probably i will do it someday, but i know a book cannot be compared to a movie, they're different but i'm sure they have the same essence. I know it's easy to find movies like this, i watched recently ""the revenant"" and it gave me a similar feeling, i was up, and then was down, i was happy, but then concerned, movies are feelings, not just shots or frames or if it has a good photography, it helps of course, but as a screenwriter, i'd like to think about the screenplay and characters more than anything else.",Fight Club

The characters are very well played Edward Norton and Brad Pitt. They make every moment seem very real, even though it is all just in the mind of Edward Nortons characters mind. The direction of the acting by David Fincher was incredible. The way each shot leads to the next and the way the characters placed together making the viewer believe that they are two entirely different people is amazing.

Watch before die because you find too many thing from world and from yourself. Some people say ""Fight Club ? It is nice."". No no no. This movie needs better words like ""Perfect"" like ""Impossible"". Watch this movie anyway.There has been some controversy about the violence in this film but it is not gratuitous violence, it is part of the story and serves it well. It is much less than what you would see in your average Hollywood blockbuster. This is actually an insightful film and in many ways similar to American Beauty, although this film is much more in your face about it's message. If you are squeamish, you may not want to see it. There are some very painful bloody scenes, but if you can stomach it, then check it out. There is also a huge twist in this film that almost rivals the twist at the end of The Sixth Sense. And I must admit, it is the twist in this film that made me really love it. The best audience for this film is men in their 20's or 30's, but anyone that can appreciate film as a modern art should like it. One of the best films of 1999.",Fight Club

Also, I love the theories of all multiple personalities, it even looks like a totally different movie depends on what you believe. There's only one bad thing about it: don't expect an end that explains everything on black n' white cause it won't happen.. Pick a theory that you most believe and try to understand all the concepts from that respective point of view!",Fight Club

From beginning to end I was entranced with the acting and story. I love Helena Bonham-Carter in this movie. She is always so eccentric. The makeup is wonderful and believable. I don't even know what else to write here in order to make up ten full lines of review. The picture of mental illness I speak of is ever so real, the actors really make you believe that they are their characters. Then at the end it's all twisted around and you're left questioning who is really the crazy one, yourself or the movie characters.",Fight Club

3318,panos_riskakis,Fight club is not a movie.,9,24 April 2016,"By the time the movie ended merely one phrase intruded my mind and that was that fight club is more of a documentary rather than a film. Now this statement might seem a bit blunt and technically flawed but I tell you once it ended I did not bother to evaluate Norton's or Pit's performances, nor did I make a comment about the direction(which was spectacular and a breakthrough for its time). This film summarizes the condition of our world, of our society which is gradually sinking into more and more consumerist ideas and models. It indicates the intolerable routine in the working environment; people who have no dreams or ideals,who are programmed to work, eat, sleep (I wouldn't say so) and repeat. Norton is the typical worker in our society, characterized by a complete lack of energy and depression, having no goals or whatsoever. He is asleep when he is awake and awake when being asleep. He needs to cry, to feel and love and be human( that is the point where these church meetings come in). Norton searches for his actual self. I merely had one question after the movie's end and sorry guys I had no intention of categorizing this review as a spoil but I need to ask: in the end where Norton says his final lines and where the mind-blowing pixies song comes in, what does he intend to do? Who is he deep inside after all? Is he still one of the ""programmed"", consumerist piles of meat in our society or is he Pit?",Fight Club

But there was something about this movie that kept knocking me and saying there's more and I couldn't see it. So I watched it again. This time trying to get detail.
And boy was I blown away. It's unique, looks at the issue of the protagonist in a fresh way. The film urges you to keep an open mind and not disbelieve anything. The movie doesn't start in the most intriguing way but if you look deeply then you'll see how fascinating it is. It's about understanding that even if we think our choices are ours to make, society makes them for us. We all have struggled to stay within society's normal and not breaking out. There are people who can relate so much with the protagonist it's scary. It's telling you, you are not alone. Those people will love this film.",Fight Club

When I saw this movie in theaters I had to watch over and over again to catch everything. Trust me, it was worth the money. Brad Pitt is my favorite part of this movie and the supporting cast is good too. I guess you can say that my least favorite actor was the female or some would call it the love interest. I thought that the movie could do better with either another actress playing that role or just eliminating it all together. I saw it at the movies and now I have the DVD. This movie is funny, full of actions and suspense. You gotta see it.",Fight Club
3321,bym-09714,Fight Club Movie Review-Spoiler Alert,9,4 May 2016,"****SPOILER ALERT************I give this movie 8.5/10 as it is very entertaining, captivating, seductive, and at times makes you readjust your sitting position and ask yourself what in the world is going on. This movie was brilliant in several aspects. I feel like it encapsulated several themes, and the top ones addressing mental health issues, as well as the consumer culture that we live in. Fight Club has big time actor Brad Pitt playing Tyler Durden, who is the main character's alter ego. Marla Singer is played by Helena Bonham Carter and is the narrator's ""girlfriend"" throughout the movie. Edward Norton plays the main character to in which is officially referred to as the unnamed narrator. This is a bold, yet unique approach from director David Fincher which almost compliments the character. The movie begins with the narrator struggling with insomnia and slowly divulges into his private life and many personal issues. The narrator appears to have some underlying issue or set of problems that is inhibiting him from acquiring hardly any sleep whatsoever. Deciding on this name for the character compliments his character in the fact that he appears to have a lack of confidence or the ability to address any of his issues, letting them perpetually compound into a greater mess. This mess is later revealed as Schizophrenia, which contrary to popular belief does not have multiple personalities, as well as Identity Disorder, which is indeed the root cause of multiple personality disorder. The narrator begins to attend a testicular cancer support group to personally feel real pain. He endures raw emotion and cries with a member there, coincidentally allowing him to begin sleeping. He meets Tyler Durden on a flight for a business trip, and escalates his testicular cancer meetings into what we all know as Fight Club.I feel one of the underlying issues from the narrator, as well as everyone that eventually attends Fight Club, is an issue with the consumer culture we live in. We live in such a materialistic world that when we're unhappy, we go out and buy ice cream or a pair of shoes. Instead of addressing the fact that we're depressed from being overweight, lack of exercise to stimulate endorphins, release dopamine, or maintain our serotonin levels. All being things we could personally control, yet everyone just continues to overeat in place of these things.We first take notice of this in the film when his apartment burns down, and he loses his suitcase filled with all of his things. To him this was his identity and creates an internal combustion within him. He evolves Fight Club into Project Mayhem with the realization that if you want anything in this world, including happiness, you have to go out and take it. He ends the movie by shooting himself in the head which the bullet exited his cheat allowing him to live, yet frees him of his alter ego when he dies, as they are the same person.This film was the first thing since Clockwork Orange to boldly portray mental health as an epidemic issue. People are so easily recruited for fight club, due to their own underlying mental health issues regardless of what they are. The narrator dealing with a range from depression, insomnia, clear to schizophrenia.The lighting in the entire film is very dark, which helps compliment the depressing nature of the character, and helps shine light on Tyler Durden. The camera angles have the narrator and Tyler Durden appear to be in important places in the group, almost allowing you to see their power. Angles are also shot as a close up full frontal from the main characters, and more of a distant panning for everyone else, establishing them as the main characters.Fight Club was well worth my time and money to watch it. If you didn't enjoy it's violent seductive nature, then perhaps you can enjoy the depth of the film that definitely helps shine light on our mental health issues being nurtured by materialistic things and ideas. This is a movie I would definitely watch again.",Fight Club

3332,saksham-67842,Masterfully done!,10,9 August 2016,"A brain-racking suspense, an unconventional yet intriguing story line; this part psychological, part macho thriller is nothing short of a phenomenon.When a materialistic insomniac suddenly loses everything due to a fire; his life changes for the (seemingly) worse, as he moves into a abandoned house with Tyler (Brad Pitt), whom he met on a flight. With him, he learns that the macho in him loves to fight, irrespective of physical pain; and he uses fist fighting as a way to get away from the stress of day-to-day life. Turns out that they weren't the only one, and he finds himself the co-founder of the Fight Club; which soon spreads across cities. They bring in more people into fight club, and soon begin to change it into an anti-establishment group. Meanwhile, he realizes that he is being sidelined in the newer anti-corporate goals of the club. But a sudden disappearance of Tyler sends him traveling over the country looking for him.The sheer beauty of the movie lies in the fact that it is pretending to be a movie about society, while hiding a whole story. Admittedly this is not a new concept, but the movie does a great job keeping it full of suspense, and revealing it as a masterstroke.The motivation behind Tyler's actions are reminiscent of the anti-corporate story of the TV show Mr. Robot. The feeling of being happy in a fake society, clinging to materialistic supports to gain happiness; and how the corporate world tries to bind us into this pursuit of materialism. And while we're on the topic, the similarity with Mr. Robot does not end at that. Saying any more would be a spoiler for Mr. Robot. The movie also shows how the narrator was dependent on Tyler, begging on his I-don't-care attitude to take decisions for him which were too difficult or wrong, according to the narrator's perceived identity as a 'normal' person.The direction of the movie is to credit for executing the tricky theme; but to end this review without remarking on Edward Norton's (the Narrator) exceptional acting would be a shame. His acting lent character, but also made the reveal much more of a surprise.To conclude, this movie would be one of the best ones I've seen with such a theme. Masterfully done!",Fight Club
3333,nikhilvanjani,A radical and nihilistic idea,10,15 August 2016,"""You're not your job. You're not how much money you have in the bank. You're not the car you drive. You're not the contents of your wallet. You're not the f**king khakis. You're the all-singing all-dancing crap of the world"". To an outsider, all-singing and all-dancing may not make much sense but the idea has been depicted in the movie beautifully.Fight Club, a psychological thriller is a movie depicting radical and nihilistic ideas relating to the society in general which I believe to be true to a great extent. The movie revolves around the life of an unnamed person working for an automobile company, frustrated with his job and suffering from insomnia.One night he visits a support group for testicular cancer and finds some kind of freedom there and then events lead him to meeting Marla Singer and then Tyler Durden. He is initially attracted to Marla but keeps away from her. He fears meeting her often because of the stark similarity in their personalities. Along with Tyler, the narrator opens a fight club. The idea being that fighting for re-creation makes them feel what real pain is which helps them to let go the fears they had in their life and live freely.I liked that the movie focused on minutest details which if one notices would leave him appreciating the movie more and more. I would refrain from going into the details of it as it would be a spoiler of the plot. Also, the cinematography was appreciable with use of single frames for subliminal conditioning effects. The visual effects were put to perfect use too to give a first person perspective.Overall I feel the movie is enlightening with it's radical idea. Though people might say that it gets a bit too violent in parts, but I feel if that bit of crossing the sanity can depict a radical idea profoundly then there is no harm in it. I think the idea of nihilism is very much practical (though the society may not consider it) and has the potential of paving the way for a free life and at the same time being responsible for it. Also, I feel that many people do practice this ideology to some extent though not much significant and I am sure such people would be able to connect easily with this movie.",Fight Club

This film is not only social commentary, not only very very funny, not only able to make you re-evaluate your life choices, not only an amazing experience to watch, not only an amazing piece of art, not only the most quotable film ever made but it is also a film that will leave you a different person that when you first put it on.

3342,lucasmaya,Fight Club helps to showcase a human's inner darkness.,10,2 October 2016,"This movie is an amazing look at a human's inner darkness. We all have a fight or flight response hardwired into our brains and this movie showcases those who attend these fight clubs choosing to fight instead of fleeing from each other. The movie shows that humans need some kind of outlet for certain emotions mainly anger and aggression. It shows that even the mild mannered everyday people we interact with on a daily basis can become hardened fighters if they let their inner darkness rise to the surface and take over. Some of these people can get addicted to the rush of the fight so much that they want to spend every single moment fighting. That level of addiction can be dangerous not only for themselves but also for those around them. Fight Club has made me reconsider my outlook on certain sports mainly combat sports. The people who participate in combat sports have agents, coaches, and the other fighters to help keep them grounded. If they were more like Fight Club I would fear for their safety. They only have themselves to keep them from losing themselves to their inner darkness. All in all this movie was amazing to watch.",Fight Club
3343,kianmoriartysucks,Fight Club is a good movie,10,12 October 2016,"Fight Club is a drama in any town America during the 1999's. The narrator of the movie, his name not mentioned, is a materialistic and depressed middle aged man. He never sleeps and drones through life. Until everything he owns is destroyed and he goes to live with Tyler Durden, a man he had recently met on a plane. Tyler Durden is a charismatic man who leads the narrator on a path to the bottom. The movie leads the audience along the way as the narrator gives up everything. The theme of this movie is summed up in a line early in the movie spoken by Tyler, ""It's only after we have lost everything that we are free to do anything."" Meaning that true freedom comes when we reach the rock bottom. Throughout the movie this is the critical plot point that makes this particular movie a philosophical tale of a man's enlightenment. This theme combined with great acting by Brad Pitt and Edward Norton truly make this an enjoyable movie. As well as this, there were many speeches throughout the movie that kept audiences entertained while getting a deeply philosophical theme across. Another theme in this movie was masculinity. The movie asks what it is to be a man. It fights the materialistic view that is on becoming a man, like a stable job and a pretty wife, and takes the view to breaking yourself down and going back to the instinct brought out through violence. Fight Club is a movie that unlike many other Hollywood movies has a deeper meaning behind it that makes it so much more worth the watch. Given that the intended audience is men due to the masculine point of view in the movie, I thoroughly enjoyed the movie and plan to watch it again.",Fight Club

3346,tapper-33113,a review of fight club for one of my college courses,9,1 November 2016,"IntroductionThis movie, although rather dark and existential in nature, reels you in, slaps you across the face, and leaves you laughing in the face of social norms. A depressed man, played by Edward Norton, who suffers from insomnia meets a strange salesman named Tyler Durden, played by Brad Pitt. These two men soon start to live together in an old rundown house on Paper Street once The Narrator's apartment is destroyed by an explosion. The two men form an underground organization where men fight each other to get away from their mundane lives. The Narrator and Tyler's relationship starts to get rocky when a young woman The Narrator met at support groups attracts Tyler's attention, leading to not just underground fighting. Plot: 6The plot throughout the movie kept the audience guessing. Nobody knew what would happen unless you've seen this movie. Throughout the film many different plot devices were used, and it didn't follow one linear, continuous path. This movie jumped from scene to scene and if the audience wasn't paying attention, they would lose an understanding of the movie entirely. For instance, the main plot device used was the character of Marla Singer. She was used to distract The Narrator and Tyler from their daily life, as well as their enrollment in the fight club. Without her key role in the movie, it would have had a very different outcome. Cinematography: 5Cinematography, in its most basic definition, is ""the art of making motion pictures."" This includes the different shot types (close up, medium, long, and everything in between), the shot angle (low, high, birds-eye, and everything in between), as well as the different types of music and lighting used in the film. Cinematically, this movie is beautiful. Music isn't often used, except for the very ending scene when The Pixies lent their song to be played as the other high-rises crashed to the ground. Other than that, the lighting and shot type/angle changed to match the scene that was being portrayed. The director and editor knew what they were doing when they made this movie, and as I once heard ""Everything in the film happens for a reason."" This is clear in the movie Fight Club, as nothing seems ""out of place"" or strange—for the movie. Cinematically, this movie is very similar to one of David Fincher's other films, Se7en. Not only does Brad Pitt star in this movie as well, it is also similar in the sense that it is very dark, and the shot angles are not exactly paralleled, but still resemble Fight Club. Pictured below is Brad Pitt in Se7en and Edward Norton in Fight Club. As one can see, the two films are very similar in ""aesthetic""Mise en Scene: 6Mise en scene is the blanket term used to note the makeup, hair style, costume, and props all the actors and actresses use throughout the film being made. For instance, ""good"" makeup, hair, etc. would be making the actors and actresses look like they literally were in an underground fight organization, but in reality they aren't. The makeup, costume, hairstyles, and props used drastically changed the movie. Without the use of makeup to make the men look beat up, the costumes to show how drastically different The Narrator and Tyler's lives are, and Marla Singer's hair: almost as messed up as her life, the movie would not have had the same effect on people that it had. Pictured below is Edward Norton as The Narrator with visible makeup effects applied to make him look like he was actually fighting someone the night before, as well as Brad Pitt as Tyler Durden when he was first introduced in very eccentric clothing. Acting Ability: 5The acting ability is obviously subjective but this movie does not have any ""bad"" actors. Edward Norton and Brad Pitt are a duo that belongs in a hall of fame. The two played off each other so well it was hard to distinguish the better actor. Helena Bonham Carter also added well to the mix, playing a suicidal group therapy addict, like the Narrator. Overall the actors fully committed to their roles, but their roles did not change them as people. Which some people, like Jared Leto as The Joker in Suicide Squad had a hard time distinguishing. Norton, Pitt, and Carter all know that they are playing a character, and while they may relate strongly to the personality they are impersonating, they are still their own person. ConclusionOverall this movie definitely deserves a 5.5 out of 6. It leaves you with a better understanding of the world in general. You realize that fundamentally, you are nothing. The world will not stop once you are gone. This is such a rude awakening for most people that this movie sticks with them. It's like a little voice in your head, pun not intended. It invites you to accept a completely different understanding of life and the functional timeline we are all used to. This film makes you understand that you are not special and that you have to know, not fear, that one day you're going to die.",Fight Club

There's a lot and while watching the film a second time, you really notice the small objects that move the plot forward. Overall one of my favorite films. Fight club really shows how far films have gone and where they are going. Throughout the film the first thing I noticed was that Tyler wore a red leather jacket and then I thought why is it red? why are there always red objects around when he's around. This means the the director liked to play with the colours and red represented blood, obviously. There is countless fights scene which end in blood. Every time Tyler is around Blood is around.",Fight Club

I taught it would just be a movie about some folks fighting each other for fun but the story is way better than that. It directly starts with with giving the watcher questions about what is going on and it takes a long time before you get answers. The film does gives you a lot of little hints so you can find out how everything fits in place. There's a lot violence in the film but in a weird way it felt just perfectly normal.

This movie comes together with acting, editing, and music that are very well done and fit the mood and atmosphere of the story. It is difficult to think of something I didn't like in this film since I don't have the book to compare it to. Also, in comparison to most films that are found in theaters, this movie is an outlier. The name of the film implies a focus on fighting, but this is not the case. So for anyone who enjoys a story with interesting characters and plot, Fight Club is for you. If you want something easy to take in, watch something else.-T",Fight Club
3357,moontheloon,Best film ever,10,7 October 2005,I am studying this film at the moment to do with camera angles and stuff but when I was doing this the film that I loved before became even more loved by me. Just subtle things that Fincher Puts in are amazingly effective. If any one is interested in this they should just watch it with sound off subtitles on and think about it. the acting is stunning with IMO Career bests from Pitt and Bonham Carter and supporting casts are also great even with little use. The story is a fantastic one which twists and turns and allows more and more viewings and even demands them in parts. It is shot mainly in a dark setting that emphasises what is going on and really really adds to the atmosphere of the piece. Just an amazing piece of cinema that will really make people think for years to come... Best Film ever,Fight Club

The story of those two guys and they relationship is the starting point of a journey into itself, into the mind and into our perception of the human being and the world. The direction of Fincher is precise and guides the viewer to wherever he wants to be reality or dream! The acting of Pitt and Norton couldn't be more accurate, organic and animal!

Released way back in 1999, this movie is way ahead of its time. The themes portrayed in this film really do strike all emotional chords. The story, direction, screenplay are just flawless.Coming to the actors, all the actors were fabulous, even the supporting cast. Brad Pitt as always brought charm and style to this movie; Edward Norton gives a performance that you can relate to at all levels. It is not just a thriller, it is more than that.

I think it is a masterpiece (While not the best Fincher), because it can send a deep message through the use of images and strong words that can penetrate deeply. ""Fight Club"" is not a film for rebellious teenagers, this film is a lot more and to understand better you need to have much culture and a basic understanding of philosophy. Especially the thought of Hobbes and Marx, since the main issues are critical to the consumer society and man's ability to be mean and ruthless towards his similar (Homo homini lupus).",Fight Club

Every time I finish watching this mind-numbing film (no matter how many times I have seen it) I have a sense that I have witnessed the absolute of what a movie should be. I swear if you watch this movie enough you could become a master in psychology. I agree with every one else when I say that Fight Club is the most underrated film in the history of film making. If everyone in the United States or the World for that matter had seen this movie this whole place would have a different outlook on life. Maybee to some of you reading this I may sound obsessed and I probably am but only because I think that this movie depicts the way that I think life should be. It shows how we are all in some kind of little womb that we are afraid to leave because of what we may find on the outside, but some go for it and are revealed to the possibility's of what true freedom in complete chaos.",Fight Club

We even started our own mock fight clubs to be ""like Tyler"". Every few years I return to this classic, partly because of nostalgia but also because watch time I watch it, I see new things. Brad Pitt and Edward Norton are both amazing actors and probably my favorite roles for both of them. The screenplay is A+, filled with suspense and cliffhangers. I love how the writers portrayed the dark undertone of the movie with a sense of humor and lightness. Lastly, as an insomniac myself (due to too much coffee/work these days) I can totally relate to the duality presented in this movie and how lack of sleep can sometimes make you feel like you are someone else!",Fight Club
3366,balaji_mani,Practical Nilhism,10,10 June 2006,"Fight Club is quite possibly the greatest film of all time. The philosophy of the film transcends beyond in-time structures. there is a whole coolness about film, the characters of Tyler and Jack representing and mirroring the wants and state of society. Palahniuk's story is cleverly utilised by Uhl's to give one of the best scripts and Fincher's direction is amazing. It is a film that if watched only once doesn't leave much of an impression however if watched 2-3 times most of you will be fans. It is such a complex film with small intricacies added by Fincher to give the film a world encompassing overtone.Tyler is the essence of suave, he is the f**k you and up yours to the world whereas Jack is the your average Joe. Combined, this usual partner matchup, is used uniquely to give interesting twist to what could have been a poorly made film.Pitt's and Norton's performances in this film are amazing, they convey their respective character;s perfectly and make you believe that they truly are Tyler and Jack.Many believe this film preaches nihilism and Buddhism, it does to a large extent. However Palahniuk has stated in a interview, that Fight Club is more in the vein of romanticism rather nihilism. It is an expression of individual's rebellion against consumerist and archaic social constructs. The manner in which this is done is highly nihilistic though.I recommend to anyone and everyone and please watch it at least three times. Each time the story opens up becomes even richer and better. In my opinion one of the greatest films ever made.",Fight Club

3368,Freak88,Great!!!!,10,27 October 2005,"First of all I gotta say I love this movie. I don't know how to describe it. A lot of people say it's just an average action movie and it's only worth seeing cause of Brad Pitt. But I totally disagree, it's not an action movie at all. OK it contains fight scenes but that's not the point. It's so much deeper. The theme of the movie is how you get influated by the media, your folks and your whole environment. About how much we're addicted to being ""normal"". About how we live our lives without living it. And it's all about a waste life. I think everybody should watch this movie and reconsider what's really important in life. Being accepted by other people or living your life the way you want it.",Fight Club
3369,nielsniessen,Schizophrenic security cameras,7,4 April 2006,"If Jack and Tyler are one and the same person, then why do the security cameras near the end of the movie show two persons instead of one guy fighting himself? Of course these cameras don't offer the real, omniscient perspective, as they are part of the narrator's story being Jack's flashback, but at this point of the story (within the narrator's story) Jack is aware (at least part of the time) that Tyler is his imaginary friend. Also when proceeding from the narrator's point of view, meaning that everything, thus also the images shown by these cameras, are part of the narrator's projection, the cameras should have shown either only one person or alternating images (Jack fighting with himself, Jack fighting with Tyler) reflecting the state of his mind at that particular moment. Or, could it be argued that these cameras are the element in the movie subverting its interpretation, that Tyler 'really' exists, that the idea of Tyler being imaginary is imaginary itself? I think it would increase the story's credibility because indeed, as someone else remarked here, a fight club started by a lunatic hitting himself in the face... One should have to do a very close analysis of the plot details to say whether this interpretation could be maintained, although I'm afraid that the plot wouldn't be watertight neither.",Fight Club
3370,saburns-64822,Highly Entertaining and Instantly Rewatchable,10,21 February 2017,"The 1999 film Fight Club is a psychological dramatic thriller that was directed by David Fincher and is based on the book of the same name. The film revolves around a nameless narrator, played by Edward Norton, who is a material-obsessed, office working, insomniac in desperate need of a change of lifestyle. That change comes when he meets Tyler Durden, played by Brad Pitt, the eccentric soap maker who is everything the narrator wishes he could be. Together they form an underground fight club which slowly evolves into something much bigger, to the point where it becomes out of our protagonist's control.Before I watched this movie for the first time, I was skeptical that it would just be another run-of-the-mill action movie with not much deep thinking and lots of violence. What I wasn't expecting, was a thought-provoking, funny, dramatic, psychological thriller. But that's exactly what this movie is, and I loved every minute of it. Fight Club will keep you hooked for over two hours as it takes you through the narrator's journey from being your typical everyman to becoming the ringleader of his own group of anarchists. All while providing interesting insights into what humans really desire in life.While Edward Norton's portrayal of our mostly clueless protagonist is very good in its own right, Brad Pitt really steals the show here. His performance as Tyler Durden is highly entertaining and his cool guy attitude adds a lot of personality to the film. Helena Bonham Carter also does a great job in her role as the not-so-innocent Marla Singer. Overall, these characters are very dynamic and are expertly performed by these actors/actresses.The best part of the film would have to be the big twist at the end. Not only because it is a genuinely surprising moment, but also because it makes the film that much more incredible upon second viewings. If you re-watch this movie you be able to pick up on so much more after knowing what the twist is. It just makes the writing seem that much more clever when you watch it again.This movie has it all; captivating acting, an intriguing story, brutal action, excellent special effects, a great soundtrack, and many twists and turns all the way to the very end. I would strongly recommend watching this movie, and then watch it again, and again, and again, so you can truly appreciate the greatness of this film.",Fight Club

I will not bore you with overly long and complex ideas that this film has changed my life like a lot of people say about this film, because frankly you won't believe me.Fight club is about an insomniac who leads a consumers life, that is until he meets Tyler Durden(Pitt) who turns his life upside down and round 'n' round. The violence may have attracted men in their mid 20s but they left the cinema feeling fulfilled in all their viewing needs.This film has taught me to enjoy life and become more whimsical and fun.

While its gotcha twists are interesting they really push the barrier and for not a whole lot of result. While I think there is a story in this movie, I did not find it well made or particularly well written. And I did not see anything that I would call funny. (or brilliant for that mater.)Acting is OK. Writing is OK (which is better than average these days) but it seemed like a silly exercise rather than a story. Maybe its an age thing-I am 50 and twists just don't impress me as much anymore.

Fight Club's portrayal of the paramilitary Project Mayhem represents a response to the ""feminization of America,"" and the portrayal is reminiscent of the creation of Nazism in response to the ""decadent"" Weimar Republic of Germany.

""Resurrection is possible only after full destruction."" Civilization has stalled and needs a complete rebirth. This something was the problem Tyler and his Project ""Defeat"".""Who are we? We're just consumers, obsessed with the external trappings prosperity."" (C)Here the familiar world we are shown awesomely, horribly empty and artificial. Order. Blue tie on Tuesdays. House. Work. Disposable ware. Greatest comfort. And it all collapses under the pressure of two rebels, to feel alive, awakened from their lethargy everyday, feeling the power in their hands to direct the course history.Intrigue, chaos and soap — to watch it all with such gusto was not be possible without the brilliant tandem of brad Pitt and Edward Norton, who played some of his best roles in his career. It is also worth to note Helena Bonham Carter, who plays Marla singer. And separate ovation David Fincher is one of those rare occasions when adaptation is not inferior to the book.

3400,elizabethgrese,"Get ready for a knock out film review of Fight Club, a classic 1999 drama film.",9,24 September 2017,"Fight Club Review 1999 Drama Film By Elizabeth GreseWelcome to Fight Club! A dramatic expression of escape created by a man whose reasons for living was nothing short of pathetic. Correction: created by two men. Meet our nameless narrator played by Edward Norton; a man monotonously living his life clouded by his insomniac state. We are introduced to the second main character, Tyler Durden, played by Brad Pitt. The third main character, Marla Singer played by Helena Bonham Carter, was a constant in the film – although is portrayed as a lunatic. The dynamic of the duo started fight club and broke the monotonous state of the young man. As fight club progressed, what was a secluded expression of emotions morphed into schemes far more violent than intended. The progression of the film starts to reveal uncertainties of what is perceived as the plot. Plot twist and nothing is as it seems. When defined, film noir is the term for crime drama that emphasize particularly on cynical attitudes and sexual motivations. The definition of film noir basically sums up Fight Club. Having never seen the movie previously, my idea of the plot consisted of bloody battles. As I watched the beginning of the movie, I was so sure of myself that I had the plot right. I was shocked when the plot thickened with the use of film noir- the relationship with Marla (sexual motivations) and the creation of the fight club followers (crime and cynical attitudes.) The intricacy of the films in terms of the plot and layers of madness is none-the-less incredible. Fight Club exceeds pre- conceived expectations. In addition, when re-watching the movie, subtle clever hints tell the peak plot even in the first few scenes. I would urge new watchers and ultra Fight Club fans to take a second look at the filmmaker's placements of people, places, and things. The fight scenes in the basement created the feeling of grimy, pain and freedom. These feelings were portrayed during the film by the narrator as well. The lighting has a major play in how these feelings are presented. The dim lighting and semi-spot light on the two fighters creates the focus point. As the importance of the fight scenes are the two men fighting not the spectators around. During the basement fighting scene, Tyler Durden states the rules of fight club – one of which no shirt or shoes are allowed. This 'costuming' portrayed the plot point of the fight scenes being a freeing escape. The representation of no clothes often is referenced as a freeing feeling. ""The things you own end up owning you.""The intricacy of the character Tyler Durden and his perspective on the world created an underlying aspect to the plot. His opinions of meaningless material goods and corruption of consumer markets was the basis of Project Mayhem. The ending scenes, blowing up the credit card skyscrapers, used location as an example of his opinion on the corruption of material goods; more specifically, money. This film references what is often see as a modern day societal problem. The intricacy of the plot and portrayal of character Tyler Durden was an ingenious idea directed and produced. ""The first rule of fight club: don't talk about fight club.""One of the most iconic film quotes was from Fight Club. As a first- time viewer, I had noticed the subtle and prominent classic references to and by this film. If this isn't enough to spark your interest to watching this well-known film, then surely a shirtless roughed up Brad Pitt will certainly do.",Fight Club
3401,jxw-44165,Fight Club follows the dive into insanity of a man trying to escape his own anarchy.,9,27 September 2017,"Fight Club follows the dive into insanity of a man trying to escape his own anarchy.Even in the daylight this film manages to create darkness. The whole film consists of dimly lit, menacing scenes portraying the unknown as the narrator, Jack, loses his sense of reality. Actions of his alter-self, Tyler, are completely unpredictable and often unmemorable to him. His psychological state is constantly re-enforced by the mystery set forth by the film's cinematic elements.The major theme of the unknown that we see in this film aligns with the conventions of a typical film noir. Their rundown home, the violence of their ""Fight Club"", and the eventual creation of a cult-like ""army"" all appeal to the theme of emphasizing the darker aspects of human condition. Outside of the cinematic elements, the role of a femme fatale is fulfilled by Marla. Introduced as an annoyance to Jack, she eventually becomes the only piece of reality he has left - aiding him in returning to reality by the end of the film. Though she was more known to his alter-self, ultimately his decisions throughout the film are driven by his interest in her.Emphasizing character emotions, this film doesn't consist of many long shots. In the fight scenes, close and medium shots allow us to associate ourselves with the emotions of the characters as their aggression erupts in front of our eyes. Within these shots, the limited lighting is directed onto the bodies of the characters without reaching their faces, de-personalizing them to us as they have done to each other. This focused lighting shows that their club acts as another world to them, their realities temporarily forgotten. Throughout most of the film shots are done in a realistic style. It is only in the end, after Jack's reality has become apparent to him, that the film switches to a formalistic style. This style was most prominently featured in Jack and Tyler's fight scene as Tyler's power is exaggerated.Production design is a major element of this film. Within the fight scenes the shirtless costumes are used to portray the characters as the vicious animals they have become. Outside of the ""Fight Club"", the next primary usage of costume is seen when Tyler begins building his ""army"". The all-black costumes his followers are made to wear reflect the attributes of the mindless cult that he is running. Particular to the main characters, Jack and Tyler, their costumes seem to contrast with each other. Jack is mostly seen wearing plain, casual clothes while Tyler wears more vibrant, exotic outfits. This contrast is used to symbolize the separate personalities - good and evil - of the single person they are.Another evident element of the production design was the claustrophobic urban setting. This was employed to create the darkness necessary in portraying the film noir theme of the unknown. Tyler's rundown home in an abandoned district symbolizes the characters' alienation from society. It re-iterates the idea of the new society they have created for themselves, living by their own rules. Within that home, the disgusting conditions they subject themselves to represent their loss of sanity and the overall anarchy their world is evolving into.Combined, these elements allow the audience to associate with the characters and feel the distancing from reality that the characters themselves are experiencing. With having the ability to to experience the plot rather than just witness it, I consider this to be an excellent film.",Fight Club
3402,cspinelli-80049,Fight Club Review,8,27 September 2017,"Brad Pitt has done a tremendous amount of films, and a lot of them are very well known. One of his better-known films is Fight Club, directed by David Fincher, starring both Brad Pitt and Edward Norton. This film starts off quite slow, but he moment that Edward Norton's character, the Narrator, meets Brad Pitts character, Tyler Durden, the film picks up relatively quickly. The tempo and tone of the movie change after their first interaction with each other. The tone of the film beings to become somewhat dark. This tone is enhanced through the type of lighting that David Fincher uses throughout the film. As the film progresses, you rarely see any true natural lighting which results in the lighting being very dark and dim. This helps enhance the films tone, but also helps in telling a deeper meaning for the character and story. This decision to have the lighting like this in regard to the characters and the story works well in the way that David Fincher uses it. The Narrator's life is an unpleasant one, and as the story progresses it becomes darker, just like the lighting style that David Fincher uses. David Fincher also uses the concept of colors to help enhance certain points of the film, which works very well in this film. The major color concept that he uses is the outfit color differentiation between Tyler Durden and the Narrator. The outfits that Tyler Durden wears are very vibrant and colorful whereas the Narrator's outfits are very bland, and the colors are very boring and solid. The Narrator will wear black and white, and Tyler will wear an eye popping red or yellow. This differentiation that David Fincher used is key to the story line of the film. It shows the personality of both characters and how much they oppose each other. Tyler is a lot more outgoing and crazy, whereas the Narrator is more conserved and cautious. Another key element that David Fincher incorporates in the film that works really well is his ability to take a location in the film and basically make that location its own character. The two main locations that David Fincher creates are the house that Tyler and the Narrator live in and the basement where Fight Club actually takes place. These two locations are integral to the characters and the story line development. The house shows the turn of the narrator's life going downhill. This house though would become the focal point of Project Mayhem which shows the progression of the story, characters, and fight club itself. The basement where fight club takes place is also integral in that it shows where everything started and that it stays there throughout the whole film never changing. The film does use a variety of camera angles, some for the better while others are not. The camera angle used for the first fight between Tyler and the Narrator is done well in being a wide shot and zoomed out so you can see both of the characters. The camera angles used during the fight scenes I felt weren't great. I felt sometimes they were too close to the fighters which didn't allow me to visually see the fight as well. When David Fincher used a birds eye view of the fights I felt they were well done. Also the camera style he used when the scene zoomed a ridiculous amount, for example the scene explaining how the Narrators apartment exploded, I feel was a good touch due to its ability to show the true detail behind something. My thoughts overall on the film is that the film is very well made and the story line is very well progressed throughout the film. I felt the film though was dragged on and slow at certain points which caused me to lose interest at certain points. I enjoyed the movie and its story line. I also enjoyed the cinematography of the film and how the film is directed. I will not discuss the ending of the film to avoid spoilers for anyone, but I personally did not enjoy the ending. I felt that the ending was a risky move, and I feel that it was well done and it paid off. I just feel that it could of gone a different route and had been better. Overall I would give the film an 8/10.",Fight Club
3403,nad-74339,Fight Club Review,8,27 September 2017,"Fight Club is one of those movies where each time you rewatch it, you realize more and more things that you did not pick up on the previous rerun. When you watch Fight Club, you might think that it is simply about members of a club that all they do is fight one another. When really it is a much deeper and dramatic story than it seems.The story follows an unnamed man played by Edward Norton and narrates the entire movie. The narrator lives a boring life where he has a boring job that is meaningless and doesn't care for. The narrator's life becomes meaningless to him and starts to fall into a depression which gives him insomnia. After many weeks of sleepless nights, the narrator visits his doctor to try and get help with his insomnia but is no help and suggests visiting support groups. After going to a few the narrator relies on them to vent so he can get sleep. When he notices a woman named Marla Singer (Helena Bonham Carter) starting to go to each support group as well he develops insomnia again. The narrator finds himself on an airplane for a business trip and meets a man named Tyler Durden (Brad Pitt). When the narrator returns home from the business trip he discovers that his condo was blown up, he decides to move in with Tyler in an abandoned house and also start a ""Fight Club"" in at a local bar. The purpose of the club was for men to get all their frustrations out about themselves, society, or anything by fighting one another. After some time Tyler decides to make the club members to start revolting against society by destroying all the popular consumer products and committing acts of terrorism known as Project Mayhem. Tyler disappears and the narrator is the one left in charge. He keeps running into people he knows from Fight Club and determines that he is Tyler. The movie ends with the narrator and Marla at the top of a building watching the financial buildings crumble to the ground due to Project Mayhem's plans.In Fight Club, David Fincher uses multiple camera angles to make the audience feel a certain way at different times. In the fighting scenes in the bar, the cinematographer uses low angle shots whenever Tyler speaks showing that he is the one in charge. The use of close up shots of the bloodied and beaten faces of club members makes the audience react in the way Fincher intended you to. The cinematographer also filmed the fight scenes in a way which makes the viewer feel like they are actually in the fight. The camera bops back and forth, falls down with the fighters, and shows the nasty and grotesque injuries up close and personal to make you feel like you are the one beating someone up. Lighting is a major role in this film as well. Fincher uses expressional lighting a lot throughout the film. In the scenes in the basement of Lou's Tavern, there is only a few lights hanging from the ceiling to make the scene feel more dark and mysterious. The use of expressional and low lighting throughout the film makes Fight Club have more classic noir characteristics with a modern twist of the time.Not knowing that the narrator was Tyler until finding out towards the end of the film added to the film. It made you think differently of the narrator and left you wanting to find out more about Tyler just like the narrator is trying to do. Each time I rewatch Fight Club I still find myself learning more and more about the narrator and Tyler. Edward Norton and Brad Pitt did an amazing job in this film and the attitude and characteristics they have added to the feel of the film.""His name was Robert Paulson.""",Fight Club
3404,jmb-32864,Modern Take on the Film Noir,8,27 September 2017,"Fight Club is one of those movies that has to be watched several times to see all of the small allusions to the twist that comes at the end of the second act of the movie. While I have only seen the movie once so far, I think I will make it my mission at some in the future to find more of these small hints left by the director David Fincher. I had caught a few after the plot twist was revealed by remembering key details, but I feel there are more that I have missed.Fight Club revolves around an unnamed narrator played by Edward Norton whose insomnia is affecting his life tremendously, to the point that he goes to different random support groups just to cry it out and get some much-needed sleep. However, after a woman named Marla Singer (Helena Bonham Carter) starts going to the support groups too, the narrator is unable to get the sleep he needs again, to which point he meets a man named Tyler Durden (Brad Pitt) on an airplane. After the narrator's condo is blown up, he moves in with Tyler, eventually starting a ""Fight Club"" in the basement of a local bar where men emasculated by modern society can vent through beating each other up. After a while, the Club starts to commit acts of vandalism against capitalist and materialistic objects throughout the city. Eventually, the Club is taken over by Tyler, who turns it into Project Mayhem, which the narrator does not approve of. Tyler disappears, leading the narrator to follow him around the world where he keeps bumping into people part of Fight Club/Project Mayhem, where he realizes he is Tyler Durden, an alter ego created when he falls asleep from insomnia. Trying to stop ""Tyler,"" who is going to blow up all of the financial institutions in the city, the narrator is unsuccessful and the movie ends with Marla (who plays a minor role as ""Tyler's"" love interest) and the narrator, now Tyler watching the explosions of the skyscrapers from a construction site. One of the most interesting aspects about Fight Club is its relationship to much older ""film noirs"" of the 1940s. The lighting in the movie is an obvious example, with most of the movie in a high contrast state of the bright characters against a dark background. Most of the film takes place at night or indoors with minimal lighting coming from natural sources, the film is very expressionist in this regard. Fincher wants us, the audience, to see how the light looks, the contrasts, the rich blacks and grays, the muted colors of most of the cast, except for Tyler. The film is like this for the entire film, a dark, seedy underworld only exposed once the sun goes down and the artificial lighting humanity has created turns on. Shadows are engulfing, threatening to steal some of the characters from the scenes, disappearing from the film. Colors stand out in the film, Tyler's flamboyant clothing sticking out the most in the frame, almost popping out of the otherwise dark and muted movie. Every scene without Tyler is much drabber, the narrator's work is a good example of this, the extreme amount of white, gray, and brown in these scenes show how boring and mundane the narrator's life is without Tyler, the man who keeps the narrator entertained and on his toes. Another aspect of Fight Club, also connected to film noirs is the anti-materialistic view the film has, along with the air of mystery connected to Tyler and Project Mayhem. Throughout the second and third acts, Fight Club/Project Mayhem has a very clear anti- materialist and capitalist stance, showing continued vandalism against expensive neighborhoods, billboards, store displays, commercial art, chain stores and restaurants, and financial institutions. The film ends with the destruction of several credit card and banking companies to drive this stance home. Film noirs of the 40's also took this stance most of the time, the victims and perpetrators almost always rich, trying to become rich, powerful, trying to become powerful, married, cheated, jealous, or some combination thereof. The acts of violence in those films always had some ulterior or revenge motive, they were not random. The detectives or protagonists of these films were disillusioned by these problems, immune to the trials and tribulations of the cases they were working. Additionally, the mystery aspect of both also is important to both Fight Club and film noirs. Fight Club's mystery is almost hidden from the audience until the end of the second act when Tyler disappears, the fact their is a mystery at all is not totally apparent, but there is one, with a multitude of clues along the way that lead to that conclusion. Film noirs also have mysteries, but they are usually much more straightforward and obvious in existence, most film noirs, if not all, are crime-based, the mystery of ""whodunnit"" the driving force behind the plot. Fight Club and film noirs are very similar movie types, with Fight Club being a more modern film noir.Fight Club's mystery may not be apparent for a lot of the film, but when the movie is rewatched, a lot of elements early on clue into what the solution to the mystery is. Fight Club, a modern- day film noir brings the decades-old genre to a new generation of moviegoers, exposing them to the lighting style and ideas that the original film noirs had, with a more modern message and style.",Fight Club
3405,kxm-37680,Great Movie,10,28 September 2017,"Fight Club is the kind of movie that tugs at your inner demons. It'll make you take a step back and really question the life you're living. It's a powerful film that really puts you in the place of crazed Tyler Durden. Director David Fincher chose to take the route of a film noir over a classical film, and the genius of this choice lives on in the legacy that is Fight Club. The lighting, the camera angles, and the story all blend together to become an instant classic. Edward Norton plays a character who is stuck in a cycle of depression and insomnia. After a doctor recommendation, he attends support groups to let go and help his insomnia. He eventually meets Tyler Durden, a soap salesmen who changes his life forever. From the very beginning of the movie, the film is dark, and low lit, there are very little scenes with bright lighting. The film-noir- esque film focuses on not showing too much, and keeping dark overtones to make the audience feel on edge or more intrigued in different cases. Especially during scenes where the fight club is actually taking place, everyone's faces are shrouded around the outside, while the lone spotlight in the middle signifies the only thing that matters to the members of fight club. The film follows many of the same standards found in a film-noir, such as the dark, abandon and unkempt home, the heavy focus on using violence to get what you desire, and the idea of having a following, who will do as you wish regardless of the request. The narrator and Tyler's home is a rundown house, filled with leaks, trash, and mold everywhere. It really shows how driven the pair are to be different, and stray away from societal norms, and how little they care for living how an average person lives. It really emphasizes how far gone they are from sanity, and how far they are willing to go to stand for what they believe in. The way the members of fight club are portrayed says a lot about them as well. In the beginning, everyone fights with no shoes, and no shirts. They are seen as barbaric, stripping down to their roots to do only as instinct tells them. By the end however, they are dressed in all black, and the organization has drastically changed. They have gone from an organization built on liberating themselves, to an organization built on liberating others. The way the characters are portrayed shows visually the change from self-liberation, to organized crime. The way the film is shot is very effective as well. Often times we find ourselves seeing things directly from the eyes of the narrator, or right up in the character's faces. This style of up close and personal filming helps the audience establish a personal connection with them. The goes hand in hand with the dark lighting as well. We see close up faces and minimal lighting, and it really brings out the raw emotion and dark senses in the characters. Overall, Fight Club was a great movie, the plot was fantastic, and the twist caught me completely off guard. It was exciting to watch and I found myself constantly wondering where the story was going and wondering what was happening, until the ending completely reels you in. The dark lighting and abstract film angles emphasize the true nature of the Narrators mind. I would definitely recommend this movie to anyone who loves dark and brutal films with great and unexpected twists.",Fight Club
3406,ctt-10655,Welcome to Fight Club!,10,27 September 2017,"""Fight Club"" (1999) Review By Christopher Tran""Welcome to Fight Club. The first rule of Fight Club is: you do not talk about Fight Club. The second rule of Fight Club is: you DO NOT talk about Fight Club!"" At least that's what Tyler Durden, played by Brad Pitt, exclaimed when he first established the so-called ""club"" in the basement of a bar. Never could he have imagined such a simple rule could lead to the expansion of the club to simply multiply overnight. He along with the Narrator, played by Edward Norton, create a dynamic duo that could influence the lives of many in the film which eventually led to the many emotional and intense scenes. Originally a novel published by Chuck Palahniuk in 1996, the book would become a movie that would intrigue the thoughts of others into believing such a reality could exist in the U.S. at the time. While the time period for the film isn't specifically stated, it can be deduced to take place around the mid-90s. Multiple events throughout the film from explosions, riots, vandalism, to multiple personalities and various psychological disorders, make the film seem so realistic yet impossible for society at the time. The films realism approach with these multiple chaotic events gives it the dark noir vibe that most of David Fincher's, the director for this film, films take and also the reason he receives so much criticism from those who watch his films. This ""dark noir"" is depicted with multiple sexual scenes as well as vandalism and malicious activities centered around a crime driven film. The amount of suspense from the plot as well as the characters mixed personalities creates such an amazing film.Going to the characters, just by comparison the Narrator and Tyler Durden are strong opposites. Yet, they somehow create a bond that allows them to create their own society. A society where one looks up to the other, wanting to be like him, almost like the average movie duo where one is obedient to the other while the other has the more vocal personnel. What makes this film great is how the interactions between these two characters evolve, deconstructs and soon implodes under the realization of the Narrator and his dual personality is what creates the amount of tension evident in the film. The role of Marla Singer in the plot also has its impacts. An obstacle to the narrator becomes the romantic and sexual motivations for Tyler Durden's temporary relief. Despite what a nuisance she appears to be to the narrator by being the one mental block that interrupted his support group relief, she appears to be the main reason for the narrator to keep his mind straight especially during the time when he knows she would be in grave danger. Her psychological problems, as well as drug abuse, in the beginning, were there mainly to express the darkness of the crime central film and how some people at the time experienced some problems that she had to endure or bestowed upon herself.Diving into this film seems great, plot and all. A story that revolves around chaos, destruction, and conflict. A psychological game that plays not only with the viewers of the film but also with the other characters in the film that play along with the ""game"" with the addition of the double personalities. A love triangle that appears strange yet somehow begins to make more sense as the film plays out. And most of all the fight club that started it all, acting as both the psychotherapy and the personality development the story needed. This movie has it all, a must see!",Fight Club
3407,dsy-30212,A review of Fight Club.,8,28 September 2017,"Fight Club has many things going for it, when looking deep into the techniques used to relay the emotions and feelings desired. The one that stands out is the dim and sometimes pitch-black scenes that really put an ominous feeling over the scene. Another is the camera views chosen in this film. In many of the scenes there was a new placement for the camera to look at. Although there are many more film making techniques used throughout this film, these are the ones that really stood out when viewing the film.In order to give this film the right feel it only made sense to use a very dark and creepy lighting style. If this film had a light theme similar to something like a children's movie, it would have had a much different feel. And then the cinematographer would have not been able to relay the message that was intended. However, this film is not all dark. There is a good number of scenes in which a lighter theme is used. This is to give a very graphic and clear view of what is going on in these moments. This is most apparent in the scene in which the narrator is in his boss's office and is beating himself up. The lighting in this scene is such that you can see everything that is going on in vivid detail. Another example of this is the scene in which the members of project mayhem bring back Bob from their ""mission"" and everyone is arguing over what to do. Unlike most of the other chaotic scenes in this film the lighting of this scene is such that there is no question as to what has happened.In coordination with the lighting the camera angles and views are another key component to the successful portrayal of the desired theme. The use of the different types camera angles can add a lot of varied subconscious emotions. This allows for the cinematographer to relay these feelings while doing very little work. While this is the ideal scenario, it is not always that easy, which is why other methods exist, such as lighting and sound. Other subconscious notions that all work together. Some examples of scenes in which the camera angle added to the story telling affect include, most of the scenes that took place in the house. These camera movements and angles really make you feel like you are in a claustrophobic building. You also get the feeling of a lot of filth, which is amplified by how small the spaces feel. Another example of interesting angles are the ones used in the fight scenes. The camera was either up around head height, or pretty much on the floor. This was done to get really close up views to the people who were being beaten up on the floor. And to really show the gore and blood that was being flung everywhere in these fights.Over all these two techniques were both well utilized in order to relay the feeling and emotions desired by the director and the cinematographer. And to add to that they were used in almost aseamless way where it was just one flowing motion and it was sometimes difficult to be able to tell what techniques were being used over others. This is a testament to the talent of the talent of the director and cinematographer. To be able to envision these ideas before they were ever put onto a screen. As well as the editors and after effects people who can adjust all of these parameters after the whole film has been shot.",Fight Club
3408,eknyazici-85327,Fight Club,10,27 September 2017,"When I first heard the name of the movie (Fight Club) I thought ""Oh so it's basically just guys fighting the whole time. Like main character is probably a boxer or a fighter or something. It's not really worth watching."" I didn't think it was a kind of movie that I would enjoy. But, Fight Club is not just a movie where guys beat each other up because they have nothing else to do. On the contrary, the movie has really clear statements about the society that we live in. During the last week of school of my junior year of high school, we would watch a different movie everyday because we didn't have class. One of the movies we watched during that week was Fight Club and I think I was the least excited person in the class about watching that movie. However, throughout the movie, I had a great time. I absolutely loved the movie and it's definitely one of my favorite movies. It was definitely not what I thought it was going to be. I liked everything about it, it was great until the end. I've watched that movie multiple times and I still watch it without getting bored. I can watch it again and again and it will never get old or boring. Fight Club is a really unique movie. It's intense, aggressive, deep, dark and maybe disturbing for others. However, all those things made the movie a lot better and in my opinion more successful. The movie was brilliant, in my opinion, from the script, the lighting, the music, cast choice, to the acting. I'm not a person who knows a lot of thing about movies, or lighting, or settings of movies but from what I know everything was brilliant in this movie. The lighting throughout the movie, in different scenes matched perfectly. It helped the person who was watching it understand the scene or the seriousness of it better. The screenplay was definitely perfect according to what I think and I think casting couldn't have been better. The cinematography, pacing, twists, transitions are excellent. I've seen a lot of movies of Brad Pitt and Edward Norton and I can say that Fight Club produced their best performance. I thought they were the best fit for the characters. The movie begins with a narration from a person who we know as ""narrator."" It goes on by showing how he lives his life basically. What he does at work, at home, etc. It helps the viewer to get to know the narrator and this happens throughout the movie. Norton plays the narrator (we are never given his name). Starting from the beginning of the movie, he tries to find something that will change his average life. He is living this boring, dead-end life. He is trying to find meaning in his little life. Tyler and Marla help the narrator and change the narrator's life. Tyler is almost everything that the narrator wants to be. He is spontaneous, does whatever he wants, etc. These two personalities go well until they start to kind of destroy each other. And the love triangle that came with Marla makes things more complicated than it already is. When I watch a movie, the first thing I really want to know is how the movie is going to end because the filmmakers make either something big or something small for the end. I am not going to tell the ending because I do not want to spoil it for anyone but the ending was definitely amazing just like the rest of the movie.I would definitely recommend this movie to everyone. It is an amazing movie. I will never get bored of watching Fight Club. It should be on everyone's list of movies that they should watch.",Fight Club
3409,iceemrr,Fight Club Film Analysis,10,27 September 2017,"One of the most noticeable elements that was employed in the film Fight Club was the use of production design. The entire film had a dark feel to it, and the production design was composed in such a way that the darkness of the film progressed throughout its length. In the beginning of the film, the costume and set were selected in a way that seemed realistic, as though to appeal to our sense of connection to the character in the film. Despite this, the lighting, and of course the narration from the main character led us to notice something was clearly amiss. The main character was certainly not the average person.After having watched the film, one subtle, yet extremely powerful instance of foreshadowing happens when the main character narrates: ""If you wake up in a different time, in a different place, could you wake up as a different person?"" The camera then pans to centre the motion around Tyler, as if to show that maybe the main character could wake up as Tyler. The irony of this is, of course, that the main character really does wake up as Tyler, but the element is subtle because, at this point in the film, the viewer has yet to be formally exposed to Tyler.Throughout the film, Tyler's and the main character's are always in contrast. Through his costume, Tyler is portrayed as laid back, care- free, and dare I say it, cool. On the other hand, the main character generally tries to dress more formally, depending on the occasion. However, as the film progresses, the main character seems to become increasingly like Tyler. The main character shows up to work in tattered clothes, a sharp contrast to the suit and tie that he always wore for the first 40 or so minutes of the film. It gets to the point where the only difference in Tyler and the main character's outfit is an undone bow-tie, seen in the scene where they coerce the mayor. The bond that the main character feels toward Tyler and his ideas quickly dissipates when Bob is killed, and their outfits return to being highly contrasting, to show that the main character is no longer on Tyler's 'side'.After the main character, and the audience, realise that he is really Tyler Durden, the film switches between realistic and formalistic shots. When the main character is getting beat up by Tyler in the garage, the main action is more formalistic, as it is known that what we are seeing is just happening in the main character's head. However, the camera frequently switches to security cameras, which is fitting being that they are in a car garage. This different photography shows what is happening in the 'real world' as it shows the main character just throwing himself around, and causing severe injury to himself in the process. By adding this to the film, some context is brought into how the main character could have actually believed that Tyler was a separate person. His mind is so warped, that he can seriously injure himself just from his mind playing tricks on him. Despite the physical location of the shots being completely different (one being in the garage, and the other in the security room) the film is edited so the transition is seamless and continuity is preserved completely. This makes the transition between the formalistic and realistic shots fluid with the action and not seem jarring or out of place. The music in this scene also assists the director in getting his point across. The music is like what would be played in a horror film, with high- pitched, fast violins, and strange sounds. This helps to build an almost nightmarish atmosphere in the film as it seems like what the main character is experiencing is something most people only ever face in a bad dream. He is utterly helpless to the wrath of Tyler and the thrilling music makes the audience feel some of the terror that the main character is feeling in this scene.",Fight Club
3410,ajv-63385,Such a Classic,9,28 September 2017,"This film although quite a mental thriller sides with a sense of classical cinema. This movie falls between realism and an avant-garde. Many of the events taken play may have happened before as well as can happen in the future. The final scene does get a little extreme but theoretically an act of terrorism similar to that could occur. Due to the film being narrated by a character, there is more freedom for the story to be twisted around a bit. Everything can be twisted due to complexity of an unstable mind, leading to a more artistic stance.The lighting in Fight Cub was minimal, casting shadows around every corner. Although the lighting set the mood for the movie, it was used realistically. Nothing was un-natural, some of which I have experienced myself. Turning off the power to the house while it rained created a sense of realism. I'm not saying everyone does that, but when it comes to living in a house that is falling apart and leaking, it is something that should be taken care of. The basement scenes were great when it came to the lighting, there was little to none. It lowered our senses, making it more difficult to track what is going one, and get lost in the pure violence that was going on between two people. One film that comes to mind, using light as an expression of feeling is Limitless. Every time the main character takes a performance enhancing drug, the lighting around the world changes. Everything is more vibrant and energizing and contrast was enhanced to give the viewer a chance to walk in the main character's shoes.Now let's talk about the shots. Fight Club covers all of the classic types of shots, from static to full motion this film seams it all together flawlessly. Close up shots made the fights personal, giving the viewer a chance to be in the shoes of the narrator. Being this close, raises the heart rate, nothing matters but this fight. The viewer is forced to watch the violence and there is no chance of getting out, just like the narrator taking punches. Extreme long shots were used when setting the scene. Displaying the whole back of the bar and the parking lot took the minimized the violence. It gave the viewer a chance to watch it from afar. The fight is meaningless and the viewer is no longer attached to it. It doesn't affect anyone but Tyler and the Narrator. This distance adds a sense of humor to lighten the mood. When the random guys come out of the back of the bar, the viewer sees what any onlooker sees, a fight between two people over an important reason. This adds a sense of humor to lighten the mood. The viewer knows they are beating each other up for fun, but the other guys see it as a serious fight between two drunks that should be broken up.The production design crew did a fantastic job creating the apartment for the narrator. Filing it up with furniture to make it look similar to an Ikea magazine. This is a major part for setting up the story, showing how materialistic the narrator is. Also a slight foreshadowing with the yin and yang table. As the narrator transforms, he becomes less materialistic, he loses a sense of what it's like to own nice things, and does not miss it. He even points out that after a month of no television, he almost forgot it existed. The costume design department did a nice job on the narrator's work attire. Starting off well dressed with a tie and clean pressed shirt and eventually changing to an unbuttoned coffee and blood stained shirt. I noticed Tyler's shirt at the end was very unusual looking. After doing some research I learned that the shirt he wore was covered in pornographic magazine covers. The rating association made sure to tone down the movie to receive its R rating, but they completely missed the nude images portrayed on the shirt. That shirt really resembled what Tyler stood for.",Fight Club
3411,tmg-84458,very good movie 8 out of 10,8,28 September 2017,"In David Fincher's 1999 Fight Club Edward Norton's character is a depressed insomniac that is stuck in his boring life but looking for an escape. In an attempt to find his escape he attends support groups, until Marla Singer(Helena Bonham Carter) starts to do the same thing that he is doing. When he see's this he is distraught and doesn't know what to do until he finds Brad Pitt's Tyler Durden. Soon after they move in together and begin fight club, a club for men to get together to relieve there aggression and problems. The club quickly develops in to something very different; They start vandalizing around the city as a means to topple the country's social structure, and fight club becomes project Mayhem. As Edward Norton's Tyler Durden gain's knowledge of the larger plan he begins to hunt down Brad Pitt's Tyler Durden to stop all of this, but he soon realizes that Brad Pitt's Tyler Durden is a figment of his imagination and he is the one that caused all of this. The film ends with Edward Norton's Tyler Durden watching buildings collapse and the social structure topple as he wanted. Although film noir is not a style that has a happy ending we see many elements of film noir through out Fight Club. So is this a film noir or just a film with many film noir elements. Film noir has many key elements to it such as lighting flash backs and voice overs. It also has many key story elements such as loss, nostalgia, lack of priorities. Through out the film we see many of the elements that go into a film noir such as lighting. Lighting has a key importance in this film, it is very expressive and high key used to show the modes of the scenes. The lighting plays a huge role in the scenes where fight club is held in the basement of the bar. The fight scenes are very dark and mysterious only having enough light to show what is happening. When light is put on someones face only half of their face can be seen, this adds to the idea that you are not yourself when your in fight club; By only showing half a face you do not show someone's entire identity but only part of it. Another way lighting is used is in showing dominance in the fights. The scene in which Edward Norton's Tyler Durden is on top of one of the members and punching his head in to the ground we see that his face is light from the bottom this is showing dominance over his opponent. This scene is also interesting because of the camera angle. In this scene a low camera angle is used to show Edward Norton's Tyler Durden's dominance over the other fighter. The camera along with the lighting give him a different type of dominance and power almost making him look sinister. These are two prime examples of very stylized lighting that is used in the film. On top of the fight scenes being dark and mysterious the entire moving tends to be quite dark with only few scenes with actual full lighting. The majority of the light seen through out the film tends to be very dim with the backgrounds tending to be very dark. Other key elements such as flash backs and voice overs are also seen through out the film. Flash backs are a big piece to this film, the entire film is a flash back. In the beginning of the film we see Edward Norton's Tyler Durden tied up and being held by Brad Pitt's Tyler Durden; The film is one large flash back of how he got in to that position. Along with Flash backs you will see voice overs, those two go hand in hand. These are two big elements of film noir and they are seen through the entire movie not just parts of it. Other than the elements of film noir the muse en scene in fight club also stood out. Through out the entire film Edward Norton's and Brad Pitt's Tyler Durden both were in the center of the frame. This showing that they are the center of attention and are the most important characters through out the film. This also shows their dominance over other characters throughout the film being in the center of the screen. Another thing that happens through out the film is that when Edward Norton and Brad Pitt are in the same frame Edward Norton is in the center and Brad Pitt is off to the side a little. This has to do with the plot and how they are related. Brad Pitt's Tyler Durden is made up by the imagination of Edward Norton's character so it makes sense that Edward Norton is in the center and Brad Pitt is off to the side a little. Is this a film noir or just a film with film noir elements; This is a film noir, there are a multitude of film noir elements and themes. So this is a film noir that happens to have a happy ending.",Fight Club
3412,mattoel-83948,A story about an emotionless man who changes his life after meeting a man named Tyler and a woman named Marla,10,28 September 2017,"Fight Club ReviewFight Club is a bizarre film. It has a weird sense of pacing, the plot is extremely lucid and seemly has no overarching goal, the main character is extremely off-putting and doesn't even have a name, and many other elements of the film are strangely put together. Fight Club is an extremely experimental film that tries to break a majority of the set-rules of cinema, but does this leave it a shallow stylistic mess? Absolutely not! Despite its very odd presentation Fight Club is an extremely brilliant film, that holds a tremendous amount of depth.Fight Club is a black-noir film, which means the story is narrated from the point of view of the main character. Being a black-noir film is also carries a few noir flavored troupes, being that the movie has a mysterious atmosphere, contains many twists and turns, depicts a cynical view of the modern world, and of course contains a whole lot of gritty violence and sex! What I found funny about this film is how it can shift from being dark and violent, to hilariously immature, to deep and intellectual. I love these types of juxtapositions sense they do a great job of keeping the audience off kilter. An aspect I love about Fight Club is the excessive amount of theming and symbolism used. Almost every object, location, or person represents an important aspect of the character or of an overall theme. (Spoiler warning!) For example when the main characters fancy apartment is a representation of his personality. The apartment has all of the essential things for living and looks very presentable, but it has nothing with sentimental value and looks as if no one has even been living there. The main character focuses on being presentable and having the appearance of a whole person, but in reality lacks substance and emotional attachments. This metaphor is pushed further when the main characters house is burned down and he describes seeing his destroyed fridge as ""embarrassing, fridge full of condiments and with no food"". This further represents the idea that main character is the same way, full of ornamentation and with no substance. (Spoiler end). Personally I'm a sucker for clever symbolism and theming as it adds a deeper meaning to the actions of each character and of each scene. I wouldn't say it's any substitute for a good plot, but it definitely adds to the overall quality of the film, especially when it's done as subtle as this film. The cinematography of this film is spot on! Each scene's lighting and camera angle is manipulated in such a way that it forces the viewer to feel a plethora of emotions. Many fight scenes brilliantly use the lighting to only show the highlights of the characters bodies, and keeps their faces in the dark. This is done to intensify each blow that dealt between fighters and to help portray just how gruesome it is. Many scenes are filmed indoors and are set-up with a very claustrophobic feeling. This is to heightened the theme of entrapment that a majority of the characters feel within their lives. There are many other cinematography ticks used throughout the film, some being extremely connected to the films major plot twist. To catch some of these subtle foreshadows sprinkled throughout the film, I highly suggest watching the film multiple times to try. The last thing to talk about is the plot. I've been avoiding touching this since this film is best watched with as little information as possible. The key things I want to address is despite the film seemingly like it has little main goal or plot, there is a rather hidden main point of the film. The film overall is a story about a man who meets a man named Tyler and a woman named Marla, and it shows how the friendships he made with the two ultimately push the main character to change his life, for better or for worse. The film breaks a lot of rules about narrative progression but it still feels like a solid and well thought out story that's definitely worth a watch!Overall Fight Club is a fantastic story with a lot of depth and I definitely recommend it to those who enjoy thrillers, and mysteries.",Fight Club
3413,cap-78153,Fight Club Review,9,28 September 2017,"Do you really know when one situation ends and another begins? Are there gaps in your memory, where for some reason, you can't remember how you got somewhere? No? Well this is the case for the unnamed narrator in Fight Club. Looking for change, a depressed insomniac living a gray boring life is looking for relief; relief from the humdrum grind of his life. This leads into the emotion of the movie. Darkness shrouds the film at every corner. Seemingly to represent the crushing weight of uselessness the narrator feels towards his life. The darkness that encompasses nearly every scene almost allows the viewer to feel the weight and pressure of the narrators life. A justification for using this type of lighting may be because of how the story was being told. Narration occurred solely by the unnamed narrator, the main character. The audience is only allowed to see the story through his perspective. This leads into time gaps that occur in the film. Since the audience can only see the story from his perspective, the audience is limited to the knowledge that he has. For example, Tyler Durden, his alter-ego remains as a separate person throughout most of the movie. Time-gaps are also evident This limitation of perspective allows the narrator to shape what the audience thinks of him. Towards the end of the movie, the audience gets a glimpse of reality through the cameras in the parking garage. There are many situations within Fight Club that try to clue the audience into the fact that Tyler Durden and the narrator are actually the same person. These become much more evident towards the end of Fight Club. Tyler tells the narrator not to talk to anyone about him. This is an attempt to prevent others from revealing who Tyler Durden really is. It's actually a very intelligent way to partition his mind like this. However, the narrator himself realizes something is wrong very early in the movie. At one points he attempts to consult a professional asking him if he could die from insomnia or narcolepsy which involves appearing in places but can't remember how you got there. This scene shows directly that the narrator is experiencing this and is worried. If the narrator had gotten professional help and was prescribed medicine to treat his neurological illness, the acts of terrorism at the end of the movie might not have ever happened. A possible suggestion towards the narrators neurological illness was the beginning animation. During the starting credits, a brain and neurons with electrical impulses is shown at the beginning of Fight Club. This could have hinted towards the neurological illnesses that the narrator has and will face. The movie also used camera angles to help the audience experience what the characters in the movie were feeling. During the fight scenes, a lot of the time there was a bottom up view of the fight5ers. This happened especially when the narrator want barbaric on the blond man and beat him until he had sustained heavy injuries. This was to show the audience the position that the blond man was in, showing the true ferocity of the narrator. However, this isn't always the case. Other times throughout the movie camera angles seemed pretty neutral or just moved with the flow of the characters to provide a fluid viewing experience for the audience. During the end of the movie, the camera shot was used to show the vastness of the city being dismantled by Tyler's destruction. Fight Club also includes those strange up close and free moving, almost untethered shots where scenarios are shown such as when the narrators apartment is blown up or the 10 bombs that are scattered around the city. All of these shots together in one movie give the audience a unique perspective.",Fight Club
3414,jth-66514,Consumerism in Film,8,28 September 2017,"Fight club is a very interesting look at the the way we live our lives compared to how we want to and what the reality of our dreams could look like. The Narrator lives the quintessential ""American Dream"" a decently paying job with travel around the country and more material items than he knows what to do with. And when life turns down for him, his apartment blows up, he realizes he has nobody to turn to. This in itself would of been a travesty of life but as is revealed toward the end of the film, the Narrator did this to himself. I view this as the manifestation of the Narrator's distaste in his current life. He lives a life trapped in his own discomfort, going to cancer meetings and pretending to be dealing with real issues when in fact he is dealing with depression stemming from his hatred of his own affluence. Once he has to face this reality, by Marla Singer also feeding off the pain of others. Her character is more emotionally complex in that she lives in a crack apartment and steals for food. She doesn't have superficial problems with her life, she has real issues and things to have a reason for being upset or hating existing. Maybe her reason for false consolation is her inability to face real adversity. Just like how the Narrator can't face his life sucks and hates it. Fincher's use of framing throughout the film creating a feeling of claustrophobia, putting the viewer in the mental state of the Narrator. All the action is centrally focused with external characters rounding out the shots. The end shot of the credit buildings falling is the first example of an open frame. This connects emotionally to the Narrator for the first time allowing another human being to embrace him in a non violent or aggressive fashion. Fincher also used lighting on an emotional level throughout the film. Even during shots during the day time there was an aura of darkness around the Narrator, again the film didn't seem bright or with life until the final explosion shot as the building falling seemed to be acting as fireworks in celebration of his personal escape from his self made prison. Costuming of the characters was also brilliant. As the gaudy outfits of Tyler and Marla seemed to exemplify what a regular person would think would happen to anybody if they lived at a slot machine for 5 years and took a flight to New York City. The underlying message of the film however seems to be kind of fuzzy. It is very obviously anti consumerism and an attempt to show the furthest extent that a person can be pushed to when they live their life defined by what they own. However the film itself doesn't seem to be outside of this corporate influence. As Pepsi has a prominent presence on the screen, even featuring an actual Pepsi ad in front of the news report on the smiley face building. This could be seen as an active decision, seeing the irony in this and allowing it anyways. But I don't buy that. It seems that the main message is fogged down by the true reality of modern film. As much we want to believe they are free forms of creativity and free from foreign influence. They still need to be funded and still need to appeal to as many as possible. So as creative a movie Flight Club was, even its anti consumerism message cant escape the grasp of what has become big Hollywood controlling what gets made and what is inside these films.",Fight Club
3415,yxf8054,A Film Every Millennial Needs To See,10,4 October 2017,"After watching Fight Club blown away by the plot twist, I wondered why it took me such a long time to come around to watching it. The moment my first screening of Fight Club ended was just like the first time I saw Memento. My mind was blown away and I could only think how did the screenwriters created such a radical and genius screenplay. The way the story is told and presented on the screen is intensely engaging that I was sucked into the story and I became ""the narrator"". Born as a millennial, I felt that this is one of the most important films that every young person needs to see. It is amazing but also shameful that this film made in 1999 is still relevant today. These days the population is still occupied with people who are unhappy about their life. There is a statistic which says that in the US one of the most well-off countries, over 70% of people hate their jobs. Basically, spending years of their lives miserable. This dull and harsh reality is illustrated in Fight Club with the ""Film Noir"" style, realistic lighting and the minor-key soundtracks which creates a dark mood. It shows you from the start that this film is about getting to the pointno more lying to ourselves, and it's time to wake up. This is the journey that the narrator takes in the film. Tyler Durden is there to help the narrator to awaken from his life of indoctrination. Fight Club is a modern Film Noir. The filmmakers of Fight Club were able to reflect the time in place the film was created. Fight Club is set during late capitalism after the war, where people were consumed by consumerism. Subsequently, this is also when many men became the sensitive new man of the 1990's, which closely reflect the narrator especially his obsession with IKEA furniture. Rather than working for power or building himself up, he purchases things to create his identity. Moreover, the low-key lighting and overall darkness of Fight Club possibly reflects the harsh reality of how these men perceived the world during ""(the) great depression (of) our lives"" quote from Tyler Durden. In addition, to add to the theme of consumerism. David Fincher stated that there is a Starbucks coffee cup or a logo in every scene of the movie. Starbucks is one of the most recognizable franchise in the world and it is a great example of people's dependency and addiction to materialism.One of the most noteworthy characteristic of Fight Club is its unique and out of the ordinary story-line. As stated earlier it is an experience similar to watching Memento. The story is formed in a way that the experience of the audience mirrors one of the narrator. The first time the narrator finally realizes that him and Tyler are the same person, the audience is equally confused as the narrator and cannot believe everything that has happened. Nowadays, I feel like the cinema is dominated by films with predictable story lines where the story is just spoon fed to viewers, made by studios with big budgets and revenue as utmost importance. In my life time, it seemed to me that there were not many films like Fight Club where I actually enjoyed being confused after the first screening and still enjoy watching it for the second time with the same amount of engagement as the first. The whole film experience was like completing a puzzle. With some online research, I was able to find answers to lingering questions. Then watching it for the second time I was able to make sense of everything and it was a satisfying moment.Fight Club isn't just a film with incredible cinematography and screenplay. It is philosophy and is a catalyst for many to live a full life. Tyler Durden is really someone that the young generation need, he delivers all the most important lessons in life. If you want a big wake up call in your life, something that breaks your pattern this is the film to go back to.",Fight Club
3416,brk-38847,Ironic Anti-Corporate Message,6,4 October 2017,"The 90s were a time that focused on anti-corporate propaganda, where movies were openly mocking the corporate American life style where people were drones that worked their 9-to-5 job looking for an escape from the repetitiveness of their lives. Movies such as the Fight Club depicted their main protagonists in dull business attire, bland colors to drive the point home of the bland lives that these characters were living until their opportunity for release came along. Camera movement in these scenes were particularly slow and the camera would only zoom into Norton's face to emphasize the daily struggle he was experiencing in his life. After an explosion at his apartment, Norton is given the opportunity to escape the norm of everyday life as everything he has done in his life thus far is now gone. Fight Club mocks this scene as the first part of its anti-corporate message where Norton's entire collection Ikea furniture is now destroyed. However, Norton was lucky he recently met Tyler Durden, a man who encompasses all the traits that Norton wishes he also encompassed, a man who actively destroys the social norms such as splicing pornographic content into a family film and peeing in soup containers at a high-class restaurant. With nowhere else to turn, Norton seeks out Durden in an attempt to chase a life away from corporate structure. The house, is run down and decrepit, with a basement that floods anytime it rains, sketchy electrical connections and one that barely provides shelter, one that most Americans would choose not to live in. It is when he moves in with Durden that Norton learns of Fight Club, an organization that allows men to free themselves and express their masculinity by fighting one another until the other taps out. In the fight scenes themselves, the lighting stages the fights as being the focal point of the images, but blacks out along the first row of the ring of other fighters symbolizing that these fights are salvation for these men who are done with their mundane lives. The lighting in these scenes also tie into the movies anti-corporate message saying that nothing matters to these men in the outside world, the only thing that matters are these fights. As the movie progresses more subtle changes occur. As Norton chases his more perfect life, we see Durden become a more prominent character in the film, taking up more screen time and Norton seeming to suffer from his insomnia more severely than ever. Durden pushes Norton to become more daring in his actions to chase a high of living that Fight Club itself can no longer satisfy. This manifests itself as Project Mayhem which becomes the physical destruction of corporate life in the movie as the Fight Club evolves and becomes a terrorist group focused on destroying shops and statues that worship the corporate life. The ultimate goal is the destruction of ten skyscrapers among the city, but steps are taken to ensure that only the corporations are attack and innocent civilians are not caught up in the destruction. To emphasize the actual destruction, multiple camera angles are used which and at the point of impact, slow motion is used. The destruction also sees the lighting transition from dark before the terroristic act begin to the scenes being lit up by the explosions to show a relief on corporate America from the chains that Norton and Durden feel as though they are unshackling for the common corporate worker. However, some of the anti-corporate messages are lost when product placement sees the movie ironically being endorsed by the corporations that it is trying to portray as destroying the American dream. The thrill ride and twist ending make Fight Club an enjoyable movie, if not one that almost was lost in how ironic it could become.",Fight Club

I was told by a friend to rent the film again and watch it until the end, because I walked out of the first viewing half way through and I ""missed the whole point."" The film does make a poignant statement, albeit in a very graphic manner.Honestly I don't care how clever it is, that level of violence is absolutely and completely gratuitous despite all the claims to the contrary. I'm not a prude; I loved Scarface, Blow, Full Metal Jacket, etc. The violence in those films rose to the level that supported and enhanced the plots. Not only did the violence in Fight Club exceed what was necessary to get the point across, it exceeded the threshold of what most people can tolerate. I know some will say that's the point, but I disagree. The violence is nearly pornographic. How anyone has the stomach to get through this movie is beyond me.

In the movie was directed by David Fincher and stars Brad Pitt. Edward and Helena Bonham Carter.A nameless first person narrator played by the star Edward Norton attends report groups in attempt to suede his emotional state and relieve his insomnia. When he meets Marla interpreted by the actress Helena Bonham Carter, another face attendee of the support groups, his life sens to become a little more bearable. However, when he associates himself with Tyler, played by the known actor Bra Pitt, he is dragged into an underground fight club. Together the two men spiral out of control and engage in competitive rivalry for love and power. The way the film is directed is brilliant and the manner of David Fincher would appeal to any watcher. What i liked the most were the scenes which had lot of energies and also included many interesting details in shots too. I was pleasantly surprised by the camera's techniques which created a focusing illusion on Edward Norton's character, displaying how he feels alone. I believe that the cast was exceptionally and the actors provides some elements benefice for the movie. Moreover, the soundtrack is perfect for the film and it's numerous themes. Like the film, it jumps all over the place and comes at you from different directions.In conclusion, ""Fight Club"" is a high quality, impressive and my all time favorite movie and i would recommend it to anyone.This review contains some spoiler's, don't blame me, i love this movie :)",Fight Club

We think a movie can have certain limitations on its effect and direction but this movie shows you how awesome and well-directed a movie can be. This movie is about male aggression, not just aggression, it is a wrong word, it shows how much non-alive we are. So a guy starts fight club to have some sort of aliveness in a person. He is a visionary man, tyler durden, who has a plan and an entirely different approach to the modern generation. What follows is a roller coaster ride and a one which you wont possibly forgot till you die.The acting is brilliant and so are the one liners.Even before the ending you are tightly gripped by this movie and i assure you at the end you will be overly surprised.

As far as I'm concerned, this is the best movie to ever hit the screen. The dialog, the actors, the storyline, it's just flawless.It's the story about a man in his late 20's, (his name never told, but is often credited as Jack, or simply The Narrator, brilliantly played by Edward Norton) who lives a totally pointless life. He is a slave under the new Ikea furniture-trend, and works a typical office job. All this change when he meets Tyler, (Brad Pitt) an eccentric soap-maker/seller who believes that the true way to salvation lies in self-destruction. Together they form Fight Club, where every man can release themselves in a one-on-one fight. But Tylers plans stretches beyond Fight Club, into something much bigger, and ""Jack"" is not sure he is up for the ride.",Fight Club

3465,faydoedeelay2004,One of the best movies of our generation.,10,24 March 2006,"Warning: This comment may contain spoilers, if you do not want to read spoilers, please skip this comment.Ever felt like you've been dominated by the society? Driven only by your career, work and the IKEA Company? Are you tired of it? If so, then this movie is a must see for you.Fight Club deals about the life of a rather depressed person, simply named as Narrator in the movie, who has a rather pathetic job, pathetic life, pathetic past and surely a pathetic future. And, he hates it. Suffering from insomnia, he gets addicted to visiting various counseling groups. The pain of others make him feel, more or less, alive. Aware of his own, rather worthless, existence. This all changes when the Narrator meets Tyler Durden, a man who you could describe as an anarchist. Preaching the rejection of material possessions and just live. Every week, Narrator, Tyler and others meet and just fight. Not for the glory, victory, but just for the sake of being alive.From here on forward, I will no longer really focus on the plot itself, but more on the story. More of the bigger spoilers will follow, so, if you don't want to read major spoilers, don't read any further, and just watch this brilliant gem.A rather simplistic story you might say, however, it goes beyond the standard Hollywood action-flick. I'm going as far to say that the actual fighting in this movie is just a way of making the point of the real story. It's not about the fighting, or the gore and blood. It's about alienation with oneself, about the fact that most of us forget to live, and just lose themselves in their work and other activities.The character Tyler Durden, brilliantly performed by Brad Pitt (who shows once and for all that he's more then just a Hollywood star) is not a real human being, but just the basic instinct, a hallucination, of a man who has alienated himself from reality, from life. Tyler is everything Narrator should be. Free of all pain and suffering, enlightened. Simply put. He is free.Everyone who has every questioned the meaning of life (and I'm not referring to that brilliant Monty Python movie!) is sure to get a thrill out of Fight Club. It makes you think, perhaps question, your perceptions about life, or perhaps reinforce them.A must see movie and surely one of the best movies of our generation. Perhaps even one of the best in the history of cinema.",Fight Club

If you are a average person likes cinema you may like this movie, if you identify with the narrator maybe you will feel a bit bad but will sleep and say well its just a movie, and wake up nothing changes, but if you've ever get to a conclusion near to tyler durden toughts you will get what the movie is all about.With the right perspective you ll realize you are watching best critique to modern society you ll ever see. Every dialog is a pearl every detail even hidden is a explicit part of the movie, as tyler says "" You gotta learn to pay attention to what does not matters.But if you want a nice movie it has violence, comedy, sex everything you need in your single portion of fun.",Fight Club

This film is similar to David Fincher's other critical success - se7en. Both films are beautifully shot, Fincher's cinematography is characteristically dark but captivating and beautiful. However Fight Club, much like se7en, fails to capture me in its narrative. The message of this film is that consumerism is making everyone a slave to society, suppressing every man's inner urges and masculinity, so people should be allowed to express their inner primal urges (but not let it entirely consume you). This is well discussed in films, and not new, but to the film's credit it deals with it in an imaginative - but not subtle - way. Brad Pitt and Helena Bonham Carter are great, but I failed to get invested in any of them to be honest. A well shot and imaginative yet underwhelming film. 7/10.",Fight Club

This movie has a lot going for it to be one of the best ever made, the plot is outstanding, the characters are dark, alluring (although at first not a fan of Brad Pitt's work i became one after the film; Edward Norton is GOD, the way he molded to Palahniuk's character is incredible, and Helena Bonham Carter is...well she's disturbing, crazy and why not... quite hot portraying Marla:) ), Fincher, i think ,has made willingly or not one of the best cult movies ever, the lights, the aura of every scene is spot on to the feeling the book gives you...

3493,bookfencer,A helpful understanding,10,8 November 2018,"A lot of people have this movie all wrong. Especially the ones giving it the negative reviews. This movie isn't about following in Tyler Durdens footsteps which a lot of of people on both sides think.Now I only allow myself to have one 10 star movie and one 10 star tv-show(band of brothers). This movie is my number 10. This movie starts out showing us how much of our society is brainwashed and dull. How nothing we do is fulfilling. It's takes you through the narrators life of buying useless junk that is supposed to make him feel better.Then he meets Tyler Durden. Tyler Durden in the begging is the hero of the movie. He shows people how dull and asleep they are. He forces them to follow dreams that society has made them push far down. The narrator made him because as said in the movie ""it's not till you lose everything that you are free to do anything."" And the narrator had lost everything. He was a complete loser and made a strong personality for himself that took over. Tyler was the one that woke him and many others up to the toxic society they lived in.Unless you've seen the movie many Times the next part might not be as clear but Tyler then becomes the villain/antagonist. He used his influence to cause terror. The writers try to make you understand in the end that Tyler is no longer the one to look to. It's trying to show you that we as a society follow the strongest personality and don't do things for ourselves.The movie starts out showing us that we are dull society and uses Tyler to portray a way out. To get out of consumerism and wake up follow our dreams. It then turns the movie around after the narrator wakes up. The movie then try's to tell us that we as a society need to stop following the strongest personality. It again uses Tyler Durden to portray this but in a negative light as the narrator is now the protagonist.As for the reviewers giving negative reviews for the plot holes and calling themselves ""cultured"" I've seen 80% of the top 250 and almost all of the classics out of that. This is one of the best movies I've seen at covering all of it's holes. The narrator is an insomniac and therefore cannot sleep giving Tyler plenty of time to do his work. Just because the movie isn't 25 hours long and shows you how Tyler does everything doesn't mean that you cannot use your brain to put two and two together. You have to watch this move many times to even have an understanding of it and watching it once and deciding it's not to your level is childish and shows how little you know.",Fight Club
3494,stpartington,bad -- very bad,2,10 April 2006,"This is one of the silliest movies I have ever seen.It is not only not credible that such clubs exist; the motivation of the characters in this film to act the way they do is simply not believable.Having said that the performances are quite good. Brad Pitt and Edward Norton always deliver consistent well rounded performances. It is unfortunate that their efforts are wasted here due to an unsatisfactory script and an incredible plot line.The ending of the film is especially unsatisfying and .... well, weird. I guess one should have expected that from the lengthy period of grief that precedes it. The performances probably rate more than a 2 rating, but I think it deserves a rap on the knuckles just in case someone wants to make Fight Club II",Fight Club

3501,neilsgrayson,Genius,10,3 May 2006,"Every frame of this movie has meaning. There is no wasted film at all! I love the use of ""first person"" voice over from Edward Norton (one of my favorite actors). This movie has it all, boy finds girl, boy screws girls head, boy loses girl, boy blows up buildings, boy gets girl but doesn't know it! Wow!!! I only watched this movie because I enjoyed Brad Pitt in ""12 Monkeys"" and, as mentioned earlier, I love Ed Norton. Anyway, the story threw me for a loop, I thought it would be a bunch of macho crap about fighting... OK there is some of that, but that does not even come close to what the movie is all about. If you watch this movie and don't put it in your top 10 list, your top 10 list must be full of musicals.",Fight Club

I find myself avoiding it whenever it happens to be showing and couldn't bring myself to watch It a third time. I didn't enjoy Brad Pitt's performance and found it to be one of his random but similar crazy people characters like his character in 12 monkeys among other fommsbhes done the same performance in like later on in seven. Snatch was and is his best movie ever, this however is just a nonsense movie as my grandfather would have called it.",Fight Club

It's entertaining, it has great visuals and a good soundtrack, very good actors and a mind blowing story with subliminal messages that perhaps let you think completely different about your life! This also is one of few movies I can watch again and again. Most movies become boring once you know the whole story, but this one gets even more exciting. You'll notice details you will sure have missed before and perhaps there is just another aha-effect after watching it a few times. I have the special edition DVD with some very interesting extras you shouldn't miss too. Tyler says: get this movie and watch it!",Fight Club

3515,theshortguy28,Truly a thought provoking film,10,16 October 2007,"It's strange that I put off viewing this movie for a long while. The title is misleading and does not summarise the true notion of this film. 'Fight Club' is a top notch movie in all aspects. The introduction sequence cleverly interests the viewer from the moment the feature begins. It's truly amazing that this movie works on so many levels, from the ideas that it puts forth, to the way it's shot to convey them.Both Edward Norton's and Brad Pitt's characters are excellently portrayed, and they pique the viewers curiosity in many ways; despite being seemingly polar opposites, they have great chemistry. Their growth throughout the movie is exciting, and Marla's (Helena Bonham Carter) character adds the little bit of 'love' interest to mix things up (hectically). It was intriguing that I found Tyler's (Brad Pitt's) character more likable than The Narrator's, (Edward Norton) despite him being a rambunctious anarchist and The Narrator being the typical materialistic consumer. It's strange, in a way, that I should think this; Tyler's actions are extremely questionable, but I felt envious of his personality and behaviour. This movie's ability to question your own morals and today's views on society are well thought-out and acted.Fight Club not only invokes feelings for the characters, but the very society we live in today. Granted, it is a character-driven plot which formulates this. The pacing of the movie is perfect despite the long running time; the story slowly and steadily flourishes as more and more of the main characters lives are revealed through the Narrators dialogue and his interactions with them.Another thing I should mention is the superb directing. David Fincher creates a great mood with camera views, musical score, dialogue, and lighting. The characters never seem out of place, and the mood of the scenes are subtly (and not so subtly) interwoven. The plot twists towards the movie's conclusion are not complicated as to completely confuse the viewer, however, they are clever enough to keep you guessing until 'the revelation'.Overall, Fight Club is an excellent movie with many strong points, whether it be direction or production. It almost instigates the viewers need to come to terms with themselves and their lifestyle, something that many movies do not do.Do not misjudge this movie simply by the title, or you may miss out on one of the most greatest and thoughtful films ever created.",Fight Club
