0,MartinHafer,Well made but yecch.,7,17 August 2012,"I should probably mention right up front that I am not a huge fan of thrillers and, in particular, I don't care for violent or gory films. Because of this, I have waited a very long time to finally getting around to seeing this film. The idea of a film about serial killers just doesn't appeal to me. However, there is also an obsessive part of me--the part of me that wants to see all the Best Picture Oscar winners. Apart from this film, there are maybe two others I need to complete this...until next year! And, my daughter assured me that the movie wasn't too gory. So, this film review is best appreciated by others who just aren't into gore, serial killings and cannibalism--though, oddly, a very high percentage of viewers DO like such plots.First, the bad news. I sure as heck thought it was a gory film...a very gory film. You see people with huge chunks of skin ripped off, a guy's face ripped off and lots of blood. I don't know how my daughter would think this isn't gory! Second, the not so bad news. Although I really didn't like the film very much, it was interesting and different. Anthony Hopkins did a nice job playing a psycho murder--though I also felt this performance was anything but subtle--but it was entertaining. So did the film change my mind about the genre or this film in particular? No. But, apparently I am in the minority here.UPDATE: I recently began watching the TV show, ""Hannibal"", and although I also think it's way too graphic, I much prefer Mads Mikkelson's version of Dr. Lecter. It's much, much more subtle and creepy--without the over the top theatrics of the movie version of the guy.",The Silence of the Lambs
1,TheLittleSongbird,Truly enthralling film and not one to forget,10,15 July 2011,"I have seen some great movies, old or new. The Silence of the Lambs is an amazing one, while not my personal favourite of the year of 1991 it was a well deserved Best Picture win in my opinion.Jonathan Demme's direction is superb, the film is shot in a ceaselessly atmospheric manner and Demme never lets the suspense drop. The story from start to finish is enthralling, and the script is tense and thought-provoking.The Silence of the Lambs is wonderfully acted as well. Jodie Foster is the one who holds the film together and her performance here is one of her most excellent, and I mustn't forget Ted Levine who is very chillingly effective as Buffolo Bill. Anthony Hopkins however steals the film, it is his perhaps most iconic character and he proves that although he is in only a portion of the film his performance lives long in the memory.All in all, amazing. 10/10 Bethany Cox",The Silence of the Lambs
2,bkoganbing,Getting A Good Consultant,9,3 August 2007,"It seems as though there is a serial killer out there who's grabbed the daughter of a United States Senator and this guy has zoomed right to the top of FBI's Most wanted. This man's modus operandi is to keep the victims alive for a while before killing them so they're racing against time to find him. Desperate situations call for desperate measures.The desperate measure is, you want to catch a serial killer, bring in one as a consultant. That's why FBI trainee Jodie Foster goes to visit Anthony Hopkins in prison. Hopkins is not just a killer who eats his victims, he's a brilliant psychologist himself with insights maybe no one else has.Of course his price are some cheap insights into Jodie Foster's soul, thrills he probably got when he was in practice.The Silence of the Lambs in less capable hands could have just been another cheap slasher flick. Instead the leads who walked off with the Academy Awards for Best Actor and Best Actress give riveting performances of a sick twisted psycho and a woman who became the biggest feminist icon since Sigourney Weaver by confronting some demons of her own. It's the best work that Anthony Hopkins and Jodie Foster have ever done and let's not forget the Oscars won by Director Jonathan Demme and the Picture itself for being the Best in 1991.A couple of players who made their marks on television later on also score well here. Anthony Heald who was Buffy the Vampire Slayer's handler plays the psychiatrist in the institute where Hopkins is incarcerated and who Hopkins makes a fool of and says at the end he's far from done with. Also Ted Levine who is Captain Stottlemeyer on Monk plays the serial killer the FBI is trying to catch. Also look for a good performance by Brooke Smith as Levine's potential victim.The Silence of the Lambs with its taut direction and riveting performances has an appeal far beyond the horror genre. See it and you'll know what I mean.",The Silence of the Lambs
3,Leofwine_draca,The granddaddy of all serial killer flicks,10,11 May 2014,"THE SILENCE OF THE LAMBS is, quite simply, a breathtaking movie. It's the granddaddy of all serial killer flicks, a film that even the almost-as-good SE7EN can only aspire to, a movie that gets into the mind and soul of a serial killer like few others. It inspired a huge sub-genre of similar movies that came out during the 1990s and 2000s, and it's up there with Hitchcock's PSYCHO as one of the most gripping looks at the subject matter of all time.Where to begin? There's a pitch-perfect Jodie Foster, gradually leading us into the depths of the storyline as the naive FBI agent, and the oft-overlooked Ted Levine who excels as the supremely skin-crawling Buffalo Bill. Of course, the film is dominated by Anthony Hopkins, giving the best and most memorable performance of his career in just 16 minutes of screen time. Hopkins chills you to the bone in this, and Jonathan Demme's direction is a perfect match for his talents.The storyline is engaging, ably mixing the criminal investigation strands with scenes involving the killers themselves. There are gory and monstrous set-pieces which make your flesh crawl while watching, yet it's all rather restrained and intellectual, a surprise given the subject matter. Most importantly, it's never less than gripping and completely frightening. A true masterpiece of a movie.",The Silence of the Lambs
4,SnoopyStyle,iconic villain,9,5 December 2015,"Trainee Clarice Starling (Jodie Foster) is recruited right out of Quantico by Jack Crawford (Scott Glenn) of the Bureau's Behavioral Science Services. He's investigating serial killer Buffalo Bill who skins his female victims. He's interviewing imprisoned killers but Dr. Hannibal Lecter (Anthony Hopkins) refuses to cooperate. Starling is sent to talk to Lecter.Director Jonathan Demme takes the serial killer genre onto another level. It is brilliantly intense and brutal. It's a solid entry but then there is Hopkins' Lecter. It is an iconic villain for all times. From the moment he first appears, he steals the movie. It's rare that somebody can produce a character that is so original and so memorable. He is so impressive that he actually overshadows the penis-tucked human-skinning lotion-basket transvestite serial killer. Foster is also pretty solid. She brings a competence to the role that is needed for the outrageous villains to shine.",The Silence of the Lambs
5,Hitchcoc,Maybe a Little Too Much,9,5 April 2006,"Though there are few films so outwardly violent, the real gold in this film comes from the interaction between Anthony Hopkins and Jodie Foster. He prowls like a lion, back and forth in his glass cage, muzzled, dangerous. Foster reacts to him as you would someone who could kill you if you looked away for a second. Parry and thrust. As the film develops, a charming kind of standoff occurs. The FBI agent begins to see some humanity in this monster. She needs him, but she needs to trust him first. There are the scenes with the mask and the biting off of noses and other violence, but these show that he is in many ways a cunning beast. He is also a genius. As the profiling goes on, more and more layers of the mystery are cleared and the quarry knows the quarry. Hannibal Lecter is a celebrity brutalizer, and, of course, a cannibal. Hopkins knows few peers in contemporary cinema. His films are almost always worth the time. I doubt if he has ever created anyone like this before.",The Silence of the Lambs
6,mark.waltz,Sheri Lewis need not worry. Lambchop the puppet will not be served with chanti and Fava beans.,10,17 September 2021,"Lots of jokes have been made over the years of the only horror film to win best picture at the Academy Awards. Its also one of the few times and that the stars of a horror film went home with the awards, in this case Anthony Hopkins as serial killer Hannibal Lechter and Jodie Foster as FBI agent Clarice Starling out to interview him so she can try to capture another serial killer named Buffalo Bill. You miss out on the fun if you take this film completely seriously even though it is a horrific subject. But the imagery is memorable in so many ways, and unintentional laughter did erupt when the film first came out. Like ""Fargo"", it takes a serious subject and almost turns it into a black comedy, something that ""Fargo"" did intentionally but something that happened to ""Silence"" quite accidentally.So you get to serial killers for the price of one and you get to go into the minds of both. The character of Buffalo Bill is indeed disgusting. He is presented as a deranged man who tortures heavy set women, starving them so their skin will loosen and then kills them and uses their skin for his cross-dressing fetish. Lechter was a genius, a well noted psychiatrist who got into the minds of his patients in order to use their thoughts against them, and he also uses that when being interviewed by Agent Starling. Initially, he is repulsed by her for her unadvanced intelligence but as he gets to realize her seriousness of succeeding in her job, he begins to admire her but of course cannot help but use his genius to torture her through memories of her past that brings her to her own terror.At times, the relationship between the two is touching as part of him begins to think of her like a surrogate daughter and she begins to see a Sweetness in him that others are petrified of. She has been warned of his genius, doesn't heed the advice, and that brings her childhood fears to life and allows him to manipulate her. When he is transferred to a private facility oh, he uses this as a means of escape, and of course that is going to bring more terror to the world and give her more to put on her place as she tries to pinpoint where Buffalo Bill is and bring the madman's repulsive actions to an end. Psychological horror transfers into physical horror as Hopkins commits several vile acts, and as Agent Starling moves in on her target, Lechter moves in on his.This is probably not a film that movie fans will watch more than twice, because the imagery is very disturbing and the same is very dark even though there are unintentional comedic elements about it. Veteran actress Diane Baker is seen as the United States Senator, mother of one of the kidnapped victims being held by Buffalo Bill, and when Lector gets to meet her in one sequence, he provides a wisecrack so hysterically funny and cutting that you can't help but soak your screen if you are drinking at that moment. Scott Glenn as Foster's boss, is also quite memorable.There were certainly controversies over this film during the day because of the nature of Buffalo Bill's motivation for torture and murder, but now, he is simply just viewed as a psychopath whose sexual fetish goes beyond all mental reason. In fact, his character is so repulsive to look at that you can't help but laugh at him. One of the weak moments of the film is Foster's talking of him as she becomes closer, and it certainly was not intentional that it came off as laughable. The growing understanding between Starling and Lechter is much more memorable than the scenes involving Buffalo Bill. Foster gets a glimpse into Lechter's head when she visits his storage unit, a truly disturbing moment. Director Jonathan Demme does present an atmosphere constantly creepy which shows us a correlation between horror and comedy. I don't know that Foster's performance was Oscar worthy, but Hopkins, really in a supporting role, does command his way to winning Best Actor, and he joins Lugosi and Karloff in the list of movie monsters where you begin to understand why certain actors are associated with one role even when there were a ton more.",The Silence of the Lambs
7,classicsoncall,"""They don't have a name for what he is"".",9,24 June 2011,"It's hard to believe this film is twenty years old, having seen it when it first came out and not again till now. The movie lived up to it's opening hype as a masterful thriller bordering on horror. Anthony Hopkins' portrayal of serial killer Hannibal Lecter defines the story, but when all is said and done, his character doesn't appear in the picture very much at all. However when he does, one's attention is riveted to the screen, attempting to outguess director Jonathan Demme's next move in a deadly cat and mouse game between Lecter and his adversary, be it FBI Agent Clarice Starling (Jodie Foster), or hapless security guards caught unaware by a scheming mad man.The larger plot involves the chase after a serial killer known as Buffalo Bill, named after a penchant for skinning his female victims after he murders them. To say that the picture has it's grisly moments would be an understatement. There are more than one scene that require caution for the faint hearted, visualizing grim aspects of brutality that don't leave much to the imagination. Buffalo Bill himself (Ted Levine) is an inspired piece of work, a monster that could have stood alone as a title character if not part of this larger story.Without giving it away entirely, I have to say that the hunt for Buffalo Bill gives rise to a clever gimmick that will catch you off guard for a moment, only to redirect itself very quickly to it's suspenseful conclusion. This one's recommended for fans of psychological thrillers who'll try to guess the ending only to be set up for one more neat twist at the finale. Anyone for a glass of Chianti?",The Silence of the Lambs
8,gavin6942,Modern Masterpiece and For Good Reason,8,18 June 2008,"Agent Clarice Starling (Jodie Foster) enters into a relationship with Dr. Hannibal Lecter (Anthony Hopkins), a brilliant but deranged flesh-eating psychiatrist. He may be her only hope in catching Buffalo Bill (Ted Levine), a new serial killer who strips women of their skin for his own nefarious purposes. Can she trust him? ""Silence of the Lambs"" won a few Academy Awards, and it's plain to see why. Everyone involved does a wonderful job, and even after several viewings the movie remains fresh and enjoyable. I still haven't figured out what kind of accent Jodie Foster has, and I probably never will. Anthony Hopkins is perfect as Lecter, and I think it goes without saying that this will be the role he is remembered for. Maybe not his best role, but certainly his most widely received.The film has a timeless quality to it. Of course, we can tell the year the film was made from the clothing styles and production quality of the film. But there's nothing glaringly time-specific about it (compare it to ""Manhunter"" with the pastel jackets). Some things may seem silly and unintentionally comedic (there are excessive amounts of close-ups on Lecter that make me chuckle) but overall it's a good, smooth showing.I'm not going to get into detail about the film, director Jonathan Demme's vision or the changes from book to film (such as the number of Lecter's fingers). The film has been combed through a hundred times by critics and fans, and I'm merely adding an opinion that's been voiced before. But I will say this: as of 2008, the film retains all the qualities and positive aspects attributed to it when it first arrived in theaters. One suspects it always will.",The Silence of the Lambs
9,lee_eisenberg,A most unusual treat.,10,21 October 2005,"""The Silence of the Lambs"" will have to go down in history as one of the most ingenious movies of all time. After a string of bizarre murders, FBI agent-in-training Clarice Starling (Jodie Foster) is hired to interview psychopath Hannibal ""The Cannibal"" Lecter (Anthony Hopkins) to find the perpetrator. In the process, we get to learn some very interesting things about both Starling and Lecter. The main thing is that, despite how vile Lecter is, we can't help but admire him. And I don't mean just because he's helping Clarice; something about the guy, you just gotta love him.In case you're squeamish, I should remind you that this movie contains some very ugly scenes. But don't worry, director Jonathan Demme knows how to handle them. This masterful combination of acting, directing and writing helped ""The Silence of the Lambs"" win the top five Academy Awards, putting it in a league with only ""It Happened One Night"" and ""One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest"". Watching the movie, you will agree that the movie deserved these awards. In fact, you just might want to have an old friend (over) for dinner.",The Silence of the Lambs
10,jboothmillard,The Silence of the Lambs,9,18 March 2005,"This is often cited and one of the greatest in its genre, more a thriller than a horror, featuring one of the most recognisable villains of all time, based on the book by Thomas Harris, directed by Oscar and BAFTA winning, and Golden Globe nominated Jonathan Demme (Married to the Mob, Philadelphia, The Manchurian Candidate). Basically young FBI trainee agent Clarice Starling (Oscar, BAFTA and Golden Globe winning Jodie Foster) is assigned by Jack Crawford (Scott Glenn), of the Behavioral Science Unit, to interview former psychiatrist and incarcerated cannibalistic serial killer Dr. Hannibal Lecter, aka Hannibal the Cannibal (Oscar and BAFTA winning, and Golden Globe nominated Sir Anthony Hopkins). Lecter, being held in Baltimore State Hospital for the Criminally Insane, has information about serial killer Buffalo Bill (Ted Levine), who skins the corpses of his female victims, Lecter is courteous, but hates Starling trying to dissect him. Lecter does tell Starling to seek out an old patient of his, later a cocoon containing a sphinx moth is found lodged in a victim's throat. Starling returns to Lecter, he agrees to give a physical description of Buffalo Bill, in exchange for him being transferred to a new facility, and away from Dr. Frederick Chilton (Anthony Heald), whom he detests. Crawford authorises a fake deal to be made with Lecter, meanwhile Buffalo Bill has kidnapped Catherine Martin (Brooke Smith), daughter of U.S. Senator. Lecter demands a quid pro quo (""something for something"" in Latin) from Starling, in exchange for personal information about herself he will give her clues, so Starling tells him about her childhood and the murder of her father. Lecter is later flown to Memphis, Tennessee, there he verbally torments Senator Ruth Martin (Diane Baker), before giving information about Buffalo Bill, some misleading, including the name ""Louis Friend"", an anagram of ""iron sulfide"", meaning fool's gold. Starling realises Lecter's deceit and asks for the truth from Lecter, now held in a cage-like cell, he tells that all information she needs is in the case file, rather than give a name. Lecter insists they continue quid pro quo, she recounts her traumatic childhood where spring lambs were being slaughtered, Lecter speculates saving Catherine will help her end the nightmares and the ""screaming of the lambs"". Lecter gives Starling back the case files on Buffalo Bill before they are interrupted and she is escorted out by police, later that night Lecter has taken a paper clip, uses it to uncuff himself, kills the guards, escapes from his cell and disappears, in fact using a guard's face and uniform to disguise himself. Starling examines the files and realises Buffalo Bill knew his first victim personally, going to the victim's hometown she discovers Buffalo Bill was a tailor, recognising his dress patterns as identical to his victims skins removed, she calls Crawford to inform him Buffalo Bill is fashioning a ""women suit"" of real skin. Crawford is already en route to make an arrest on a man named Jame Gumb, referenced in Lecter's notes and hospital archives, who once unsuccessfully applied for a sex-change, while Crawford leads an FBI tactical team to Gumb's address in Illinois, Starling interviews friends of Buffalo Bill's first victim in Ohio. The house in Illinois is empty, while Starling finds the house of ""Jack Gordon"", this is in fact Jamie Gumb, she recognises him as Buffalo Bill seeing a sphinx moth, she pursues him through the rooms of the basement, discovers Catherine alive, trapped in a dry well, then Starling is trapped in the dark, Gumb stalks her with night-vision goggles, but cocking his gun Starling instantly reacts and fires at Gumb, killing him. In the end Starling is given an FBI Academy graduation party, she is shocked to receive a phone call from Lecter, calling from an airport, he promises not to pursue her and asks she returns the favour, before hanging up he says he is ""having an old friend for dinner"", and follows newly arrived Chilton before disappearing into the crowd. Also starring Candyman's Kasi Lemmons as Ardelia Mapp, Lawrence T. Wrentz as Agent Burroughs, Frankie Faison as Barney Matthews, Charles Napier as Lt. Boyle, singer Chris Isaak as SWAT Commander, Roger Corman as FBI Director Hayden Burke and George A. Romero as FBI Agent in Memphis. Hopkins deserved his Oscar for his brilliantly sinister 24 minutes on screen as the intelligent serial killer; Foster deserved her Oscar as the young agent slowly toughening up following the clues, and Levine is splendidly disturbing as the killer taking skins for his demented pleasure. The relationship between Starling and Lecter is wonderfully twisted, and the mystery element to find the killer works well, this film became a big hit, legendary for many reasons, it is definitely a great psychological thriller. It won the Oscars for Best Writing, Screenplay Based on Material from Another Medium and Best Picture, and it was nominated for Best Film Editing and Best Sound, it was nominated the BAFTAs for Best Cinematography, Best Editing, Best Original Film Score for Howard Shore, Best Adapted Screenplay, Best Sound and Best Film, and it was nominated the Golden Globes for Best Motion Picture - Drama and Best Screenplay.

11,ccthemovieman-1,A Story And A Character That You Can't Forget,10,17 January 2007,"I'll never forget my first viewing of this movie at the theater and will always look back fondly on it for one reason: helping me quit smoking cigarettes.I read the book first, was fascinated by it, and couldn't wait for the film to come out. That was the day I picked to quit smoking and I knew this movie would take my mind off that matter. I was expecting an intense movie and I got it. Little did I realize how well-received this film would be and how it propelled Anthony Hopkins to super-stardom.Although entertaining, this is not always a fun movie to watch, especially with the scenes with Ted Levine who plays the killer, ""Buffalo Bill."" ""Bill"" and his kidnapped young woman are sick and profane people, respectively, and their scenes are very unpleasant. This movie is not for the squeamish with those and other scenes involving the infamous Dr. Hannibal Lecter (Hopkins). There also is some extreme crudeness in the jail/dungeon where Lecter and other inmates are held.Jodie Foster is excellent as the FBI agent ""Clarice Starling"" and Scott Glenn is low-key and effective as ""Jack Crawford."" A major part of the film is psychological more than violent as Lecter constantly taunts ""Clarice,"" while she tries her best to manipulate him to help with a case. The by-play between the two is a game in itself.Hopkins, however, is the actor people remember best from this movie. His portrayal of the refined-yet-cannibalistic serial killer-doctor is one viewers will never forget. I've enjoyed watching him in the sequels, too. The looks on his face, his fascinating vocabulary with intelligent sarcasm and frankness, never ceases to entertain.""Silence Of The Lambs"" has turned into a modern-day ""classic."" If by some odd chance you have never seen this movie, be warned it is a dark, difficult story to watch at times....but it will get your mind off other things.",The Silence of the Lambs
12,rmax304823,Surprisingly Effective Thriller,7,15 February 2008,"Jodie Foster, in a fine performance, is FBI-trainee Clarice Starling. She is assigned by the chief of the Behavioral Sciences Division (Scott Glenn) to interview the brilliant and cannibalistic mad psychiatrist Hannibal Lecter (Anthony Hopkins) in prison and try to enlist his help in capturing a currently active serial murderer, Buffalo Bill (Ted Levine), who skins his victims and sews the patches of skin into a kind of integumental suit made of women.When Starling first visits Lecter, the chief psychiatrist ( the eminently hatable Anthony Heald) escorts her down into the bowels of the institution and cautions her about approaching Lecter too closely, although they will be separated by a wall of bullet-proof plastic.Lecter DOES in fact help her. Buffalo Bill had once been a patient of his. But Lecter wants something too, in return. ""Quid pro quo,"" he tells her, showing off his Latin clichés. For every hint he gives to her and to the FBI, he demands some sort of present, such as a room with a view and, most important, some personal details about Starling's earlier life, the events in her past that brought her from a one-horse town in Appalachia to the FBI. He gets it. And she gets Buffalo Bill. And Lecter escapes in order to carry on his own cannibalistic career, beginning with the eminently hatable Anthony Heald. (His last line: ""I'm having an old friend for dinner tonight."") It doesn't sound too promising, does it? Still ANOTHER serial killer on the loose? With a puzzling modus operandi? Which the FBI must figure out in order to track him down and shoot him dead? But I described this as an effective thriller, not an ordinary one that serves as one more opportunity for Stallone to strip off his clothes and bulge his muscles at the camera. It's functionally directed by Jonathan Demme, based on Thomas Harris's novel. Only one incident involves a stunt man. There isn't a car chase in sight, nor an exploding fireball, nor a slow-motion shot of violence. There is one lethal beating and only a single shoot-out -- with pistols, not Uzis or 40 mm. Bofors cannons.The three threads of the story involve Glenn's avuncular relationship with the younger Starling, the flirtation (for that's what it amounts to) between Lecter and Starling, and the pursuit of the twisted Buffalo Bill. The stories mesh very well, and one scene in particular, linking the FBI's attack on a suspect's house to Starling's casual and apparently post-climactic ringing the doorbell of a house belonging to an old lady, is masterfully done.Tak Fujimoto's camera work could hardly be improved upon. He paints for us a wintry Middle-Atlantic setting with ice-cold rivers and stark, bare deciduous trees. There is a scene with a decomposing corpse that makes your skin crawl, although it is handled matter-of-factly, or even in such good taste as such a scene allows for. Original, too, is the character of Buffalo Bill's last intended victim, a large young lady kept prisoner in a basement pit. With Bill still darting around in the shadows somewhere, the lone Starling yells down to her and tells her she's safe now that the FBI is here. We're wrong if we expect the captive to pull the usual response. She doesn't break down and sob with relief. She screams back, ""**** that, you b****! Get me out of here!"" It was a nice touch in the novel too, which is written in lean, functional, and artless prose.All of the performances are quite good, with Hopkins outstanding as the crazy genius. The character became something of an icon in vernacular culture, which I guess is why audiences find it satisfying and amusing that he should be left on the loose to kill still more people. It adds a new dimension to films -- the serial killer who deserves to be let free because he's polite and has visited Florence. The writers help bring this story above average. When Foster explores the house of an earlier, almost forgotten victim, there is a touching moment when she discovers some hidden photos the girl had taken of herself posing coyly in her underwear, although she's too plump to be conventionally attractive. A music box plays in the background while Foster goes through these pitiful remnants and we can sense the life behind the death. The direction isn't free of conventions though. Foster is blinded in darkness and the murder's hand reaches out from behind the camera and traces her contours without touching them. Every horror movie must have such a scene. And earlier, when Scott Glenn realizes he's sent Foster into a dangerous, potentially lethal circumstance without any warning, the camera moves in quickly to a close up of his startled expression as he says, ""Clarice!"" These clichés are available in finer B-grade slasher movies everywhere.The conventions are aptly deployed though and the movie succeeds in what it's trying to do.",The Silence of the Lambs
13,Tweekums,Talk to a serial killer to catch a serial killer,9,18 September 2016,"A serial killer, dubbed Buffalo Bill, has been murdering and skinning young women and the FBI are getting nowhere. Jack Crawford, the agent leading the investigation, decides to try something different; he sends trainee agent Clarice Starling to talk to incarcerated serial killer Hannibal 'The Cannibal' Lector hoping that he might provide some insight; it won't be easy though; Lector likes to play mind games with people and he is soon trying to get young Clarice to reveal some personal secrets. Soon another body is discovered then Buffalo Bill kidnaps another victim; this time the daughter of a US Senator; with the clock ticking before he kills her the FBI offer Lector a deal; unfortunately the doctor in charge of the facility housing Lector tells him the deal isn't real he then arranges another deal and Lector is transferred to Tennessee. Here Clarice sees him one last time and, after revealing details of a childhood trauma, is put on the trail of Bill and into a potentially deadly situation.This is an impressive thriller that is still effective after a quarter of a century and numerous spoofs of some of its most famous scenes. While the story is ostensibly about the hunt for Buffalo Bill it is as much about the growing relationship between Clarice and Lector as he gets her to open up about herself; something she has been warned about doing but does to gain his trust. Jodie Foster and Anthony Hopkins are both impressive in these roles. The rest of the cast, most notably Scott Glenn as Crawford and Anthony Heald as Dr Chilton are pretty good too. While there aren't a lot of violent scenes those that there are are particularly brutal. As the story approaches its conclusion the tension rises until the conclusion that remains very tense even after several viewings of the film. Overall I'd certainly recommend this to those wanting a solid thriller; just be warned it isn't for the faint-hearted.",The Silence of the Lambs

15,BA_Harrison,Not quite as baarilliant as ewe might have herd.,7,9 February 2012,"Five times Oscar winner The Silence of the Lambs is a class act in many respects, but there are several factors—issues with the script that many fans seem to have happily chosen to ignore—which prevent me from finding the film such a wholly satisfying experience.With a little suspension of disbelief, I can accept that FBI boss Crawford (Scott Glenn) might believe that Hannibal Lecter (Anthony Hopkins) could help in profiling serial killer Buffalo Bill (Ted Levine), but what are the chances of him knowing the killer's actual identity? Pretty damn slim if you ask me—almost as unlikely as Crawford assigning a rookie agent like Clarice Starling (Jodie Foster) to interrogate a manipulative psychopath in the first place!Swallow all that, and you'll probably have no problem with Lecter's escape, but I know I'm not alone in finding this pivotal scene far-fetched in the extreme. Even if I let the whole 'pen thing' slide (Hannibal's a master of sleight of hand and a whizz at picking locks–fair enough), I still struggle to believe that it is possible to fool an entire team of highly trained cops and medics by slipping a dead man's face over your own. Just ain't going to happen.And then there's the ending, which after all of the slow-burn psychological games between Lecter and Starling, suddenly goes into over-drive, glossing over details in a hurry to get to the typically tense Hollywood-style finale: all of a sudden, the FBI have Buffalo Bill's true identity, Clarice Starling has tracked the nut-job to his lair, and it's all on for an exciting climax inside the pitch black, labyrinthine basement where the psycho skins his victims.Thankfully, even with these frustratingly ill-considered moments taking the film down a peg or two in my opinion, Silence of the Lambs is still well worth a watch thanks to director Jonathan Demme's slick handling of the material, and career defining turns from several of his standout cast. Hopkins iconic performance as Lecter is mesmerising, the actor deeply menacing even behind a sheet of unbreakable glass or completely immobile, securely fastened to a trolley in his iconic face-mask; Foster is also memorable as Clarice, who unwisely allows Hannibal inside her mind to exploit her emotional fragility. But it is Ted Levine who steals the show: as sexually confused, mumbling maniac Buffalo Bill, whose goal is to make himself a suit from women's skin, Levine is absolutely superb, providing the film with many of its most memorable moments and delivering several of my favourite quotable lines of dialogue.All together now: 'It rubs the lotion on its skin...'",The Silence of the Lambs
16,moonspinner55,"It tries to build a crawling sense of dread and menace, but...",6,27 March 2002,"Jonathan Demme's ""The Silence Of the Lambs"" is a grisly spook show, and one without any sympathy for its victims (or for the audience, who get a good hammering on the head). Yes, the Oscar-winning performances by Anthony Hopkins and Jodie Foster have become legendary (and for good reason, they are both intensely focused and driven), but the picture leaves scummy feelings in its wake, as if Demme had suddenly turned carnival barker for the ultimate freak show. FBI trainee Foster, invited into the gruesome investigation of a serial killer, seems to climb the ranks awfully easily, being allowed to do potentially dangerous work on her own as well as going mano a mano with Hopkins' Dr. Hannibal Lecter, an imprisoned cannibal who may hold the key to the crimes. There's chilly art in Demme's presentation--it's a polished piece of work--but I soon tired of the Woman as Hero underlying theme, complete with a who's-in-the-dungeon finale that doesn't work at all, the sacrificing of real human drama for shock value and lots of outlandish violence (such as a mutilated security guard hanging from the top of a prison cell like an angel). The black-humored kicker is that all this perverseness is good for a raunchy thrill, and what better way to arouse a stultified audience than to give us two psychopaths--one who eats his victims, the other who carves up women. **1/2 from ****",The Silence of the Lambs
17,dbdumonteil,the intense humming of evil,8,2 April 2004,"With ""Silence of the Lambs"" (1991), Jonathan Demme achieved a masterstroke and his movie became one of the landmark movies made in the nineties. The reward of his efforts were the following ones: 5 Oscars in 1992 including Best Movie and a widely deserved blockbuster.This is a movie that enjoys a performance of a high quality with, of course Jodie Foster and Anthony Hopkins who dominate the cast. The former is absolutely convincing in her role of ambitious trainee who gradually realizes that if she wants to nab ""Buffalo Bill"", she has to face and overcome her fears. All this with ""a little help"" from Hopkins who finds in this movie one of his best roles and offers a remarkable and especially unforgettable composition of his character: Hannibal Lecter. Besides, concerning this character, more than fascination, this is nearly liking that we feel for this monster. On another hand, his confrontations with Clarisse are the key-moments of the movie where we can notice a careful work on the light, the scenery and the framing.In ""Silence of the Lambs"", Demme plays with the spectator's nerves, avoids as much as possible the bloody sequences and creates suspense the following way: throughout the movie, there's a constant tension that starts with the warnings given to Clarisse before her first meet with Lecter. Then, it becomes more marked with Lecter's escape and it reaches a peak with Clarisse's final dual with ""Buffallo Bill"". The whole is well-orchestrated by Demme thanks to a witty making. At last, even if the end reveals an inevitable happy-end, the very last sequence is here to remind us that one of the two monsters in the movie is still alive and he will keep on getting himself talked about (Hannibal, 2001).A terrific and terrifying thriller. Highly recommended and this is one of the very few movies that will haunt you for a long time after you watched it.",The Silence of the Lambs
18,Quinoa1984,One of the best suspense films of the early 1990's,10,9 February 2001,"Silence of the Lambs is a film that will always be memorable because of 2 things (in my mind)- 1, Hopkins brilliantly mixed type of Socrates meets Dawn of the Dead zombie charicature and 2, an argument will go on like who was the better Darren on Bewitched, Jodie Foster playing Clarice Starling (and version of herself in 10 years Julianne Moore).  I feel that Jodie Foster is very good here as a FBI agent who has to get in the mind of Dr. Lecter (Faba beans and all) to find a killer.  Story latter patterned out in The Cell, which while that was better, this film is a tad better than the sequel by having you sqeam in your seat while getting memorable catch phrases and (dare I say) laughs.

19,Coventry,Everything you could possibly look for in cinema!,10,10 January 2006,"To keep up the goody goody cannibal spirit: ""Silence of the Lambs"" is a finger-licking GREAT thriller and one of the most righteous Academy Award winners in the history of cinema. Maybe I'm just saying that because I'm a big fan of nerve-racking thrillers and, let's face it, nerve-racking thrillers hardly ever win any Oscars, but apparently all audiences as well as all critics seem to agree that ""Silence of the Lambs"" is the worthy conquerer of 5 awards in the most eminent categories. The foundations of this cinematic milestone couldn't have been better, of course, with Thomas Harris' intriguing characterizations and basic story-idea (the efficiency was already proved in 1986, with ""Manhunter"") but really a lot of the film's brilliance is added by the Jonathan Demme and his outstanding cast. Despite not having directed a lot of horror/thriller films before this, Demme's knowledge of the genres is impressive and he terrifically manages to bring a constant level of tension without ever resorting to graphic violence or explicit gore. And that's quite an accomplishment because, primarily, ""The Silence of the Lambs"" handles about a sadistic serial killer, who eats his victims, who's recruited to assist in catching another sadistic serial killer, who skins his victims! Young FBI-trainee Clarice Starling is sent to Dr. Hannibal Lector's isolated prison cell to profile the new killer Buffalo Bill. But the highly intelligent and sophisticated Lector is only prepared to reveal clues about Buffalo Bill's modus operandi in exchange for answers to personal questions regarding Clarice's childhood.Apart from being a truly exciting and rather educational serial-killer chase, ""The Silence of the Lambs"" also definitely is a compelling psychological drama-triumph! The 'Quid Pro Quo' conversations between Clarice and Dr. Lector are portrayed like highly competitive duels in which the young FBI agent isn't necessarily the weakest party! These conversations revolve on how determined both of them are willing to go in order to find out what they need to know and, simultaneously, we get to know how vulnerable Clarice actually is. These marvelous sequences appear to be even stronger thanks to the genuinely eerie and cold setting of Hannibal Lector's old, windowless cell. The camera perspectives throughout the whole film, as well as the cinematography in general, are impeccable and often trend-setting! Particularly classic is the ""parallel"" climax, which actually is a ridiculously simple and misleading trick but increases the suspense to an unprecedented high point. And then, of course, there are the acting performances but what praise can I possibly add that hasn't been said before? Anthony Hopkins is in one word hypnotic, Jodie Foster is pragmatic but truly overpowering and Ted Levine is genuinely terrifying as the personification of human complexity!",The Silence of the Lambs
20,sunwarrior13,A Great Film In The 90's,10,17 October 2011,"It is one great film. No question about it.The Silence Of Lambs is rare American thriller film that blends elements of the crime and horror genre that is based on the novel of the same name by Thomas Harris, his second to feature Dr. Hannibal Lecter, a brilliant psychiatrist and cannibalistic serial killer after The Red Dragon. The movie stars Jodie Foster, Anthony Hopkins, Ted Levine and Scott Glenn. It was directed by Jonathan Demme,who won an Academy Award for this film.The story of the film centers on Clarice Starling,played by Foster in an Oscar winning performance.She is a young FBI trainee that seeks the advice of the imprisoned Dr. Lecter,played by Hopkins in his Oscar winning performance as well just like Foster, to help apprehend another serial killer, known only as ""Buffalo Bill"".The movie was smart especially in the intellectual tug-of-war between Sterling and Lecter.The Award winning performances truly made it credible and suspenseful.At the same time,the story was full of horror that will thrill the viewer to the edge of their seats. What makes Silence rise above the other movies of the same genre was its smart story as well as the movie's ability to put the viewer into the psychological inner workings of the minds of both Sterling and Lecter during their meetings.This is what makes is one of the best films ever made not only in the year but also during its decade of its release as well.",The Silence of the Lambs

22,hitchcockthelegend,The lambs are unlikely to ever stop screaming.,10,27 May 2010,"Clarice Starling (Jodie Foster), a young rookie FBI agent, is enlisted to help in the hunt for a serial killer known as Buffalo Bill (Ted Levine). To aid the investigation she is requested to interview an already incarcerated psychopath, the infamous Dr Hannibal Lecter (Anthony Hopkins). Cunning and very intelligent, Lecter takes a shine to Starling but will only assist her if she is prepared to let him into her personal make up. As Buffalo Bill kidnaps the daughter of an American senator the clock starts to tick downThe Silence of the Lambs is directed by Jonathan Demme and stars Jodie Foster, Anthony Hopkins, Scott Glenn, and Ted Levine. It is based on the novel of the same name by Thomas Harris. It won the top five Academy Awards for Best Picture, Best Actress, Best Actor, Best Director and Best Screenplay. With a production budget of $19 million the film went on to record a staggering Worldwide profit of almost $254 million. Those awards and those figures don't lie, The Silence Of The Lambs is one of the rare occasions where everything came together perfectly.The source novel is in truth brilliant anyway, but how many times have we seen film makers make a hash of good material by either cutting corners, or by trying to be too Hollywood in the telling? Too many is the answer. Jonathan Demme and his team know that not much needs tampering here, their task was to understand Thomas Harris' complex characters and give them narrative strength, which they got courtesy of Ted Tally's brilliant writing. The portrayals of said characters have gone down in history to an extent they barely need me to have an opinion. From the first meeting of Starling and Lecter down in the bowels of the asylum, to the cheeky and unnerving closure, Foster & Hopkins engage and chill respectively, one of the weirdest, yet most tender relationships to have hit the silver screen. Scott Glenn is professional personified as Jack Crawford, while in the wake of Hopkins' classy monster show it gets forgotten just how brilliantly twisted Ted Levine makes Buffalo Bill. Two quality monsters for the price of one movie here, a bargain if ever there was one.For all the plaudits for cast, direction and writing et al, ""Lambs"" climbed to the top echelons of 90s cinema because it also exists as an excellent thriller, even a pant filling horror at times. While it also works very well as a criminal procedure movie. We know who the killer is quite early on in proceedings, but with Lecter tossing out conundrums and the FBI utilising all their tricksy scientific methods, it makes for a fascinating watch. And lest we forget that Demme shows himself to not only be a purveyor of adroit pacing, but quite a dab hand at thrilling set-pieces too-one that would be a spoiler should I mention it, and the other coming during a wonderful double handed twister as the net hopefully closes in on Billy Boy. While for hold your breath tension, night vision goggles are your pal, or not as the case may be.Not just one of the best crime/thriller/horror film's ever, one of the best film's ever, period. 10/10",The Silence of the Lambs
23,Theo Robertson,Very Effective Thriller But Ultimately Overrated,8,30 October 2005,"It's impossible to comment on SILENCE OF THE LAMBS as being a mere film . Its release was a watershed in popular culture and has influenced a myriad of imitations that are far too numerous to mention . Much of this success is down to director Jonathan Demme who has made the film so effective by coming up with the strikingly simple idea of filming everything in dim lighting which gives SILENCE a moody and brooding atmosphere that was absent from movies in the previous decade . Ironically enough this is as typical of 90s film making as MANHUNTER was of 80s movies . Howard Shore's score also helps the proceedings and Jodie Foster gives a sublime nuanced performance as vulnerable heroine Clarice Starling . Watch the scenes closely when Clarice is in the company of men , don't you get the feeling she has a phobia about the male of the species . Is she a victim of sexual abuse in her childhood ? A lesbian ? We never find out but Foster's performance is multi layered and it's a pity this aspect is never explored in HANNIBAL which sadly deletes this aspect to Clarice Sadly SILENCE was released with a tidal wave of hype which the film doesn't live up to . Who can forget the stories that upon seeing this at the cinema certain audience members wanted armed escorts back to their cars ! I'm sorry but despite being a good thriller it's not that good and I fail to see how people were turned into quivering jellies unable to sleep with the lights off . I'm also afraid to say that much of the awards heaped upon the film aren't that well deserved either . Foster deserved the Oscar as did the film and possibly Demme too but did Ted Tally for his adapted screenplay ? All he seems to have done is to copy the best bits of Harris's novel wholesale into the screenplay without making an effort to improve anything . and i'll probably be accused of sacrilege but the more times I see this film the more times I ask myself how did Hopkins win the Oscar for Best Actor ? I don't even think Hopkins should have qualified for the Best Actor category since the role isn't on screen long enough and his performance is slightly hammy . Hannibal as played by Hopkins resembles something along the lines of a paedophile rather than a serial killer who has maimed , murdered and munched on adults . Despite having some reservations of Brian Cox as Hannibal in MANHUNTER you do believe his burly presence does have the physical strength to overpower his victims , not so Hopkins I know it's very difficult , perhaps even impossible , but the best way to enjoy this movie is to erase from your mind the fact that it's one of only three movies to have picked up the Oscar in all five main categories , the fact that it made headlines about being the most terrifying film committed to celluloid , and the fact that it stands as the 28th best movie ever on this website . It is a very good thriller but one that is ultimately disappointing after hearing of the hype surrounding it",The Silence of the Lambs
24,Hey_Sweden,A dynamite Hollywood thriller.,9,27 December 2012,"This is deservedly one of the most popular and praised of all the entries in the worn-out ""cop vs. killer"" genre, and represents a career high point for its key participants. It's especially noteworthy that it should have swept the five major Oscars for the year of its release, considering that the Academy wouldn't normally award such acclaim to a thriller with often grim and disturbing content - a tribute to how well crafted it is. Also worthy of a mention is the way that this film put the Behavioural Sciences unit of the FBI on the map - that unit devoted to the study of the most deviant ""human"" beings among us. Director Jonathan Demme shows a great skill for the genre, and with the assistance of a first rate crew creates some eerily effective suspense. Based on the novel by Thomas Harris, it stars Jodie Foster as an eager beaver young FBI trainee who is sent by her superior (Scott Glenn) to interview an imprisoned murderer, the intelligent, cultured psychopath Hannibal ""The Cannibal"" Lecter (Anthony Hopkins), in the hopes that he can lend his insight into the activities of ""Buffalo Bill"" (Ted Levine), a serial killer currently on the loose. Other than a music score by Howard Shore that is a little *too* over the top and manipulative, ""The Silence of the Lambs"" hits all the right notes, telling a story in a taut and convincing manner. The subject matter admittedly is not to every taste - especially when one thinks about what Bills' ultimate plan is. The editing (by Craig McKay), production design (by Kristi Zea), and cinematography (by Tak Fujimoto) are exemplary; among the scariest scenes are Clarices' (Foster) search of a storage space, and the climactic action where agent and maniac are finally face to face (and the sequence leading up to that). Of course, the real meat of the story is the unusual relationship between the charismatic Lecter and the determined Clarice, as he demands she divulge personal information in return for his thoughts on the Buffalo Bill case. Lecter is a truly memorable character, from his choice of entertainment to the way that he gleefully toys with those people that he holds in contempt. Hopkins and Foster are both very effective in these parts, although the contributions of the supporting cast absolutely should not go overlooked. Given the way that Lecter dominates the proceedings, it's important to point out just how extremely creepy Bill is; his performance brought character actor Levine to real prominence. Brooke Smith is very good portraying a would-be victim who actually tries to use her wits and fight back in some way. Also appearing are many other familiar faces: Anthony Heald (as the smarmy jerk in charge of the insane asylum), Diane Baker, Kasi Lemmons, Demme regulars Charles Napier and Tracey Walter, his old mentor Roger Corman (as the director of the FBI), Frankie Faison, Dan Butler, Chris Isaak, and Daniel von Bargen. Even at just under two hours long, this is actually pretty taut in terms of pacing; there's no filler at all, just some very potent entertainment. This was preceded by another Harris adaptation, ""Manhunter"", in which Brian Cox played Lecter, and would be followed by ""Hannibal"" and, after that, ""Red Dragon"", another film version of the source novel for ""Manhunter"". Some people tend to prefer ""Manhunter"" and consider it superior; this viewer merely prefers to think that they each have their own heavy assets. Nine out of 10.",The Silence of the Lambs

He's a cannibal and VERY dangerous. Also there's a psychopath named Buffalo Bill kidnapping girls and skinning them alive. Lecter hints that he knows who Bill is and Clarice tries to find out...but Lecter is playing serious mind games with her. I caught this back in 1991. I liked it but I thought Foster was just OK and I found the story pretty confusing with glaring lapses in logic. Seeing it now some 17 years later I still feel the same way. The film is somewhat slow and I wasn't that scared or upset by it. Also Foster (who's Southern accent comes and goes at an alarming rate) is just OK. I'm really surprised that she won the Oscar for this. PLOT SPOILER AHEAD!!!! There was also a lot of gay groups who complained that Buffalo Bill was a transsexual. As a gay guy I wasn't offended but other people were just horrified. END SPOILER!!! Still the movie isn't a total washout. Hopkins is just superb as Lecter. He's downright terrifying at times. He's only on screen about a total of 30 minutes but you always feel his presence. Also his breakout (while completely illogical) is one of the scariest sequences I've ever seen. The whole movie is well-directed especially during the final sequence. Also it's the first horror film since 1932 to win an acting Academy Award. Heck, it won quite a few! Best Picture, Best Supporting Actor (Hopkins), Best Actress (Foster), Best Director and Best Adapted Screenplay. So, it's a very good thriller worth catching...but Academy Award material?

It is sometimes disturbing, sometimes terrifying, and sometimes the Characters are engaging. Sometimes.The Film is inconsistent in both style and substance. There are way too many close ups. After a few, the intended uneasiness is lost. Most of the sets are attractively unappealing and does give the sense of a forbidden place. A striking performance from Hopkins but some of his cryptic inclusions using anagrams are uninteresting and at worst confusing and make no or little sense of irony. Jodie Foster seems forcing it, especially when asked to reveal some secret recalling the title of the Book and Movie. There are also some less than brilliantly enticing lectures from Hannibal about coveting and a scribbled note that is laughably sophomoric and we're off to catch the truly creepy Buffalo Bill.Overall it adds up to be less than it seems. Some clever stuff but it is carelessly sewed together and with some tugging starts to unravel.

Clarice meets up with the slimy Dr. Frederick Chilton (Anthony Heald) who runs the hospital & has responsibility for Lecter, he tells her some basic rules & then she's ready.

Meanwhile 'Buffalo Bill' himself has abducted a young girl named Catherine Martin (Brooke Smith) who is the daughter of a powerful Washington Senator Ruth Martin (Diane Baker). Lecter sees an opportunity to leave his miserable existence in his cramped brick cell behind & tries to strike a deal with the Senator in exchange for 'Buffalo Bills' name. As politics & greed begin to surface Lecter sets his plans in motion while Clarice who is now on the investigating team is determined to track 'Buffalo Bill' down, save Catherine before he kills her & put a stop to his grisly crimes for good.Directed by Jonathan Demme (who also has a small cameo at the end apparently) I thought Silence of the Lambs was a solid horror film, & by the way if you listen to the documentary on the DVD everyone involved in the production refers to it as a horror film & nothing else! The script by Ted Tally based on the novel by Thomas Harris is a little slow & deliberate on occasion but for the most part it's very interesting & gripping. There isn't much in the way of on-screen blood or gore, in fact very little, but it's still quite a powerful film with Anthony Hopkins performance as Hannibal Lecter the obvious standout, although having said that he has very little on-screen time with about 15 or so minutes in total which is the shortest amount of time ever to win a best actor Oscar. I liked how Silence of the Lambs ended & in particular how things turned out for Lecter. Everyone else is good as well but I personally didn't really like Jodie Foster that much as she just got on my nerves after a while & I couldn't see her as a tough chick kind of character! Horror film directors (another indication that Silence of the Lambs was indeed intended to be a horror film before it became a big success & we all know horror films can't be successful so now it's called a thriller) Roger Corman & George A. Romero both have cameos. Technically Silence of the Lambs is competent but not outstanding, the music is O.K., the photography a little flat & the production design bland but with such a strong story I guess these things don't matter so much. There are some truly great moments throughout, too. Overall I liked it for sure but I did find it a little slow going during certain places & Jodie Foster just didn't do it for me as Agent Starling for some reason I can't quite explain, Silence of the Lambs is a great horror film but I couldn't see myself sitting through it again anytime soon & it's maybe not quite as good as all those Oscars would suggest you to believe. Definitely worth watching & deserving of my 8 out of 10 star rating but I do have certain reservations about it & believe it to be a little overrated.",The Silence of the Lambs

30,zardoz-13,Excellent Serial Killer Thriller,10,25 July 2013,"""Something Wild"" director Jonathan Demme's ""The Silence of the Lambs"" proved to be a memorable milestone of a movie in both the careers of Jodie Foster and Anthony Hopkins. This serial killer thriller concerns the efforts of an FBI agent in training who proves instrumental in cracking a case that nobody could have solved without her help. The daughter of a small-time cop, Clarice Starling (Jodie Foster of ""Taxi Driver"") is minding her own business at Quantico, Virginia, negotiating an obstacle course when the FBI Chief of Behavioral Sciences, Jack Crawford (Scott Glenn of ""Sucker Punch"") summons her for an interview. Crawford wants Clarice to visit convicted murderer Dr. Hannibal Lector where he has been imprisoned for eight years. In fact, Lector hasn't laid eyes on a woman for eight years. The warden in charge of Lector's incarnation is a conceited egotist, Dr. Frederick Chilton (Anthony Heald of ""Red Dragon""), who makes a pass at her and fails. Before he allows Clarice to speak with Hannibal, Chilton shows her a photo of what happened to a nurse that Lector gnawed on. The nurse is permanently disfigured as a result of Lector's attack. Lector is now kept in a cell with a reinforced glass window and stone walls. Dr. Chilton is prepared to escort Clarice into Lector's presence, but she convinces him that Lector may clam up at the sight of Chilton. Rudely, Chilton dismisses himself and turns Clarice over to Barney. Barney (Frankie Faison of ""Hannibal"") provides Clarice with a chair and she and Lector talk briefly. Lector isn't the only unsavory soul in the prison. In what amounts to an infamous death row of sorts, other perverts are housed in the same area. One of them, Miggs, make a derogatory comment to Clarice about her body odor, and Lector later kills Miggs. Meantime, Clarice entices Lector to talk about Buffalo Bill. Bill is a serial killer who has slain five women. These women are a little bigger than the average. In Memphis, we watch as the killer, Jame Gumb (Ted Levine of ""Heat"") abducts a girl when he is struggling to load a sofa into his van. Catherine Martin (Brooke Smith) backs into the rear of the van and Gumb traps her and takes her to his house. In the basement of his residence, Gumb has a pit where he holds Catherine. Meantime, Lector provides Catherine's mother with information and he is moved to another facility. During his sojourn at the new facility, Lector fakes off the guards, kills them, and manages to escape. Lector's escape is pretty incredible. By this time, Clarice believes that she has found a clue. Crawford warns her that they have found the killer. Clarice continues with her part of the investigation and stumbles onto Gumb living in the residence where she thought she would find somebody else. Clarice narrowly survives a suspenseful moment when Gumb extinguishes the lights and uses night-vision goggles to overpower her. Clarice cannot see but she can hear and she shoots at the sound of a revolver being cocked. She empties her gun into Gumb and he dies. In other words, he doesn't jump up a few moments later. ""Silence of the Lambs"" concludes with Clarice graduating from the FBI Academy. Well-made, well-acted, ""Silence"" is top-notch material.",The Silence of the Lambs

He's one of the most interesting and well-known fictional serial killers, and this is probably the movie that manages to do him most justice. Anthony Hopkins as the serial killer, psychiatrist and cannibal was a great casting decision. He definitely performed the role as perfectly as it could be done. However, when it comes to the overall quality of the film, it just doesn't entirely measure up. The plot is good, and evolves at a pretty good pace; however, I couldn't manage to sit through the entire thing... I only barely made it, half-attentive, through the first 45 minutes. I couldn't even sit through more than 3/8's of the movie, let alone the whole thing. Now, this may be because I've seen it many times in the past years, but usually, when I can't sit through a movie because I have seen it before, it's due to my remembering most of the key parts of the movie, and not being surprised by it... but not this movie; I can say, in entire honesty, that I didn't remember or even recognize any of the film, despite having seen it plenty of times before, about one time a year. If I remember anything from a movie, that I haven't seen for a long time, it's because it had an impact on me; for example, I still haven't forgotten the twist of the famous Hitchcock horror-thriller, Vertigo, despite the fact that I've seen it once, and that was about five years ago. Nothing in this movie had an impact on me, nothing affected me deeply. Maybe I'm hard to impress, maybe I am too hardened by worse films... but still. The film involves sick and disturbing characters and actions; it should have an impact on the viewer. Maybe I'm not smart enough to get it; maybe I keep expecting the film to be very different from what it was... I don't know. I just didn't find this film as good as it has been made out to be. The acting is very good; Hopkins nails the role of Lecter perfectly. Foster is good, too. Both portray their roles convincingly, and make their characters and their actions credible. The characters are well-written, credible and, well, colorful. Buffalo Bill makes a great villain, very psychotic and disturbing. Levine also gives a very good performance. All in all, a pretty good horror-thriller, but inferior to Se7en(arguably the best of the genre), and only enjoyable for people who can appreciate the psychological aspects of the film(which I guess I can't). I recommend it exclusively to people who can enjoy a very psychological thriller-horror piece. 8/10",The Silence of the Lambs

I actually sneaked in to watch it 1.) because I was too young for an R rated movie and 2.) because I wanted to see a movie for free. I had no idea at the time that I was watching what would be considered a classic film. At that time the entire movie was new and fresh: this genius of a madman named Hannibal Lechter, this young FBI agent in training named Clarice Starling and this absolute freak making clothes out of women's skin dubbed Buffalo Bill.

But to look back, it's amazing that this film was taken seriously enough to win big. It's brutal, violent and traffics in all manner of psychopathic nastiness, from cannibalism to sexual deviation. Jonathan Demme's direction is tight but by-the-book -- it's first and foremost a plot driven movie. But the film's ace card is the performance by Anthony Hopkins, who chose to play Hannibal Lecter as a suave and polite Englishman rather than a raving lunatic. His scenes with Jodie Foster, as FBI trainee Clarice Starling, are mesmerizing, and it was a brilliant choice on the part of the screenwriter (and this probably came from the book, though I haven't read it) to make the film, under its grisly surface, essentially about a love story.Foster's performance doesn't hold up well all these years later. She's mannered and unconvincing, especially later in the film as her character becomes more frantic.

FBI agent Jack Crawford believes that Lecter, who is also a very powerful and clever mind manipulator, has the answers to their questions and can help locate the killer. However, Clarice must first gain Lecter's confidence before the inmate will give away any information.......In 1991, this movie changed the way that thrillers and horror movies would be made for a very long time.

There are so many red herrings going on, that the only genuine relationship in the whole movie is that of Lecter's and Starling's.And what performances we have from Foster and Hopkins. These are career defining performances, and yes, they were both prolific artists before the movie for years, but ask anyone about either two, and I guarantee they will mention this movie right away.The chemistry between the two is electric, and although they only share a few scenes, its cinematic gold.The camera-work is cold and stark, and the use of head shots subliminally breaking the fourth wall, adds to the tension, and almost makes you feel like you are in the actual narrative.Its a solid movie, gripping you from the bleak opening credits, right up to one of the best lines in the film.But the biggest surprise is the wonderful trick the film throws at you, duping you into thinking that the FBI are at the killers house, when it's just Starling at the door.

I've watched it once, about a year ago, and could never figure it out myself. What I saw was a pretty good thriller which bombed out at the very end. I never thought the acting was all that great either. I think Anthony Hopkins was overacting, and I thought it was one of Jodie Foster's slightest performances. She had a more complex character in Freaky Friday. Oh, and the end that I mentioned above (I guess SPOILERS):
Jodie Foster just stumbles on Buffalo Bob while following her clues. It seemed believable to me that she might come upon him before she actually new exactly who she was confronting. But it also made the film seem rushed to actually have the final showdown as soon as she accidentally runs into Buffalo Bob. It almost seemed to me as if they decided that the movie was too long at that point, and that they should just let this coincidence develop into a finale, even if it was premature. If you don't understand what I am talking about, that is, if you thought the film ended at the correct time, read Roger Ebert's review of the film. I did not develop my opinion from his review either, he  just confirmed my suspicions. I don't think Silence of the Lambs was particularly fascinating elsewhere, but it was often entertaining. I would have given it a 7/10, but the sloppy ending knocks it down to a 6/10. Jesus, how did the Academy remember this at awards time. 1992 must have been a slow year.",The Silence of the Lambs

I enjoyed watching this film again on AMC with tidbits of information on the bottom of the screen about the film-making. I would have like to have seen more Diane Baker on screen. I would have like to have known more about Dr. Lector's past too. The film always packs a punch when you least expect it at the end of the film.

47,JamesHitchcock,A Big Fish in a Small if Overcrowded Pond,7,31 January 2013,"""The Silence of the Lambs"" was the Big Film of 1991. It cleaned up at the Academy Awards, becoming only the third film in history to win the ""Big Five"" Oscars of Best Picture, Best Director, Best Actor, Best Actress and Best Writing, a feat which eluded many other Big Films. (The other two films to achieve the feat were ""It Happened One Night"" in 1934 and ""One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest"" in 1975). And yet, even though I can appreciate its many good points, it has never really been a favourite of mine. The reason it has never been a favourite of mine is probably that I don't like serial killer films very much. More recent essays in the genre such as ""The Bone Collector"", ""Se7en"" and ""Copycat"" have struck me as very overrated and as having little to do with real-life crime. ""Zodiac"", which provided a fictitious solution to a real crime, was both dull and distasteful in the way that it branded a (safely dead) real individual as the killer. Each of these films revolved around some sort of gimmick; in the case of ""The Bone Collector"", for example, the gimmick was a brilliant but disabled detective, and in ""Se7en"" it was a killer who based his pattern of killing around the Seven Deadly Sins. The gimmick in ""The Silence of the Lambs"" is the concept of one serial killer helping the FBI to capture another. It was not the first film to feature the character of Hannibal Lecter (that was ""Manhunter"" from five years earlier), but it was the one that made him famous. Lecter is brilliant psychiatrist who also happens to be a cannibalistic serial killer. Because of Lecter's insights into the criminal mind, the FBI seek his help in their pursuit of a serial killer nicknamed ""Buffalo Bill"", who kidnaps and murders women, then skins their corpses.""The Silence of the Lambs"" shares one feature in common with ""The Bone Collector"" and ""Copycat"". All three films feature a detective who is for some reason unable to investigate the crime in person, so the actual leg-work is done by a keen but inexperienced female associate. In ""The Bone Collector"" the detective is physically disabled; in ""Copycat"" she is confined to her apartment by severe agoraphobia. In this film it is Lecter rather than Clarice's superior Jack Crawford who is effectively the lead detective, but as he is incarcerated in a hospital for the criminally insane the actual investigative work has to be performed by Clarice Starling, a young FBI trainee. The two Oscars I would not dispute are those which went to Jodie Foster as Clarice and Anthony Hopkins as Lecter. Scott Glenn is rather uncharismatic as Crawford, but both Foster and Hopkins are brilliant. There are two sides to Hopkins's personality as an actor. On the one hand he can be excellent playing quiet, reserved or gentlemanly characters, like Dr Treves in ""The Elephant Man"", Frank Doel in ""84 Charing Cross Road"", C S Lewis in ""Shadowlands"" or Stevens in ""The Remains of the Day"". On the other, he can be equally effective as villainous or monstrous characters, like Lambert Leroux in ""Pravda"" or Crawford in ""Fracture"", and Lecter is undoubtedly his most famous creation in this vein. Indeed, Lecter has become one of the most famous villains in the modern cinema, a man who is undoubtedly cultured and intellectually brilliant, possessed of both a rather grave old-world courtesy and a savage low cunning, and morally quite insane, quite incapable of understanding why killing and eating people is considered morally wrong, although he is fully aware that it is illegal. He describes with lip-smacking relish how he ate one individual's liver ""with some fava beans and a nice Chianti"". Foster's performance here is perhaps less obviously dramatic than those she gave in two other films from around this period, ""The Accused"" and ""Nell"", but Clarice Starling is a rather different character to Nell or Sarah in ""The Accused""- quiet, determined and professional, anxious to hide her emotions. She combines well with the more obviously flamboyant Hopkins as Lecter and Clarice start to play complicated mind-games with one another, each trying to get inside the other's head. (The film's rather obscure title derives from a traumatic episode in Clarice's childhood, which Lecter succeeds in worming out of her). There is also a good contribution from Ted Levine as Buffalo Bill.1991 was not perhaps the greatest year in cinematic history; I doubt very much if ""The Silence of the Lambs"" would have scooped the ""Big Five"" had it appeared in the same year as, say, ""Dances with Wolves"" (the Big Film of 1990) or ""Unforgiven"" (ditto of 1992). My own choice for Best Picture in 1991 would have been Zhang Yimou's masterly ""Raise the Red Lantern"", but the Academy is notorious for its dislike of foreign-language films; all films to have won ""Best Picture"" have been American or British, apart from the French ""The Artist""- which contained no spoken dialogue. My favourite American film of the year would probably have been ""Cape Fear"", but in the early nineties the Academy was equally notorious for its dislike of Martin Scorsese. ""The Silence of the Lambs"" is well-directed; Jonathan Demme skilfully handles his material to produce a tense, exciting thriller. Yet despite this, and despite some fine acting, the film never really rises above the limitations of its genre, remaining a combination of Grand Guignol and gruesome crossword puzzle. (Sometimes almost literally so; Lecter shares the crossword compiler's weakness for puns, anagrams and word- games). It may be the best film ever made about a psychopathic criminal, but that only makes it a big fish in a small if overcrowded pond. 7/10",The Silence of the Lambs
48,StevePulaski,Dr. Lecter will see you know...,8,4 May 2014,"The Silence of the Lambs is one of the rare horror films that convinced much of the American public, and even the Academy Awards, that horror doesn't have to always be about gore, excess violence, and extremism. In fact, horror can stem from many different aspects, one of them being psychological, which is the subgenre that the film caters to. Through use of strong acting and an interesting story, the film manages to explain why it etched itself into the list of greatest American films ever made simply by existing and going what nobody thought its own genre could do.The film stars Jodie Foster as Clarice Starling, who is pulled from her training at an FBI academy by Jack Crawford (Scott Glenn), who works for a unit in behavioral sciences. Jack grants Clarice the honor of meeting one-on-one with former psychiatrist and serial killer Dr. Hannibal Lecter (Anthony Hopkins), who is also known for cannibalistic crimes. Lecter's knowledge is requested because of a serial killer nicknamed ""Buffalo Bill"" currently running rampant in the streets, who is highly-publicized and known to skin the corpses of his female victims.Upon arriving at the Baltimore State Hospital for the Criminally Insane, Clarice meets a surprisingly mannered and well-articulate man that is Hannibal Lecter and not the psychotic murderer one would believe. What unravels is a strange relationship between an FBI trainee and an insane mental patient. Starling has to get close to Lecter for his knowledge and insight into the crimes of ""Buffalo Bill,"" but also must refrain from dangerously close connections which could instantly spark something detrimental to her well-being.The first thing to marvel at with this film is how it utilizes its talent, plunging Foster and Hopkins into a story and set of circumstances that need to be well acted in order to be believable and gripping; both veteran talents do not slump here. Foster gives a very solid performance as Clarice, that is mostly successful at avoided the often alienating tropes that result when we focus on cops or undercover investigators for two hours. Then there's Hopkins, in a role he has become known for for good reason. Hopkins instantly clicks here as Lecter, provoking fright and unsettled nerves with viewers. Rather than over-the-top zaniness, Lecter relies on quiet, mannered acting techniques that are all the more frightening because of how out of the ordinary and unexpected they are from a man of his caliber. This leads the viewer to ping-pong back and forth with the idea that Lecter is really a misunderstood victim or an amazingly talented con-artist.Then there's the mounting tension on display here, largely thanks to Jonathan Demme's direction and Ted Tally's screenplay. The film plays like a true detective story, utilizing slowburn and patient tension in order to achieve a great, suspenseful result. These kinds of films hold up because they deliver something new each time one sees them. This being my first time viewing The Silence of the Lambs one gets the idea that even after seeing it, watching it again would be a great experience because it would allow you to pay more attention to the serene details of the film and how the end result came to be.With strong work behind the camera, and equally strong work in front, there's really no shock that The Silence of the Lambs came out the way it did, a strong and capable psychological thriller/horror film that beautifully relies on nuances and mannerisms rather than shock and awe. The fact that the film may have lead some to look at the horror genre with a bit more respect in the short-run would maybe be a stronger statement if horror didn't go south in the long-run. But that's another blog/review for another time.Starring: Jodie Foster, Anthony Hopkins, Scott Glenn, and Ted Levine. Directed by: Jonathan Demme.",The Silence of the Lambs

""I ate his liver with some fava beans and a nice bottle of chianti,"" he tells FBI Agent Clarice Starling (Jodie Foster) after she meets him in a prison, metal bars their only means of separation.Their first conversation and face-to-face interaction is a vital element of the film's narrative; the bars represent Starling's own self-defense; they have wide-open spaces that are easily penetrable. And Hannibal Lecter, a psychologist and cannibal, knows exactly how to reach past her own mental cell bars and crack into her brain, and he does so in the classic scene where she recalls memories from her childhood, of the lamb she tried to save...Agent Starling is on the case of a bizarre serial killer whose victims tend to be young women. Although they are unaware of his motives, it turns out the infamous ""Buffalo Bill"" is using the skin of these unfortunate victims for his own sick pleasure. He's not the sort of person you'd feel comfortable being stuck next to in an otherwise empty elevator.Clarice is smart, a feminine icon of the movies. Her brains are what propel her own investigation into the case while her desire to unearth the truth and succeed past the results of her male counterparts stems from a sort of egotistical dominance. Not many people comment upon Sterling's own sexuality, her almost overly excessive efforts at saving the victims (who happen to be females). Buffalo Bill seems to represent her own image of men: cruel creatures who inflict pain and suffering upon helpless women. Her sole friend, the only man she can rely on for help and inside tidbits, is an outcast upon society -- a metaphor for the repressed homosexuals who are abandoned by their own societies, shunned by those who feel they are not ""normal."" Harris's underlying implications of homosexuality and female dominance in the novel are admittedly stronger than in the film, although the presence of the suggestions is clearly evident under close examination.Or, it could just be about serial killers and FBI agents. You decide.Sure, the movie is famous, but we must ask ourselves whether or not the film's reputation has given it a better face over the year than it has deserved. It is well directed, but never does the film fascinate us as the bold and daring ""Se7en"" did. ""Silence of the Lambs"" is a fine film, but pales in comparison to some of its imitators and fellow genre occupants.The acting and writing is not at fault. Hopkins and Foster are superb. Hopkins received the most critical acclaim, although in 2001 we all realized that Foster was a key to the series as well, when she was unsuccessfully replaced with Julianne Moore in the sequel, ""Hannibal,"" directed by Ridley Scott, which was a total failure and disappointment for the fans of the original and source material, the novels by Thomas Harris, who has reportedly never seen ""Silence of the Lambs"" for fear that it would influence his writing.""Lambs,"" more than any other film in the series, is terribly manipulative, complete with tacky flashbacks that are out of place and all too convenient. That's where the film ultimately fails. The direction by Jonathan Demme is, truth be told, rather poor and borderline mediocre; Demme does not use cinematography to his advantage, does not use darker tones to evoke feelings from the prints as Fincher did with ""Se7en."" It's a great movie with convincing performances and a realistic script packaged in the form of a typical Hollywood thriller -- it might have a good reputation, it might be a good movie, but compared to other classics of the genre, ""The Silence of the Lambs"" just doesn't hold up as much as I had hoped it would after all these years.

54,Red-Barracuda,One of the all time definitive serial killer movies,10,11 May 2015,"The Silence of the Lambs surprised everybody by winning all five major Oscars and being only the third film, as well as the last, to achieve this. I say 'surprised' not because it was an unworthy winner, quite the contrary, but because it is only once in a blue moon when the Academy acknowledges any R rated film with any awards such as these.Based pretty closely on the riveting Thomas Harris novel of the same name, this was the second film to feature his character Hannibal Lecter, the first being the Michael Mann thriller Manhunter (1986). Both movies take differing approaches to their broadly similar material but where the earlier film is almost clinically stylised, Lambs is a little more horror-oriented. This extends to Anthony Hopkins performance of refined malevolence as Lecter, which was one that would propel him to super-stardom. From his first appearance in a cell that looks not unlike a medieval dungeon, Hopkins is in his element playing this extremely interesting character in such a way as to maximise all possibilities. He really steals every scene he is in and this is no disrespect to Jodie Foster who is the definite lead, she also puts in an extremely good turn overall but this will always primarily be remembered as being Hopkins movie. That said, much of the overall credit has to go to director Jonathan Demme for putting together a masterfully paced and edited film, while remaining very faithful to the source novel.The story has a top FBI student Clarice Starling assigned to a special case where she is to interview incarcerated cannibalistic serial killer Hannibal Lecter as a way to help identify another murderer at large known as Buffalo Bill. In doing so she is forced to let Lecter into her mind, with all the inherent psychological dangers that presents.The Silence of the Lambs remains a very effective thriller that focuses its attention mostly on the psychological, yet is memorably visceral on occasion too. It's pretty intense in places, with all of the scenes involving Buffalo Bill being extremely creepy indeed. But it's also the various details of the investigation that make a huge impact. Layer upon layer of dark intrigue is slowly and expertly revealed to ultimately construct a dark masterpiece. What gives it its extra level of greatness of course is the script and performances. All-in-all, a justifiably revered and iconic film that still packs a punch.",The Silence of the Lambs
55,sddavis63,Flawless; An Absolutely Spectacular Treasure,10,23 September 2002,"Immeasurably superior to its disappointing sequel ""Hannibal,"" ""Silence of the Lambs"" must surely rank as one of the absolute greatest thrillers of all time. Given the nature of the movie, there is surprisingly little graphic violence contained in it. The story focuses instead on the complex psychological relationship between FBI trainee Clarice Starling (Jodie Foster) and the imprisoned cannibalistic serial killer and ex-psychiatrist Dr. Hannibal Lecter (Anthony Hopkins.) Both Foster and Hopkins are brilliant. Foster has the larger role, and carries it off well, but Hopkins steals the movie with a frighteningly realistic portrayal of a frightening serial killer. Lecter, approached by the FBI because they believe he might be of assistance in helping identify a current serial killer known as ""Buffalo Bill,"" sees in the FBI's interest an opportunity to escape imprisonment, and plays a series of mind games with Starling (and anyone else who wants to speak to him about the case.)Director Jonathon Demme effectively weaves two stories (the hunt for the serial killer, and the Starling-Lecter relationship) together into a taut thriller that will have you on the edge of your seat. And, in the end, has there ever been a better, funnier and more thoroughly chilling line in any movie than Lecter's closing comment to Clarice: ""I have to go now. I'm having an old friend for dinner.""I can't identify a single weakness in this movie. 10/10.",The Silence of the Lambs
56,thesar-2,Hands Down Best Movie of ALL time,10,20 February 2010,"""Believe me, you don't want Hannibal Lecter inside your head."" – Jack Crawford.No truer words have been written about the monster, Hannibal Lecter in what I call my FAVORITE MOVIE OF ALL TIME: The Silence of the Lambs.I used to work for AMC Gateway on 59th Avenue and Bell Road in Glendale, AZ way back in 1991. I was 16, and one of the perks, was, if you were able to, watching movies at late night prior to movies being released the following day. So, I would say this was February 13th 1991. They did this to make sure the film ran correctly, audio, picture, etc. But, the employees were invited. And it was like a party: only about 10 or so inhabited their biggest theatre. It was a fantastic experience with my peers, as was the movie.Jonathan Demme's masterpiece of sound and visuals rests on many factors: acting, screenplay, sound, mood, surprises, pace, dialogue, suspense, originality, opening, middle and end, comedy, character development, believability, music, score, editing and literal bite. Honestly, I could write an entire hardback on all of these aspects and still have enough for a follow-up publication. In short, this movie worked on all angles. No other movie have I ever seen, in the 1000's I have seen, hit the nail on the head on every single right move on how a movie is supposed to be made upon.In what most people don't know (but it has become more common knowledge in recent years) is the follow-up/sequel to 1986's Manhunter, The Silence of the Lambs begins with Clarice Starling (Foster,) a definitive over-achiever FBI trainee. Immediately into the film, she's summoned by her mentor/soon-to-be boss (she hopes,) Crawford (Glenn) to merely interview the imprisoned ""Hannibal the Cannibal"" (Hopkins.) She suspects it's concerning on-the-loose serial killer ""Buffalo Bill"" but takes the assignment anyways.Upon meeting, he doesn't just call her out; he sniffs her previous lotion and dissects her innermost fears. Undeterred, the trainee follows the leads Hannibal presents, while previously bad memories resurface and the status of a Senator's Daughter's life is at stake while in the hands of Buffalo Bill. Frankly, she's juggling a lot.All the while, Crawford's actually (and surprisingly to him) impressed and Hannibal continues to taunt – whether to teach, learn, relieve boredom or use Starling, all for his own amusement. Despite his previous free existence's knowledge, before being caught as a serial cannibal/murderer, he's giving her all she needs to ""advance,"" or, in turn, catch the killer, Jame ""Buffalo Bill"" Gumb.The movie is only the third (at the time) in history to ""Sweep"" the Oscars, meaning: it took all five top awards: Picture, Director, Actor, Actress and (adapted) Screenplay. (For the record, I've read all the Hannibal Lecter books by Thomas Harris (all but Hannibal Rising) and I'm definitely in agreeance with that last one. No one could've translated the mood, theme or scene-by-scene as well as screenplay writer Ted Tally did.) Despite the 5 Oscars it did win, it deserved more.Score! Or, the musical background music was amazing and in my top list of all time best scores. Creepy, moody and the perfect sound to match the theme/atmosphere of the film. The soundtrack, or music tracks, such as American Girl by Tom Petty and especially Goodbye Horses by Q. Lazzarus were both not only excellent choices for the film (and scenes) but, personally, they shot to my ""best of"" movie music lists. Also, it should've won for editing. This movie was beautifully cut and carefully spliced together. In addition, another award for cinematography was justified, as the movie's photography was eerie, colorful – when called for and truly put you in the character's shoes.You must see this movie. Everything works. It is gory at times, really gory. And I wouldn't like a movie if that's all they gave me. It must contain a story, character depth/growth and true to the story acting. Obviously, I'm going to say this does, and I'd be right.And finally it truly invented my number one favorite villain, Dr. Hannibal Lecter. Sure, Brian Cox already played him in Manhunter and as good as Cox is as an actor, no one could touch Hopkins powerful performance. Apparently he did a lot of the stances, movements, creation of the monster all by himself and it paid off. Thanks to Demme for allowing him to create such an icon. He was scary, smart, deadly and had charisma all in a single breath on screen. This kind of acting job comes but once, generally, to any great actor.Need more evidence that Hopkins did a role of a lifetime? His screen presence was so powerful, he even tricked the audience into thinking he appeared all throughout the film, yet was only shown for under 25 minutes, or less than a fourth of the film. Not the shortest timeframe for an actor to win Best Actor over Best Supporting Actor, but his impact not only impressed the Academy Award voters and audience, but you will truly feel his presence even when he's not on film.This is largely due to the fact on how great Jodie Foster was – another role of a lifetime for her. She carried Lecter's spirit with her when she left his asylum, and on screen, that's not easy. In addition, she was vulnerable and strong, smart and slow, determined and deterred.all of these at the same time. As much as everyone, including myself, focused on how great Hopkins was, she deserves equal treatment on how masterfully she played her part.""I've no plans to call on you, Clarice. The world is more interesting with you in it."" – Dr. Hannibal Lecter.Actually, he's the one that made our world a lot more interesting.",The Silence of the Lambs

58,wellthatswhatithinkanyway,A truly remarkable film,10,16 November 2005,"STAR RATING: ***** The Works **** Just Misses the Mark *** That Little Bit In Between ** Lagging Behind * The Pits Rookie FBI agent Clarice Starling (Jodie Foster) is assigned to get into the mind of notorious incarcerated serial killer Dr Hannibal 'the Cannibal' Lecter (Anthony Hopkins) to get his evaluation on the elusive Buffalo Bill, a serial killer who's been abducting and killing young women. When a prominent senator's daughter is kidnapped, it becomes a race against time to find her before she is killed and all the while Lecter is playing mind-games with Starling as well as any help he can provide...The first of Thomas Harris's Hannibal novels to be adapted for the screen, only to be followed some years later with some very lacklustre (but inevitable!) follow-ups, despite it's age this remains one of the most effective chillers of modern times. Despite the mainstream appeal of the film, the grainy lighting and laid-back budget give it an art-house feel that sets it apart from other such films that were as successful. The film manages some effectively disturbing scenes that make it a not altogether pleasant viewing experience.Performances wise, in a very early role, a young Foster shows her promise for future roles, with a gripping portrayal of naivety and vulnerability here that is very compelling and convincing, even though there are some plausibility problems with someone as junior as her being assigned to do something like that. Hopkins too is brilliant as Lecter, playing a dangerous man behind bars who's ability to get inside your head and see the things you don't want him to see makes him no less dangerous, if not more so, than if he was on the outside. He's certainly received the most acclaim for his role over the years, but in my humble opinion, he's actually over-shadowed (though only slightly!) by Ted Levine as Buffalo Bill, a truly extraordinary psychopath with an unsettling sexuality disorder that is probably one of the nastiest things ever to be seen in such a mainstream film. As supporting FBI agent Crawford, Scott Glenn is impressive but sort of just faded into DTV land after this film.It's easily one of the most popular films ever made, so it's likely a lot of you are familiar with it already, but with reviews on the so-inferior follow-up films Red Dragon and Hannibal, I thought it only right that I'd finally give this first film a mention. Truly remarkable. *****",The Silence of the Lambs
59,ElMaruecan82,A Modern Horror Masterpiece ...,10,14 August 2011,"If there ever was a movie genre that needed constant renovations in order to maintain its appeal, it's certainly Horror, and at this level, ""The Silence of the Lambs"" didn't just reinvent but transcended it.Fear is based on a simple principle : the 'boo' effect. The less we expect something to happen, the most it scares us. ""Psycho"", by featuring a totally demented boy-next-door villain, terrified an audience used to associate horror with vampires and exotic monsters. ""The Exorcist"" pushed the level of realism to a magnificent artistry while ""Jaws"" suggested a mysterious presence, keeping it even more frightening, a device sublimated by the movies ""Alien"" and ""The Shining"". All these movies shared an iconic significance in the evolution of Thriller and more specifically Horror films and it seemed like nothing could surprise a mature audience anymore This situation worsened with the consecration of slasher films and their overused cheap-plotted formulas making uncertain recipes out of classic ingredients, notably those introduced by the previous masterpieces : hemoglobin overdose, gruesome over-the-top special effects and various experimentations that pushed the genre down to Z-movies in the worst case, and in the best, B-movies with a cult status. So, a masterpiece built out of a new and fresh material was begging to be made. And cinematic Gods attributed this mission to Jonathan Demme with the classic ""Silence of the Lambs"", the first Horror film to win the Oscar for Best Picture. Finally.""The Silence of the Lambs"" is one of the greatest cinematic achievements of cinema's history. Every single element contributes to create a disturbing and unique atmosphere, and I use very carefully the word 'unique'. I highly doubt anyone was reminded of a villain with the same caliber as Dr. Hannibal -with the chilling rhyming nickname- Lecter, masterfully personified by Anthony Hopkins. I doubt anyone remembers a similar movie where a young, vulnerable and non-Ellen-Ripley looking girl doesn't play the victim, nor the hero's love interest, but the actual heroine. Clarice Starling, as a FBI trainee is played by Jodie Foster, in a performance subtly combining feminine vulnerability and heroic tenacity. And no one would have expected the film to have a binary structure with a classic serial-killer's investigation in one hand, and a subplot involving one of the greatest movie villains of all-time and his interaction with the heroine, on the other.The script is tightly constructed, patiently leading us to assemble each piece of the puzzle until the series of interactions between Clarice and Hannibal approaches a disturbing truth. The relationship between the two leads is even more fascinating because it deepens their personalities and allows us to get more and more in their background : the wounds in Clarice's past, the mystery around Hannibal Lecter, and the roots of evil that inspired the serial killers' acts. And this is where the freshness of the film relies on : its capability to put everything into perspective and invite our perceptions to go beyond the simple 'good vs. evil' dichotomy. The villain are no sharks, no monsters, no possessing demons, they are everyday men, like some Norman Bates with an extra level of savagery and pervert creativity and we try to understand to better fight them, under the pervert irony that the investigation requires a psychopathic mind to arrest another one.Talking about psychopath, the way Hannibal is introduced after the first minutes is impressive and gloomy enough to make us expect the worst and when we finally see him, standing, well-dressed, clean cut, the impact is immediate. Demme's meticulous direction introduces Clarice in a very clever way too, she's basically a girl enduring a lot of stress and hardship while trying to overcome a physically handicapping feminine condition in a world of men. There's one scene where she enters an elevator, surrounded by a group of men whose big sizes emphasize her tininess. Another moment shows her trying to handle a group of officers standing in a room, assessing a minimum of authority. Clarice Starling is endearing and engaging as the heroine driven by a desire of justice and accomplishment, and the trust or fondness developed by both the Agent in Charge, Crawford, played by Scott Glenn, and maybe Hannibal Lecter, himself. After all, the many close-ups on his face during his interrogations and the suavity of his voice suggest a disturbing feel of intimacy between him and Clarice. And as the investigations progresses, the extraordinary portrayal of the real villain of the film, by an underrated Ted Levine, keeps us hooked until the final confrontation. If you noticed, I mentioned every element that generally makes a great movie, writing, acting, directing, the movie was indeed the third, and last to date, to win the five major Academy Awards, after ""It Happened One Night"" and ""One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest"". It had this classic feeling from the day it was released because it combined so many new elements that defined the notion of psychological thriller, before it became a trend. And it's no surprise that the film topped many list from the American Film Institute, #5 of AFI's 100 Thrills, #6 heroine, and good ol' Hannibal as number one movie villain, and he wasn't even the main antagonist in the film, which says as much as his winning the Oscar for less than 20 minutes on-screen, to find a character with the same cinematic aura, I guess we would go back to Vito Corleone.""The Silence of the Lambs"" reinvented the horror genre as the kind of movie that would have made Alfred Hitchcock proud : a scary villain, a sympathetic hero, a script respecting our intelligence, top-notch direction and editing, and for one thing, it didn't even need a twist ending",The Silence of the Lambs

The incredibly disciplined way in which the film restrains its two most flamboyant aspects - those being the serial killers Hannibal Lecter and Buffalo Bill - to always maintain the perspective of its rookie FBI protagonist as she navigates her way through her newfound world of silver-tongued devils and elusive monsters is both impressive and necessary in elevating the piece above what could've been simple shock value. The feature is gripping right from its opening moments and always maintains a tight grip on its psychologically complex characters who remain fully rounded no matter on which side of sociopathy - or the law - they sit. Thanks to a mature treatment of its audience, it never feels as though it is pandering or dumbing itself down, rather elevating the viewer to its own level of intelligence. The picture also knows when to pull back on the reigns too, making for an experience far more cerebral than visceral; this is something perhaps unexpected from a thriller where a serial-killing cannibal is, for all intents and purposes, one of the 'good guys'. 8/10.",The Silence of the Lambs

Regardless, she and Anthony Hopkins turn in legendary performances, and there are lots of scary moments here.

""Silence of the Lambs"" is exactly this type of experience.For a basic plot summary, ""Silence of the Lambs"" sees young FBI agent Clarice Starling (Jodi Foster) given her first assignment: interrogate Hannibal ""The Cannibal"" Lector (Anthony Hopkins), a former psychologist-turned-psychopath. In trying to glean some information from Hannibal about the grizzly ""Buffalo Bill"" murders, Clarice catches the caged madman's sense of gamesmanship and enters into a battle of wits with the thought-provoking Lector.This film primarily works because of the Hannibal Lector character. From out of nowhere, he becomes one of the most iconic villains in cinema history. He's clearly a crazed personality (as evidenced by his cannibalistic tendencies), but at the same time he is utterly brilliant ability to dissect the inner human psyche. His inner battle of wits with Agent Starling is incredibly interesting material that never gets old no matter how many times it is viewed.However, the film is also just an overall general masterpiece in pretty much all areas. The basic plot involving the Buffalo Bill maniac is chilling (especially the heart-pounding ending), the music is also creepily in the background, and the visuals are scary while still managing to be realistic.Simply put, this is one of the greatest suspense thrillers ever made.

The first time we arrive at said psychopath's cell, it is en route through many-a door and corridor as Chilton describes in a chaotic and disorientating nature the rules which come with interacting with this beast – a final warning as the screen, drenched in blood red lighting, when a photograph of a deformed nurse harmed only recently by the inmate is displayed to her. The key item being that we do not see the picture, and along with all the hustling build up, must come to our own conclusions about the imminent interaction. Build up such as the above aids in making the man feel as if he's present more in the film than in actuality.Such a sequence, or chain of events, goes a long way in capturing everything that makes The Silence of the Lambs so effective, that sense of talking about something and building it up rather than out-and-out showing it. The common place is that the first thing you jump to when talking about the film is the particular character the above dialogue refers to, and how their presence is both so very fascinating as well as rather frightening. The fact the film balances this well enough with everything else so that as to avoid ultimately overwhelm the film is an achievement. That character is of course a certain Hannibal Lecter, an individual played by Anthony Hopkins in what is a highly praised performance for his portrayal of the man, a victim of countless spoofs; references and imitations since. Lecter is both foil and mentor; both anti-hero and a (not THE) villain, psychotic enough to have previously killed and maimed, but smart enough to identify when genuinely coming across as helpful to a cause might aid in his own intentions. There is a degree of irony in the fact F.B.I. chief Jack Crawford (Glenn) attempts to exploit the mind of Lecter so much that his desperation forces him to turn to a young female rookie, something that ultimately stirs Hannibal's creative juices enough so that he may carry out what eventually happens in the film.When our lead, a certain Clarice Starling (Foster), arrives at a heavily guarded entrance, the film is constructed through Starling's point of view as we observe security screens; an armed guard plus his arsenal of shotguns as well as heavily fortified steel doors protecting this little area all by itself stand tall, all before settling on the welcoming tone of an orderly named Barney. The film's first interaction between them plays out, and the film toys with all the prior material in having Lecter demand he have a ""closer"" look at her identification. But despite Lecter, it is lead Clarice Starling whom drives the film; heading on out into her own arc of self discovery within a circular journey; all the while with the slow burning memories and tragedies of years of old eating away at the back of her mind. Whilst the leads ponder Lecter as a tool, key for burrowing into a certain Buffalo Bill (Levine), a slight nickname for a serial killer in operation, it is Lecter that provides the burrowing into Starling and her own past for sake of us that proves just as interesting.Most of the latter half of Starling's past, that is to say her childhood, reveals a sense of desperation to aid the helpless or a violent reaction to slaughter and murder and an aching lust to reject it in helping those that are victims of it. This, combined with her father and both his role and his fate, help in fleshing Starling out and getting to understand why it is what she is, something a little more than a nameless; faceless protagonist detective hired to take care of whatever case because the demands of that genre implore it. If American films of the action, thriller or detective ilk produced in the 1980s fed off an idea of the male lead and their body being put through a grinding process of harm and hurt, then The Silence of the Lambs toys with this in its opening segment when a yet to be identified Starling huffs and puffs her way through an assault course in rural nowhere, putting her body through the established test before someone intervenes and sends her on her way to an assignment which will ultimately lead her on her quest. Progressively, the film develops Starling as the agent she will become; observing tiny details such as having her describe what she correctly assumes Buffalo Bill to look like, a scene after we observe him for the first time in swiping his next victim.The tie that binds Starling's world both inside and outside of the F.B.I. academy is a degree of sexism and individualism; exemplified when male trainees gaze at her as she jogs past but also when she is surrounded in an elevator early on, the colours of the occupants' jerseys getting across a sense of alienation. This, as Chilton's futile flirting plays out at the asylum; a moth expert's advances are rejected and an additional sense of astonishment contained within by local law enforcers when she orders out a room full of them whom are relegated to having to bear it occur. The text is aware of both its lead character's strength and gender, providing a number of instances in which the danger of getting knocked back down because of both role and gender is made aware but always rejected. The film is a powerful, well observed pot boiler as detectives race against time and a fascinating third element in Lecter ominously plans and ploys. In combining narrative with character study, Demme has created something remarkable.",The Silence of the Lambs
76,filipemanuelneto,One of the best thrillers ever,10,30 July 2016,"In this film, the young and inexperienced FBI Agent Starling will need the help of Hannibal Lecter, a dangerous and manipulative cannibal, to capture a serial killer. Directed by Jonathan Demme, it has screenplay by Ted Tally, and has the participation of Jodie Foster and Anthony Hopkins. Won five Oscars (Best Picture, Best Actor, Best Actress, Best Director and Best Adapted Screenplay; was also nominated for Best Sound and Best Editing).This film needs no introduction and has already become a classic. The Hanibal character is a horror icon and consecrated Hopkins as one of the greatest masters of representation of the late twentieth century. Decidedly, watching this film, we have the notion that all factors combined, in the ideal measure, to make a piece of art that, even so, due to the topic and some more shocking scenes, is not suitable for sensitive people.The script is excellent and works in a masterly manner, without errors or holes. The work of director was essential for the success of the film, along with the performance of the actors themselves. In fact, even the supporting actors in the film were very good in their roles, although the spotlight have been under the heads of Hopkins and Foster. The two actors were brilliant, the way they interact is a drama lesson. The penetrating gaze of Hopkins, and his viperous cynicism, are one of the registered marks of the film. The rest (sets, costumes, photography and soundtrack) is impeccable. It's a great movie, recommended to those who like a suspense story.",The Silence of the Lambs

This is the kind of movie that while you are watching it you think it's really good. But when it's over and you begin to think about what you just watched, you realize that it's pretty dumb. Hannibal Lector escapes by wearing a dead guy's face. Silly. Oh by the way, how did Lector steal the pen? They don't tell you because it would have been impossible for him to steal it.

I found the writing and direction to be typical for the Hollywood formula. Characters were unappealing and unrealistic.I found the antagonist to be completely unreal even thought I think Anthony Hopkins played the character correctly. I do not find the character to be strong enough to be considered a threat. Many of the scenes use deus ex machina to force the movie along and allow characters to get away with murder (lol).Ted Levine did an amazing, creepy job of the character Buffalo Bill. I understand that his character and the scenes he did were completely ad lib. So amazing that it even creeped out Ted Levine and for a time he didn't watch the movie.I'll point out that the deus ex machina happens a lot and too much for such a dangerous character. This is why the script fails and it is unbelievable. They want you to believe on thing about this character, but in return, they give the character the keys to escape.The rest of the movie, acting, script and direction are lacking. I was bored through the entire movie. Yes, there are a few scenes I liked, but it wasn't enough to make me care about the characters.I can't believe this won best picture. Seriously.

83,insomniac_rod,"Excellent display of acting, direction, dialog, and the mind of a serial killer through the eyes of Dr. Lecter.",10,23 July 2006,"This movie is simply excellent because it truly shows you the life and methods of a serial killer. Not only that, the movie also demonstrates how the FBI investigates, studies, and acts against these maniacs. If that isn't enough, the movie also displays the basics of criminology. We have a complete serial killer movie with high budget and excellent production values. This is by far, the best movie about any serial killer. The main character should be Buffalo Bill because all of the events have to do with him. The FBI is ""hunting"" him because he kidnapped the daughter of a senator. The FBI agent in charge of the case is investigating hints given by the sinister Dr. Lecter in order to catch Buffalo Bill. And of course, Dr. Lecter's speeches always give something away in order to capture the maniac. The events that lead to the ending have important information; every scene is a step towards the mystery behind Buffalo Bill. Agent Sarling is the person in charge of the investigations. She's clever, brave, and beautiful. I won't get that much into the scenes of the movie because it would be giving away important things to those who haven't seen it. I'll just comment on how this movie displays the intense relationship between a novice agent and a powerful-minded cannibal, who also is a psychologist. The relationship between Dr. Lecter and Agent Starling is the best feature of the movie; all the scenes involving both are great in the acting and dialog factor. The acting couldn't be better. Mr. Hopkins delivers his best performance to date. Dr. Lecter is the eyes of Buffalo Bill; we get to understand and learn about him through Lecter. Jodie Foster demonstrates that she's a brilliant actress and person. How could she manage to perform this complex character? She's just great. The direction is great. With the proper use of dark combined with beautiful exteriors, ""Silence Of The Lambs"" is an unsetting movie with excellent cinematography. This movie has some memorable scenes in movie cinema and will always be the number one movie about a serial killer.

85,Movie_Muse_Reviews,A near flawless execution of a crime thriller,8,16 February 2008,"Few crime films seem to transcend their genre. ""Silence of the Lambs"" is one of them. With incredible characters and careful, thoughtful direction, it's not a complete surprise that this film is among the many elite that call themselves Academy Award winning best pictures.The film centers around Clarice Starling (Jodi Foster), an FBI trainee that essentially because of being young and feminine, gets assigned to work with a serial killer: the infamous Hannibal Lecter, one of the most chilling villains of all time played by Sir Anthony Hopkins. Eventually she finds herself thrust into another serial murder case involving ""Buffalo Bill"" and must seek the nutty Lecter's advice in order to solve it.Starling and her struggle to ward off the sexist world of that surrounds her in this field is the film's centerpiece. Director Jonathan Demme does a great job focusing on Foster's strengths: her facial expressions, her constant nervousness knowing that this will make or break the career to which she aspires. Demme also does a great job making it clear, but not too overtly so, how the men in the film eerily gravitate toward her in every situation. It's bothering, but the fact that she is indeed the film's hero makes it somewhat empowering.While little attention was paid to ""Buffalo Bill,"" an interesting character with a powerful metaphor and comparison to Starling in Thomas Harris' book, the focus is substituted with full attention to Lecter's scenes and his role becomes more pivotal in the film, which is clearly worth it given Hopkins' talent. It is then more about how he affects Starling and how they work together and form a unique relationship. It is unfortunate both could not be stronger, but there's is no arguing with the strength of this screenplay.""Silence of the Lambs"" is not the kind of film that will move you, but it is an excellent example of how great characters can take an ordinary serial murder plot and make it something more than just a genre film.~Steven CVisit my site: http://moviemusereviews.com",The Silence of the Lambs

87,Anonymous_Maxine,Definitely one of the best thrillers of all time.,10,30 January 2001,"I'm normally not one to spend much time concerning myself with who won what Oscar and who didn't win that Oscar, but if anyone but Anthony Hopkins had been awarded the Best Actor Oscar in 1991 I would have been bitterly disappointed. In my opinion, Hopkins' performance as the deceptively charming Hannibal Lecter is one of the best performances ever caught on film. Especially if you have read the novel by Thomas Harris, Hopkins flawlessly captures all sides of the tremendously complex personality of Hannibal Lecter, providing for one of the main things that made The Silence of the Lambs such a spectacular film. (possible spoilers ahead) Another person who performed amazingly well was Ted Levine as the horribly disturbed murderer Jame Gumb. Levine presents a startlingly convincing portrayal of the disgustingness of this character, as well as his psychological isolation from the normal world and other people in general, shown with great effectiveness through the way that he talks to his victims (`It rubs the lotion on its skin or else it gets the hose again.'). Jame Gumb (whose first name, Jamie, had been misspelled on his birth certificate, but he insisted on leaving it that way) is the man that the FBI is utilizing Lecter's tremendous intelligence to try to capture. Gumb kidnaps full figured women and cuts portions of their skins off, which he sews together in order to make himself a full body human skin suit. One of the amazing things about this film is that it was able to win a Best Picture Oscar while having such a gory premise, and this obviously has something to do with the tremendous quality of the movie. It was so good because there were so many things going on in the film.  I guess you could say the plot was extremely thick. Clarice Starling, played excellently by Jodie Foster, is an FBI trainee who is assigned the emotionally and psychologically dangerous task of trying to get Lecter to talk to her, because he sees right through all of the questionnaires and surveys given to him by countless other, more experienced, personnel. Beyond that, Starling is also fighting her own personal demons; she's struggling through her training, she has to ward off the amorous advances of at least one of her superiors, and now she is faced with an assignment that dwarfs all of those problems. Then you have the story with Jame Gumb, and on the other side, you have the struggle of dozens of people trying to control Lecter and get him to talk without damaging anyone emotionally or psychologically (evidently he was able to talk the insane inmate in the cell next to his into swallowing his tongue one night). You also have a very detailed subplot about the types of insects that are found on the bodies of Gumb's victims. And, of course, you have Lecter's stunning insights, providing in one very tense scene, the meaning of the title, The Silence of the Lambs. Clearly, Thomas Harris deserves a lot of credit for his outstanding novel, but so do the filmmakers for their efforts at crafting this first rate thriller. This is not exploitative cinema in any way, and it is extremely unique in both its story as well as its presentation. Some scenes really stood out in their originality, particularly Dr. Lecter's escape, although it is never clearly explained how Lecter, while in restraints, was able to get a hold of Dr. Chilton's ballpoint pen, which he had been eyeing as it lay on the desk and which he eventually used to open his handcuffs. Luckily, the quality of the film as a whole overshadows trivial things like this, making them more than excusable. This is a very graphic film, make no mistake about that, but it is so well done that it can be enjoyed by virtually anyone.",The Silence of the Lambs
88,imseeg,Seen it over 20 times and still I am as thrilled as during the very first time I watched it!,10,15 May 2018,"""Silence of the Lambs"" is riveting from beginning to end, made with such excellent craftmanship that it deservedly won multiple oscars and dozens of awards worldwide. ""Silence of the Lambs"" is considered to be one of the all time greatest classic movies. You just gotta see it, to believe it...What's the story about? Jodie Foster plays a FBI agent in search for a serial killer who rips off the skin of his female victims. In order to better understand the way this serial killer thinks, she starts interviewing another notorious serial killer in jail, played by the legendary Anthony Hopkins. The first half of the movie is a cat and mouse game between Jodie Foster and the locked up serial killer Anthony Hopkins to retrieve information from him, that will lead to the capture of the serial killer on the run. Will they find the serial killer before another victim is slashed up?What makes ""Silence of the Lambs"" so irresistably horrifying yet riveting at the same time, is it's psychological mindgame played by the locked up serial killer Anthony Hopkins. Add to that magnificent acting performance an extremely suspenseful story and you have got a classic. Man oh man, I must have seen it 20 times or more and I still get goosebumps at the end. I know exactly what is gonna happen and STILL I am THRILLED TO THE BONE! It is one of those movies that just wont break. To this very day it is as brilliant as it was back in the nineties.There have been said so many things about this movie and I recommend you dive into that AFTER you have watched this classic, because there are lots of fun trivia to be learned. There is even a special blu ray version released by classics distributor ""Criterion"" of the making of this movie. I wont reveal anything here, about all the ins and outs of the making of this thrilling classic, because during the first viewing it is better you know as little as possible, in order to enhance the shock effects. Because shocked you will be, but in the most pleasant ""hollywood way""!Personal endnote: I still remember when I saw it first. 30 years ago there was a new cinema in my hometown that featured discounted reruns of popular movies. Only 1 dollar tickets for a movie. The weirdest mix of people flocked to that theatre, who wouldnt normally go to movies: mothers with kids, drunks and drifters and students skipping school. The atmosphere in this theatre was great, packed full every time . ""Silence of the Lambs"" is the perfect example that excellent movies CAN be made for the masses too.This is nr. 1003 of all the reviews on Imdb for ""Silence of the Lambs"". Gives me a good understanding how popular this movie still is to this very day, 25 years after it's first release. What a thrill!",The Silence of the Lambs
89,jzappa,"An Artistically Complex, Penetratingly Intimate Drama Leaning Towards the Thriller Genre",10,28 October 2008,"Broodingly, intimately and truthfully shot, quietly edited, with a gloomy orchestral score and a richly commanding cast everywhere from Hopkins and Foster's obvious milestones to Scott Glenn and Ted Levine, this artistically complex, penetratingly intimate movie is a masterpiece in all departments. I do not categorize it as a horror film. Maybe a suspense thriller, because whenever I watch it, I view it as such, but the reason it is so compelling is because it is not genre-specific. Yes, it is scary, it is suspenseful, especially in its heart-exploding climax, and our fear of Dr. Hannibal Lecter is established as soon as he appears for the first time, as FBI cadet Clarice Starling reticently passes the maximum security cells of clearly demented ward occupants, and director Jonathan Demme cuts to her point of view as she arrives at Hannibal's cell at the end of the dank corridor, and he is awaiting her already, standing with perfect posture, a pleasant, polite look on his face. His speaking voice has the care of a man having transcended the common cognizance that he can hardly be concerned to speak to the slack acumen of the ordinary person. The effect of this scene is so powerful that it underlies all the rest of the movie, affording fear to scenes that do not even have to do with him.There is so much to say about Hannibal Lecter, as a character, as a villain, as a person. But rather than doing so, I shall simply say that the reason Jonathan Demme's The Silence of the Lambs as a film works incomparably better than Ridley Scott's Hannibal or Brett Ratner's Red Dragon, in the sense of portraying Hannibal in the most powerful and mystifying way, is because it tries to create sympathy for him through his charm, his incredible intelligence, his creative cultivation and his penetrating insight into the mind with all five senses, then turn the monster loose. Accordingly, there are moments when Lecter commits brutally violent acts, but Demme and the adapting screenwriter Ted Tally wisely let a little go a long way, with the foreseeing intention that the long-term impact is of his evil psychological strength.Most of the best stories never started from ideas but always from character. I firmly believe that The Silence of the Lambs is an offshoot straight from the creation of Hannibal Lecter. Even as rich and sympathetic and real as Clarice Starling is, she is a projection of what Dr. Lecter would find fascinating, how he would affect an eager but inexperienced rookie's undertaking of a critical case.The Silence of the Lambs is not simply a horror film because of its involvement of two psychopathic serial killers but because of its organic use of the great common phobias and fears. Here is a story involving not only cannibalism and skinning, but also kidnapping in the least likely situation, one that will shatter one's trust and sense of good samaritanship, being trapped in the bottom of a well, the details and anatomy of decomposing corpses, large insects, being lost in the dark, being tracked by someone you cannot see, not being able to get people to believe you, people who know your deepest secrets, beheadings, bizarre sexual perversions, and being a short woman in an investigation otherwise led completely by tall men.Demme is aware of the pitfalls of shock value and exploitative horror film techniques, but does not hesitate to take chances. His first scene with Hopkins could have gone over the top, and in the hands of a lesser actor almost certainly would have. But Hopkins is in the great British tradition of actors who internalize instead of overacting.Jodie Foster is unavoidably upstaged by Hopkins's fertile and horrific conception, but her stability, natural sensitivity and stealthy backbone are at the core of the film's resolve. Real and attention-grabbing facets lurk within her character as they do in any one of us: She is one age group ahead from white trash, as Lecter precisely conjectures, she tries to camouflage her southern accent, and she has to rally all of her nerve and fabricated confidence to instruct a room full of coarse small town lawmen out of an autopsy room. This gripping and incessantly developed drama has a nuance of unsolicited male attention toward her. Hardly ever in a movie have I been made more alert to the understated sexual burden men instill in women with their eyes. Ideally, if you're going to have a character appear in a story long enough to glance at a woman, pass by at the wrong time, take a picture or anything to such a minuscule effect, they had better be real enough that you can guess what they ate that morning. The makers of The Silence of the Lambs understand this.",The Silence of the Lambs
90,videorama-759-859391,"Demme's cult serial killer masterpiece, marks his finest hour, if despoiled by it's over top-ish-ness",8,23 August 2014,"The thing with comparing this larger than life serial killer movie, to like Seven or Rampage, they of course come off way much more realistic. As for the serial killers, they're way over the top, as in terms of their characters and how they kill. SOTL is a different kind of serial killer movie experience, with three mains who deliver top floor performances, none than more than Hopkins of course as Dr Hannibal Lector, where he's at his most brilliantly chilling in this pic. When seeing the end of Red Dragon, it's hard to believe that was just prefore to the start of Hannibal's presence here, as Hopkins was much more effective and scary. There are nasty moments in this film, where a lot of people couldn't get over the fact of it's M 15+ rating which was very questioning. Some content will indeed disturb people, but that's one of the movie's intentions, where for some sickies, they're are addictive pleasures. The movie's a great re watch and will still manage to disturb and rivet you, if not seeing for years. Truly dedicated, 24/7 Agent Clarice Starling, is played with so much professionalism, no one can do the role better than Foster, yet too, I really liked the under appreciated Scott Glenn as Jack Crawford. Glenn is an actor who always delivers, no matter the role. Honestly I'd have to say, he's almost on par with Foster. Of course the other role of the other sickopath, Buffalo Bill is played by great character actor, Levine. Foster implores Hopkin's genius to help her track down this very bad boy, a transsexual sewer, who kidnaps and skins his victims, the latest one is from a high ranking family, and of course, Hoping making a deal, does the inevitable: he escapes, making way for a following of course. The movie is really over the top, but it's good, and an addictive watch with some truly terrifying, scary quality moments, in a fantastic script, Foster's first visit to Hopkins dungeon cell is one scene, I never got out of my head. The movie pulls some story tricks I liked too. The film is a well oiled machine, where also I must praise another great character, Heald, as the smarmy Lector hating, Dr Chilton, who has no idea what's in store for him.

And that's only scratching the surface.Everything in The Silence of the Lambs is cinema at its finest. The dialogues are crafted with perfection. These are conversation that simply ooze atmosphere and hint at backstories untold. They're also very memorable and quotable. The characters are out of the ordinary in just the right way. The protagonist Clarice Starling is normal enough, except for her past. But it's the villain that has imprinted himself so permanently to our cultural consciousness. This is a man that they would have worshipped as a god in ancient times. A dark genius, who fields both his smarts and his sophistication with razor sharp focus, always with a knowing smile on the corner of his mouth. He makes even the act of cannibalism look cultured.The movie also deserves a nod for its technical qualities. The visuals and the music support the atmosphere and the mood perfectly and you'd never guess it was made with such a small budget. Money well spent indeed.The Silence of the Lambs is a thriller you must see to truly appreciate the genre.

I like the scene where Lecter was in this round cage, and when he called out Clarice to get her papers, he strokes her hand with his finger. Some may call this scene nerve-racking, to me it's a flirt. He trusts Clarice, and I bet she does the same too. Hmmm! Then after that, he gets his dinner, he killed those two guards. He got the liver of the tougher one. Must tastes like foie gras. (HEH HEH!) And he wears the face of the other, another Ed Geine-like action. There's plenty to see in that movie, the moths, the booby traps, and the chilling climax this movie got. It didn't lack anything there! A Neo-classic! 5 stars!",The Silence of the Lambs
94,FiendishDramaturgy,Chillingly realistic,10,21 October 2003,"For character development of Hannibal Lecter, please view Red Dragon, first.It is the prequel to this movie, and bestows the viewer with much needed information not gleaned from this production.The end of ""Red Dragon"" tells us that Hannibal has an upcoming visit from another FBI agent to look forward to; a female agent. He asks for her name but due to the nature of prequels, we already have that information: Clarice Starling. This is one of those Oscars-dominating movies whose name was on the tip of everyone's tongue for a while. From time to time, a movie comes along which is so annoyingly popular as to make me wish to never see it. Mainstream popularity is not wholly attractive to me, and I tend to avoid it at all costs. However, I was forced to view this film as a class requirement in college. So I rented it, determined to hate it. First of all, the whole movie, although released in the early 90's, appears to be obsessed with the 1980's. The clothing, the hair styles, the clichés, the soundtrack, and the atmosphere seems to be wrapped in a time warp. Starling's (Jodie Foster) character in particular, seems to be a walking cliché. She is a hapless hick; an unfortunate who is, as Lecter put it, ""...one generation away from poor white trash."" Secondly. I was born in the south, and I can tell you that her accent, though sometimes a decent reminiscing of poor West Virginia, is horrible. It comes and goes seemingly at whim. Third. The training and knowledge Starling exhibits, combined with the fact that she grew up poor, in a home where sewing was almost a certain necessity, the fact that she missed the obvious sewing patterns of skin removed from the victims just does not work for me. I grew up upper middle class, and I knew in the first 30 minutes what Buffalo Bill was up to. Her character should have been written to be more intelligent. She was able to puzzle out Lecter's riddles, but not see what was staring her right in the face? And lastly. While the film quality is horrible; grainy and low quality, the cinematography itself is startlingly good.All that having been said, the psychological aspects of this film are above reproach. Dr. Lecter's character, portrayed brilliantly by Anthony Hopkins, is the perfect portrayal of a psychopathic sycophant with a ""taste"" for high society. As a slave to his own superiority, he is a thousand times more dangerous than those psychopaths who believe they are on a holy mission, or at the head of some spiritual metamorphosis into a higher state of being. Lecter is under no such delusion. He is the brilliant sociopath who can blend into society without casting even the briefest hesitation in our acceptance of his social graces and high society politeness. He does as he does, merely as a means to humor himself, and for no other reason. There are no outward clues or appearances of anything gone wrong within and therefore, is all the more deadly for it. He simply...is. His manipulation of Starling is on a high intellectual level. He is a sage of such devious management of others' minds. His knowledge of Buffalo Bill, the newest personification of sickness, brings Starling to his cell. As a brilliant psychiatrist turned ""Chesapeake Slasher,"" Lecter has had the opportunity to touch many lives; to shape, mold, and guide others less fortunate than he. Indeed, his influence may very well have assisted Buffalo Bill in his crossing the stream between being a confused and needy individual, to that of a homicidal psychopath. Many researchers have agreed that offender profiling can be a useful tool in solving serial homicides (Egger, 1998; Stevens, 1997; Holmes, 1998; Canter, 1994; Douglas and Olshaker, 1995). However, the question remains as to whether the lack of ability the modern police department has in dealing with serial homicide has created a real need for this type of investigative practice. A lack of psychological training, limited resources, and an apparent rise in serial homicide rates may be creating the appearance that police need new investigative techniques, when in reality what may be more appropriate is a higher standard of psychological training among police investigators. The number of serial killers presently active in the United States has been estimated to be between 30 and 500, depending on the source (O'Reilly-Fleming, 1996). Just think. With the possibility of 500 serial killers who are ""active"" in the US, how many of them are as educated and intelligent as the character of Hannibal Lecter? The statistics are chilling at an estimation of 80% (O'Reilly-Fleming, 1996). Many serial killers are professionals; doctors, lawyers, even law enforcement personnel or city employees. People who have passed the civil service tests, psychological evaluations, and thorough screenings. Sociopaths are such due to their ability to ""blend in"" with our society without any obvious dysfunctions. How many people do you know who are a little ""quirky,"" eccentric, or just plain freaky? Chances are, they are not the homicidal maniacs in your lives. Chances are, they are the very polite, nice, friendly and helpful person at the drug store where you go; the empathetic lab tech who is drawing your blood; the family physician with the terminal smile...think about this, and these movies, next time you encounter an overly-polite stranger. Just a thought. This movie rates a 9.8/10 from...the Fiend :.",The Silence of the Lambs
95,jadavix,A classic - the best filmed version of any of Harris's works,9,7 April 2021,"After watching both ""Red Dragon"" and ""The Silence of the Lambs"" back-to-back, I can't help but compare them, especially since ""The Silence""'s brilliance is only further illuminated by this comparison. With ""Red Dragon"", the mediocre, dependable Brett Ratner seemed to choose to highlight the silly aspects of the story by going for a fairy-tale like approach, even down to an overwhelming score by Danny Elfman, who is most famous for his collaborations with the master of the urban fairy tale, Tim Burton.""Red Dragon"", though I liked it when I saw it back in 2002, just seemed crass and unconvincing when I watched it yesterday, like watching actors attempting to navigate a bathetic minefield.Jonathan Demme took the right approach to Harris's material. He plays it straight, gritty and realistic, with subtle direction that reminded me of Friedkin's work on ""The Exorcist"". Howard Shore was a much better choice to score Harris also; he provides the kind of brilliant film score you aren't supposed to notice.The movie has at least three brilliant scenes that are among the best thrillers have to offer. These are Starling's first meeting with Lecter, Lecter's escape from his cage, and the final confrontation with Buffalo Bill.About that Buffalo Bill. Anthony Hopkins - and Hannibal Lecter - are household names. Ted Levine is not. He was undeservedly overshadowed by Hopkins, and deserved an Oscar nomination.",The Silence of the Lambs

With plenty of ripe ham from Mr H. and some Nancy Drew like behaviour from Miss F.,the movie trundles over familiar ground with lots of shocks that aren't shocking for people who remember them from the first time around.Mr H escapes and eats somebody.Excuse me whilst I repair my split sides.

97,ackstasis,"""Don't you feel eyes moving over your body, Clarice?""",10,4 October 2006,"'The Silence of the Lambs (1991)' isn't even about Hannibal Lecter. We're so distracted by cold, probing voice of the suave psychiatrist- turned-serial-killer (played with chilling calculation by Anthony Hopkins) that it's easy to forget that the film is ultimately about Clarice Starling (Jodie Foster), a rookie FBI agent with a dark past.Clarice spent her adolescence trying to escape death – the shooting of her father, the slaughter of spring lambs on her neighbour's ranch – and sought to banish these memories by joining the FBI. She's a young woman in what is traditionally a man's world, forced to endure the degradation of constantly having ""eyes all over her body"" (and this disquieting metaphor is reinforced later on as we witness Clarice ogled through the lens of night-vision goggles). The motives of her boss and mentor Jack Crawford (Scott Glenn) are somewhat dubious, and their final handshake quivers with sexual awkwardness.Hannibal Lecter perceives Clarice's dark past and recognises her strengths. He falls in love with her in a platonic sort of way (not dissimilar to how Sherlock Holmes fell in love with Irene Adler, one of the few people to have outwitted him, in ""A Scandal in Bohemia""). The moment that their fingers touch through the bars of Lecter's cell is a chilling sharing of intimacy. Thomas Harris subsequently elaborated on this relationship in ""Hannibal,"" but that novel (and, to a lesser extent, Ridley Scott's 2001 film adaptation) goes completely off the rails in its final act. Clarice Starling would've been best left alone. (Tellingly, the best parts of 'Hannibal (2001)' were those set in Florence, Italy with Giancarlo Giannini).Finally, nobody ever mentions Ted Levine's perfect performance as Jame Gumb (a.k.a. Buffalo Bill), probably because he's such an repellent character. Lecter is frequently framed in close-up, emphasising Hopkins' mesmerising, unblinking stare, and he speaks eloquently and intelligently. Jame Gumb, conversely, is kept at a distance, often swathed in poor or garish lighting, or framed in such an extreme close- up that his features appear grotesque.",The Silence of the Lambs
98,dee.reid,The greatest thriller of all time? I think so.,10,7 June 2009,"I don't think a movie has really been so effective in shocking the hell out of the audience. So let's be frank: movies like ""The Silence of the Lambs"" don't usually win very big awards, let alone Oscars (in all five of the major categories, no less, making it only the third film in history to do so).With gruesome scenes of murder, autopsies and cannibalism, it's hard to imagine ""The Silence of the Lambs"" winning Best Picture at the Oscars, not to mention heaps of praise and topping numerous ""best"" lists since its release. ""The Silence of the Lambs"" has also become a bona-fide cinematic and pop culture icon, introducing two of the most memorable characters in cinema history.The film, an adaptation of the novel by Thomas Harris, concerns the FBI's hunt for a particularly brutal serial killer, ""Buffalo Bill"" (the creepy Ted Levine), who skins his victims, mostly plus-sized women, for reasons that are too gruesome to be repeated here. The FBI puts a young trainee on the case, Clarice Starling (Jodie Foster), and they have her, in turn, interview the deadly Dr. Hannibal Lecter (Anthony Hopkins), a cunning psychopath who remains under tight lock and key at a hospital for the criminally insane. Lecter offers to help Clarice in developing a psychological profile in order to help capture ""Buffalo Bill,"" in exchange for her confiding in him, some of her darkest and most troubling childhood memories.""The Silence of the Lambs"" is not a film for the squeamish; I already mentioned why. But even for its scenes of grisly carnage, it's not a horror film, nor an exploitation picture that revels in scenes of outlandish gore. Instead, the real terror is more psychological: we rely on the reactions of the characters for the effect. It's a technique that director Jonathan Demme found to be quite satisfactory (it was also put to effective use in the equally disturbing, and commanding serial killer thriller, ""Seven,"" four years later in 1995). Another technique that Demme put to great work here was having his actors stare directly into the camera, allowing us to become uncomfortably intimate with the on-screen action.I'm not really a fan of Jodie Foster or Anthony Hopkins, really, but their work here is nothing short of legendary. Foster is stunning as the young FBI trainee Clarice Starling, an attractive but commanding young woman who, it seems, is an adult child still reeling it in from some deeply-seeded childhood traumas, and it is through her work on the ""Buffalo Bill"" case and her meetings with Hannibal Lecter that she seems to be able to get a chance to deal with her troubled past and get some closure. Hopkins is equally commanding as the manipulative ""Hannibal the Cannibal,"" who is able to probe the mind of his young interviewee with disturbing efficiency and ease, to satisfy his own twisted curiosities that I don't think are ever really explained (that's a good thing - it makes him even scarier). These truly are, two of the most phenomenal performances in a movie that is a phenomenon upon itself.""The Silence of the Lambs"" is purely the greatest and most terrifying thriller I've seen. However, my personal favorite thriller of all time remains ""Seven."" But the contributions that ""The Silence of the Lambs"" made to the thriller genre, and motion picture history, are not to be overlooked. If it weren't for this film, I don't think I would've gotten ""Seven"" all those years ago.""The Silence of the Lambs"" was recently named the greatest thriller of all time in Britain.I'll be hard-pressed to find a reason to disagree with that assertion.10/10",The Silence of the Lambs

100,mjneu59,doesn't deserve its high reputation,3,3 January 2011,"Despite the impressive credentials this so-called thriller is nothing more than quality exploitation with highbrow pretensions, none of which can patch the many plot holes and jarring improbabilities. The script presents an awkward adaptation of what must have been a much fuller (if equally unpleasant) novel, compressing the material with too many transparent narrative gaps and shortcuts, including some amazing FBI deductions worthy of Sherlock Holmes.The idea of using one psychopath to help catch another is intriguing, but having two serial killers dilutes the impact of the story, especially when it focuses more on cartoon cannibal Anthony Hopkins, already in custody until his illogical, unlikely escape. Nothing much is learned about the other killer-at-large (an apparent reject from a David Lynch freak-show), and the film ends as a typical damsel-in-distress drama with haunted house shock effects.The screenplay is overloaded with bogus psychological significance and padded with irrelevant flashbacks, and the film was shot entirely in blunt, video-format close-ups, with director Jonathan Demme apparently trying to get inside the mind of his characters by simply shoving the camera in their faces. The manhunt is also highlighted by a gratuitous excess of explicit gore, but that doesn't stop it from having a happy ending, for everyone involved, including cannibal/killer Hannibal Lecter.",The Silence of the Lambs
101,robfollower,The Silence of the Lambs 10/10,10,16 February 2020,"Is Silence of the Lambs a horror movie ?Yes. It's a mix between Horror and Thriller. I have always viewed the film an American psychological -thriller in addition to being a horror film. Whereas a movie like ""The Conjuring "" is a supernatural horror film or ""Zombie Land Double Tap"" is a comedic horror film.Prior to ""Silence of the Lambs,"" there had only been two films in the horror genre nominated for best picture since the very first Oscars ceremony in 1929 - ""The Exorcist"" in 1974 and ""Jaws"" in 1976.1991 box office hit, horror psychological thriller, is not for the squeamish. Based on the Thomas Harris novel and directed by Jonathan Demme. Nominated for 7 Oscar's, winner of the 5 major awards.The Silence of the Lambs (1991) became the third film in Academy history to win the ""Big Five"" Academy Awards. It was the first film in the genre to win the top award. In fact, ""Silence of the Lambs"" swept the 1992 Oscars, becoming only the third film in history to win best film, best director, best actor, best actress and best adapted screenplay. Following It Happened One Night (1934) and One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest (1975).A rookie FBI trainee is tasked to interview an incarcerated psychopath for information into a recent crime spree. Foster won a Best Actress Oscar, and in addition to winning Best Actor, Hopkins' Dr. Lecter was named the Best Villain by the American Film Institute. Demme's Oscar-winning direction and Oscar-winning screenplay make one of the most tense and chilling films of the past 30 years; Lecter's eventual escape being especially scary.

102,parry_na,Spoilers follow ...,9,11 August 2016,"It is difficult to convey what a massive film this was on its release. It transformed second-billed Anthony Hopkins from a highly respected and well-known actor into an international superstar, caused a degree of controversy and cemented Jodie Foster's reputation as a major talent. Both won awards for this, and the film won several others.It isn't difficult to see why. Starling's (Foster) initial meeting with Lector (Hopkins) has a tremendous build up – tales of Lector's legendary brutality, warnings and a corridor full of inmates leering (and worse) at Starling as she makes her way to his cell. The following scene alternately fills the screen with first Hopkins' face and then Foster', and – considering they are really explaining the plot to the audience - is electrifying.Starling's isolation in her male-dominated job is nicely conveyed visually (without over-labouring the point) often simply by featuring her in scenes with men a lot taller than her. Her willful lack of vulnerability ensures we are instantly on her side. When we meet Lector, such is his beguiling magnificence, we find ourselves on his side too. A dilemma for the audience, but a fascinating one.Among this terrific cast, it would be an error to overlook the contribution of Ted Levine as Buffalo Bill. His perversion is told to us at first, and revealed slowly thereafter, culminating in a scene in which he hides his penis between his legs and displays himself as a vision of what he believes to be divine beauty. Much of the original novel's detail regarding Bill has not been included in the film (how much more shocking – perhaps too shocking – it would have been to see him wearing one of his skinned female victim's breasts, as in Thomas Harris's story). And yet he still emerges as a deranged and frightening figure.The double twist towards the end of SPOILER (a) Lector's ingenious escape, and (b) the realisation that Starling's back-up team have gone to the wrong house leaving her to face Bill alone, are perfectly handled. And yet for such a controversial film, there is little gore actually in it – it is the implied violence and Lector's relish in it that shreds the nerves. 'Silence of the Lambs' is thoroughly deserving of its acclaim.",The Silence of the Lambs
103,GiraffeDoor,Trashy movie with one amazing character.,4,18 April 2019,"There's one good thing about this movie and that is Hopkin's riveting performance as the inimitable Dr Lecture.The scenes with him in our one of those rare treats in the movies where everything in a character from their look to their voice and their lines makes you want to hang a poster of them in all the rooms of your home.It's the rest of the movie that palls. The flimsy plot they use as an excuse to get Lecter on screen focuses on some transsexual killer as its macguffin and this might have been somewhat interesting if this really was the story they were committed to tell and focus on. Like how even two really good pieces of music can sound jarring and stupid when played at the same time, the overall effect is of a disjointed movie that desperately required some rethinking of its plot direction. It's just goofy.Jodie Foster's stoney performance as copper as the overzealous fed typically shows about as much emotion as my toaster. She doesn't feel like a person, just some crude character type that is just boring to watch and impossible to feel anything for. When she does finally show emotion it's like a daytime movie and she manages to help realize what is perhaps the most obnoxious, smug and heavy handed monologue in all cinema. Whoever wrote this seems desperate to convince the world that women in the work place are all emotionally sterile, hard to like nitwits making this movie a huge middle finger to feminism even if its bad guy wasn't a man who wants to be a woman. Or woman trapped in a man's body, I'm not really fussed.There are so many moments where you really feel the classic this might have become but the movie it should have been is just a subplot.

Hannibal is a great monster. He conforms perfectly to the antihero archetype as he typifies the best qualities of humanity gone disastrously wrong. Hopkins chews scenery with the best of them. Clarice, especially in Foster's hands, is a strong character with buried psychological trauma that is fighting to get out. The interplay the two characters stands apart from the rest of the film.Part of the reason for that is the rest of it so much worse than the leads. Of note, Buffalo Bill's villainy is steeped in lazy cultural tropes. The screenplay bothering to distinguish between Bill and a ""real"" transsexual does not make it any less lazy to othering a male villain by feminizing him.

I've touted the amazing things being offered in the past by companies like Twilight Time, Shot Factory, Olive and Arrow. Criterion was one of the first companies to bring forth full-fledged special editions of classic movies with numerous extras that make them worth tossing out the old version of a film in favor of theirs. If you need an example of why here is one.Released in 1991, SILENCE OF THE LAMBS was the second time that the character Dr. Hannibal Lecter appeared on screen having been seen just a short time in Michael Mann's MANHUNTER. But the performance of Anthony Hopkins in this version will forever be sealed in our minds as the perfect performance to associate with the character. But maybe you're not familiar with the story.Clarice Starling (Jodie Foster) is in training to become an FBI agent. Her desire is to work in the behavioral science department. She's called to the office of Agent Jack Crawford (Scott Glenn) for a special assignment. They're doing a survey of serial killers and he wants to send her to see Dr. Hannibal Lecter in prison in the hopes he will respond better to her than most and agree to answer the questionnaire.Starling goes to visit Lecter at the facility he is imprisoned in for the criminally insane, first having to deal with the facility's head Dr. Frederick Chilton (Anthony Heald) before being taken to the now iconic cell block that holds Lecter. Behind a Plexiglas wall she sees him for the first time and he converses with her. But Lecter is one to use psychiatric measures against those he confronts and the pair play a cat and mouse game until he finally agrees after a traumatic experience with the man in the cell next to his.Crawford is actually working on a current case, another serial killer the press has called Buffalo Bob. His assignment to Starling was in reality a hope for clues that Lecter could provide. He takes Starling along with him on the case as they begin to investigate the latest victim. Each has been killed but held captive after several days and each has had portions of their skin removed. As Starling delves deeper into the case and her communications with Lecter, he begins to offer her clues to aid in finding the new killer. But at what cost? Her sanity? His freedom? Or is there something more going on here?The film is one of those perfect movies that works on all levels. The direction of Jonathan Demme is some of the best ever committed to celluloid. He combines all of the pieces used to create a film that terrifies and fascinates at the same time. That combination of music, cinematography, acting, sets, costuming, stunts, makeup and more are all molded into a movie that you won't forget after seeing it just once. Having the opportunity to watch it more than a single time just helps you to appreciate the effort and end results all the more.The film was released in blu-ray format before in a collector's edition by MGM so why bother picking up this version instead? That's where Criterion shows what they do best. To start with the presentation of the film with a 4K digital restoration approved by director of photography Tak Fujimoto. The images on screen are the best you will find for this film. But the extras are not limited to that.The audio commentary track from 1994 with director Demme, actors Foster and Hopkins, screenwriter Ted Tally and former FBI agent John Douglas (the actual agent Crawford was based on) is here. A new interview with film critic Maitland McDonagh focuses on both the film and a brief discussion about serial killers in reality and on film. There are 38 minutes of deleted scenes. If this wasn't enough there are four documentaries that feature hours of interviews with the cast and crew. Then there is a behind the scenes featurette. The storyboards used for the film are on hand to view. The original trailer is here. And this new version includes a book featuring an introduction by Foster, an essay by critic Amy Taubin, articles written by Thomas Harris, the author of the book the film is based on, from 2000 and 2013 on the origins of Lecter and lastly an interview with director Demme. That's an extensive amount of extras along with the best presentation of the film ever all brought together by Criterion.While I've been aware of Criterion this is my first time viewing one of the versions they've put out. I'm glad to see that they live up to their reputation. As a matter of fact they have exceeded it. They not only put out versions of popular films such as this one they make it a goal to seek out classic films of the past as well as foreign films that might not have gotten the attention or been made readily accessible to movie fans around the world. It's a tremendous and thankless job that they do. After my experience with this film let's hope that they carry on with their goal and achieve it daily.",The Silence of the Lambs

I thought that Clarice (Jodie Foster) looked very pretty in all the dressy clothing she wore, especially the dressy outfits she wore when she visited Dr. Lecter (Anthony Hopkins) in jail. This film didn't scare me at all. Well, maybe just a little. Dr. Lecter scared me a little when he attacked the two cops in his cell. There was only one thing that really grossed me out, and that was the killer (Ted Levine) shoving an insect down each victim's throat and then skinning them. That was really disgusting in my opinion. Also, when I noticed that Buffalo Bill had a pierced nipple, I got really uncomfortable, but I still enjoyed the movie.

110,drownnnsoda,Genuinely Scary Suspense Upheld With Wonderful Performances.,10,23 December 2006,"""The Silence of the Lambs"" is a genuine suspense thriller that is sure to satisfy anyone who enjoys a good old crime thriller. Jodie Foster brilliantly plays Clarice Starling, a strong willed, ""tough girl type"" FBI trainee, whose job is to track down a notorious serial killer by the name of ""Buffalo Bill"", who is kidnapping and slaying young women in the area. While investigating, in hopes of finding the killer, Clarice meets Hannibal Lecter (Anthony Hopkins), an incarcerated, blood-thirsty cannibal who holds information as to the whereabouts of Buffalo Bill. Clarice and Hannibal begin to form a strange relationship as she seeks him for help to find the serial killer and stop him before he kills his latest victim.Easily one of the best and most sophisticated crime thrillers I've seen, ""The Silence of the Lambs"" is an excellent movie. To begin, the performances are what really shine here. Both Foster and Hopkins are award-worthy (and I believe Hopkins won an Academy Award for his portrayal of the malevolent Hannibal Lecter). Jodie Foster is completely believable in her role as the intelligent heroine, and really has the audience sympathizing with her. On the other hand is Lecter, wonderfully played by Hopkins - his character is one scary guy, I definitely wouldn't want to be near him. Their chemistry in the film is amazing, and the conversational scenes between them, both of them separated by bars or a glass wall, are tense and brilliantly acted. The performances all around are simply top-notch.The plot itself is an intriguing one at that, and I liked the relationship that was formed between the FBI agent and the serial killer - it's all really interesting. Then, there's the serial killer that is the sole reason that Clarice has any relation to Lecter - because Lecter has information that could help her. The gender-bending Buffalo Bill is shown throughout the movie, kidnapping women, and the viewers get an insight into his bizarre world, mostly shown in his underground ""chamber"" under his house, where he skins and stores his victims, dead and alive, and wears their skins. The finale in the pitch-black basement/lair between Clarice and Buffalo Bill is genuinely terrifying, and will surely have you on the edge of your seat. Really one of the creepiest scenes that I've seen in a movie.Overall, ""The Silence of the Lambs"" is a movie that you won't want to miss. The performances alone are enough reason to watch this film, Jodie Foster and Anthony Hopkins are absolutely amazing. On top of that, it is a truly scary film and one of the most suspense-ridden thrillers out there. A definite must see. 10/10.",The Silence of the Lambs

114,slokes,Good Cutting Makes For Great Slasher,9,19 July 2014,"""The Silence Of The Lambs"" is famous for being Hollywood's finest slasher film, a masterpiece of unblinking psychological gamesmanship, but its best cuts were made in the editing room.Time is running out for psychopath Buffalo Bill's latest kidnappee. Trying anything, the FBI sends a young trainee, Clarice Starling (Jodie Foster), to chat up an especially diabolical serial killer now in custody, Dr. Hannibal Lecter (Anthony Hopkins). The hope is the two will hit it off well enough so that Lecter will help with nailing down Bill's persona. But what starts out unsettling enough for Starling soon becomes a real journey into fear.""Silence Of The Lambs"" has a great story, diabolical atmospherics, and a stark visual template that pulls you in. But two things work for it beyond these elements.The first, which is widely commented upon, is how everyone in this film is working outside their comfort zones, all the way through to the audience. Director Jonathan Demme did quirky, humanistic comedies centered around redemptive themes. Foster didn't play cops. Hopkins didn't play psychos or big-screen villains, unless it was a historical figure like Hitler. Handing such creative people different hats and making them work allowed for fresher, vital impressions.Second, and more critical, was the way ""Silence"" was cut. Looking at the ""Collector's Edition"" DVD reveals scenes trimmed or edited out entirely, employing plot elements from Thomas Harris' source novel. A couple of dropped scenes between Starling and FBI lead investigator Jack Crawford (Scott Glenn) are particularly involving, but the overall subplot they work to establish, about Crawford's dispute with a nasty superior and Starling's own line-crossing of FBI strictures, only obscure what the audience cares most about, which is the relationship between Hannibal and Starling and also the ongoing case of Buffalo Bill.The first of these is really where ""Silence"" best delivers. So much of the movie's cultural legacy rests in the exchanges between Starling and Lecter as written by Ted Tally and delivered by Foster and Hopkins.It's a tense cat-and-mouse situation, not devoid of humor or pathos but focused relentlessly on the core issue of stopping Buffalo Bill. What motivates Lecter is not sympathy but his interest in Starling, both as someone he rather likes and as a worthy opponent. ""People will say we're in love,"" he jokes at one point, and it's funny because it's kind of true in a twisted way the movie is not afraid to develop, even if the idea of an actual relationship between the two seems absurd, at least in this iteration.While known as a slasher film, violence is handled very well. We see as many murders actually take place here as we did in ""Psycho,"" which is not that many. More is done by showing less. Hitchcock would have approved.Some aspects of the film keep me from declaring it perfect. The way Hannibal makes his big play in Tennessee is too much of the Hollywood- magic-villain variety, while Demme emphasizes Starling's discomfort as a woman in a man's world in a way that comes off dated and pedantic today. Howard Shore's music adds to the atmosphere but never gels as anything with a character of its own.But when you watch the movie, all you care about is what happens to Starling and what Lecter could do to her. And that is exactly what should happen. The end result is a very involving, one-of-a-kind experience.",The Silence of the Lambs
115,gcd70,Could be the best thriller ever!,8,20 May 2007,"This film would have to be the most suspenseful drama in years, right up there with ""Fatal Attraction"", and in the best Hitchcockian tradition. The tantalisation of scares that are not quite delivered, and the ones that are keep you on the edge of your seat from scene one. Jonathan Demme knows exactly when to use subtlety, and does it superbly. ""Lambs"" continually intrigues, shocks, disturbs and fascinates, and the subtle humour works well in a dark fashion.Jodie Foster deserves an Oscar for her frantic, tense performance as an FBI trainee searching desperately for a serial killer. Even more deserving is Anthony Hopkins, who is disturbingly charming and chilling as Doctor Hannibal 'the cannibal' Lecter, who trades with agent Starling (Foster) for 'information'. All supporting cast are excellent in a film that delivers a knockout punch. Owes a lot to scripting (original story by Thomas Harris), tense music (Howard Shore), cinematography and editing!""Silence of the Lambs"" deserves Academy nominations in all categories (Best Film, Director, Actor, Actress etc).

116,dworldeater,Untouchable,10,17 June 2019,"The Silence Of The Lambs is a riveting psychological thriller that gets in your head and under your skin. The film is done really well and the story is engrossing and both the motivations of the killer and law enforcement are explored and understood. Anthony Hopkins brings it big time with an iconic performance as Dr. Hannibal Lecter which won him a richly deserved Oscar for best actor. The film won multi academy awards that year, which also had Jodie Foster walk away with a gold statue as well with her best performance ever as FBI agent/trainee Clarice Starling. Scott Glenn and Ted Levine are strong support for this very dark and suspenseful film. Director Jonathan Demme made a remarkable film that has no equal until Seven comes out. There is no doubt that The Silence Of The Lambs would be influential to Seven and many other films and for what it is, it is flawless. The sequel Hannibal however is not nearly as good, but this is mandatory viewing for anyone that wants to be movie literate, The Silence Of The Lambs is a must see.",The Silence of the Lambs
117,TOMNEL,"Disappointing, not to say this wasn't a great movie.",8,19 June 2008,"The Silence of the Lambs won the Academy Award for Best Picture in 1992, and though I did enjoy Beauty and the Beast more, I can understand this winning. It was the best of the nominated films and overall that was a weak year. This movie is highly enjoyable with well written and even better acted out characters, such as Anthony Hopkins who seemed to gain the fame that he had been searching for after years of acting with his portrayal of the psychotic Dr. Hannibal Lechter. The direction is good, and the situations, though horrible, are also believable. It doesn't seem to far-fetched that a serial killer would make a coat of human skin, does it? I think the problem here is a lack of true tension. Scenes trying to be suspenseful and tense came off almost as clichés, and weren't nearly as scary as they could have been.FBI agent Clarice Starling (Jodie Foster) is on the case of a serial killer who is known as Buffalo Bill, but in order to get information on him, she must go to incarcerated psychiatrist Dr. Hannibal Lechter, who was put away for killing and eating his victims. As the story progresses Clarice begins to learn more and Buffalo Bill continues killing and skinning his victims.This movie is very good, not excellent, but very good. Many critics say this movie is so disgustingly violent, but that's just not true. Though violence does occur, none of it was over the top, and it occurred very infrequently throughout the picture. The acting is top notch, with as I (and anyone else who reviewed this mentioned) said earlier, with Anthony Hopkins pulling the most he could out of his scenes. Jodie Foster was also very good, and so was Ted Levine as the disturbed serial killer Buffalo Bill. The scary moments...well, for me there were none. Any scene trying to be scary fell flat. One scene involves a character being stalked by a man with night vision goggles in his dark house, and that scene should have had my heart pumping for the safety of the character, but it didn't. I found it clichéd and very typical of any slasher film. Another thing that just didn't work for me was constant flashbacks from Jodie Foster looking back at her traumatic childhood. It should have had real drama, but again felt contrived and clichéd. I also didn't like the musical score, which felt like something that belonged on an episode of NYPD Blue, or some TV show, and not in a good movie.Overall, this movie was great, and entertaining to watch, but it has some faults that drop it from a thrilling adventure I want to watch again and again to a very good movie, but a mediocre thriller.My rating: *** out of ****. 120 mins. R for language and some blood violence.",The Silence of the Lambs
118,Agent10,"A good movie, but still lacks in some parts",8,23 July 2002,"While this film was great, it still pales in comparison to the vastly superior SE7EN. What I did enjoy about this film was the exceptional use of light and the sets. However, the bad guy proved to be one of the lamest excuses for a villain ever. Not only was he ridiculous, his intentions were revealed too early, making the suspense of his evil far too easy to comprehend. While I will say the characters were interesting, the overall scope of the film was muddled. What was supposed to be scary proved to be lacking. Anthony Hopkins was good in the film, but much like the villain, his evil was too caricaturized to make him evil. The direction was exceptional, and Jodie Foster was good, but little else seemed to impress me.",The Silence of the Lambs

""The Silence of the Lambs"" is a film that grips me every time I watch it--an entrancing, mesmerizing experience that sheds the pulp and trashiness usually associated with the horror genre, transcending into a tasteful, terrifying, and wonderfully-acted masterwork.  Jonathan Demme, who started his career making pulpy exploitation, exhibits maturity and confident directoral skill.  It goes without saying that Anthony Hopkins' portrayal of Hannibal Lecter is one of the most intelligent, multilayered depictions of a psychotic ever committed to celluloid, and Jodie Foster's twerpy, Southern-fried FBI agent is easily his equal; the understated Ted Levine is also excellent (and underappreciated) as the Ed Gein-ish serial killer who skins his victims.  Basically, if you haven't seen this movie, what are you waiting for?8/10",The Silence of the Lambs
121,Reviews_of_the_Dead,Truly a Masterpiece,10,3 June 2021,"This was a film that I remember seeing the video case for when I would go to the video store. My dad would never let me rent it, because he knew the type of horror I was into and looking for. He knew that this wouldn't be up my alley at that time. I have now seen this movie a few times, while also catching it at different parts on the movie channels. I have also read the novel as well. To get into this, the official synopsis is a young FBI cadet must receive the help of an incarcerated and manipulative cannibal killer to help catch another serial killer, a madman who skins his victims.We kick off with Clarice Starling (Jodie Foster) as she is running an obstacle course. She is called in by an instructor to meet with Jack Crawford (Scott Glenn), who is the head of behavioral sciences with the FBI. She is tasked with meeting Dr. Hannibal Lecter (Anthony Hopkins). She is told she needs to interview him with a questionnaire in order to gain his insight for cold cases of serial killers.At the hospital he is kept at, we meet the doctor in charge of him, Frederick Chilton (Anthony Heald). He comes on to Clarice, but she politely declines him. She then goes and meets with Hannibal. He is intrigued with her, but doesn't give her what she was expecting. He wants to help her career by giving her information about Buffalo Bill killer.Going along with this, we see this killer. The man's name is Jame Gumb (Ted Levine) as he kidnaps his next victim, Catherine Martin (Brooke Smith). It now becomes a race against the clock to save her before she is killed. Clarice is helped by Hannibal, but in order to give information, she has to share personal information and decipher his codes. This doesn't seem like that difficult, but he is one person you don't want in your head.I wanted to keep this recap short, because I feel most people have seen this film. It is a classic to horror and non-horror fans alike. I fall into the camp that this is a horror fan as well, if you couldn't tell why I was writing this review. Back to my point though, I also kept it short, because the story itself isn't the most complicated. The bigger part of it is the performances and uncovering information to build the mystery of the film.Something else really good with this film is realism of both serial killers. I don't know what Thomas Harris was doing before he wrote these novels, but I really like that he took real aspects and incorporated. Having Clarice interview Hannibal is just like law enforcement interviewing Ted Bundy. I first learned this through my mother while she was reading a book on the Green River Killer. What Hannibal does later in the film is something Bundy did as well and he is a pretty good looking guy in his own way, much like the real serial killer. How Jame kidnaps Catherine is exactly a move Bundy used, making himself seem vulnerable. Jame is also very similar to Ed Gein in what he is doing with his victims.A subtext to the film I found interesting was the sexism that Clarice has to deal with. There is Dr. Chilton who hits on her. She isn't rude to him when rebuffing him, but he is the definition of toxic masculinity as he's a jerk. Dr. Lecter says some inappropriate things to her, but he also really likes her. He like to press buttons and to see how far he can go. Dr. Lecter does get revenge for her when a fellow inmate does something disgusting. There are also the police officers in West Virginia and how they look at Clarice. I did like that it is pointed out when it comes to Jame Gumb, that he doesn't fit the real profile of a transsexual as they aren't normally aggressive like he is. Incorporating his love of moths and butterflies is interesting as well.The pacing of this film is also really good. The film moves through the information, but it keeps building the tension as it does. It really sucks you in and even though I know how it ends, I could feel my anxiety to find Catherine rising. There is also the build to the climax when we realize where Jack and his team are going. Having read the novel, I do think they cut out the things that would bog the film down, which is good. There are some things changed for the film also, which didn't really hurt it in my opinion. The ending is also really good and fitting for the film.Acting for this film is great. I didn't remember how great Foster was as Clarice. She brings a sort of attractiveness to the role and that's good, because of all the things she has to put up with being a woman. She is capable at her job and wants to be known for that. Hopkins is also great as Hannibal. He brings sophistication to the role. The more you get to know him, the more dangerous he becomes and seeing how savage he is as well. Glenn and Heald are both solid in their roles. They bring them to life. I also have to give a shout out to Levine. His voice is wonderful and he went all in, which makes it really good. There are so many cameos in this film, like Roger Corman, George A. Romero and David Early. They all do great in rounding out the film as does the rest of the supporting cast.This brings me to the effects of the film. It doesn't really need a lot of them, as the film isn't that type. I do think that the blood and the aftermath of things that happen is good. There is a scene where a body is staged and looks amazing. There is a decapitated head, which does as well. There might not be a lot used, but the ones we get are well done. The film is also shot beautiful. The cinematographer Tak Fujimoto did some really good things.The final thing to touch on would be the score of the film. I will be honest it didn't stand out to me, but I think that was a good choice. It does enhance the scenes for what they needed, which is really all that you can ask for. It didn't stand out, but this isn't a negative.Now with that said, this is a damn near perfect film. The story isn't the most complex, but it really didn't need to be. It is more about the acting, which is great. I like the aspects of the story that are taken from the real world, as that makes the film that much better as well. There's not a lot in the way of effects, but it wasn't needed. It is shot beautiful. The score also doesn't stand out; it does enhance the scenes for what was needed. If you haven't seen this film, I definitely recommend it. It is a great film.",The Silence of the Lambs

Anthony Hopkins gives a awesomely creepy performance as the cannibal Hannibal Lector, and Ted Levine plays Buffalo Bill, in a mildly comic, but still quite terrifying performance with a subtle layer of sadness.Jodie Foster also does a pretty great job as Clarice Starling, and deserved the Best Actress Oscar in my opinion.The score by Howard Score is absolutely lovely. The moodiness and dreariness to the score really adds to the film's slightly sad, and highly disturbing nature. I think it may actually be his best score ever, and that includes the score to the LOTR trilogy, which is also quite magnificent.The film is also very intense at times, mainly during the climax of the film.

127,PredragReviews,I've learned to appreciate fava beans!,9,13 May 2016,"Johnathon Demme's The Silence of the Lambs (1991) is perhaps an anomaly - it's not your average slasher horror film or predictable thriller, which have come to dominant the genre. The haunting performances and psychological interaction between the characters, coupled with the presence of a strong female character, makes for an eerie production that brings raw emotion into the thriller genre. The plot is undoubtedly intense and well-written. However, it's not so much the story-line as the performances of the actors that make Silence a must-see. Hopkins' control and almost monotone high-pitched voice takes sadistic lines to a whole new level. His gaze brought shivers down my spine as he delves into Clarice's psyche. But Clarice can hold her own against the former psychiatrist. Foster plays her character as young and innocent, but not to a fault. She uses Clarice's naivety and lack of experience as an advantage to stand up to Lector, which he, in turn, finds admirable.Yes, there are a few gory scenes, but the implied wickedness, the spine-tingling suspense, and the electrifying, terrifying chemistry between the two leads will keep you on the edge of your seat. The actors all did their homework on serial killers and the people who strive to catch them and that effort paid off. The Silence of the Lambs captured the imagination and attention of American moviegoers like few Horror films have. Perhaps this is due in part to the fact that most didn't realize they were watching a Horror film to begin with. I'm sure Chianti sales skyrocketed, perhaps even sales of fava beans.Overall rating: 9 out of 10.",The Silence of the Lambs
128,eric262003,Two Thumbs Up For This One,9,22 February 2011,"Jodie Foster stars as FBI Agent Clarice Starling who's on a mission to track down a homicidal maniac, but only the sneering cannibal Dr. Hannibal Lecter (Anthony Hopkins) is the only person who knows his whereabouts. But his presence is luring and quite intimidating so getting into his head shouldn't be an option. With supreme intelligence like Stephen Hawking and diet that will put Jeffrey Dahmer to shame, Lecter has the delight in manipulating his victims through his diabolical mind games.Kindly, Lecter obliges to Clarice in helping with her investigation if she joins him in his little web of mind games. but the catch is she must reveal her personal background about her and he'll do the same. The horror genre in the movie isn't some dark, scary macabre individual going on a joyful killing spree, but a chilling, manipulative supremely intellectual individual who's desires is to play games with the medulla oblongata. He's got the gift of smelling one's fears and knows exactly where to strike at you, psychologically. There's even a good chance that the psychopath Agent Starling is after might even be twice as crazy as Lecter. But Lecter's motives are so convincing and executed to perfection by Sir Anthony Hopkins that the room temperature in the theater got a bit colder than usual.With the instincts of a snake, Lecter starts then starts to slurp. Hopkins later reveals it was improvised just to add more intimidation to the character. This role as Dr. Lecter brought this relatively unknown British actor exceptional fame and Hollywood started to take more notice from this middle-aged performer. Lecter himself has identical similarities to Boris Karloff's 1934 movie ""The Black Cat"" in which Karloff plays a demonic Satanist. Instead of making Lecter an evil, ghoulish monster who goes on a killing spree, he takes the Norman Bates route and plays a monster in the form of a sophisticated gentleman. Sure he gladly helps Clarice, but at cost of haunting her as well. Sure he's not as bad as we are lead to believe, but you can't help taking your eyes off the screen when he comes on.What was fortuitous about the release of ""The Silence of the Lambs"" was released at the time cold-blooded cannibal/serial killer Jeffrey Dahmer was making the headlines. Both stories were quite identical to one another as they both lured their audience with gripping and chilling effects. Therefore, it is safe to say that ""Silence of the Lambs"" gets us into sorting out connections to find a convincing explanation as to what drove Dahmer to be the way that he is. Unlike other psychological thrillers, this one will have you pondering to yourself over what kind of connection this movie has to the Dahmer story. The real shortcoming here is that audience at the time wanted more, as in more Hannibal. Well it took 10 years in the making and in 2001 ""Hannibal"" was released. And even though Dahmer is rotting in hell, Hannibal will live on into ours minds forever.",The Silence of the Lambs
129,Sandcooler,Superb thriller,10,10 March 2011,"""Silence Of The Lambs"" is really that kind of movie that gets under your skin and lays eggs. Doesn't sound appetizing, but that's pretty much the point. It's a very vile and intense film, it's filled with dark, unnerving scenes that make you feel dirty for watching them. The tension just never goes away, it never gives you a moment to lay back and relax. Anthony Hopkins has surprisingly little screen time, but somehow his uncomfortable presence is always felt. Damn those prison scenes are ominous, downright unpleasant to watch really. Jodie Foster is pretty brilliant too, even with her much-ridiculed Southern accent she still gives a stellar performance. The climax is also everything you expect and more, excellent to say the least. To me this is one of the best and most exciting thrillers ever made.",The Silence of the Lambs
130,Zbigniew_Krycsiwiki,"Sometimes, you wake up in the dark and hear the screaming of the lambs.",7,27 August 2015,"Film is basically divided, unevenly, into three sections: Starling interviewing Lector, for clues about the identity of a killer at large, referred to as Buffalo Bill; Lector's manipulation of Starling, in attempt to escape custody; and the case of Buffalo Bill himself, a truly frightening villain, moreso than Lector himself, in my opinion.Buffalo Bill holding the girl captive in the well in his basement are terrifying, especially when he speaks to her, referring to her as *it*. ""It rubs the lotion on its skin. It does that whenever it is told"", in such a booming, baritone voice, only makes it sound even more intimidating. He is one of the creepiest killers in film, vaguely similar to Leatherface, and leaves quite an impression, despite precious little screen time. I found him to be more intimidating and terrifying even than Lector, who, while also chilling, was more of a gentleman in his speech and mannerisms. Even when Lector was beating the guard with his nightstick, he did it with such elegance and finesse, he made it seem almost poetic. A counter to Buffalo Bill's crudity.The climax was taut and suspenseful, as Starling gropes around in the pitch black basement searching for Buffalo Bill, a light, and a way out, but it was negated when he committed such an obvious, stupid mistake (loudly pulling the hammer back on his gun, and basically announcing his presence to Starling) Or, was that the purpose of that action, to show us he really wasn't a very smart man?",The Silence of the Lambs

132,screenman,Supreme Cinema.,10,17 May 2008,"This is one of those very rare movies in which every detail meshes. It's a whole piece. A comparison that comes most readily to mind is 'The Usual Suspects'.From the beautifully evocative orchestral music onwards, you just know you're about to witness something special. The camera-craft and lighting are at times quite sublime, the acting entirely believable. For those with a decent sound-system, one can almost feel the changes of ambiance. Take, for example, Clarice Starling's first encounter with Hannibal. A slight echo typical of the prison facility above ground, is lost as she descends into the catacomb-like dungeon of the most dangerous inmates. Now there is no resonance at all. Instead we have a thick, claustrophobic silence that is frighteningly intimate. This is a nerve-racking aural prelude to their first meeting at the other end of the chamber. It is wonderfully crafted. And because it serves our expectations so well, we take it for granted. For this reason, good quality sound-engineering is often overlooked.And so the movie goes on. Dr Lecter is standing in the middle of his cell. It's a strange, unnatural posture, as if momentarily paused from some action. But he just remains, quiet, still, fixedly watching. The exchanges between nervous Clarice and himself are amongst the classics of cinema. Jodie Foster is ideal with her nervous palpitation, but still driven by pride and ambition to achieve something, whilst Anthony Hopkins, playfully enigmatic, intelligent, and with a barely-restrained madness, sets her a perfect foil.The plot twists are numerous and clever. The discovery slow, slick and often shocking. The script is arch, witty, but still entirely believable, and delivered by a cast of actors who never put a foot wrong.Small town America is depicted as a sad failure. Properties are neglected. The people appear defeated. The lighting is always dull, with the colours washed-out. It's grim. The sun never seems to shine. The music is pensive and thoughtful. A great deal of attention went into describing emotion by light and sound, and once again we can easily take it for granted. But someone thought it all out, piece by piece.Fast forward to Buffalo Bill's lair. We meet the man himself at last. He is naked, obsessing over his pathological delusion. In the mirror he conceals his genitalia between his legs as metamorphosis into femininity. A different music is playing - heavy metal.Clarice has found him out. But he has descended into a sub-basement hell and she must follow and find him. Groping in absolute darkness amongst unimaginable ghastly relics of wickedness we see her at last from Bill's perspective. He has an image intensifier and can observe her every move. She is desperately afraid but yet more courageous still. She will not be deterred. In the stifling confinement we hear her hyper-ventilating with terror and barely able to hold her gun steady. Then it's over. Bill is disclosed by his own sound and seen in a whirl of momentary gun-flashes. During the chaos a blind is disturbed and at last there is sweet daylight flooding in. A Chinese-lantern affair is twirling gracefully in its glare. The audience collectively begin breathing again.This movie is a master-class in cinema as an art-form. It is possible to exhaust one's fund of superlatives in praise. I cannot watch it very often because I am drained by the sheer emotional experience. When Hollywood does it right, they really cannot be bettered. Oscars for best film, best director, best screenplay, and best actors for both Hopkins and Foster, with two other nominations - never more deserved.As a footnote to an earlier commentator. Apart from the corpses, the only character in the movie to be seen naked is that of buffalo Bill himself. And even he spares our sensibilities. At no time does Jodie Foster expose herself, neither does Anthony Hopkins, nor indeed anyone else. I begin to wonder if that commentator was watching a different movie.",The Silence of the Lambs
133,brando647,A Masterpiece of a Psychological Thriller,10,21 September 2008,"Jonathan Demme's 1991 film is one of my all-time favorite movies, and it's one of the reasons that drove me to study film-making. It's an intense psychological thriller with a phenomenal cast and some of the most memorable characters/scenes in cinema. Based on the novel by Thomas Harris, the film follows Clarice Starling, an FBI trainee who has been pulled on to assist in a case by the head of the FBI Behavioral Sciences division. Starling must interview incarcerated serial killer Hannibal Lecter in an attempt to help capture a new killer who has risen up and killed three women for their skin. Of course, this movie is legendary, so I'm sure everyone knows this much already...Demme's film, while not the first to feature the character of Hannibal Lecter, is what turned the psychopath into one of the greatest movie villains ever created. Most of the credit for this can be attributed to Anthony Hopkins portrayal of the evil genius. The character is charismatic and frightening, all at the same time, so you can't help but like him despite the terrible things he's done. Lecter is a film icon due to Hopkins' performance. The best scenes in the film are any that include conversations between Lecter and Starling (Jodie Foster). They make every other scene in the movie (including the primary plot) seem insignificant and I found myself waiting for the next interview scene. Foster was great as the naive FBI agent-in-training who is thrown into the fire for her first real assignment and Scott Glenn gave a strong performance Jack Crawford, head of Behavioral Sciences. Aside from Hopkins, I'd have to say the best performance came from Ted Levine as Jame ""Buffalo Bill"" Gumb. Perhaps I am just easily entertained by sociopaths but watching him as the severely disturbed Gumb still gives me the creeps.I wouldn't say I was ever really scared by this movie, so I wouldn't classify it as horror. It was more a sense of uneasiness from the film's two resident psychos: Hopkins and Levine. It gives you a minor glimpse of the mind of a serial killer and it does it effectively, thanks to the writings of Thomas Harris and Ted Tally. Despite having been released in 1991, the film is timeless and continues to stand today as one of the best movies I've ever seen. Honestly, if you're reading this and haven't seen this film, do yourself a favor and watch it. You won't regret it.",The Silence of the Lambs
134,begob,You're safe now!,10,28 June 2020,"A rookie FBI agent on the trail of a perverted killer must follow the clues left by the mind games of an evil genius.Impossible to overpraise this movie. The score, the performances, the sequence of scenes, the choice of scenes, the structure of the scenes, even the segues between scenes are beautifully judged. Direction and editing nice and tight, cinematography contributing so much to the tension. Some nice touches too, when the FBI trainees jog past and look back at the girls, and in the final scene the Caribbean palm trees tossing in the wind of an incipient hurricane.Loads of thoughtful reviews on this, so I'll just make a point about the dialogue, because it delivers so much exposition under cover of the emotional push and pull between Starling and Lector, Starling and Crawford. In many bad movies the writer throws Q&A dialogue into the script just to get the characters interacting, but to no purpose. In Silence, the quid pro quo sucks us into Starling's tense conflicts even as the information rolls along to keep us up to pace with the plot. And the close ups make it all the more fascinating. Just excellent.Overall: Perfectly paced thriller that takes us through the looking glass and in to horror.",The Silence of the Lambs

He assigns her to interview Hannibal Lecter, a former psychiatrist and incarcerated cannibalistic serial killer, whose insight might prove useful in the pursuit of a serial killer nicknamed ""Buffalo Bill"", who skins his female victims' corpses. Starling travels to the Baltimore State Hospital for the Criminally Insane, where she is led by Frederick Chilton (Anthony Heald) to Lecter's solitary quarters. Although initially pleasant and courteous, Lecter grows impatient with Starling's attempts at ""dissecting"" him and rebuffs her. As she is leaving, one of the prisoners flicks semen at her. Lecter, who considers this act ""unspeakably ugly"", calls Starling back and tells her to seek out an old patient of his. This leads her to a storage shed where she discovers a man's severed head with a sphinx moth lodged in its throat. She returns to Lecter, who tells her that the man is linked to Buffalo Bill. He offers to profile Buffalo Bill on the condition that he be transferred away from Chilton, whom he detests.It won Academy Awards in all the top five categories: Best Picture, Best Actor, Best Actress, Best Director, and Adapted Screenplay.

137,Muhammad_Rafeeq,"Masterpiece, My favorite movie of all-time! ( A+ Movie) My Ratings 10/10",10,8 February 2020,"The greatest horror thriller ever made. Jonathan Demme's psychological horror thriller The Silence of the Lambs (1991) is a masterclass in creative filmmaking, poignant acting, and striking visual storytelling. Demme directs The Silence of the Lambs with an eye for visual metaphors whether it's FBI agent Clarice Starling, played by the endearing Jodie Foster, standing meekly as a short female FBI student among her tall male co-workers. Demme keeps you gripped by showing you crime evidence photos, realistic corpses of victims, cuts to the killer's activities, and showing consultations with an infamous cannibal doctor. Demme's direction is intriguing with a constant unnerving representation of killers or their victims. You are forced to follow Starling's investigation into the brutal killings of a madman named Buffalo Bill. It's a creative cinema masterpiece as it remains always entertaining and genuinely chilling. Howard Shore's score is unsettling with subtle eerie melodies and soaring scary themes rushing around the gruesome crimes herein. Shore composes memorable music for The Silence of the Lambs that continues to frighten any audience that dares to view this classic movie. Notably, Jodie Foster gives her arguably her greatest performance in The Silence of the Lambs, and she was in Taxi Driver! Foster brings a sincere warmth, sympathetic trauma, inspiring gusto, and engaging intelligence to her role as Clarice Starling. She's an ambitious and cool FBI woman with top ranking in her class and a desire to become a real FBI agent. I love how Foster depicts the investigative process as serious and rational, especially in the face of crazy, seemingly random killings. Foster finds Clarice's earnest approach to communicating with a flesh craving cannibal and brings Clarice a clarity of conscious and morality that is fascinating in every scene. I appreciate Jodie Foster in The Silence of the Lambs more with each viewing of Jonathan Demme's iconic film. Of course, most remember Sir Anthony Hopkins in his groundbreaking performance as serial killer Dr. Hannibal Lecter also known as Hannibal the Cannibal. Hopkins never blinks to throw you off balance in his imposing staring portrayal is simply marvelously creepy. Hopkins boasts a frightening stocky stature and suddenly violent physicality to his Hannibal that makes his Lecter even scarier than Brian Cox's archetypal portrayal back in Michael Mann's Manhunter. Hopkins plays the psychological torture by the doctor's words toying with Clarice to perfection. He is curious and cruel with malicious intent and shocking again and again. Hopkins will never not scare me anytime I see him as Hannibal Lecter. I should mention Scott Glenn is great as the FBI head Jack Crawford. His accidental sexism is beautifully portrayed by the nuanced Glenn. He is steadfast as a lawman, but always belittles Clarice, while encouraging her work. It's an interesting bit of acting and writing for an interesting character. Anthony Heald is so slimy and creepy and the sadistic narcissist Dr. Frederick Chilton. Last, but surely not least, Ted Levine is absolutely terrifying as the serial killer Jame ""Buffalo Bill"" Gumb. His feminine body language, effeminate voice, lithe appearance, brutal physicality, crafty killing, and playful attitude all culminate in the vicious atrocity of Buffalo Bill's character. Levine plays up the fact that Bill thinks he's a transsexual so well that you are fearful of his sudden changes in personality and masculinity. He embodies both masculine and feminine traits, thus creating a nebulous figure in Buffalo Bill. His character can be anyone and that's what makes him so scary. Levine's acting during the ""tuck"" scene as well as while meeting Clarice is just wonderful acting. Ted Levine is more versatile than I feel critics and audiences are willing to give him credit for as Levine is every bit a monstrous and scary as Hopkins' Hannibal. Overall, The Silence of the Lambs demands to be seen and will haunt you forever after witnessing all its glorious filmmaking and stunning crime.",The Silence of the Lambs

139,mjw2305,Dark and Gripping Thriller,10,2 February 2005,"Silence of the Lambs was the birthplace of Anthony Hopkins's Hannibal Lecter, one of the finest monsters ever screened. Although this is the middle film in the trilogy, it was made first and remains the finest in the set.Clarice Starling (Jodie Foster) is a highly intelligent, very vulnerable young FBI trainee. With a serial killer named Buffalo Bill increasing his body count. Clarice is sent by Jack Crawford (Scott Glen) to attempt to gain any information that she can from Dr. Hannibal Lecter (A brilliant, yet Insane Psyciatrist known as Hannibal the Cannibal) Starling has to gain Lecter's trust, by engaging in very dangerous mind games with the Doctor, and the last person you want in your head is Hannibal Lecter, but without his help, Buffalo Bill's victims will stand no chance.Foster and Hopkins have a very strong on screen chemistry, and both portray their characters brilliantly, making them realistic and believable. The Scenery matches the mood of the movie, very dark and gloomy for much of the time, and the pockets of suspense interlaced with some imaginative psychological horror make Silence of the Lambs a movie that sets the standard, and the standard is high.10/10",The Silence of the Lambs
140,SusieSalmonLikeTheFish,Why?,4,17 January 2017,"Look, ""overrated"" doesn't necessarily mean bad. I liked this film when it first came out, and I found it very entertaining. But the extremely high amount of praise that this film gets, makes no sense to me at all. The supposedly menacing and creepy Hannibal Lecter, who ate his victims and is now locked away from society, sounds totally ridiculous with his cheesy one-liners about cannibalism and killing. Jodie Foster, who plays our main protagonist (an elite FBI agent in training) looks and sounds about thirteen years old, and the entire time I was watching, she kept reminding me of an actress from a television after-school special playing dress-up and pretending to be a cop. The pace of this film was rather dull as well, unnecessarily long with hammy characters that seem like they belong in a Troma movie rather than anything highly rated. It still blows my mind that a brilliant film like ""The Killing Fields"" has never been selected for national preservation, but this corny crime thriller was. Honestly I've seen low-budget slashers better than this thing... so why the high reputation and constant fans saying ""oh god, this film is awesome! Hannibal is soooo sexy!"" and all that? To each their own, everybody likes different things, but with this one, which currently has an 8.6/10 overall rating on IMDb, how did that even happen? Was this one of those ""right place at the right time"" kind of things where it hits a generation by doing something innovative for the time, thus becoming popular? Or is there seriously something here I'm missing? I've watched it several times and I don't find it complex or overly intriguing in any way whatsoever. And I really like Foster and Hopkins as actors, from Hopkins' role as the grieving father in Audrey-Rose, to Foster as the dying little girl on a Nova Scotia vacation in Echoes of a Summer, but in this film it tries to put them together in some sort of tragic love story, which really plays out strangely. I kept cringing at Foster's character's pretentiousness and show-off attitude and Hannibal Lecter's pointless riddles and games, which are interesting at first but quickly become boring and stupid.",The Silence of the Lambs
141,sme_no_densetsu,A top-notch thriller - Enjoy it with some fava beans and a nice chianti,8,9 December 2008,"""The Silence of the Lambs"" is a film that needs no introduction. After all, who isn't familiar with Hannibal Lecter, chosen by the AFI as the top movie villain of all time? Needless to say, this is a thriller that touched a chord with movie-goers everywhere and continues to do so today.One of the film's strong points is the casting. Obviously, Anthony Hopkins as Lecter was an inspired choice, but the thing that makes it even more special is the interplay with Jodie Foster as Clarice Starling. Deservedly, both of their performances resulted in Oscar wins. The supporting cast is solid too, though unremarkable, except for Ted Levine as Buffalo Bill.One of the film's other Oscar wins went to Ted Tally for his screenplay adapted (pretty faithfully) from Thomas Harris' best-selling novel. It's a compelling story and the female 'hero' makes it unique (or at least it was unique before countless copycats tried and failed with the same formula). It also features not one, but two, psychologically fascinating psychopaths.Director Jonathon Demme won an Oscar for his efforts but I'm not especially crazy about the film's look. There are indeed a few memorable images but, generally, the whole visual presentation seems a little B-movie-ish to me. Howard Shore's score is mostly average as well though I suppose that it does have its moments.However, what I perceive as a slight deficiency in terms of style is more than made up for in substance. Forget the scores of imitators that have followed (including the sequels), this is the real deal.",The Silence of the Lambs

I've never read the book but the film feels so genuine in its approach just like its main character Clarice starling played by an amazingly vulnerable but strong Jodie Foster. Anthony Hopkins is also amazing in his role and so is Ted Levine. But it's more than that the screening and the way its adapted is unique and intriguing.

144,oneguyrambling,A rare film that challenges the audience and finds both commercial and critical success.,9,3 February 2012,"A number of Oscars and one of the more memorable psychopaths in cinematic history render any banal positive reviews of The Silence of the Lambs unnecessary. Therefore I will keep this brief and try to throw in a chuckle or two.Silence of the Lambs is a masterpiece in characterisation and lean filmmaking. If you think about it the characters portrayed are either vital to the story or mere window-dressing, there are no in between 'sorta' supporting roles.This leaves rookie FBI trainee Clarice Starling (Jodie Foster) free to hunt a serial killer named Buffalo Bill (Ted Levine) on behalf of senior FBI agent Jack Crawford (Scott Glenn). With the all important support and guidance from super intelligent, clinical and fiendishly complicated Hannibal 'the Cannibal' Lecter (Anthony Hopkins).Without Hannibal's input SotL might still be a solid FBI procedural 'go-geddim', it just wouldn't be near as memorable. Hannibal doesn't display many other signs of normal body language, he remains bolt upright and his arms and hands rarely move about. Hopkins' performance is all eyes – a steely gaze during conversation changes instantly to a wide eyed glare during times where 'you'd better listen'. His speech is quick, clipped and crisp, though he hangs on to the last syllable of every important sentence as if he's afraid that ending it won't allow time for another.Even though Hopkins' screen time is very short he also gets all the best lines and is the core of the most memorable sequences.After a perceived discourtesy to young Clarice enrages Hannibal he throws her a bone and her investigation progresses more rapidly. Along the way she learns more and more about Buffy B, and in a few solid scenes so do the audience, most notably the oft parodied 'self analysis' whilst wearing a lovely pink negligee.Clarice begins the film as a nervous rookie in a grown man's environment, that of the testosterone dominated FBI ranks. She ends the film a seasoned pro who has seen things that 99% of the population couldn't possibly fathom.Without labouring on the plot developments the final sequence contains a masterful misdirection that will shock and hook you in until the closing credits, and even though we now know that the sequels didn't really deliver you were definitely left wanting more of Hannibal at the time.There are lots of close ups during dialogue scenes that demand that you pay attention, and given the gory and disgusting subject matter Demme wisely keeps a leash on the violence and macabre to save the impact for the more important scenes near the end. He does though keep reminding us of the thematic elements with the occasional head in a jar, skinsuit or my favourite, the unnecessary throat-moth.I am not a director's aficionado. I subscribe more to the ""I don't know directing, but I know what I like"" motif, that leads me to follow the careers of certain guys more than others. But The Silence of the Lambs is lean, mean and memorable and obviously exceptionally crafted.Final Rating – 9 / 10. Very rarely do truly challenging films find both commercial and critical success – especially if they contain 'unpleasant subject matter such as this. Silence of the Lambs managed both, on top of all that it is still as strong and packs as much of a punch some 20 years on.",The Silence of the Lambs
145,frankde-jong,One of the weirdest beauty and the beast films ever,9,21 August 2020,"""The silence of the lambs"" is not just (or just not) a film about the FBI hunting a serial killer. The officer in charge of this hunt (Jack Crawford played by Scott Glenn) assumes that ""it takes one to know one"" and wants the help of a psychpath who is already behind bars (Dr Hannibal Lecter played by Anthony Hopkins). Because Hannibal does not want to speak with any of his men, Grawford sents a female trainnee (Clarice Starling played by Jodie Foster). The relationship that evolves between Clarice and Hannibal is the real gem of this film.Already their first meeting is brilliant. Clarice has te descent a couple of stairs and go through a couple of doors to reach the heavily guarded Lector. It reminds of a descent in the underworld, a metaphor that is used a couple of times in this film. When reaching Lecter, he is standing in the middle of his cell. Despite his normal appearance Hopkins manages to radiate evil in his most pure form.The FBI is in a hurry because the serial killer can strike again every day. Hannibal Lector has all the time in the world, because he has been senenced to life imprisonment. There resuls a cat and mouse came in which Lecter aks personal information from Clarice (which she has been ordered not to give) in exchange for help (sounds familiar in the internet age) . During the relationship there somehow grows some respect and trust. Clarice not only learns about the case but also about herself.Clarice, who is of humble descent and who works very hard to climb the social ladder, is less confident then she wants us to believe. We see this for example in a scene where she enters an elevator full of men much taller then her. Dr Hannibal Lecter recognizes her uncentainty immediately and delves into her past. This gives rise to a couple of flashbacks where it takes some time for the viewer to realise that we are in the past and no longer in the present.The flashbacks are one example of sophisticated editing, the parallel montage of the arresting scene is another. Parallel montage is nearly as old as the movies self. It was already used by D.W. Griffith in ""Intolerance"" (1916) in a sequence in which we alternately see the hanging of a man and the approaching of the one who knows that he is innocent. In this example of parallel montage we know at each moment at whom we are looking. The sophistication of the ""Silence of the lamb"" montage is that we no longer know which images belong to which location. Clarice and a police force are approaching two different houses. One of these houses is empty, at the other lives the serial killer. We see a police man ring the bell. The next thing we see is a bell ringing inside. Belong these images to the same location???""The silence of the lambs"" depends for a good part on the acting of Jodie Foster and Anthony Hopkins. In 1991 Jodie Foster was still young, but already very experienced (see played in ""Taxi driver"" (1976, Martin Scorsese) at the age of fourteen). At first I thought Anthony Hopkins was more convincing in ""normal"" roles such as in ""Shadowlands"" (1993, Richard Attenborough) and ""The remains of the day"" (1993, James Ivory). Only on second sight I could appreciate his ability to personalize evil without to much gruesome action.The relationship between Clarice and Hannibal Lector has been labeled as a beauty and the beast relationship. This is only partly true. In the first place Hannibal Lecter has a normal appearance and is not particularly ugly (not good looking either). In the second place if the beast does something wrong it is because of his nature and outside the reach of his free will (compare ""Frankenstein"" (1931, James Whale)). I don't know to which extend a psychopath has a free will. The only (but not unimportant) ""match"" is that during the film we develop some sympathy for Hannibal (but we keep identifying only with Clarice).",The Silence of the Lambs

He was so evil and brilliant any time I see him in a movie(like in Fracture) I think he is going to bite someone. He is that good. Jodie Foster deserved the Oscar that she got too. The Silence of the lambs is all around fantastic. Foster stars as FBI agent Clarise Starling.

He even kidnaps a politician's daughter.The Silence of the lambs is deranged and great. Buffalo Bill of course don't got nothing on Lecter. But even he is frightening as hell because he...

Anthony Hopkins is just wild in his Academy Award winning performance. I find it amazing that I was getting chills up my spine just from watching him play Lecter. This is the best of his Lecter performances, as the other movies (that would be Hannibal and Red Dragon (though they were okay) lack the dramatical oomph so prevalent in this one.

150,TheUnknown837-1,"""The Silence of the Lambs"" is, as you've heard, intensely frightening and off-putting, but more significantly in today's cinema, it's storytelling at its finest",10,22 August 2009,"There is a fine line of similarity between Jonathan Demme's ""The Silence of the Lambs"" and Alfred Hitchcock's iconic thriller ""Psycho."" They were both notorious upon initial release for their surprising amount of violent and off-putting content that ultimately proved too much for some people and they are both incredible, visionary masterpieces. Demme's film, based on a very good book by Thomas Harris, is not only one of the creepiest films I've ever seen, but it's one of the two or three best horror films I've ever seen. It's frightening, it's unforgettably creepy, it's off-putting, but it's also well-acted, works around a terrific story and premise, and is overall, a great movie.Purist fans of the original book by Harris will not be disappointed, for Demme's film follows the novel almost religiously step by step and sometimes quote for quote. Jodie Foster won her second Academy Award for her portrayal of an FBI trainee after a serial killer nicknamed Buffalo Bill (Ted Levine) who skins his victims, and uses the psychological genius of a cannibalistic serial killer behind bars, Dr. Hannibal Lecter (Anthony Hopkins) to track him down before his latest victim's skinless body winds up in another river.Let me state off the bat that personally, I am not a fan of the horror genre and knowing that Gene Siskel himself was quite appalled by the film, I was a little cautious going into ""The Silence of the Lambs."" But I am so glad I did. I was freaked out, I was on the edge of my seat half the time, and there are some images in the film that I really don't care for, but underneath all of the frightening subtext, there was a true, beautiful masterpiece and a terrific story to keep me interested.Unlike a truly awful horror film I recently saw, ""Mirrors"" (2008), ""The Silence of the Lambs"" is not all blood-and-guts and no story. In fact, there's only five or six really creepy and gruesome moments in the movie and they are wisely spaced apart from each other so that the filmmakers and actors can work on developing the plot and the mystery, which is far more engaging. It's not just one brutal killing after another, which really gets tiresome. It's an engaging example of storytelling, but for those who love scary movies, you will not be disappointed, either.Apart from having a well-written story, ""The Silence of the Lambs"" has terrific characters and a great cast to boast about as well. The best performance in the film is Jodie Foster's, who is hands-down sympathetic and brilliant as the struggling FBI agent whose on this mission not to prove herself to her boss (Scott Glenn), but to save a young woman's life from the hands of a sick-minded monster. One of the few problems I had with the book was that I didn't like the Clarice Starling character; she seemed too vulgar and dislikable to me and more self-centered. I liked Foster's interpretation more because she generates the sympathy and remorse that an audience goes after. Quit the contrast to Anthony Hopkins's character.Although he is a versatile actor capable of doing a great many other movies, this is the film that Anthony Hopkins is most remembered as and that's simply because next to or even above Norman Bates by Anthony Perkins, he's the most disturbing villain ever put on screen. Hopkins's entire performance is a brilliant visualization of what Thomas Harris dreamed up while writing the original books after hour upon hour of studying real-life serial killers and psychopaths. Hopkins speaks of a voice that's only uncannily familiar to his natural tone, he seldom blinks, he oftentimes stands perfectly still, and works with these well-written lines conceived by Harris and adapted by the screenwriter to present a disgusting, horrific monster of a man who does not serve as a role model and something that the audience fears and turns away from. We do not even see Hopkins for a good chunk of the way in and we spend the first part of the movie anticipating his arrival, preparing for this man who killed and then ate people for reasons nobody can really understand. A great strength of ""The Silence of the Lambs"" is that it does not make likable characters out of serial killers. Hannibal Lecter and Buffalo Bill, by contrast, are sick, conniving, and savage whom you do not want to come within a mile of.But again, the movie is not ABOUT the fact that Hannibal Lecter eats people and Buffalo Bill skins people and it does not lead up to these moments. It's not ABOUT the notoriously shocking thrills. Many horror films today are—they follow it almost as if it were a formula. But ""The Silence of the Lambs"" is an exception. The thrills are used as they should be—as a service to the story that's being told. They strengthen it, rather than consume it.",The Silence of the Lambs

Lambs is in my top ten of horror movies of all time and as a film student I think I know film. Hopkins and Foster are superb and the camera work and cinematography are amazing.

Like all or most Oscar's winners this is time waster too. There are far better shorter movies and series episodes and villains who are much more interesting to hear and watch, the perfect example being some villains and insane criminals from CSI. Although there is some mystery, rare occurrences, scientific words, most of it requires knowledge of related jargon or vocabulary. It is too subjective, egoistic, and complicated, unclear. I would prefer much more objective movies that deal with stuff like forensics like CSI series. Not fully finished, not fully clear, and not that convincing. For example what are motives, what happened to 2nd villain, what is purpose...are some questions unanswered. Unfortunately like most Oscars this is long time, low quality movie. Also bit too dark, gray, or weak graphics.",The Silence of the Lambs

He had those mannequins and moths with a well in his basements. He'd wear make up. He abducted plus size woman and wanted to make a new skin for his transformed self out of these women. He abducted the daughter of a senator. Dr. Lecter was transferred to a hall in a hotel and caged in the middle like an animal. He got away by killing the two officers. He took the face of one and disguised as an injured officer and dropped him on the roof of the elevator. This trick was played again when agent Crawford and others busted a house thinking they found the moth killer buffalo bill just as Clarice found the killer's house by herself. She made sure he's the one when he saw the moths flying around. He cut the power and he was able to see her with night vision glasses but when he pulled the triggered, Clarice heard it and managed to shoot him dead. Then she became an FBI agent. Dr Lecter called him from a tropical town and he was at large. Jodie Foster and Anthony Hopkins are both flawless in this film. Listening to them speaking to each other is so good. The backstory of Clarice with all those lambs in the range she was living after his father was killed and how she wanted to save them from getting slaughtered and gettin away from the farm with one of the lambs ended up in an orphanage. The lambs stopped screaming for Clarice. It had some really creepy moments without jumpscares like when Clarice entered a garage whose door wouldn't completely open and found a severed head in the bottle in a car and that man was the boyfriend of Buffalo Bill. I'll definitely watch this again.",The Silence of the Lambs
154,gizmomogwai,Dark. Disturbing. Emotional. Compelling,10,28 February 2009,"What makes The Silence of the Lambs, which won the Oscar for Best Picture of 1991, a classic? It's not the story, involving a serial killer kidnapping a senator's daughter. There's nothing wrong with this story, but it's rather the characters that make this movie so memorable and powerful. Anthony Hopkins plays Dr. Hannibal Lecter, one of the greatest villains in movie history (if not the greatest), a perceptive psychiatrist turned cannibalistic killer turned prisoner. Jodie Foster plays Clarice, an FBI trainee who gets to know Hannibal, hoping he can help her with a current serial killer case. Hopkin's performance is mesmerizing. He's intelligent but a monster. He's frightening because, as Crawford tells Clarice, ""you don't want Hannibal Lecter inside your head."" But Clarice lets him inside her head, and breaks a number of other rules regarding how to talk to Hannibal. As Hannibal asks Clarice for details on her personal life, their meetings become a sort of twisted therapy, developing Clarice as a character and allowing Foster to deliver an impressive performance of her own when telling her lamb story.The Silence of the Lambs is compelling, and frightening. The moth is creepy. Lecter's escape scene is, for me, the scariest thing in the film; his face is calm as he's killing the guards. The movie ends with Hannibal free again, a cliffhanger ending that (unfortunately) resulted in a disappointing sequel ten years later. The Silence of the Lambs is one of my all-time favourite films.",The Silence of the Lambs
155,hnt_dnl,"Uneasy mix of genuine chills and ""Hollywood""",5,28 July 2011,"SILENCE OF THE LAMBS (1991), based on the major awards that it won (Best Picture, Director, Actor, and Actress) could be considered the most overrated film of the 90s. While the film has it's plusses, it fails for me in being a purely chilling horror movie, which is what I think it should be. I'm not as enamored of Jonathan Demme's psychological yarn as so many others.First and foremost, SOTL is a boring movie! The first scene between Oscar-winning stars Jodie Foster (as FBI recruit Clarice Starling) and Anthony Hopkins (as imprisoned psychotic Dr. Hannibal ""The Cannibal"" Lecter) is definitely a keeper. Much as I don't like this movie, I DO really like that intense early scene! But everything after that just drags...and drags...and drags! Foster and Hopkins, while good, do not IMHO give Oscar-worthy performances. Foster's ""Southern"" accent is fairly overwrought and phony and Hopkins kind of hams it up too much as Lecter. They really don't embody their characters so much as they are just ""acting"". Foster is basically a made-to-order female hero for everyone to fawn over and Hopkins is there for entertainment value only.Now, there ARE scary parts to SOTL, just none involving Hannibal. The real scary parts are of Starling's prey Buffalo Bill (Ted Levine in a genuinely creepy performance) and his latest hostage Catherine (Brooke Smith in an authentic performance). The scenes of Bill's dungeon are very unsettling. But everything revolving around the capture (the investigation, the dead ends, the MacGuffins, etc.) is the standard Hollywood storyline. It was obvious from the get-go that Starling was going to catch Bill, but the way it was done was extremely pedestrian.SOTL isn't even the best film with ""Hannibal"". That honor goes to the superior Michael Mann-directed film Manhunter from 1986, which is much more involving, intense, and satisfying. It has a better, more believable hero (William Peterson's Will Graham), a better Hannibal (Brian Cox), and an even better antagonist (Tom Noonan's multi-layered Francis Dollarhyde). Manhunter was a police procedural, but also took the time to develop and delve into the psyche of it's characters. SOTL seems to be more interested in putting on a show. Then again, showmanship is what usually wins Oscars!",The Silence of the Lambs
156,classicalsteve,The Darker Side of Human Nature Explored Through a Very High-Quality Yet Disturbing Film,10,25 May 2011,"The Silence of the Lambs, based on the Thomas Harris book of the same name, is one of the most disturbing films based on fictional material to win the Academy Award for Best Picture, Best Actor, Best Actress, and Best Director. When you consider that films like ""My Fair Lady"", ""the Sound of Music"", ""Gandhi"", ""the Hurt Locker"", ""Schindler's List"", ""Driving Miss Daisy"", ""Rain Man"", and ""Forrest Gump"" have also earned the Best Picture prize, Lambs stands alone; similarly disturbing films are predominantly historical dramas. The only other Best Picture winners equaling the horror of ""Lambs"" are ""One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest"", ""Platoon"", and ""Unforgiven"". But none of these movies ever dealt with not one but two serial-killer sociopaths in a suburban-rural setting.An outstanding horror-suspense film, ""Lambs"" is not for the feint of heart. ""Lambs"" centers around three characters dealing with intense psychological dysfunction. Each character in turn not only reacts to their dysfunction in their own style but is in very different circumstances. Two of the three engage in horrific behavior of extreme violence, succumbing to the darkest side of human behavior as a result of their mental illness and dysfunctional pathology. At the story's beginning, one of them is in an institution for the criminally insane, having had a history of violent and sadistic behavior. The second is on the loose, dispatching young women for reasons yet unknown. The third character deals with her psychological issues by joining the FBI, and her reason d'etre becomes a mission to stop such behavior and rescue potential victims at the hands of psychological killers. If a ""story"" is about the growth and change of a character, then Lambs' narrative is really about Clarice Starling, an FBI trainee who is majoring in the Behavioral Science division which does psychological profiling of criminals, particularly serial killers. Her first real task, or test in a sense, is to psychologically profile the serial killer Hannibal Lecter, nicknamed ""the Cannibal"", played with such a believable yet sadistic sensibility by Anthony Hopkins that make Dracula and Frankenstein's monster seem more like Saturday morning cartoon villains by comparison. Lecter is possibly one of the most fascinating and simultaneously repulsive characters in fiction and film. He is a fusion of an Ivy League liberal arts professor who easily quotes ancient philosophers and the Monster of Venice, an Italian serial killer who dispatched victims, usually women, without a shred of empathy. But Lecter also has a fondness for high culture, displayed by his drawing of the Duomo in Milan. Italy. We learn Lecter had been a university professor of psychology who made it a habit of eating human victims. At story's beginning, he resides at a prison of mentally disturbed criminals where Starling first meets him in person. Also, we learn the FBI is hot on the trail of a strange woman-killer, the second character nicknamed Buffalo Bill by the press. Starling and Lecter form a strange yet compelling bond, not quite true friendship but something more meaningful than mere acquaintance. Part of the story is the evolution of Starling's and Lecter's relationship. A very subtle undertone of sexual flirting is hinted at in some scenes and yet we know that these two worlds could never permanently mesh.Eventually, Starling begins to solicit the help of Lecter to arrest the perpetrator of the horrid acts . We believe it's an accidental interaction at first, but then we learn that the solicitation is the brainchild of the head of the FBI's criminal behavioral division, Jack Crawford (Scott Glenn). Other agents had tried and failed to convince Lecter to assist, so he tries another tact: send a green trainee to Lector without telling her Crawford's real intentions. Buffalo Bill has dispatched five women, but no one at the agency can figure out his motive. With Lecter's help, Starling begins to unravel who Buffalo Bill is from a psychological standpoint as a means of finding out his identity and where he lives. Part of the narrative involves the revealing of both Starling and her target Buffalo Bill, although the most interesting and colorful character, Hannibal Lecter, remains completely enigmatic. The story then pushes into a new direction when a young woman from a prominent family is kidnapped and it is believed she has been abducted by Buffalo Bill. Can Starling extract enough information from Lecter to save the young woman before Buffalo Bill dispatches another innocent victim?One of the first elements that strikes you about Lambs is its foreboding atmosphere with some scenes having a quasi-medieval flavor. When Starling first visits the corridor inside the mental prison which houses Lecter, you feel like you're walking into a medieval dungeon. The stone brick is dirty and damp, and the inmates seem like something right out of Dante's Inferno (Hell). The same is true for Buffalo Bill's hideout, a maze of dark corridors filled with strange objects, like mannequins and costumes. The place where he imprisons his victims rings of something out of the Spanish Inquisition. Themes of raw sexuality permeate the entire story, although there is no love affair between any of the characters. Simultaneously, there are also overtones of objectifying human beings. Dr Chilton, the doctor in charge of Lecter at the hospital, boasts of having his sociopath patient, ""So rare to capture one alive. From a research point of view, Lecter is our most prized asset,"" as if Lecter is a rare object rather than a person. Also, the serial killers objectify their victims as a means of rationalizing their behavior. ""The Silence of the Lambs"" is one of the best horror-suspense films of its type with absolutely first-rate acting by the leads and the supports. And one of the most disturbing. But if you're looking for escapist innocent fun, Lambs will have you running under the covers, or at least switching to ""My Fair Lady"". Lecter and Buffalo Bill are the stuff nightmares are made of.",The Silence of the Lambs

The only answer I can come up with is that despite the horror, it's one of the best films ever made!!! The acting, the cinematography, the score,, it's all so incredible!! It won all those awards for a very good reason, don't ya think?!?No offense intended towards Brian Cox's portrayal of this character in Manhunter (he's a very fine actor with a long list of work to prove it), but Anthony Hopkins brought Hannibal Lecter to life in a way no other actor could have! So much so that the audience is pretty much rooting for the villain!!

159,sharky_55,He would consider that rude,10,1 October 2015,"""People will say we're in love,"" jokes Lecter, as he tantalisingly squares up young FBI trainee Clarice Starling in the tense first meeting. The excellence in Demme's direction comes from knowing what to linger on and what to hint at. He milks that first encounter of the two leads to its extremes, leading a young Foster down into the underground cells, past a room flooded in frantic red light (along with strict instruction and warning) and finally along that long corridor. The other prisoners leer and jeer as expected, but arriving at the end is a glass cell and that still and unblinking monster in Lecter. This very first conversation is impeccably shot; they trade blows and tight POVs immerse us into their mind's inner sanctums, and as Clarice's thin facade and accent is shattered by a few choice words, she is pushed off centre, disorientated and vulnerable. The plexiglass walls augment the atmosphere of unnerving intimacy between the unconventional pair. Like several other figures throughout the film, Lecter's male gaze seeps into the frame from front on and in extreme close-up, hungrily eating up Clarice's insecure psyche and exposing the screaming of the lambs in her dreams. Foster plays this part magnificently, not with acts of bravado, but in the nervous addressing of a room full of male police officers questioning her authority, in the low-class accent she tries desperately to mask, and in her sense of honesty and goodness that sets her apart and convinces Lecter to take a liking to her. ""Don't you feel eyes moving over your body, Clarice?"" We experience this in the rather nervous way her POV is presented to us, gazing absent-mindedly in every new scene, scanning the surroundings, and trying to avoid the sexualising and trivialising gazes of the male dominated law enforcement agency, which she must navigate with self awareness and a casual, tactful disposition despite it evidently worrying her. Lecter's eyes are also fixated intensely, but not on her body. Apart from the harrowing monologues of the screaming of the lambs from Foster, there are other ways that Demme increasingly notes her state of mind. Her introduction has her determined in the midst of male power and domination, no better expressed than when she enters an elevator full of male agents a good head taller than her. Mid investigation, she creeps over to the slightly ajar door, and with a smooth edit, we are transported to her youth, her father's funeral that began the terrifying downward spiral of her life. She makes the initial breakthrough with Lecter and expresses her frustration at being used by her superior, Jack Crawford, and the fading light within the tunnel is forced back into the frame via the car mirror, opposite Clarice's increasingly independence and wariness. And in that brilliant misdirection just before the climax, two operations are crosscut with the utmost precision, the complex man power of the SWAT take-down, and the pleasant but curious face of Clarice, not yet aware that she has stumbled onto Buffalo Bill.Opposite her is the demented yet strangely eloquent and intelligent Hannibal Lecter, a character which Anthony Hopkins lifts into classic film territory with his performance. When a golden pen is cast wayward in the holding cell, we are given a moment's glance, like Lecter and his eyes light up behind that grotesque and terrifying mask, Hopkins immediately conveying his intentions. We fear him so much more for the things unseen, our imagination going haywire as we witness him pull off a bloodied mask of skin in the ambulance, or as we stumble into the third floor with a officer hung up like a gory tapestry, or in that final haunting credits sequence, as he plots the meal of his former nemesis. Yet he remains staunchly interested in Clarice; in a fleeting close-up where they exchange files, their fingers touch for the only time in the film, yet we don't flinch, because strangely like Clarice, we know that he means her no harm. It's a sort of agitated confidence, after the brutality of Lecter's escape that flashes with terrifying aggressiveness and disregard for human life. His advice and assistance steers Clarice into the terrifying climax in the basement, the tensest sequence in the film. Shore's score simmers menacingly beneath the surface as Clarice prepares to enter each room of uncharted territory, the sound design magnifying each heavy breath and gasp, as well as the faint cries of the kidnapped daughter and the poodle's frenzied barking. As she kicks open each door, the camera doesn't immediately peer in and reveal its empty non-threatening contents, but holds onto Foster's panicked sweeping glance and brief window of relief. This forbids us from gaining a foothold onto the scene, and like Clarice we are constantly looking over our shoulder, even more so when the lights are switched off and she is forced to fumble around while the eerie night vision places us right in those slimy hands of Bill. The dread is perhaps a little cheapened by the slow-motion reaction and gunshot, but all the same, a film shows its excellence in sustaining tension when you are forced to back away a little. Here is the only horror film to win Best Picture, one which drives the audience and the horrors of imagination along the edge, brimming with nervous apprehension and fear. Best served with some fava beans and a nice Chianti.",The Silence of the Lambs
160,one9eighty,Chilling masterpiece,9,1 August 2018,"One of my favourite films of all time - which makes me a little bit strange in my family's eyes! The film tells the story of you young FBI Cadet/Trainee Clarice Starling's (Jody Foster) first big case. She's thrown into the wolves den and asked to interview an infamous cannibalistic serial killer, Dr Hannibal ""The Cannibal"" Lecter (Anthony Hopkins). Little does she know that she was chosen for ulterior motives, nether the less, she manages to extract information by forming a close bond with Dr Lecter - something nobody previously has been able to do. The information she is trying to get should lead to the capture of another serial killer, Buffalo Bill (Ted Levine) who has previously cross paths with Dr Lecter. Currently terrorising the eastern states of the US, he's killed five victims and kidnapping the senator's daughter. Lots of psychological warfare is and will be used in order to get the required information and track down the killer before it's too late for the senators daughter.Based on a Thomas Harris book of the same name this is actually one of those rare things, a film which doesn't ruin the feeling left by the book. Directed by Jonathan Demme the film is dark and tense, and acts as a benchmark for thrillers and horrors - proving you don't have to go overboard on gore or graphic visuals to make something haunting and memorable.The casting is brilliant and believable but its Hopkins and Foster who really drive this film from start to finish. Hopkins in particular delivers a performance which is classy but scary at the same time and will forever live in cult memory. From the minute you first glimpse Lecter in his cell, watching the wide eyed Starling approach you sense that something isn't right with him - massive credit to Hopkins for this delivery, it's haunting and disturbed, a kin to a caged predator watching curiously to see what has just entered his cage and what he can do with it for fun. Ask somebody to quote a line from the film and 9 times out of 10 it's be a quote about fava beans and Chianti. The visuals are dark and dirty, Demme chose washed out, almost sepia, colours throughout the film and it really adds a lot of texture to the experience. It almost feels like you've got dirty by watching the dirtiness of what's happening in front of you. I loved this film and would happily watch it any time I happen to catch it repeated. This is rare example of film which tests my ability to rate it - I refuse to give out 10's but that self-imposed rule could have been broken for this masterpiece so easily. 9 out of 10.",The Silence of the Lambs
161,Stampsfightclub,"Smart thriller, beautifully character driven",9,23 November 2008,"Clarice Starling (Foster) interviews cannibal Dr Hannibal Lecter (Hopkins) in an attempt to track down serial killer Buffalo Bill.No amount of praise that comes into this world will be enough to recognize the brilliance of this picture. Intelligent, quick witted, psychotic, different, shocking, tense and beautifully acted, the list of positives simply continues.The most recognized feature of this film is more than likely Anthony Hopkins' portrayal of the evil Hannibal Lecter. An extremely intelligent man who simply knows everything, he IS the epitome of evil.His smart sophistication and intelligence is brought to the screen in a vivid and shocking manor when dealing with FBI trainee Clarice Starling. The pairing of Jodie Foster (The Accused) and Hopkins (World's fastest Indian) is a thing of art. With Clarice's entry into the crime world and Hannibal's experience, we see a wonderful reflection of life. The past, the present and the future all intellectually driven by Lecter. Ideologies of investigation, nightmares and diagnosis's are all brought to the screen in a shocking manor, brought to an astounding light and credit to the actors who both received Oscars for their acts. Though Hannibal has hardly any screen time he is the stand out figure of the picture and will leave a devastating effect in the viewer's mind that will never be erased.Based on Thomas Harris' novel, this tells the story of Clarice, coming into the FBI world, unaware of anything and still haunted by her past.Unlike many crime films out there, this 1991 Oscar winning picture is beautiful in crafting character but also delivering a knockout issue driven plot, combining the two most important elements of films. This is achieved through some intelligent portrayals, but a grasping realistic direction tactic by Jonathan Demme.The plot is consistent with the dramatic ideology of the serial killer driving the film forward. There are a couple of scenes that are questionable, and a second viewing is usually necessary to capture all the necessary information.Having never read the book myself, I find this to be a shocking tale that the book may either offer so much more, or put a dent on the picture. Either way, the film is a necessity for any film fanatic.Smart and sophisticated, Silence of the Lambs is fast and flowing, beautifully realistic with a great line of characters, and one of the greatest on screen villains in history.",The Silence of the Lambs
162,KnightsofNi11,Masterfully disturbing,9,9 July 2011,"I'm not sure how anyone could disagree that The Silence of the Lambs is the greatest Hannibal Lecter film ever made. This is one of the highest quality horror films you will ever see. It's got an intense story, riveting characters, and incredible actors. The film takes place years after Manhunter. Lecter is still behind bars and he is once again called upon to assist in tracking down a disturbed serial killer. This time it is young FBI agent Clarice Starling who is assigned to talk to Lecter and with his information track down Buffalo Bill, a serial killer who kills young women and then skins them. But once again there is only so much trust you can put into a cannibal, and Lecter complicates things while at the same time giving subtle and vague clues to Clarice that might help track down Buffalo Bill. This is one of the most disturbing and psychologically grotesque films ever to grace the world of cinema, but it is made so well and with such expertise that it becomes a work of art rather than exploitation.This is one of those films where every aspect falls into place so perfectly it is as if you are experiencing everything the characters are as it happens, rather than just watching this film unfold. Right off the bat the movie grabs you with its stern sincerity and you can immediately feel the tension that rises throughout the film. Through the beginning of the film we develop a perfect sense of the tension within the film and the dread within the characters. Then we reach Clarice's first meeting with Hannibal Lecter and the films true haunting intensity comes out. At that moment the film becomes a nightmare that grows darker and darker with each clue that leads Clarice closer to what she sees as the ultimate evil that she is going to face, Buffalo Bill. She doesn't even know that the true evil is Lecter himself, but he is behind bars misleads Clarice to think he isn't as threatening. We the audience of course know that he is a bigger threat than any Buffalo Bill, but somehow we forget this because we are so compelled to feel as Clarice, our innocent and tormented protagonist, feels. It is a sinister trick the film pulls on us because it works all too well.This film relies a lot on shock value, making us remember every last disturbing image we are forced to witness during it. This film engraves itself into your mind and there is no way to escape the horror elicited by it. This is a movie that tortures you and makes you feel more than you've probably ever felt during a horror film. And yet it isn't a movie that draws out fear through cheap thrills. Every horrifying image you witness is meaningful and furthers the plot, driving us through the terror straight ahead to the film's explosive conclusion. This movie is what I consider to be truly scary. It instills true fear rather than just frightened amusement. It is masterful in its suspense building and ingenious in the placement and moderation of its thrills. We see a lot of grotesque things in The Silence of the Lambs but there are still things we don't see that make it even scarier.Through its incredible script, excellent direction, and superb acting this film establishes itself as a masterpiece. What really makes this film is definitely Anthony Hopkins portrayal of Hannibal Lecter. It is so perfectly haunting in a calm and sedated kind of way. There is nothing over the top or ridiculous about his character or Hopkins performance. It is totally believable which makes it that much more disturbing. It is easily one of the best film performances ever and a huge part of what makes this film incredibly terrifying.I don't hesitate to call The Silence of the Lambs one of the scariest films ever made. Its tension and its suspense make it so terrifyingly gripping that once the film has a hold of you it doesn't let go. Few films can instill fear the way this film does. I have to commend it for actually scaring me while refraining from being an over the top film full of cheap thrills and easy scares. This film is a horror masterpiece.",The Silence of the Lambs

It's regularly cited by critics, film directors and audiences as one of the greatest and most influential films, and after watching it for the first time I have to agree. I started this trilogy with the prequel Red Dragon and I liked it a lot but it wasn't anything mind blowing, the TV Series Hannibal was what got me interested so maybe my expectations were too high for that film. But I know this won't disappoint, I also thought this film was the perfect to catch the interest for the audience, much better writing and the overall story is better.The Silence of the Lambs is directed by Jonathan Demme and written by Ted Tally, the screenplay is a brilliant adaption from Thomas Harris' novel. The film won an Oscar for Best directing and best screenplay, also Best Picture, and I agree.
The story has Clarice Starling, a young FBI trainee who is hunting the serial killer ""Buffalo Bill"" who skins his female victims. She goes to seek the advice of the imprisoned Hannibal Lecter who were a cannibalistic serial killer before his imprisonment, to catch the serial killer known as Buffalo Bill.The screenplay is clever and perfect, with a realistic storyline throughout the whole film and the characters are well written. I absolutely love the story, it's possibly one of the best psychological horror and crime films out there. Visual storytelling is important for films in this genre, and they doesn't disappoint, phenomenal direction.
The Silence of the Lambs is a beautiful looking movie, not in how graphic it is but in how it was filmed.Clarice Starling is a well written character that deserves to be among the greatest heroes in film, Jodie Foster is a huge part of why the character works so well. She is likeable and realistic as you can easily imagine yourself in her shoes. Having a female lead worked perfectly and I couldn't see this film being as good if it was male lead. It was an award worthy performance and it was an Oscar she deserved to win, superb.
In my previous review I didn't write much about Anthony Hopkins' performance as the serial killer behind bara, Hannibal Lecter, as I didn't really feel he was the primary focus of the film. But in The Silence of the Lambs that's completely different, now I understand completely why people and critics say that this is one of the best villains in film, it's also possibly Anthony Hopkins best performance of his career, at least top 3. He won an Oscar for Best actor fair and square, if you decide to watch the movie you'll understand why it's so good. It's a memorable performance, one that will be remembered for many years.The American Film Institute ranked it the fifth-greatest and most influential thriller film, Clarice Starling and Hannibal Lecter were ranked among the greatest film heroines and villains. The film is also considered ""culturally, historically or aesthetically"" significant by the U.S. Library of Congress.
That shows how incredible The Silence of the Lambs really are, a film that acclaimed by both critics and audience. It's a movie that everyone should watch at least once in their life, I will probably re-watch it in the future.",The Silence of the Lambs

Saddly I was disappointed with Ridley Scott Hannibal.""Silence of the Lambs "" is a classic and I think people would agree. It is my number 1 favorite thriller ever made, mostly I have enjoyed Jodie Foster as FBI recruit Clarice Starling's. Jodie did a brilliant acting performance I have seen. I love this film to death I absolutely love everything about this film. Since the first time I saw her in Silence I went to seeing her in a movie theater 2002 Panic Room, it was her first film I saw in movie theater since than I love Jodie Foster but Silence will be her best film she ever made. I was disappointed with the sequel Hannibal, no Jodie Foster in it, no brilliant masterful Clarice. Julianne Moore was incompetent for me, she couldn't catch Hannibal. Clarice Starling character was based on Gillian Anderson's FBI Agent Dana Scully and I think The X-Files inspired this film. I am even convinced that The Lone Gunman three geeks were also based on this film. You have a nice shootout on the end with Clarice and Buffalo Bill and Clarice get's her man, spoils her plans saves the hostage and saves the day.The Silence of the Lambs is the 1991 thriller that was the feature film adaptation of the novel of the same name by Thomas Harris and marked the first appearance of Anthony Hopkins as Dr. Hannibal Lecter. (Oscar-winner Anthony Hopkins in one of the greatest performances ever on the screen) Dr.Hannibal ""The Cannibal"" Lecter, is a brutal killer with revolting methods and habits, but he's also very intelligent, charismatic and with good taste (you can interpret that as you like). He is scary and his the same time awesome including brilliant, you can't out smart him. Director Jonathan Demme is masterful directing this flick you have to be brilliant you have to keep thinking to solve the murder mystery. Scott Glenn acts beautiful as Jack Crawford. This flick got five major Academy Awards (""Oscars"" for Best Movie, Director, Actor, Actress, Screenplay) it is no wonder why.Plot: FBI recruit Clarice Starling (Jodie Foster) is asked by the Bureau to elicit Lecter's help in tracking down a notorious serial killer who has kidnapped a US Senator's daughter. Directed by Jonathan Demme (The Manchurian Candidate), the film would receive five Academy Awards, including Best Picture, Best Actor for Hopkins and Best Actress for Foster and Best Screenplay. Hopkins would reprise his role as Lecter in two more films: Hannibal (2001) and Red Dragon (2002).Real life killer Ed Gein was the inspiration for Buffalo Bill as well as the inspiration for Norman Bates from Psycho and Leatherface from the Texas Chainsaw Massacre movies. And the director Jonathan Demme was a film student of Roger Corman who makes a cameo in the movie. Roger Corman taught not only him, but I think other filmmakers such as Martin Scorsese, James Cameron, Joe Dante, Francis Ford Coppola, and many others. Ted Levine did a pretty solid job as a serial killer Buffalo Bill. This film is fun, intense, very well fast paced goes quickly around for those two hours.The Silence of the Lambs is a 1991 American horror-thriller film directed by Jonathan Demme and starring Jodie Foster, Anthony Hopkins, and Scott Glenn. The film is based on Thomas Harris' 1988 novel of the same name, his second to feature Hannibal Lecter, a brilliant psychiatrist and cannibalistic serial killer.In the film, Clarice Starling, a young U.S. FBI trainee, seeks the advice of the imprisoned Dr. Lecter to apprehend another serial killer, known only as ""Buffalo Bill"".This movie is a perfect 10 out of 10, it takes the vision of one of the most imaginative directors on Earth (Jonathan Demme) with a brilliant cast including Thomas Harris novel that was adapted from it. I even saw the Documentary how they were shooting this film on YouTube. I think I do have that documentary film in my Blu-ray special features. Watch this film you want be disappointed at all.The movie is incredibly suspenseful and an absolute must see for fans.",The Silence of the Lambs
166,juliankennedy23,Poor Ted Levine,10,12 May 2019,"The Silence of the Lambs: 10 out of 10: An FBI trainee Clarice Starling (Jodie Foster) is assigned by her boss (Scott Glenn) to interview Dr. Hannibal Lecter (Anthony Hopkins), a serial killer, whose insight might prove useful in the pursuit of another serial killer nicknamed ""Buffalo Bill"" (Ted Levine).In the history of the Oscars Silence of the Lambs is one of the most exceptional outliers. It went into wide release on Valentine's Day 1991 and yet swept all five major Academy Awards fourteen months later. (Best Picture, Best Actor in a Leading Role Anthony Hopkins, Best Actress in a Leading Role Jodie Foster, Best Director Jonathan Demme, Best adapted Screenplay Ted Tally).Only two other films had accomplished this before; It Happened One Night (1934) One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest (1975), and no film has achieved this since. The Silence of the Lambs was a film that kind of opened slow and gathered steam by word of mouth far away from the Oscar bait crowd. Also, The Silence of the Lambs was an R rated horror film a genre severely underrepresented by the Oscars. There is not anything else like it in Oscar history.The Good: Let us start with the acting. Anthony Hopkins runs away with the movie despite powerful performances from the other three leads. He avoids the undeniable urge to overact and chew scenery. After all, he is playing a cannibal serial killer, and a lesser actor's inclination would be more Heath Ledgers Joker than Masterpiece Theater. By not making any sudden movements and using only his voice and eyes in the opening scenes it sets the character up to be effective when he is tied to a hand truck with a Jason hockey mask covering everything but his eyes.When Hopkins finally lets loose, he has lulled us into such a state of admiration that it truly is shocking. They told us he was a vicious killer and a cannibal. They tell us of what Hopkins did to that nurse just a little while ago biting out her tongue (Director Demme lets the characters see the photo of the incident but wisely hides it from the audience) Hopkins himself told us about eating the census taker's liver with some fava beans and a nice chianti. He is still a live wire so to speak, but we are so charmed we let our guard down as an audience which makes it that more believable when the characters on screen make the same error.Jodie Foster's Oscar win was also well deserved. The script and director do her a dozen favors. The way Demme shoots his scenes reminds us just how small and vulnerable Jodie Foster is. The script has every character in the movie subtly (or not so subtly) hit on Jodie Foster's character. Even (or especially) her mentor Scott Glenn. Foster's relationship with Glenn has an undercurrent of tension whether he will risk approaching her outside of the professional bounds and honestly whether she, with her father issues, would be receptive to the same. This vulnerability makes the character work on a level rarely since in this genre. Foster's mastery of both the accent and the physical space add incredible dimension to an already fascinating character.The Ted Tally's script based on a book by Thomas Harris cheats a bit in at least one memorable scene, and it is a testament to the strength of the story that instead of being annoyed by it I applaud it. The story is complicated enough to be interesting but told in a straight forward manner that avoids talking killers (Well except for Hannibal but that is after all his thing) and those last minute reveals. The entire production has that subtle, realistic midwestern sheen and color palate that reminded me of The Fugitive movie. The movie feels almost a documentary at times as its sense of time and place are so well grounded.The Bad: Poor Ted Levine. He is the big bad in the best horror movie of the year, and no one remembers him. He was overlooked for an Oscar nomination in a year that wasn't exactly very strong (The best supporting actor category had two nominees from Warren Beatty's Bugsy and the winner was Jack Palance from City Slickers.). His flamboyant wild take on Buffalo Bill would have been the talk of the town in any other movie, but Anthony Hopkins took all the serial killer oxygen out of the room, and bluntly people forget there was another serial killer in the film.The ugly. To make matters worse for Ted Levine his character was the target of some quite serious protests. To quote Screenhub ""Gumb has a white poodle named precious, dances around wearing women's clothes and a scalp, and has had a homosexual relationship with at least one male in his past. On the surface, it seems pretty obvious that the character is a negative stereotype of the LGBT community."" As the Los Angeles Times reported in their Oscar coverage ""Threats by gay groups to disrupt the proceedings to protest the treatment of homosexuals in such films as ""The Silence of the Lambs"" did not materialize. But outside the Music Center, at least ten people were arrested during a noisy protest by hundreds of demonstrators.""Hollywood has a rich history of the gay or transvestite killer in movies from Psycho, to (1983 spoiler alert) Sleepaway Camp, to my personal favorite Gene Simmons in Never Too Young to Die. It turns out Silence of the Lambs seemed to be a breaking point for the LGBT community. There is even a story that Jonathan Demme purposely made Philidelphia after Silence of the Lambs as an apology to the LGBT community as if he was D. W. Griffith making Intolerance as an apology for Birth of a Nation.There is only one person from the original production of Silence of the Lambs who still gets asked about such things in these enlightened times. Poor Ted Levine. Here he is playing a character that everyone forgot except those that were protesting it. That Screenhub quote above isn't contemporaneous. It's from a 2018 interview with Ted, and they treat him a bit as if he was Hanoi Jane or something. (Ted's attempt to explain how his character wasn't gay digs the hole a little deeper in all fairness but seriously leave poor Ted Levine alone.)In Conclusion: The Silence of the Lambs is one of the best out and out horror films made. I know since it won a bunch of Oscars people like to call it a thriller but one character eats people, and another skins them alive and wears their skin as an outfit. I am going to go with a horror film for this one.",The Silence of the Lambs
167,SmileysWorld,One of the top acting performances ever!,9,16 January 2002,"Anthony Hopkins gives the performance of his career,not to mention one of the best ever.I rank it second only Dustin Hoffman's acting performance in Rain Man.Not since Bela Lugosi's turn in 1931's Dracula has there been such an intimidating presence on screen. The stare,the mannerisms,the ""I just might come out of here and get you"" personality displayed here was enough,and still is enough to make my blood curdle when I view it.This film is gory,it is disturbing,but it is excellent in every since of the word.Bravo to everyone involved,and this one should take a prominent place in the thriller section of anyone's home library.",The Silence of the Lambs
168,Angry_Arguer,Hannibal Lecter's America,10,6 August 2003,"The subtext of Silence of the Lambs is phenomenal considering it is the work of Jonathan Demme.  He is not a creative person, but it is a blessing that this movie lacks any subtle directorial touches.  The focus is on the actors, not the circumstances.  This is evident in Howard Shore's score, a mix of the conventional horror movie and the old school thriller.  It is not particularly pompous, but it doesn't need to be.Jodie Foster attempts to be deep, if it weren't for Demme's camera she would be nothing more than a decoration.  Her accent is just a distraction from her actions, by golly I hated it.Anthony Hopkins is the dominant feature of the entire film.  More than him, it is his character.  Hannibal is certainly one of the 10 deepest characters ever created for film, he has superseded Hopkins himself.  Notice how the camera loves Hannibal and he loves it back.  Hopkins will never be better despite recent efforts to eclipse his role.  Hollywood has tried cashing in on Hannibal Lecter's persona, but never understanding the context enough. Gore doesn't substitute for script.  The final parody, of course, is the way Demme presents America as either a victim or something hidden in a closet.  The apparition never gets to see the light of day because it is constantly being snuffed out at night by the forces of evil.  Maybe he was being prophetic in his primitive mind.Given the documentary style of the film, it is interesting how much attention is given to Jame Gumb.  Had he been absent more often, I'm certain it would've helped the suspense, but one must wonder ahead of time where the story is going.  We can guess what Clarice is going to do ahead of time, but what about Hannibal?  That is the fault of the editors, but Silence of the Lambs is certainly better edited than Batman or Empire of the Sun.  It is gruesome, not for titillation in the fashion of Friday the 13th. Rather, it is present for the sense of realism.  Might I add that this is one of the most disturbingly dark movies ever made.Overall, a well-deserving winner of Best Picture (for once I agree with the accursed Academy of fools) that stands out in its genre.  Horror will never be the same.  I would have preferred if Foster didn't have that nagging accent, but that's a small price to pay for a lack of a message in the film. Geometrically superior to its so-called 'sequels'.  4.5 out of 5 stars.",The Silence of the Lambs
169,Ruskington,The greatest horror movie ever made,10,23 August 2020,"One of those rare pieces of cinematic perfection. The Silence of the Lambs is so damn flawless, the whole horror genre should have been officially retired after it's release. Jodie Foster gives arguably the best second-best performance of all-time while Anthony Hopkins creates the most consuming and captivating villain in movie history. The fact that you cannot help but fall in love with a man who bites peoples face off is testimony to Hopkins' magnificence.",The Silence of the Lambs
170,fernandoschiavi,"The Silence of the Lambs is hailed as one of the best films in film history, pushing the boundaries of its genre and landing well in the mainstream.",10,11 October 2021,"Jonathan Demme's 1991 adaptation of Thomas Harris's psychological horror novel, The Silence of the Lambs, is hailed as one of the best films in film history, pushing the boundaries of its genre and landing well in the mainstream.In the 1990s, having a woman in front of a thriller was not very common. Silence of the Lambs is filmed entirely from the point of view of Foster's character, who challenges the male sovereignty of his work environment and training and needs to prove his competence in every blessed scene. I graduated from UVA, doctor. This isn't a beauty school. Demme is subtle in putting us in the shoes of Clarice Starling. The male characters are always talking directly to the camera or staring at it uncomfortably, while it is the agent who sustains their looks and teasing sideways. This exchange of positions places the spectator intimately connected to the protagonist's feelings, reflecting her cloying discomfort and making us her allies.And, in fact, the heroine's strength only got the proportion it deserved due to Jodie Foster's tough and resistant interpretation. Inside an elevator surrounded by men, Clarice looks up. In a room full of police officers, she raises her voice and asks everyone to leave. There is no way to compete with her protagonism. Her villains are far from limited to just psychopaths - it's Dr. Chilton reducing her beauty, it's Jack Crawford isolating her from an argument with the local police, it's every suspicious look from a co-worker. Even so, the character doesn't allow this to affect her perfect career performance; it imposes itself and makes them apologize.Interestingly, it is Hannibal who understands her and helps her in her quest for self-acceptance. The psychiatrist treats her like one of her patients, demanding personal accounts in exchange for her help in discovering Bill's whereabouts. Quid pro quo. From the duo's first meeting, it's clear who Clarice's main partner is, no matter how morbid the situation is, and Jonathan Demme squeezes his actors' talent to the hilt to make every interaction between the character's spectacular. Not that it was a difficult task - Hopkins, for example, improvised the scene that mocks Starling's southern accent, which generated a genuinely offended reaction from the actress.In the investigation against Buffalo Bill, the star of the show is the Department of Behavioral Sciences at the FBI. The inspiration for The Silence of the Lambs came from the same source as the basis for Mindhunter: interviews with serial killers conducted by John Douglas. The agent was the direct reference for the creation of Jack Crawford, even though Scott Glenn's character doesn't please him all that much. Thomas Harris, author of the book and former police reporter, followed closely the agency's routine to develop psychological profiles of criminals and arrive at its Hannibal Lecter, the starting point for portraying serial killers as contained, cool but cold figures. Extremely smart.Anthony Hopkins was not content with just acting. He investigated real personalities, visited prisons and suggested changes to Collen Atwood's costumes to make the character appear more spiritual. All the actor's precision and dedication generated results: Hannibal, the Cannibal is today one of the most striking villains in Cinema - there are those who say the most striking. His mesmerizing figure left the production scared from the first take, which was marked by whispers more akin to hissing, a glazed reptilian gaze with a minimum number of blinks and that controlled and sullen posture. No wonder, his figure is the most talked about when you think about O Silêncio dos Inocentes. Even though Hannibal works as a tool for Clarice's trajectory, her influence and sobriety lull her right away, since, according to the descriptions of others, the agent expected some kind of out of control freak like Miggs himself in the next cell. Icy and unrepentant - Hopkins admitted that the direct inspiration for her interpretation of Lecter was the 2001 HAL 9000 computer: A Space Odyssey - Clarice elicits some sympathy from the psychopath, urging him to help her while he analyzes and plays with her with their lambs. So, Clarice, have the lambs stopped screaming?Even though the balance of The Silence of the Lambs after 30 years is generally positive, Buffalo Bill's problematic representation remains a relevant agenda. Ted Levine's killer, who delivers a sixth Oscar-deserving performance for the film, kills and skins women to create his own fur clothing and, as the work itself characterizes, alters his identity. However, the use of the word transsexual is cited in the film as a doubt about Bill's condition, and despite being reinforced that the killer is not a trans person, his representation received harsh criticism from the LGBTQIA+ community - several movement activists protested on the outskirts of the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion at the 1992 Oscar ceremony against this problematic in Hollywood.Levine's character is delicately unstable, a jumble of feelings and expressions. Buffalo Bill, Jame Gumb's alter ego, has its story narrated in parallel. He deceives his victims, like young Catherine Martin, and chaotically dumps them in his basement so that their skin goes limp. However, the character's emotional out of control makes him fascinating, with Levine's pomp and outrageous screams that bespeak the unexplored depth his assassin offers. Gumb yearns for a change that will make him emerge from the cocoon as a new creature, more beautiful, freer. He doesn't notice Clarice on her trail until it's too late and, ironically, her beautiful moths are the missing piece of the agent's puzzle.Another great triumph of the production is Craig McKay's editing. There is no scene more interesting than the moments before Clarice and Jame meet. Jack Crawford guarantees: we've already got him. A prepared team circles the suspicious house, police with guns drawn await the signal. The doorbell rings. McKay and Demme play with us, and it's not SWAT waiting at the psychopath's door. The surprise is only followed by an indignant laugh. The film's final moments don't miss a beat and, after a harrowing night vision scene, Bill's arc ends in the almost majestic way the character would have liked. In another passage, in partnership with Kristin Zea's art direction and McKay's unique editing, Hannibal stars in the scene that legitimizes the film's insertion in the horror genre. McKay gives little hints of what's going to happen: the pen, the truncheon, the spray, the handcuffs. We look forward to the disaster. Trapped in a cage, like a downed bird, Dr Lecter delivers his blow. Thorough, sadistic and committed, Hannibal has fun, as if he were playing a game in which opponents are already losing. His statement is theatrical - poor cop Boyle is disemboweled as if preparing for a flight; spotlights positioning it backlight to mark the display. Fabulous cruel.Ted Tally, in developing the text, managed to map out the main aspects of Thomas Harris' novel and wisely transform them into cinematic material. Over six years of dedication to the book, the writer built his characters with caution and complexity, a detail that in the film version he was also respected. In its structure with parallels, the film features two mentors fighting with detachment, that is, Lecter and Crawford, references to Bill and Starling, also against each other, in this exquisite narrative for being mill metrically calculated in its dramatic and aesthetic development. Kristi Zea's production design, for example, is an industry that has remained based on many studies of the profiles of the killers that inspired the creation of the story. Francis Bacon, the controversial painter of human flesh, a controversial figure in the 20th century visual arts, served as a reference for some passages, in particular the scene of Hannibal Lecter's attack on the police, a passage close to the decisive moments of this narrative with orchestrated musical conduction by Howard Shore, composer of the firm, enveloping percussive texture, melancholy in some parts and terrifying in others, best soundscape in the franchise based on the literary universe created by Thomas Harris. The costumes signed by Colleen Atwood are also assertive, presenting Clarice with clothes and makeup without any shine and excesses, visually conveying the researcher's discreet, serene and solitary personality.Jonathan Demme inherited the direction of The Silence of the Lambs from Gene Hackman, who intended to command and star in the feature film. While it's an interesting exercise to try to imagine how Lecter would be played by Hackman, Demme's choices were so right that it's hard to think about this production any differently. Demme conceives images with a constant close-up presence, with a view to bringing Hannibal Lecter closer to the audience and causing a feeling of fear and discomfort. Another industry strategy was to establish the point of view so that we could follow on stage what was closest to the eyes of the heroine Starling. Many passages emulate the character's gaze and allow us to understand the story from her point of view. When at the end, in her confrontation with Buffalo Bill, she is plunged into the darkness of the antagonist's trap, we enter the same discomfort zone as the character, anguished for not knowing if she will manage to emerge alive from the horror journey established by the cornered psychopath. Still on aesthetics and visual elements, it is important to note the presence of the cat as a constant symbolic element, in addition to the moth of death, inserted in the throat of its victims as a mark of the murderer.Three decades have passed, but it could be 30 days. The world is not the same, but Jonathan Demme's masterpiece keeps tinkling, with some very well-founded scratches. The Silence of the Innocents triumphs in every way.",The Silence of the Lambs

Clarice Starling (Foster) is a student agent who is sent to interview Cannibal killer Hannibal Lecter (Hopkins). During these interviews it becomes clear that Lecter had met Bill as a patient when he worked as a psychiatrist. Will Clarice be able to get Lecter to disclose who Bill is before Bill kills again ?

172,Vivekmaru45,Was This Film Made To Boost The Career Of That Gold-digger Jodie Foster?,10,23 February 2011,"I wonder....I see Jodie Foster so many times in the film, to the point that her presence begins to really annoy me. The real star of the film is Ted Levine who didn't win anything at all. All the hard work he put into the character of Jamie Gumb a.k.a. Buffalo Bill went to waste. In short Ted Levine was robbed blind.His portrayal of the character is very realistic. When he expresses his anguish and frustration to Catherine Martin that is the greatest scene in the film. Another scene is where he is in the nude and showing of his dress, wearing lipstick and blush and exclaiming,""I'd f*ck me! I'd f*ck me really hard!"" The background score to the scene is also excellent.The other star is of course Sir Anthony Hopkins. But his characterization is dangerously misleading. Cannibals are passive. They never show emotion or anger and are quite normal-looking. It is this trait that enables them to fool their unsuspecting victim. In Michael Mann's film Manhunter, Brian Cox played Dr. Hannibal Lecktor beautifully. He was exceedingly soft spoken and polite. His victims were beautiful women who lured with his CHARM.Now Anthony Hopkins portrayed his version as rude, arrogant and psychotic. Any Hollywood actor could perform what Hopkins did in the film. Take for example actors: Jack Nicholson, W. Forsythe, Brian Dennehy, Willem Dafoe, Ed Harris etc. The list is endless....The reason why the film succeeds is mainly due to the clever direction by Jonathan Demme, photography By Tak Fujimoto and excellent music by Howard Shore.

Upon meeting him, Hannibal agrees to help Clarice solve another murder case which leads to Buffalo Bill, who killed five victims. Will Clarice catch that serial killer before it's too late?To be perfectly honest, I've never seen this film until a few months ago when it was on Netflix along with Red Dragon. Considering I'm a young adult now, I've decided to watch it and to my surprise, it's a really good film. Yes, it's pretty much disturbing, but it's also very smartly written.The scenery is beautiful to look at, the music score from Howard Shore (who would later go on to compose music for The Lord of the Rings and Hobbit trilogies), is haunting and fits the atmosphere and tone, the directing is really good, the pacing is very brisk, and the suspenseful moments are well handled. And of course, there's the great acting especially from Jodie Foster and Anthony Hopkins. Anthony did a fantastic job portraying the manipulative lunatic which makes the character very iconic to those who've seen the film back at 1991 while Jodie brought some life to Clarice as you root for her to take any risks to solve that murder case. Even Ted Levine did a superb job as serial killer Buffalo Bill.Overall, The Silence of the Lambs is not only one of the best 90's films, but it's a suspense thriller done right.

174,Jack the Ripper1888,Really good serial killer thriller. One that won't soon be forgotten.,10,4 May 2002,"This movie is one that will live in film history. After garning five Academy Awards, it began many shining careers. Scott Glenn was really good. It was nice to see him as a younger person. The same thing with Anthony Hopkins. He looked much younger (because he is). I especially enjoyed the scenes with Ted Levine who plays Buffalo Bill, the serial madman that Agent Clarice Starling (Jodie Foster) is assigned to find. I heard on some documentary and on the IMDb trivia page that Buffalo Bill was a combination of three real life killers. Ed Gein, Bundy and some other guy. I also heard that Jodie Foster was creeped out by the making of this film. Which is probably why she chose not to do the sequel, HANNIBAL. The film creates an eerie and chilling mood all by itself. It lets us know that something this sick and twisted has actually happened. All the performances in this film were great. Just about everyone I know has seen this movie. So, I would assume that if you are reading this review, that you have too. So, I'm not going to recommend that you see it. I'm going to recommend that you see it again. If you want a good scare, see this movie again. Maybe if you haven't seen it in a long time, it will creep back into your memory and scare the hell out of you. Hannibal's escape scene was classic.

176,Pedro_H,A thinking person's horror movie!,7,10 October 2004,"An FBI operative seeks the help of a convicted serial killer in the search for one still active.This film features some very good acting. Not great acting, mind you, because the roles don't involve evolving before our eyes. The characters have evolved before they hit the screen.Thomas Harris is one of the cleverest novelists around. He is both a good writer and a clever writer: Plenty of good writers write novels about subjects that don't engage the general public, but are well written and deserve to be read. They write for a small audience and, if they are lucky, sales keep the author fed, sheltered and clothed until the next one comes out.However Harris is also a clever writer in that he chooses the material of cheap thrillers (serial killers - zero points for originality!) and writes about them with the care and attention that is normally reserved for our friends in the former paragraph. The subject is taking him to the top of the ladder - not his care with words.There is something slightly bizarre a-foot here. This is a film based on cheap thrills and tension, which I could live with if the reviewers (of all colours) weren't so precious about it all.This film takes a lot of time and trouble over minor details and yet major plot lines are clearly S-T-U-P-I-D. Actors sit in on FBI lessons to learn technique and procedure then Agent Starling goes and visits Lector ON HER OWN!(Yes isn't it amazing how quickly common-sense - no matter the FBI rule book - is thrown away when it gets in the way of an easy tension device!)There is a lot right with this film and a lot wrong with it too. Thrillers have no other role other than thrill and thrill it does, but I hate the authors coded references that only he and a few PhDs/crime authors can understand. Private jokes are snobbery.(I am glad that IMDb have a trivia section for this movie it answered a lot of my questions. With Harris every ""stray"" phrase has a story behind it.)Killer Lector is a bit like Huggy Bear in Starsky and Hutch. He knows everything about everything and it is a shame he is not the policeman because all serious crime would be solved in five minutes! Yes we have to have some device for throwing these people together (however silly), but how does he know all this info from his well guarded cell. Is he on some private ""serial killer"" bulletin board?(""Hey guys - that woman that was sliced up in to six pieces in Houston -- that was me...."")A lot of people got a lot of enjoyment from this film and I thought it was quite good too, but it is also slightly sick. The subject matter is worthy of our attention, but I am uneasy about it being served up as ""great art"" and given Oscars.This about as much ""great art"" as the musical Grease. Take away the horror movie stunts (or film them in a more benign way) and it would have flopped at the box office.Also to be noted is that this is a ""strong woman"" picture - if Agent Starling was a man most women would have marked it a point or two lower than they have.

178,perfectbond,Outstanding suspense thriller,9,27 December 2002,"Silence of the Lambs is a truly memorable suspense thriller which deservedly won the Oscar for best picture and Oscars for Hopkins and Foster. The best scenes are the ones with Hopkin's Lecter especially when he is conversing with Foster's Starling. Hopkins internalizes wonderfully throughout, and, wisely, he and director Jonathan Demme avoid taking his character over the top. Highly recommended, 9/10.",The Silence of the Lambs
179,jdkraus,Phenomenal!,10,26 March 2007,"I may have come late in seeing ""Silence of the Lambs"" and now seeing it, I can only give high marks of praise.The Acting: I was never really a Jodie Foster fan, but seeing her in this, I was blown away by her acting talent. She was smart, emotional, and I have to say figuratively and literally beautiful as Clarice Stirling. Anthony Hopkins shines the film as one of the best villains in Hollywood history as the cannibal, Hannibal Lector. He was simply brilliant: cunning, intelligent, and cruel. Whenever these two thespians were on camera, even though they were in only a handful of scenes together, they brought the film to life at an engulfing level that made me feel inside the film! The other cast member that was also amazing was Ted Levine, who played the lunatic Buffalo Bill. He also shined the film! The other cast members were also well-suited and believable in their roles.The film-making: This is now doubt Johnathan Demme's best and most memorable film. From the opening shots of following Clarice accomplishing the FBI training grounds, to the intense talks between Dr. Lecter and Clarice, and to the climatic finale in the dark basement of Buffalo Bill's lair, the film pumped my heart and soul with excitement. The haunting score by the famous Howard Shore also added to the suspense.Other remarks: The film flew by with no time for dillydallying like many other films have a tendency of doing, and the story was solid with no plot holes. The editing was a little choppy in the first half hour, but there's no room for complaints there. Overall, this film, I consider is among the best movies ever made. It is not only a physiological thriller, as many believe it is, but it also holds secrets and other genres to its own.""The Silence of the Lambs"" is one of my top ten favorite movies. 10/10 If I could, I'd give it an eleven or twelve!",The Silence of the Lambs

Film deserves props for the chemistry between Foster and Hopkins, as well as a chilling scene with Levin instructing his prisoner (Brooke Smith) to rub lotion on her skin ""or else it gets the hose again"".

183,moviesleuth2,One of the most infamous thrillers ever to take home an Oscar,8,2 April 2010,"There are many films out there with a reputation of being able to scare the living hell out of a viewer, but there is perhaps none as notorious as ""The Silence of the Lambs."" This is a demented and frightening motion picture, and that's the bottom line.FBI trainee Clarice Starling (Jodie Foster) is assigned to do a psychological profile of a notorious serial killer, the brilliant and insane former psychologist, Dr. Hannibal Lecter (Anthony Hopkins). Her boss, Jack Crawford (Scott Glenn) hopes that Lecter will be attracted to Starling's innocence, and help them catch a new serial killer, dubbed ""Buffalo Bill."" But Lecter won't do this for free, and the question becomes whether Starling is able to hold herself together against the evil doctor.This film works as well as it does because it is crafted so well. Had the direction and the acting been pedestrian, this would be just another movie. However, Director Jonathan Demme is interested in exploring his characters and inviting us into the minds of these characters. People call this a horror movie, and that's not true. This is a psychological thriller in its purest form, and the violence and fear that the film generates is due to this exploration. To do this, Demme uses a lot of close-ups so that we can study their facial features, which allows us to understand their emotions on a physical level. This is applying to our basic instincts, and it works; it allows us a deeper understanding of the characters.However, Demme's skill only goes so far; it's up to the actor's to take up the rest of the slack. And the performances by its two stars make a rather unique story into a legendary excursion into fear.Everyone knows his name. Hannibal Lecter, or more by his nickname, Hannibal the Cannibal. Lecter is the personification of evil, and there is no character more frightening than the chilling psychopath played by Anthony Hopkins. Hopkins uses his eyes (he seldom blinks) and his voice to chill us to the very bone. When he walks, it's slow and methodical. Being inside a caged cell does not stop him from looking at the person outside (which from the camera position, is usually us) feel like we are being stalked by a predator. Surprisingly, in this film, Lector is only on screen for 16 minutes, yet the impact of his performance is permanent. Few performances have been more justly rewarded than Hopkins as Hannibal Lecter.His counterpart, Clarice Starling, is portrayed by Jodie Foster, who it seems doesn't know how to give a bad performance. Foster is brilliant as the spunky trainee. She's in over her head, but her determination to solve the case and keep her psyche in one piece makes her a perfect match for Lecter, something they both realize. Although Hopkins gets all the credit, Foster's brilliant performance makes him even better than Hopkins could by himself. Both of their performances compliment each other well, which elevates the project from solid into brilliant. The other actors are effective, but Foster and Hopkins are the ones that really make the film what it is.This isn't a flawless movie; quite frankly, it's just not as frightening as its legend suggests, and the psychological explorations of the characters by critics and the actors make the film promise something that it doesn't have. This is simply a superbly executed thriller, one that relies on character to succeed instead of special effects.Nevertheless, this film will scare you (the climax is genuinely terrifying). And it introduces us (to the definitive interpretation at least...Brian Cox played the role in ""Manhunter"" in the 80s) to one of cinema's most notorious characters. That alone is reason enough to see this film.",The Silence of the Lambs
184,jp_91,A work of cinematographic art!,10,31 October 2021,"""The Silence of the Lambs"" is the smartest horror-thriller ever filmed, with a spectacular screenplay based on the novel of the same name written by Thomas Harris, which in turn was based on the American serial killer Edward Theodore ""Ed"" Gein (for the character Jame ""Buffalo Bill"" Gumb) and in the Mexican murderer Alfredo Ballí Treviño (for the character Hannibal Lecter). The script masterfully adapted by Ted Tally plays with suspense, mystery and horror in a way never before matched, touching on subjects of psychology and criminology. The performances of Jodie Foster, Anthony Hopkins and Ted Levine are superb, leaving their characters as icons of cinema and pop culture around the world. Tak Fujimoto's cinematography is a visual enchantment, the music composed by Howard Shore is an aural delight, and Jonathan Demme's cinematographic direction is a marvel that has no equal. ""The Silence of the Lambs"" is the only horror film in history to win an Oscar in the category of Best Film of the Year, being since 1991 a film that became an instant classic. 30 years later, Hannibal Lecter continues to be an icon of horror that makes an impression on audiences.

185,Maniac-9,Anthony Hopkins as Hannibal Lecter = amazing,10,3 March 2012,"Anthony Hopkins gives one of the absolute best movie performance ever as Dr. Hannibal Lecter, like he was born to play the role. Even though Brian Cox played the role earlier in Manhunter a prequel to Silence of the Lambs(which Hopkins later re-did in Red Dragon), but Hopkins just makes you think no else should've ever attempted to play this role other then me. Since no one else is ever going to do as good at the role so even trying to do so is a futile effort.Jodie Foster starred as young FBI agent Clarice Starling who goes to the facility that Lecter is being held to interview him to get help find another serial killer, Buffalo Bill.Silence of the Lambs is one of the few movies to win the Academy Awards for Best Picture, Best Director(Jonathan Demme), Best Actor(Hopkins) and Best Actress(Foster).One of the best suspense movies ever made.",The Silence of the Lambs
186,movieguy1021,The Silence of the Lambs: 8/10,8,17 August 2004,"I think it's gotten to the point where most people don't really care about the Academy Awards anymore, because they're not for individual achievements, but for appreciating an actor or a film because it cost a lot of money. But back before those days, when the Oscars meant something, it was a huge honor to win the five major Academy Awards-picture, actor, actress, director, and screenplay. The Silence of the Lambs is the third, and most recent, one to do that. Jodie Foster and Anthony Hopkins won acting awards, Jonathan Demme won the directing award, and Ted Tally won for best adapted screenplay. Was it deserving for all of those awards? For the most part, more or less.Hannibal Lecter (Hopkins), a serial killer/cannibal who has the identity and the whereabouts of notorious serial killer Buffalo Bill (Ted Levine), is being interviewed by rookie FBI agent Clarice Starling (Foster) for information on Bill. But Lecter's more cunning and demented than first glance, and has fun playing with the mind of Starling as she's interviewing him.Since I don't really know what to say about this movie, I'll go my fail-safe way and go over each award it won and why it should have won for that reason. The screenplay, based off of the book by Thomas Harris, has a slow build-up (one that originally turned me off), but as soon as Lecter is introduced, it's paid off. The script takes us inside of the head of Lecter, making him one of the most interesting celluloid characters of the 1990s. The screenplay also doesn't really waste that much time with unimportant characters, although a little more on Jack Crawford would have been nice. But the screenplay is tight and holds together well, throughout the hit-or-miss directing career of Demme.Demme won an Oscar for best directing. I have mixed feelings about this one. On one hand, many scenes in Lambs aren't boring, but not really that exciting or involving. He does have some good style (I love that night-vision scene), and does build up some good suspense as the movie comes to a close. The suspense is laid on thick at the end, and I suppose it makes up for the still entertaining but not thrilling rest of the movie. Demme does set up some mystery, too, as we follow Clarice's adventures. There are also some very disturbing scenes (""It rubs the lotion on the skin or else it gets the hose again!""), which fit in with the tone of most of the movie. Disturbing, yes, but actually impacting? Not really.Both Foster and Hopkins won acting Oscars for leading roles. Foster's character, as I said before, began as being annoying to me, but soon became a person I could tolerate. But was she deserving of an Oscar? A nomination is even a stretch, mainly because of that awful accent of hers. Hopkins was great, but with total screentime being around 16 minutes, he was more of a supporting actor (although, I guess the awards were crooked then. They wanted to give an award to both Jack Palance for City Slickers and Hopkins, but they were both supporting roles). I think we got the gist of Hannibal in those 16 minutes, and Hopkins put in a memorable performance in that time.Lastly, Lambs won best picture. Is it the best picture of 1991? I'm not sure, I haven't seen every film from 1991. But it's a damn good one.My rating: 8/10Rated R for language, violence, and disturbing themes.",The Silence of the Lambs
187,Min111,It's a thriller movie,10,31 March 2020,"I've seen way too many thriller movies, and 'The Silence of the Lambs' was one of them. When it comes to movie genres, 'thriller' movies happen to be my very favourite. This was a very good movie to watch. This movie was made on the year I was born, so it makes it that extra more special.I would say this movie, The Silence of the Lamb, was on the same level as movies such as Seven and Copycat, with Copycat being one of the more underrated ones. I know this is 'The Silence of the Lamb' review, but Copycat was a seriously good movie, and on par with these other movies. You'd be surprised just how similar and good it is. You should check Copycat out. It's a very good 'thriller' movie along with Seven and The Silence of the Lambs. All three of these movies are great 'thriller' movies.The Silence of the Lambs though was a masterpiece. It happens to be one of my favourite movies, and watched it a countless number of times along with some of the other ones.The start of the movie, where the FBI agent, Clarice Starling, was training outside at the academy was a great introduction. I have never seen a introduction like that before in any of the movies I have seen. The start of the movie was great, and from there, it didn't disappoint.In this movie, Clarice Starling, who is still a trainee, is tasked to finding, searching and capturing a serial killer or madman named 'Buffalo Bill' who happens to be a psychopath. He suffers from a severe form of Anti-Social Personality Disorder. She asks for assistance, though, from one of the psychopaths located and imprisoned in an asylum called 'Dr Hannibal Lecter', a former psychiatrist, in capturing Buffalo Bill, who happens to skin his female victims. Clarice Starling has a challenging task in bringing and taking down this 'Buffalo Bill' while keeping 'Dr Hannibal Lecter' at bay.What I liked about 'Clarice Starling' was her character. I have never seen a character quite like her before, especially a female one. She's very attractive. She's very keen on her job, and looks very determined in the task in hand, and ultimately, bringing down Buffalo Bill.I liked all the training sequences 'Clarice Starling' was undergoing at the academy. She sort of inspires you or someone to undertake a job or career like hers. It's a dream career - working for the FBI. I would like to have a career like that.Jack Crawford was also interesting, and I like how he leads the charge in this operation. Let's not forget the rest of the team.This movie, The Silence of the Lambs, was a very interesting one. You have to be very attentive to what actually happens in this movie, and may need to watch it at least few times to get a true picture of what this movie is really about.What I found most interesting were the 'interactions' between Dr Hannibal Lecter and Clarice Starling. It was hard to predict what was going to happen during those interactions. Sometimes, those interactions between the two was scary. It looks as if something was about to happen.If you are watching this movie for the first time, and reading this review, I would advise to try turning your volume-up on your television just for the suspense. It's a thriller movie after all, and that's what thriller movies are all about. It's about keeping you at the very edge of your seat.That's how great ""The Silence of the Lambs"" really is - it's a thriller! One of the greatest thriller movies ever made. Certainly, the greatest thriller movie of the nineties. That's what I think. What about you?It's a different movie when you see this though the second and third time.It's the plot or story that's more interesting more than anything when you see this again more than the suspense itself. The suspense is already lost.The Silence of the Lamb is a great thriller movie for anyone, especially if you're into crime. There aren't too many crime movies as good as The Silence of the Lambs. The only ones I can think of are the ones I mentioned above (Copycat and Seven).Aside from the suspense itself, it's a movie you could watch repeatedly. That's why 'The Silence of the Lambs' happens to be one of my favourite movies.",The Silence of the Lambs

Demme's use of close-ups are there to put you in the face of the horror that is serial killing. Hopkins performance is a stand-out one, although I didn't care for Jodie Foster's performance much at all. Foster's southern accent sounded forced and slurry. This film is tight though and at 118 minutes it never seems to be long or drawn out.

The management does not seem very good, but the opposite, if it is true that entertains and does not bore, but if you do not realize that it abuses those plans, bad.The picture is quite normal, although at times it is quite good.If it is true that it has a huge setting.

Ted Levine also gives a very weird, but excellent performance as Buffalo Bill.Buffalo Bill, a woman killing transvestite, is kidnapping, killing and skinning young women. Agent Starling is assigned to gather information from Dr. Hannibal Lector who might provide insight into the mind of a psychopath. But the only way he will give her any information is for her to feed him details of her personal life.This movie succeeds in all it sets out to do. Some scenes are very chilling and disturbing (especially the ending), which helps make a very uncomfortable atmosphere. The scenes with Hannibal and Clarice are very tense.

It's 2 hours long but it doesn't feel that way because of how engaging the story and characters are. A huge reason why this film succeeds are the performances. Jodie Foster is absolutely fantastic as Clarice Starling and managed to garner herself an Academy Award for it. However, one person who makes this film really memorable is Anthony Hopkins as Hannibal Lecter. With less than 20 minutes of screen time, Hopkins' portrayal of Lecter is phenomenal. His tone, expressions and way of delivering dialogues is very unsettling which makes Lecter one of the creepiest villians to ever exist.Apart from the performances, The Silence of the Lambs is exceptionally well made. Jonathan Demme's direction is terrific. Ted Tally's screenplay is filled with excellent dialogue that fleshes out each character to the fullest. The editing is really good. There isn't a single dull moment and the dark tone is consistent throughout which keeps you on the edge of your seat. Tak Fujimoto's cinematography creates such an eerie atmosphere to the world it's set in and the camerawork is filled with excellent shot choices. Whenever Clarice and Hannibal are together, the use of close-ups is applied effectively as it heightens the intensity of the scene. My only issue is the lighting during the night vision scene at the end but it's a very minor flaw that can be overlooked.The Silence of the Lambs is a 2 hour thriller that keeps you on the edge of your seat.

198,PIST-OFF,A study in building up a character as a bad ass,10,10 January 2006,"If silence of the lambs didn't do anything else right (in fact it did everything right) it would serve as the perfect example of how to build up a character as a bad ass. The secret is perfectly on display. All the rules are followed. Screen time for Hannibal Lecter is kept to a minimum, at just under sixteen minutes. This utter lack of screen time which build the anxiety necessary to the character subsequently was ignored in the sequels and the result is that Hannibal falls victim to the Freddie Krueger effect where your sympathies begin to cynically side with him, thus underplaying the currents of the movie. All great heroes and villains must follow this rule in order to be considered true movie bad asses. Think Darth Vader, or Clint Eastwood in unforgiven, or Micheal Madsen as Mr blonde in reservoir dogs. The second rule is to have you're bad ass doing things decidedly not bad ass, i.e. Eastwood getting beat up in unforgiven, and here Hannibal is mostly a caged animal. The third rule is to have other characters reference the potential violence your bad ass can unleash. Here, numerous characters talk about just how bad Hannibal is, and in a masterstroke, doctor Chilton shows a picture to Jodie Foster, that the audience never sees. This is like the scene in reservoir dogs, where the audience's imagination are encouraged to imagine the most horrific things.

I think I already saw this type of movie before, no matter what the plot is about the idea is similar to other movies. So I don't know if I enjoyed this movie as much as I expected it or if I feel disappointed but all in all this was a movie full of great moments that are worth calling it a horror movie.",The Silence of the Lambs

Good direction (except a few cheap shots), good actors, captivating atmosphere.What I didn't like, mainly, is that it seems the script is kind of rushed, especially at the end: I felt that the screenplay was unfolding too fast, resulting in a few easinesses. The movie really could have used an extra 30 minutes to properly resolve the plot.Another thing, not a real flaw actually, but I thought Lecter's character was more interesting than Gumb's, supposedly the main target.

The layers to all developments as well as the depth of themes in each interaction make the book and movie exceptional. Foster and Hopkins do phenomenal jobs in their roles, and it is a well-directed movie. I don't think it's at all a scary movie or really thrilling, aside from the climactic scene in Gumb's house, but perhaps that's because I knew the plot from the book.

206,FrenchEddieFelson,A thrilling must see,9,10 August 2019,"I just saw, for the second or third time, this cinematographic masterpiece, during an « UGC culte » evening, in Paris. The list of the Big Five Academy Award winners is short. There are currently three of them, in nine decades: It Happened One Night (1934), One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest (1975) and ... The Silence of the Lambs (1991). This is not really surprising, this film being excellent, endowed with a script skillfully elaborated by Thomas Harris, with an irreproachable casting including Anthony Hopkins, Jodie Foster and Scott Glenn. In addition, the director Jonathan Demme delivers a work obviously enjoying an admirable preparatory work.Without unduly spoiling the script, if you have not seen it yet, by the greatest fluke: a psychopath known as the Buffalo Bill sows terror in the Middle West by kidnapping and murdering young pulpy women, after partially or completely skinning them. Clarice Starling, a young FBI agent, is in charge of interviewing Hannibal Lecter, a well-known former psychiatrist who has also the characteristic of a truly intelligent psychopath focused on cannibalism. Hannibal Lecter is able to provide Clarice Starling with providential information about Buffalo Bill . But he agrees to help her only in exchange for information about the young woman's private life. Between them is established a link of fascination and repulsion.As a synthesis: a thrilling must see. 9/10 of 10",The Silence of the Lambs
207,JoelChamp85,"""I'm Crying Over You...""",10,10 April 2021,"Powerful performances and a strong story make this film timeless. This whole world of serial killers knowing serial killers is fascinating, the way Hannibal observes other fellow killers is quite intelligent. I sometimes wonder how the writer came up with the details so vividly, and for filmmakers to take those ideas from novel format and transfer to film so well is a great achievement.

208,CinematicInceptions,Intensely interesting thriller.,8,16 October 2015,"I felt like this was a bit over-hyped, but not overrated. I know those sound like the exact same thing, so I'll explain myself. The overall quality of the movie was about what I'd been led to believe it would be, but it didn't come in the way I had expected. Pretty much everything I'd heard about this movie before seeing it had something to do with Hannibal Lecter. Now, he's definitely a noteworthy and intriguing character, but not as much as his reputation seems to give him credit for. On the other hand, the serial killer plot with Buffalo Bill was more interesting than I thought it would be. Fortunately, this combination made it so that I wasn't disappointed by the hype, but that is something to be conscious of if you have high expectations for this movie, or any for that matter.I won't go into too much detail with the plot to reduce spoilers. The external plot with Buffalo Bill is the most prominent, and has a good progression that will surprise the audience at times and likely won't confuse them so long as they pay attention. Hannibal Lecter is important to this plot since he gives Clarice information about Buffalo Bill, but his pathological nature takes prevalence whenever he is on screen. If you're somebody who has a hard time following complex plots, I would recommend doing a little preliminary research on the plot beyond watching the trailer. And if you are one of those people but think this will be the movie where you are ""really going to latch on to every detail"", keep working at it, but be honest with yourself and don't be afraid to ask a friend or blogger or FAQ page. It's not necessary to do that, but I think it will improve your experience and it's something I wish I had done.Our protagonist is an FBI agent-in-training, Clarice Starling. She's confident in her abilities, but also aware of her youth and inexperience in the field. Both of these qualities are brought forward by the probing, vampiric, and insidious Hannibal Lecter, who seems to feed on people's souls as much as he does their bodies. He's got a lot of the qualities we love in our psychological villains in his ability to overcome the authority controlling him and the way he makes people like they are more prisoner than he is. I rather wish we got a closer look at how he deals with people he doesn't respect since Clarice seems to be one of the rare people that interest him. We see Buffalo Bill from a bird's-eye view, much as Clarice does. Most of what we/she know about him are based on second-hand accounts or evidence. Fortunately, the buildup of his off-screen reputation proves not to be disappointing in the few scenes where we see him at work. He seems to be quite as interesting a character as Lecter, though in a less psychological way. The second-tier characters consist of Dr. Chilton and Clarice's superior Jack Crawford. They're developed somewhat impressively for minor characters and have a decent amount of screen time and plot relevance.I didn't find the acting hugely impressive, though the dialogue ranks among some of the better material I've come across. The directing is pretty good, creating suspense effectively throughout. The couple of action sequences might not have come off well in a strictly action movie, but since this is a thriller it worked just fine.Regardless of your genre preference, I would recommend that pretty much everyone give this a try, unless you're an extremely casual movie fan that likes to watch movies passively. Otherwise, there aren't many reasons not to watch it. There aren't really any disgustingly disturbing images like you might expect, though it is certainly an intense film. It won't be as appealing to modern audiences, but don't let it's age turn you away. Just be willing to pay attention and you should be able to enjoy it. Overall Rating: 8.5/10.",The Silence of the Lambs
209,jhaggardjr,Brilliantly acted thriller,9,24 February 2001,"Even though it's been 10 years since this film came out, ""The Silence of the Lambs"" is a movie that I still can't believe won the Oscar for Best Picture of 1991. This is the kind of movie that Academy voters usually don't go for, and it was released in February of that year. Movies released very early in the year hardly ever win Oscar's top prize. But in another way I can see why this film went on the become the third movie in Oscar history to win the top 5 Oscars (the other two were 1934's ""It Happened One Night"" and 1975's ""One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest""). It's a very well made and brilliantly acted suspense-thriller. Jodie Foster has never been better in her second Best Actress Oscar-winning performance of her great career (following her first, 1988's ""The Accused"") as Clarice Starling, an FBI trainee who goes to visit Dr. Hannibal Lecter (Best Actor Anthony Hopkins), a very smart man who has a nasty habit of eating human flesh (Yuck!). Starling hopes that Dr. Lecter can provide information for her and her FBI team in catching a serial killer who likes to skin his victims, and at the moment has kidnapped the daughter of a senator. ""The Silence of the Lambs"" is a movie that is quite disturbing to watch at times. Some of the images are ugly and downright horrifying. But those two performances by Foster and Hopkins make this movie as good as it is. I couldn't take my eyes off of them everytime they were on screen. ""The Silence of the Lambs"" certainly held my attention, and I would have to say of all the five movies nominated for Best Picture of 1991 (the other nominees were ""Beauty and the Beast"", ""Bugsy"", ""JFK"", and ""The Prince of Tides""), this one is definitely the best.***1/2 (out of four)",The Silence of the Lambs
210,nickenchuggets,"""...Or else it gets the hose again""",9,15 October 2021,"If I had to pick a relatively recent movie that gets mistaken for something it's not more times than any other, I would probably choose this one. Even though Silence of the Lambs is frequently labeled as a horror film, I don't think this is entirely correct. Don't get me wrong, there's still several disturbing parts throughout it and the story itself is unsettling, but to me, this more closely resembles a crime movie with horror elements in the background. Probably the biggest reason this is mostly called a horror movie is because if you count it as such, it is the only horror film to ever win an oscar for best picture. The Exorcist and Jaws were nominated, but never won. Despite my comments on how this is more of a crime/drama film than horror, the horror element becomes apparent almost immediately because of one of the characters featured. The story follows a rookie working for the FBI named Clarice Starling (Jodie Foster) who is encountering much difficulty trying to find a serial killer known only as Buffalo Bill who has been abducting women and flaying their corpses. Clarice seems to understand that trying to comprehend the mind of a psychopath is like learning to tie a knot: you have to know how to tie one to untie it. If she can find a (less maniacal) serial killer and interview him, she might find out how Buffalo Bill's thought process works and predict where he'll show up next. To this end, Clarice is tasked with visiting the infamous Hannibal Lecter (Anthony Hopkins), a bloodthirsty madman who was once respected in the field of psychiatry. Now, he's a crazed murderer who eats other human beings. What makes Lecter so disturbing is how non-threatening he appears to be. He doesn't resemble a killer at all, at least not externally. He speaks in a very calm and patient manner with Clarice while discussing how to find Bill. After Clarice leaves Hecter's cell block, she's on the search for more evidence. Soon, a corpse of a young woman is found with several lacerations and skin mutilations indicative of Buffalo Bill's crimes. Strangely, a moth cocoon is found in her esophagus. Later on, we see how a seemingly innocent man acting too innocently for his own good asks a girl named Catherine (a senator's daughter) to help him place a heavy piece of furniture in the rear of his van. As she steps into the vehicle to make loading it easier, the guy (later shown to be Bill) assaults her and locks her inside. As she's driven to an unknown location, Clarice gets new orders to pressure Lecter into giving up more information on Buffalo Bill. As bait, she is told to tell him that he will be switched to a new prison if he complies. Lecter rejects the offer and will only give up the details if Clarice gives up secretive information about her own life. Lecter is moved to a cell in Tennessee where he tells the mother of the kidnapped Catherine that Bill's real name is Louis, but it's all nonsense. Clarice meets with Lecter again, who gives her a dossier on Bill. This time, the trust she puts in him does actually pay off and provide details, but Lecter has other ideas. The same day he meets with Clarice, he kills and mutilates his cell guards and then escapes via an ambulance after he switches costumes with a cop the paramedics thought was dead. Now that Lecter is free, Clarice is starting to feel the pressure even more. She eventually tracks Bill down to a house in Ohio after discovering his real name is Jame Gumb. At first, he seems like a stable, moderate person who has nothing wrong with him, but his body language obviously shows he's hiding something. A very awkward dialogue between him and Clarice follows, in which she determines he is Buffalo Bill after spotting a moth identical to the one placed in the mouth of the murdered woman from earlier. After a gunfight taking place in a huge and dark basement, Clarice kills Jame and discovers Catherine, who has been imprisoned in a large hole the entire time. Back at the FBI base, Clarice receives a celebration for her efforts, but one last ominous thing happens to her. Lecter calls her from a remote location, and says he's not going to bother killing her even though he's able to because the world is more interesting with her in it. He also hopes she'll leave him alone too, but Clarice can't comply with that. Lecter hangs up once he declares ""he's having a friend for dinner."" Movies like this make me realize how you don't need special effects or mindless action to make a compelling experience. What Silence of the Lambs does well is build tension. The audience is already aware of the fact that Lecter is a monster who deserves to be executed, but Clarice has no choice but to trust him so that she can stop another killer (the enemy of my enemy is my friend). Speaking of Lecter, Anthony Hopkins is the one who carries most of the movie. Despite only appearing for a combined time of around 24 minutes, he's so creepy you can't take your eyes off him. The reasons for this are obvious. Lecter may be a fictional character, but people like him do exist. The most terrifying murderers are the ones who don't feel the need to raise their voices, and he nails this performance. He's also not to be underestimated. You might think that a person with such a violent and grisly past must not be very intelligent, but Lecter is a highly adept and imposing man. He understands perfectly well what methods the cops are going to use to track him down, because he used to study the human mind. Jodie Foster as Clarice is obviously the person we are made to cheer for, as she is risking her life to track down a vicious killer as well as dealing with another madman who can end her life if he felt like it. So as you might expect, the acting in this movie is all good. Even George Romero makes an appearance after Lecter is transferred. Even though I like this movie, I have seen many saying it is overrated. That I can entirely understand. Many people don't think the performances of the two leading actors were oscar-worthy, even though acting well is a very hard thing to do. Lecter doesn't even appear that much in the movie but ended up being the most iconic thing about it. People who watched this soon found out why.",The Silence of the Lambs
211,baileycrawly,Solid Thriller,6,3 November 2020,"The Silence of the Lambs, while imperfect, is a pretty decent thriller. It's a major slow-burn, which is a turn-off for a lot of people, but it's well worth it to stick it through to the end.
The majority of this film involves detective work in an effort to track down a killer by the name of Buffalo Bill before he can kill the latest in a series of young women gone missing that have all been suspected to be him. A young student is thrust into the heart of the action, first interviewing Lecter directly in an effort to get him to talk and then, unwittingly, being in the middle of everything.I have a few issues with this movie. Sure, the last 20 minutes are heart-pounding tension, but the buildup to get there is just a little bit too much. The film is bulky, and because of that it really drags a couple of times throughout. There are moments you just want to skip past to get to ""the good stuff,"" which is never a good look for a film. This very easily could've been condensed to an 85-90-minute film without making it noticeably poorer. The second issue is the fact that no student would ever be given access to such risky and potentially dangerous subject matter. It's just not realistic. This film uses the concept of transsexualism and gender reassignment as a point of shock-based humour, which absolutely doesn't age well today and only serves to paint the film in a disrespectful light by today's standards.Overall, it's a pretty solid film. A great thriller, but a lousy and bloated horror film. With a little bit of the fat trimmed off the meat (no pun intended), this film would be much more comfortable to slip into (pun intended). It's award-winning and it's certainly cemented it's position in cinematic history (rightfully so) but it's just not something I can see myself giving repeat viewings to.",The Silence of the Lambs
212,SKG-2,Unusual horror film,10,15 March 1999,"I'm not an expert in the horror genre, but I do know the reputation it earned thanks to the ""slasher"" films which were so prevalent in the 70's and 80's, which could be described by the ""M"" word; misogynistic.  THE SILENCE OF THE LAMBS is one of those rare horror films(hell, one of those rare films) which features a strong heroine who's also believable.  And Jodie Foster is the perfect actress to play it, conveying all the strength, toughness, resourcefulness, and vulnerability of Clarice Starling.  And while ""Buffalo Bill"" may kill women, none of the women portrayed in the film, from Brooke Smith as the one in the pit, to Diane Baker as her senator mother, and Kasi Lemmons as Clarice's partner, are seen as just victims (even Smith, once she gets over her initial terror, tries to fight back).  It's one of those rare things, a feminist horror film.Of course, Jonathan Demme and Ted Tally, working from the novel by Thomas Harris (the best thriller novel of the 80's) do remember this is a horror film as well, and give us THE most terrifying villain of the 90's.  No, not Buffalo Bill, though Ted Levine is effective in the role, but Dr. Hannibal""the Cannibal"" Lecter, played to mesmerizing perfection by Anthony Hopkins.  Hopkins said one of the ways he tried to create Lecter's effect was trying not to blink, and that certainly does the trick.  But he also uses his voice, his lack of body movement, and his face to create terror, and while he pretends to give away nothing, in fact, without meaning to, betrays feelings for Clarice (just look at the look of sadness he has before he tells Clarice Dr. Chilton has come for her before he can give her what she needs to catch Buffalo Bill).Yet while Demme is quite good at the horror, he avoids the mistake most serial killer works have made today, and that's being too clinical.  People get so wrapped up in the science that they forget about the human beings who are turned into these monsters, and who are killed by them.  He also avoids being overly lurid; most of the actual violence occurs off-screen, and in the one case (the jail cell) where it doesn't,  we don't have big close-ups of the victims, but mostly shots of Lecter, which is frightening enough.By the way, two misconceptions to clear up; first of all, this film does not glorify Lecter.  It merely recognizes that sometimes, when you have to fight evil, you have to confront it.  Secondly, when this film was released, there were complaints that it was a homophobic film.  Buffalo Bill is not gay, and it states clearly that he was rejected when he tried to have a hospital make him a transsexual, so his behavior, not his desire, is what is portrayed as abhorrent.",The Silence of the Lambs
213,PeachHamBeach,Truly mesmorizing,10,7 September 1999,"This movie is one I can watch over and over and never get sick of.  As a matter of fact,  after all these years,  there are still parts that I don't understand fully.  I love movies that take me a long time to figure them out!!!  I don't have the intellect required to just give a rundown on what it's about,  except that it's a facinating,  sophisticated,  brilliant psychological thriller (not a horror movie by any standards).  It is terrifying but not because of blood,  violence or gore.  Rather,  it chills you to the bone with what is unseen and unknown.  Jodie Foster (an actress of unmatched intensity and one-of-a-kind performances) stars as Clarice Starling,  an FBI trainee who is just a week away from becoming a full-fledged agent.  At the request of Behavior Field Science agent Jack Crawford (Scott Glenn),  Starling travels to a Baltimore psychiatric hospital to meet renowned serial murderer and former psychiatrist Hannibal Lecter (Sir Anthony Hopkins) hoping to gain insight on how to crack unsolved serial murder casees.  From the moment they meet,  their relationship is riveting,  separated by differing values and a sheet of glass,  yet united in eerily intimate ways.  It's this intimacy that leads to an offer made by Lecter to Starling,  an offer that might be the chance of a lifetime for Starling to make a difference,  to save a life.  This movie is enormously entertaining,  but it's also intellectually stimulating and challenging, and not very many movies are like that to me.  Presently,  The Sixth Sense is a well-done addition to this few and far between genre,  though not quite as frightening as ""Lambs"".  I credit a lot of the chill factor of this movie to Hopkins,  whose soft-spoken eloquence only served to enhance the undeniable evil Lecter represented.  The lighting in the cell made his usually soulful blue eyes seem fish-like and lifeless,  as if to transmit to the viewer the absence of soul and morality.  Excellent work!!! ****",The Silence of the Lambs
214,markovd111,Almost a perfect movie!,9,1 July 2020,"I liked the movie. Main character is good and Anthony Hopkins is great as Hannibal, but without him, Foster can't carry the movie on her own. Movie needed more time for us viewers to learn about her even more than we did. This is more a movie about Clarice and Hannibal and ""silencing the lambs"" than a movie about catching a killer. And I'm OK with it. But I feel the movie is too short to give us a perfect view of it's plot centered on both the killer and chemistry between Hannibal and Clarice. It's very close to being perfect!

I only preface this with that information because this was the very first film in which I was introduced to Sir Anthony Hopkins. What an introduction.
This is a story of a young FBI Trainee, for lack of a better term, brought on board and investigation into the kidnapping and murder of women. Agent Starling, played here flawlessly by Jodi Foster, is a psyche major. She is asked to talk to a notorious serial murderer name Hannibal Lecter, or Hannibal the cannibal, played by the Great Hopkins. It is hoped that Lecter can shed some light on who is perpetrating the murders, as his latest kidnapped victim is a senator's daughter. Foster and Hopkins are excellent together, and the story is solid. It does keep you wondering through the end if Buffalo Bill, the serial killer's nickname, will get caught. But seriously, Hopkins is what made this movie. The man is an acting god.",The Silence of the Lambs
216,DavidSim240183,"A good film, but falls just that little bit short of greatness",7,30 July 2007,"The Silence of the Lambs is considered by many to be a modern classic. Even the DVD informs you its the thriller all others are measured against. Although I did enjoy TSOTL, I'm not sure if it has the components necessary to make it a true classic. Its not the masterpiece it's often made out to be.Certainly you can understand its appeal. Its a story that comes with a rich premise ripe for delving into dark, psychological corners. Thomas Harris' novel was a wonderfully compelling page-turner. A tightly wound thriller that sent my pulse racing.But the film skates over some of the things that made Harris' novel so wonderful. I'm not saying its a terrible film. Far from it. Jonathan Demme's direction is excellent, with lots of brilliant camera tricks. And he gets a superb performance out of Jodie Foster. Clarice Starling is the best thing she's ever done. She won a well deserved Oscar for the part. But still, the film doesn't always satisfy like it should.Everyone knows the story. FBI trainee Starling is assigned to glean information from incarcerated serial killer, Dr Hannibal Lecter (Anthony Hopkins) concerning the whereabouts of another serial killer on the loose, Buffalo Bill. A former patient of Lecters, he's killed and skinned several women. Starling and Lecter's interrogation sessions become a slowly spreading invasion within the background of Starling's emotionally fragile psyche. All the while Buffalo Bill has himself a new victim, and Lecter is already planning his escape.First I will praise the film's merits. Yes it does have excellent performances. The scenes between Starling and Lecter are electrifying. They're the high-point of the whole film. And Demme does superb things with his camera. I like the way he shoots many of Clarice's scenes from her POV, like when she descends several staircases and goes through several doors at the asylum until she finally meets Dr Lecter.He stands straight. Perfectly still. Almost waiting in anticipation for Clarice. They lock eyes. He reads things about her. From her body language. The look of nervous anguish she tries to bury. Examining first her face. Then her temporary FBI badge. Sniffing her perfume through the holes in the glass partition. The only thing keeping them apart. He runs off a number of things about her personality. Capped by the surprising concern he shows when she's attacked by another cell-mate.That one scene is quite wonderful. Both Hopkins and Foster shine in this moment, arguably the best one they share. There are times when you're not sure who has the upper hand. Lecter gets under her skin. But you can tell Starling hits a nerve when she questions his choices in life. Just listen to the sharp clang the steel drawer makes when Lecter shoves a psychological profile Clarice brought back in her face. That's more jarring than his infamous Chianti speech.Although much has been made of Hopkins' admittedly impressive performance, Jodie Foster is the real star. She gives a perfectly balanced blend of tough resolve and emotional fragility. The way expressions play out over her face are easily decipherable and greatly accessible. She doesn't make any grand gestures. The pain of her troubled childhood and the growing horrors of her work are communicated in her beautifully expressive eyes. She's the heart and soul of the picture. Jodie Foster is one of my favourite actresses, and she inhabits the role of Clarice Starling so well, there comes a time when it stops being acting.You could say the same of Hopkin's quietly sinister performance. Hopkins learned not to blink his eyes for extended periods. Something he utilises to great effect. I love the scene when Lecter is probing Clarice while she's talking about the time she ran away from home. Demme has the camera right in his face. Resolved. Implacable. Unrelenting. Its a frightening scene of equal manipulation and concern on Lecter's part.The film is less successful in its supporting cast. Scott Glenn is OK as Jack Crawford, Starling's superior. But he's only designed to be there when the plot is moving along. Anthony Heald's Dr Chilton is purely one-dimensional. There's no depth to his character. And I was a bit disappointed with Ted Levine's Buffalo Bill. A transvestite making a coat from women's flesh. The film tries to craft a similar relationship between Levine and Catherine Martin, his abductee, in the same manner as Lecter and Starling. A killer and an innocent. But it doesn't work the same way. The chemistry just isn't there.One thing I liked about the book was I got the impression Dr Lecter was pulling the strings from the comforts of his jail cell. I didn't always get that same impression with the film. Not to criticise Demme's direction. He keeps things moving at a brisk pace. But still, he throws in a few hackneyed ideas here and there, e.g. anagrams with hidden clues, to keep things moving.And I'm not sure I believe Lecter's method of escape. It seems a bit ridiculous to me. And it makes fools out of real SWAT teams. The ending seems hard to believe too. I didn't buy for a second an FBI trainee would be sent into such a potentially dangerous situation, even if she thought it wasn't the home of the killer. Although it does build up to a tense, well sustained climax in the blacked out interior of Buffalo Bill's basement. Where we see through his night vision goggles, leering at a frightened and bewildered Clarice. Images of his hand reaching out for her are scary as hell, and reminds me of John Carpenter's techniques in Halloween.The Silence of the Lambs is undeniably an enjoyable effort that occasionally digs into some dark areas. But it doesn't quite do the novel justice. Excellent performances from Hopkins and Foster. Superb direction too. But its lacking that essential ingredient, brilliance, to elevate it to classic status.",The Silence of the Lambs
217,lagudafuad,here is a movie you can watch again and again,9,20 December 2012,"With a screen time of not more than 17 minutes, Anthony Hopkins pulled off a memorable performance that gained him an Academy Award; I think no actor has won an Oscar for such a short screen time. His was so great that even in this short screen time he puts the fear of his cannibalism in you that he also earned the title of the 1 Villain of all time in the AFI (American Film Institute) 100 Years... 100 Heroes & Villain for his portrayal of Dr. Hannibal Lecter in this movie.There is just so much about this movie that just makes you love it, the high intellect showed by Lecter, the way he master minds the people he is talking to making them bend to his will in such a way that they have no idea, and how he can draw you in for just a bite of your nose. This is one of the best movies I have ever seen.Silence of the Lambs is one of three movies to win all five major Oscar awards, those awards are: Best Picture, Best Actress, Best Actor, Best Director and Best Adapted Screenplay. The other two films to achieve such are It happened One Night in 1934 and One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest in 1975.The movie plot is about a young FBI trainee Clarice Starling (Jodie Foster), who seeks the advice of the imprisoned Dr. Lecter (Anthony Hopkins) to apprehend another serial killer, known only as ""Buffalo Bill"".Clarice was sent to Hannibal Lecter with the hope of gaining a better insight into the mind of the serial killer Buffalo Bill, by talking to another psychopath (Lecter). Dr. Lecter used to be a psychiatrist, until he turned psycho. He has a powerful mind and he is an excellent mind manipulator.This 1991 classic is based on the 1988 novel of the same name by Thomas Harris, his second to feature Hannibal Lecter. His first book in 1981 Red Dragon was where Lecter was first introduced as a brilliant psychiatrist and cannibalistic serial killer. Red Dragon was the first film adapted from the Harris novels and it was done in 1986 and named Manhunter it starred Brian Cox as Lecter, spelled ""Lecktor"".A remake of Red Dragon was done in 2002 starring Hopkins as Lector and the movie was adapted from the same novel as Manhunter, released to a generally positive review Red Dragon was a critical and box office success, making over $200 million on a $78 million budget.This movie (Silence of the Lambs) was a box office success and it is one you will one to watch, but warning it does deal with cannibalism and it is graphical in some sense.www.lagsreviews.com",The Silence of the Lambs
218,willcundallreview,A good thrill ride although feel it is overrated,7,8 August 2015,"When you watch a movie considered an absolute classic, you expect to be thrilled and taken away, for me though, I just wasn't. Now I'm not saying this is bad far from it, but it just isn't for me what everyone cracks it up to be, it's good but I fail to see why it is considered a masterpiece. I would watch it again as it is enjoyable and a genuinely good thriller, but part of me feels it has maybe aged a little too much since it came out, but that doesn't doubt some of the performances.The true star of the movie is Anthony Hopkins (or for some it is Jodie Foster, pick a side) and he seems to emit a certain eeriness about him, and to say he is in this movie for so little time and yet won an Oscar, well it is testament to his skill. As for Foster prefer her or not to Hopkins she is also a worthy actor here and some of the mind battles between her and Hopkins's Lecter are very fine scenes indeed. For me though the acting is where the slight overrating of this movie arrives and that is because people say about the performances as if they are what makes this incredible, but for me the acting although brilliant, does not make up for the entire piece.And on the point here of the plot, well the story is sinister, devilishly put together but never too much like a basic horror movie. See the film has a way of being physiologically scary rather than gruesome jumpy scenes kind of scary, sure there are a lot of dark moments but it wouldn't give you nightmares. I found the story to be interesting, the whole thing about Clarice meeting with Hopkins to find Buffalo Bill is an interesting concept, and the whole plot about Buffalo Bill himself is also fairly interesting too. It is Buffalo Bill who makes this movie not like others, a crazed killer but who is calculated albeit mentally scarred, a fascinating look into the killers mind.Jonathan Demme directs and he is OK, he never really made me think ""Oh wow this director is fantastic"" but nevertheless I did feel his job here was done well. As for the script well I have never read the original source material, but the adapted screenplay in any case is very nicely done, Ted Tally creates something that will live on in cinema history. The cinematography is also nice; the straight to face camera angles work well when people are having conversations and Tak Fujimoto's work all together is very nicely done.The reason I think I didn't enjoy this maybe as much as others is that it could be dated now. The movie isn't the scariest; I didn't find it much frightening at all and although as I say Buffalo Bill is a fascinating character as well as Lecter, neither really sent shivers. That said the film is I believe meant to be more about the psychological side of these characters, and especially with Lecter, although we see his horrific side, we don't see a lot. There is no doubt Hopkins deserved his awards, same story with Foster and a lot of it's wins too, but for me best picture was not something it deserved, it just for me wasn't enjoyable enough, didn't engage me near as much as others say it did for them.Overall I feel slightly disappointed after viewing this; I came in with high expectations but left having seen a good movie, but not a masterpiece. I just can't see why people believe this to be so good, maybe you have to watch this with your nose pressed against the screen but I will one day watch this again and reflect on whether I feel my feelings about this have changed.",The Silence of the Lambs
219,rdoyle29,A masterpiece,10,20 November 2017,"You know ... everyone is aware how good of a movie this is, and it's cultural repercussions are immense. David Fincher's entire career is based on this film's existence. Still ... it's a film I tend to take for granted, partly because for every good thing that it spawned (the ""Hannibal"" TV show), there's a ton of garbage (all of it's film sequels). I'm so sick of Anthony Hopkins as Hannibal Lector that I tend to forget how wonderful he originally was. This is a brilliant film that takes so many chances and just works ... it hums.",The Silence of the Lambs
220,Cinemaniac1984,An electrifying and brilliant thriller that is still an unforgettable cinematic triumph 25 years on.,10,7 June 2016,"It's hard to believe that 25 years ago The Silence of the Lambs was a huge box office success that garnered a lot of critical acclaim. It also did very well at the Academy Awards ceremony, netting 5 Academy Awards for all the major categories (Best Picture, Best Director, Best Actor, Best Actress and Best Adapted Screenplay). Anthony Hopkins and Jodie Foster have never been finer, and director Jonathon Demme was certainly at the top of his game. Based on the best selling novel by Thomas Harris, The Silence of the Lambs has done very well to uphold its stellar reputation as one of the finest thrillers of all time.Clarice Starling (Jodie Foster) is an FBI trainee at the FBI Academy at Quantico, Virginia. She is specially handpicked by Jack Crawford (Scott Glenn) of the Bureau's Behavioral Science Unit on the basis of her stellar academic achievements and performance as an FBI trainee. Crawford assigns her to interview the charismatic yet psychotic Dr. Hannibal Lecter (Anthony Hopkins), a former psychiatrist turned cannibalistic serial killer who is currently incarcerated in a maximum security prison. Clarice Starling has been assigned to see Hannibal Lector to provide an insight into a serial killer nicknamed ""Buffalo Bill"" aka Jame Gumb (Ted Levine), who kidnaps women and skins their corpses. Hannibal Lector agrees on the proviso that Clarice reveals personal information about herself and he is transferred away from Dr Frederick Chilton (Anthony Heald) and housed in a more comfortable prison. As the mind games continue between Hannibal Lector and Clarice Starling, the pursuit of Buffalo Bill becomes a race against time when he abducts and takes prisoner his next victim Catherine Martin (Brooke Smith), who is also the daughter of US Senator Ruth Martin (Diane Baker).Anthony Hopkins turns in a memorable and chilling performance as Hannibal Lector which will never be forgotten. It is also no surprise Hannibal Lector has topped (or even rounded out the top 5) list of the best all time villains.Jodie Foster is also brilliant as FBI trainee Clarice Starling who is tough, intelligent, but vulnerable. Having forged her career as a child actress, and then coming of age after netting an Academy Award for Best Actress as a rape victim in The Accused (1988), Jodie Foster firmly makes her mark as one of the finest actresses as well as receiving a well deserved second Academy Award for Best Actress. Also Clarice Starling earns a well deserved spot as one of the best movie heroines right up there besides Ellen Ripley from the Alien series, Sarah Connor from The Terminator series, and Princess Leia from the Star Wars series.Scott Glenn as Jack Crawford also does a brilliant job. Scott Glenn is a very versatile actor with an extensive career and here in The Silence of the Lambs, he always does an efficient and faultless job.Ted Levine is chilling and creepy as Buffalo Bill. Ted Levine is another versatile actor but he puts in a very memorable, though infamous, performance as Buffalo Bill.Director Jonathon Demme was an unusual choice after having directed numerous comedies including Married to the Mob (1988). Here he hits the ball completely out of the park with The Silence of the Lambs. Jonathon Demme has never been finer here, and this is certainly a movie that he will always be remembered for.Writer Ted Tally has done a brilliant job bringing Thomas Harris' best selling novel to the big screen.The Silence of the Lambs is an electrifying and brilliant thriller from start to finish and is still capable of keeping viewers on the edge of their seats. Jodie Foster and Anthony Hopkins turn in their most memorable performances, and Jonathon Demme has never been finer. It's no surprise The Silence of the Lambs was a critical and box office success in 1991 and 25 years later, it is still a unforgettable cinematic triumph.A well deserved 10/10.",The Silence of the Lambs
221,rajatdahiyax,A movie that hypnotis you till the very end!!!!,8,29 July 2015,"n this multiple Oscar-winning thriller, Jodie Foster stars as Clarice Starling, a top student at the FBI's training academy whose shrewd analysis of serial killers lands her a special assignment: the FBI is investigating a vicious murderer nicknamed Buffalo Bill, who kills young women and then removes the skin from their bodies. Jack Crawford (Scott Glenn) wants Clarice to interview Dr. Hannibal Lecter (Anthony Hopkins), a brilliant psychiatrist who is also a violent psychopath, serving life behind bars for various acts of murder and cannibalism. Crawford believes that Lecter may have insight into this case and that Starling, as an attractive young woman, may be just the bait to draw him out. Lecter does indeed know something of Buffalo Bill, but his information comes with a price: in exchange for telling what he knows, he wants to be housed in a more comfortable facility. More important, he wants to speak with Clarice about her past. He skillfully digs into her psyche, forcing her to reveal her innermost traumas and putting her in a position of vulnerability when she can least afford to be weak. The film mingles the horrors of criminal acts with the psychological horrors of Lecter's slow-motion interrogation of Clarice and of her memories that emerge from it.",The Silence of the Lambs

223,emperor_bender,"""I'm having an old friend for dinner""",9,24 February 2008,"This is a classic horror movie right from the start. Usually movies take about 20 years before becoming a classic, but not Silence of the Lambs. This movie has a very complex storyline but that works to its advantage. The music is not really eerie, but thats what makes it SO eerie. Hannibal Lecter is VERY WELL played by Anthony Hopkins. He is so evil, so sneaky, he tops most other movie villains. His mere stare is enough to make someone tremble. Everyone who stands in his way seems to have bad luck come to them. Hannibal is the most sophisticated, evil, possibly bi-polar cannibal to ever grace the big screen. 17 years later, this movie hasn't become any less eerie. My only complaint was Jody Foster, she did play Clarice very well but was sometimes over the top and seems to fall out of character a little. Unfortunately, since she's the main character, it was enough to knock this movie down a star. But this movie is still near perfect. Recommend to everyone who wants a good crime/horror movie. Fans of Se7en will most likely enjoy this. 9/10.",The Silence of the Lambs

225,avik-basu1889,An iconic thriller !!!,9,14 June 2016,"Directed by Jonathan Demme and written by Ted Tally, 'The Silence of the Lambs' is based on the novel of the same name by Thomas Harris. One of the first themes that one can notice while watching the film is the element of feminism. This film has feminism and feminist ideals written all over it. What makes this work is that Demme in collaboration with Tally conveys these feminist ideas through visual filmmaking and frame compositions instead of blatant verbal delivery. The opening of the film itself is an example of this. This opening credits sequence which apparently was something Jodie Foster came up with starts with the image of barren, dry, leafless trees in a deserted foggy forest. Then Clarice appears out of this fog and we follow her as she runs and overcomes one obstacle after another on her own. This is visual storytelling at its best. The foggy, deserted, barren forest is what society can sometimes look like from a female perspective. Then we see this woman appear and face and overcome hurdles and obstacles alone and showcase her capabilities. Another great frame is that of Clarice getting dwarfed in the elevator by the big burly men standing alongside her. Clarice Sterling is an iconic female hero, but not in the clichéd sense of the word. She is strong, intelligent and idealistic. But she is still given the chance to have a sense of fear and be vulnerable which actually makes her real and very inspirational.Another theme that I noticed in the film is the feeling of being trapped and the desire of breaking out. This theme actually binds the three characters Clarice, Hannibal and Buffalo Bill together. Clarice feels trapped in an environment which is predominantly numbered by men. But her way of overcoming this feeling is to work hard and make herself someone that the others can't take lightly. Buffalo Bill had been a victim of abuse in his past life and this had led him to hate everything about himself including his body which leads him to believe he is transsexual. So he feels trapped in his male body and wants to become a woman. This theme also applies to Hannibal Lecter, but in a much more literal sense. He is literally trapped in prisons and cages and he wants to break free. There are two transformations or desired transformations juxtaposed in the narrative of the film. The first desired transformation is Clarice's. We can see in her a determination to transform herself from the sweet, innocent girl seen in the flashback scenes to a hardened strong FBI officer. But she doesn't lose her femininity while trying to transform. Buffalo Bill on the other wants to completely lose his masculinity by using a female armour. The irony is that Bill wants to become a woman even though he treats women as objects and considers them to be fragile, weak and loves to exert his power on them.The film is brilliantly directed. Jonathan Demme uses a lot of filmmaking techniques. There are a number of tracking shots, POV shots and close-ups in the film. Demme manages to keep the film flowing and very tightly paced. But I think the best directorial decision that Demme makes here is the artistic use of close-ups. Time and again in other films, directors have used POV shots of men and especially criminals while they size up their female prey in the creepiest sense like we have seen in Michael Powell's masterpiece 'Peeping Tom'. Demme reverses that by showing us the male gaze from the woman's perspective. The men who talk to Clarice talk straight into the camera and we see what Clarice sees in their eyes. Apart from this theme, the close- ups also help the viewers in assessing the nature of these characters. Cheekily Demme reverses it again in the final set-piece and shows us Buffalo Bill's POV while he watches Clarice struggle in the dark. I would also like to mention Howard Shore's music which I thought also helped maintain the tempo of the film.The acting is pretty spectacular. Jodie Foster just through her facial expressions lets us in on what she is thinking. She acts a lot with her eyes and her face. She gives a humanity to Clarice's character as well as making her strong and determined. Anthony Hopkins' portrayal of Hannibal Lecter has become legendary. His portrayal is not realistic. He is over-the-top and very theatrical in almost a Shakespearean way. Some critics have criticised his portrayal for this very reason. But I think in the context of the film that he is in, a sedate, understated performance wouldn't have worked. The film doesn't restrict itself fully to the boundaries of realism, so some theatricality from Hopkins I feel benefited it and Hopkins is great with his intimidating eyes and distinctive vocal style of speaking. He blends disturbing psychotic antics with refined and classy gestures to make the character of Hannibal Lecter immensely complicated and deranged. The conversational scenes between Hannibal and Clarice are the ones that make the film what it is. During these scenes we see Hannibal give us subtle hints of possible abuse in his past which is why he connects with Clarice who also had to face some childhood trauma. The screenplay tactfully makes use of these conversation scenes to flesh out the character of Clarice by using Hannibal's interest in her as a psychiatrist. Ted Levine is also fantastic as Buffalo Bill. His performance gets undermentioned a lot, but he deserves a lot of credit for giving a truly disturbing performance.'The Silence of the Lambs' is a near masterpiece. It is not fully realistic, but it brilliantly directed, acted and written. Beneath the disturbing exterior, the filmmaker is working on a number of levels and the introspective viewer will be able to understand how multi- layered the film genuinely is.",The Silence of the Lambs
226,charchuk,Purely chilling,10,4 April 2007,"A film that actually deserves all the acclaim and praise bestowed upon it. Everything, from the story right down through to the music, is outstanding, making for a chilling and memorable drama. Hopkins steals the show, of course, and his Oscar is well-deserved despite it being the shortest performance for a winning lead actor; Foster provides a nice contrast to him, and is also deserving of the acclaim. The scenes between Lecter and Clarice are so exceptionally done that it's nearly a shame when the focus shifts from him to Buffalo Bill, but an underrated performance by Ted Levine makes the climax just a thrilling. The scene where Lecter escapes is one of my all-time favourite cinematic moments, not just because of the gore, but because of the pure horror that is developed without any supernatural elements.",The Silence of the Lambs

It holds one of the greatest villains of all time, accompanied by a performance that resist the stream of time.

Anthony Hopkins was remarkable in his role as Hannibal Lecter delivers one of the most memorable and interesting villains in movie history, all thanks to his genius portrayal of the character.2. Jodie Foster also did an excellent job as Clarice Starling.3. Ted Levine was alright as Buffalo Bill and helms one of the oddest scenes I've ever seen in a film.4. The story was alright.5.

I just wanted him in the movie more.2. Most of the characters are so god damn dumb it actually offends me.3. The climax was underwhelming to say the least.

The acting by Anthony Hopkins and a young Jodie Foster is great. The story has become a story that almost every new scary movie steals. If you see it today it might not be the same as when I saw it for over ten years ago. It is a really good scary film that includes much of everything. I still think the same has I have always thought about this film. It is not perfect, I don't think that it is a film that really touched me and I did not found it as a masterpiece.
Maybe the main problem is that you don't get to study the victims enough. I had also heard so much good films about it that I had too high thoughts about it. It is really worth watching but not one of the best scary movies ever. If you ask me I like the classic films that Hitchcock made better.

231,theshadow908,Chilling psychological thriller.,9,11 July 2006,"The Silence of the Lambs picks up 5 years after the events of Manhunter. A serial killer is kidnapping and murdering women, and wearing their skin as clothing. When the governor's daughter is kidnapped, an FBI trainee named Clarice Starling is sent to talk to the cannibalistic Dr. Hannibal Lecter so he might shed some of his vast knowledge on the case. This leads to a bizarre relationship where Clarice opens up to Hannibal for information. This is a very good psychological thriller that will live on through the years as a timeless classic.The Silence of the Lambs is superior to it's predecessor because it seems to be made on a larger budget, and it uses some big names. It successfully translates the mood from Thomas Harris' novel to film, so the movie comes off as dark and creepy. The characters are awesome. The cat and mouse conversations between Hannibal and Clarice are immensely interesting. She is shy, and Hannibal forces her to be bold. The serial killer in this movie, Buffalo Bill, is based off of real life killer Ed Gein, and he is extremely disturbing in this movie. Another good thing is that this is a no holds barred movie. It doesn't pull any punches. It shows what it wants, and it makes the movie more realistic.The acting is awesome. Anthony Hopkins does a vastly superior job in the role of Hannibal Lecter than Brian Cox did in Manhunter. He made the character his own, and that's why nobody mentions Brian Cox in the role. Hopkins' portrayal is creepy and memorable. Jodie Foster does a knock out job as Clarice Starling, the shy FBI agent forced to interview Hannibal.Overall, this is an amazing movie, and it definitely deserved the Best Picture Oscar.

232,Marc_Israel_365,The killer that we admire!,8,8 November 2014,"There are two types of worthy villains: those who are so despicable that we revel in the cold- blooded personality that we look at from the outside looking in, and the one that we want to identify with. That villain can appear socially intelligent, a cunning schemer and, at times, sympathetic. In Hannibal Lecter we get both. All else is a police drama that allows Jodie Foster to star with a dismaying West Virginia accent and a propped up set of credentials that places her in a position to be at the center of it all. For me, although Foster is always interesting to look at, it is Ted Levines' ""Buffalo Bill"" that encases the chilling nature of the film because we get a glimpse of the biggest reason we watch horror films. What drive the evil found in mankind. Levine gives us a chilling and fascinatingly demented killer and we see why he's doing what he's doing.

Be it be, Jodie Foster or Julianne Moore or any other it has always be an amazing experience watching the brutal yet genius psychopath at work.He knows what you are thinking, he knows when you are lying, he knows the way a psycho thinks because he is the ultimate psychopath.

The pun like 'I'm having a friend for dinner' is one of the finest lines that I can bring back to memory.The one directed by Ridley Scott(Hannibal), however, wasn't as good as those directed by Jonathan Demme and Brett Ratner(Red Dragon) but then again it was Thomas Harris altogether, so no comments there.Awesome flick, the greatest thriller and suspense movie of all times.

When I was waking up once, noticing Hannibal Lecter on my television screen, looking at me with his alive, clear eyes and speaking to me about screaming lambs, that was surely one of the most exciting moments in my movie-interested life. So it is definitely a good idea to see this at night, with one's concentration wandering away.Now I saw it again (at daylight!), and many other things struck me. The character of Catherine Martin is actually really cool. The snobbish daughter of a famous politician reacts to the terrible things that are done to her in an unusually offensive way - it looks as if she was never giving up.And then did you notice how utterly serious this film is? There is not a single funny scene in it. And this is really great! Which other feature film today manages to be taken seriously by everybody and never being unintentionally funny although it does not have a single moment of irony?

241,jackasstrange,Slightly disturbing and with very good acting,8,27 December 2013,"Silence of the Lambs is highly acclaimed as one of the best films ever made into the thriller genre, and in fact deserves this title. There are plenty of films like these nowadays, so the formula may be a bit cliché in fact, but the film itself still unique in his own way. Hannibal Lecter is a very intelligent man and at same time a dangerous psychopath, so normally the actor that would eventually take the role should put effort in bringing exactly what Hopkins's acting did. In Lecter skin, he looks like a creepy but classy individual, and one could argue that this kind of thing is very hard to accomplish. I found him to be almost an untouchable and invincible character, and if you watch the film you'll understand. I am not entirely convinced by 'that' scene(those who watched the film know what i am talking about), despite being very impressive. I also liked Jodie Foster in the film. Her performance in this film is good, not one of the 'Greatest Ever' but very convincing. If the intention was to show a character that is slightly scared all the time so she did very well, because it was exactly my impression about her.There are some harsh dialogs and situations in this film that may engross and even left the viewer uncomfortable, but still surprisingly tame for a film that explores the subjects it did.It don't have that much accomplished in the artistic aspects, but the story-telling is very good. And even with a few poorly made scenes(Jodie Foster calling 'Dr Lecter?' numerous times in the phone), it still a fine interesting film. 8.5/10",The Silence of the Lambs
242,zeekwunlau,A path to chase the soul,8,20 April 2020,"As a reasoning film, Hannibal 's intelligence to Agent Starling is particularly intriguing. The lines between the lines are all points of the Buffalo Bill, which are worth scrutinizing. As a horror movie, Hannibal 's escape from prison in the building and the brutal killing of the two guards formed psychological fears, especially one of the prison guards The belly was hung on the cage like a butterfly, which deepened Hannibal's terrible impression of a high IQ cold-blooded killer. The Buffalo Bill is a pervert in criminal behavior and forms sensory oppression. Looking at the peeling of each body and trapping the victim in a dark and damp basement mine, the terrible sense of helplessness will permeate my heart. . Especially when Starling arrested him in his dark and weird room, Bill 's tension when he was hiding in the dark and peeping into the blood vessel was creepy.Detective Starling is the only sunshine in this film. From her perspective, she was open and honest when exchanging information with Hannibal, thinking about the content of the conversation, and summarizing the characteristics of the corpse. Taking us step by step to expose the murderer, and through communication with Hannibal, let us see that besides the bloody side of eating human organs, Hannibal also has a gentleman side of courtesy.The frontal close-up shots of many characters in the film can capture their expressions and touch the audience most intuitively.",The Silence of the Lambs

244,WalterFrith,The best psychological thriller ever!,10,2 August 2003,"'The Silence of the Lambs' is the best psychological thriller ever made. This film has many visual moments of unmatched excellence.  The scene in Hannibal Lecter's cell when he stares at the pen with the hope of sabotaging a part from it to pick his handcuffs.  The camera pans back and fourth between it and the pen.  Brilliant.  Clarice Starling's point of view when she first lays eyes on Lecter.  The double murder of the guards in Hannibal's Memphis cell is probably the most terrifying scene ever filmed. Anthony Hopkins proves that quality and not quantity is the key to a best actor Oscar as his part is extremely small but effective.  Jodie Foster holds her own with him and you believe every second of her performance. Jonathan Demme's direction is superb and he stamps the film with a sure footed sense of style and chilling effectiveness.  And Ted Tally's adaptation of the book by Thomas Harris is entertaining from start to finish without one boring moment in the entire film.  And the best part is that the film, as scary as it is, has very little violence.",The Silence of the Lambs
245,TheHonestCritic,"Is this a brilliant thriller/horror film? Or, is it just another cliched mess? Check out my review to find out!",4,28 March 2021,"""The Silence of the Lambs"" (1991), before I get into my review, I just want to say something right off the bat. Over the years, I've heard many people obsess over this ""movie"". Normally, I'm not the biggest fan of the horror genre. But, as soon as I found out that this is more of a crime/thriller, I thought: ""all right, I do enjoy crime and thriller movies, I'll give it a shot."" I watched it, and I just got nothing but pure disappointment with it. This ""movie"" has a cliched and somewhat predictable storyline, standard to mediocre acting, and a generic soundtrack. The plot is, an FBI agent named Clarice Starling, played by Jodie Foster, is after a cannibalistic serial killer named Hannibal Lecter, played by Anthony Hopkins. One thing I always say is, if a movie doesn't spark my interest within the first ten minutes then it isn't worth watching. But, with this ""film"", I was hooked within the first few minutes. As I watched the first ten minutes, I thought: ""okay, so far so good. Let's see if it can maintain this excitement for the rest of the movie!"" Unfortunately, after the first ten to fifteen minutes, it all goes downhill rapidly. After the opening scene, it just turns into your typical pedestrian crime/thriller film. I will admit, there were a few decent moments here and there. But overall, it was just a disappointment for me. To be honest, the only reason I watched this ""movie"" in the first place was because Jodie Foster and Anthony Hopkins were playing the main characters. Both of them are phenomenal actors! I'll be going into more details about them and the rest of the cast in just a moment. The weird thing is, the title mentions lambs, but there are no lambs anywhere in this ""film""! But, the lambs in this case are the victims of Hannibal Lecter. As he skins his victims when he kills them, kind of like shearing a lamb or sheep. If you can't overlook the title, I'd completely understand. I'm not the biggest fan of the title, I think they could've come up with a better one! Another joke is, this ""movie"" is also considered part horror film. It didn't scare me in the slightest, yet somehow it's marketed as a major hit in the horror genre. Like I said, I'm not a big fan of horror films. Most of them are cliched or predictable and this ""movie"" is no different. As for the acting, it's just standard to mediocre. The only two that appear to be trying are Jodie Foster and Anthony Hopkins. To tell you the truth, I think that Jodie Foster and Anthony Hopkins are the two biggest elements that keep this ""film"" from being ignored. Jodie Foster did the best she could despite the poorly written script and so did Anthony Hopkins. Another annoying problem is, I was looking forward to seeing Anthony Hopkins as a villain, but he has, maybe, about 20 minutes of total screen time. Yeah, that kind of sucked, because most of the time he can save any movie he's involved in, good or bad! I guess you could argue that they were going for the less is more trope. But, that doesn't work in this case. The rest of the acting is just hit and miss, you know that's bad when great actors like Jodie Foster and Anthony Hopkins can't save it! As for the soundtrack, it's just your everyday generic thriller film score. It does have some redeeming parts, but it's really just nothing to write home about. Now, let's get to the only good elements in this ""movie"". The only good things are the sets/locations and the special effects. All of the sets/locations are great and give this ""movie"" a decent atmosphere. All of the special effects are well-done and they still hold up today. However, the reality is, great sets/locations and special effects are no excuses for a poorly written script. ""The Silence of the Lambs"" is such an upset in the aspect of crime and thriller films. The worst thing is, it did have great potential. Unfortunately, little to no potential was achieved and it's nothing short of your cliched investigation movies. Maybe the original novel written by Thomas Harris is better? I don't know, I'll have to look into it some day. But, if this ""movie"" is any indication regarding the book, then maybe I should just leave it alone. I'm giving this ""film"" 2 out of 5 stars on my personal scale, which equates to 4 out of 10 IMDB stars. Unless you're a huge fan of horror films, I recommend skipping this film. You'll just end up getting skinned with a major letdown!",The Silence of the Lambs
246,jldmp1,Caged Lambs,3,7 April 2006,"Movie adaptations of novels, even pop bestsellers with the imagery masticated for us, are a tricky business to cinematically get right. Some find a good translation by falling backward into it, like ""Jaws"". Rare birds like ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" transcend previous visual understandings, and overpower the written word. You can include this movie with ""Presumed Innocent"" or ""...Cuckoo's Nest"": in each case, the wrong path was chosen. The novel hinges on Lecter's perspective -- here Hopkins plays a mere boogey man. All we get is the cheap device of haunted houses. In the novel, Lecter moves physically and psychologically wherever he wants: in Harris' words, 'as if he chose the distance' from the protagonist/detective. He occupies his own universe of perception, based mostly on sight and smell -- Demme might have really done something by recreating the world sensed by Lecter. Instead, he spends all of his time lovingly gazing into Foster's face. If you want a better construction of a world, stay with ""Manhunter"".",The Silence of the Lambs

I can say that after watching it though I felt like I was educated by the FBI's Behavioral Science Unit! I love the script it seemed to have a real life ring to it. You have Clarice Starling (Jodie Foster) as an FBI trainee who wants to be a member of the behavioral science unit that studies violent crime and serial killings and once the brutal killings across several eastern and midwestern states begin all the work of ""Buffalo Bill"". Clarice enlists the aid of a former psychologist and now imprisoned sociopath (Anthony Hopkins) to help track the killer. And I must say that Hopkins gives a mind numbing performance he really made a great educated sociopath the movie explores the dark nature of life but mainly it proves all of us can receive a mind playing education just as Hopkins does so well with the Foster character as he brings out her dark fears and past mistakes such as the incident with a crying lamb as a child maybe we will later learn in the Hannibal sequel that a lamb doesn't stay silent forever you know Anthony's Hannibal will roar like a lion. The, Silence of the Lambs falls short of matching the gore and high drama of movies like Se7en but the script is so mind tingling and while the Hopkins character has the ability to know the future of all and any crazy individuals while he surprises himself and others with the rude nature and he can always play his own mind games to his advantage that is what makes The, Silence of the Lambs a classic.

We are soon going to be watching this film in my high school's film club on October 29th. I wanted to see what everybody was talking about. I hear this film Quoted all the time and I know the famous Characters. So what did I think of the film? The film starts with Clarice Starling played by Jodie Foster as she is pulled from the training course and called to her boss Jack Craford's played by Scott Glenn office. She is told to go to the psychiatric ward to speak with Hannibal Lector played by Anthony Hopkins about the serial killer Buffalo Bill played by Ted Levine.She meets with Hannibal as he agrees to tell her information in exchange for memories from her unhappy childhood. As a child Clarice experienced Her father die in a hospital a month after an altercation with 2 burglars. She was then sent to live with her uncle on his farm. One day she tried to run away. As she was leaving she witnessed lambs getting slaughtered. She tried to save one but had to let it go because of it's weight.Hannibal eventually reveals that Buffalo Bills real name is Jame Gumb. His mother died at the age of 2 and started killing at 12 when he murdered his grandparents. Buffalo Bill has kidnapped Catherine Martin played by Brooke Smith who is the daughter of the Tennesse senator Ruth Martin played by Diane Baker.Clarice finds out that if she does not get to Buffalo Bill fast enough then Buffalo Bill will kill Catherine. He plans to starve he and skin her for his ""Woman Suit"".Meanwhile Hannibal has escaped his highly guarded cell by killing to police officers and disguising himself as one of the mutilated officers. He gets put in an ambulance unmasks himself and escapes.Clarice finds Buffalo Bill but does not recognize him at first but then realizes who he is as he runs away. they both go down to the basement where Clarice finds Catherine and goes after Bill. Buffalo Bill toys with her and turns the basement lights out. he pulls out a revolver planning a sneak attack but is killed when Clarice hears the sound of him cocking his revolver. She shoots him 6 times and is hailed as a hero.In the films final scene Clarice gets a phone call from Hannibal who says that he has respect for her and does not wish to kill her. He then spots a Docter who was rude and harsh with him and says that he will ""Be Having An Old Friend For Dinner."" This film is a masterpiece and held my attention the entire time. It is entertaining, Gruesome and disturbing but your eyes never leave the screen. The story is one of the best I have ever seen, The characters are well written. The film deserves all of its' Oscar wins. The performances done by Jodie foster and Anthony Hopkins are some of the best I have seen. Jodie Fosters character is sweet and innocent and Anthony Hopkins is calm and gentle but has violent cannibalistic outbursts. If there is some reason you have not watched this unless of course you are too young to watch this then I am shocked.

252,Silverzero,"Intense, gruesome and complex but a tad overrated horror/thriller.",10,21 March 2003,"The film that began the world famous Hannibal Lector character is a very good one indeed. But I don't think that it lives up to the full quantity of its hype. The two leads deserved the Oscars they won back in 1991 but I don't think that the film deserved any more than that.
Nonetheless, the quality of acting from these two leads is outstanding. At 28 she was already an accomplished actress so Jodie Foster perfectly captures the role of hesitantly determined detective Clarice Starling. It's hard to believe that the Hannibal Lector part was offered to so many other actors before Anthony Hopkins was rightfully offered the role. He creates one of the most memorable movie characters of the 20th Century and is brilliant for the part. It's a shame that the same can't be said about the rest of the performances. Ted Levine, one of the most overlooked actors in the past 20 years, never receives any conviction in his role, offers us no motive, and is just plain dull in his part. No background is offered to his character and is much inferior to Ralph Fiennes character in the recently made prequel, `Red Dragon'. Scott Glenn soon gave up `the method' after he proved to be a dud. Apparently, he sat in a room for hours everyday listening to the sounds of killers torturing their victims, so he could prepare for the role. Too bad that what we see on screen is something less professional.
One thing that the film does succeed in doing is intensifying scenes so as you don't know what will happen next. It gets gratuitously visceral in some scenes to try and be humane, but just looks gruesome and unattractive. While the story is complex and the film ends so as most people will be satisfied, I didn't see much else of `sheer brilliance' about it.
Maybe it's just me or maybe this is a needlessly overrated film. But still, `The Silence of the Lambs' is a very good horror/thriller that well outshines its disastrous sequel `Hannibal'. 7.5/10.",The Silence of the Lambs

It was the first time I have ever had trouble sleeping after watching a movie, so impactful was the content.Silence is flawless in all aspects. Casting, screenplay/plot, direction, cinematography, and editing are superb. By now, we are all familiar with Dr Lector (Anthony Hopkins), the deranged, brilliant psychologist who does battle with the forces of good, here represented by the FBI's Clarice Starling (Jody Foster. Perhaps her last great role). Hopkin's performance is a tour de force of acting. He uses words like knives to stab at Clarice, exposing her checkered past, extracting information that he stores to dig into her later on. And Clarice, a young FBI agent with strong experience in psychology, is clearly overmatched by Dr Lector. They play a back and forth cat and mouse game that will keep you on the edge of your seat throughout.Excellent casting includes the sanitarium head, Dr Chilton (Anthony Heald) who plays this sleazy Head who covets having Dr Lector as his prize while clumsily trying to snag a date with Clarice. Scott Glenn portrays Dr Crawford, Clarice's boss whom she looks up to. He has his own demons he's dealing with that are never fully revealed, and the father-mentor interaction between him and Clarice is palpable. Finally, there's the other evil force, excellently played by Ted Levine.There is a significant amount of killing, and some very viscerally evil scenes that are not for the squeamish. You will be moved, so if you are not good with strong physical scenes, you may want to close your eyes a lot. But you must see this film. The final piece is the editing and directing, which weaves every scene together so it all adds up and makes sense at the end, kind of like in Forest Gump, but with evil intent, not kindness.This film was one of those rare gems that even the Oscars got right by awarding it the triple crown of Oscars - Best picture, Best Director, Best Actor, and Best Actress. It also won best screenplay. If you have not seen this movie, it's a must-see that you should put on your list.

258,Jacques98,"There are many different kinds of cheese. And in this case, mold isn't a good thing.",2,24 April 2009,"Ever since I was a little kid, I was obsessed with reading pulp horror. I've read more from the genre than anyone I personally know. Being a soon-to-be-published author myself, I've learned more about the genre by constantly reading than by any writing seminar I've ever been to. For those who don't read, by simple definition, pulp horror is: a story that is genuinely terrifying and thrilling, but purposely lacks any forced literary moral. Stephen King is pretty much the poster-child of this style of writing. With all of that said, when The Silence of the Lambs, the novel, was released and received mass critical acclaim for being the ""perfect"" horror-thriller, even being the major genre-whore that I am, I could really care less. Why? Simple because I'd read so many books EXACTLY like it, I had no interest. A few years later, when the movie was released, I felt the exact same way. This is why I've waited so long to view this ""impossible-to-miss!"" film. Because I knew it was just more of the same. When I finally decided to force myself to watch it, I found my gut instinct was underestimating. The Silence of the Lambs is not only just more of the same unoriginal story that we've all heard so many times that it's second nature to us, it's also cheesy, immature, over-glamorized, and, in the end, completely laughable. And here is why . . .First and foremost: The Silence of the Lambs is, unarguably, 100% unoriginal. There is not a single original—or even creative—concept in the entire runtime of the film. This paragraph of my review is not my opinion. The way I view the world has no bearing on what has or hasn't been done in storytelling before. Saying that it's my opinion that The Silence of the Lambs is unoriginal is equivalent to saying that it's my opinion that the sky is blue. And just as childish. With that said, I can literally point you, scene-by-scene, to where every single idea in The Silence of the Lambs has been written and filmed in the past. Dressed to Kill, for a major example. From the formula, to the characters, to the situations, to the set-up: it's all, unarguably, one giant genre cliché. And, as I said, I can point to every movie, every book that has used the EXACT scenes in the past. This isn't just a coincidence; it's an unabashed lack of creativity and intelligence from the writer. Just more of the same cliché Hollywood and pulp fiction conventions we've seen all our lives. All the standard clichés are here, folks: romantic subplot, tension at the agency, troubled childhoods, etc., etc., etc.Hannibal Lector himself is, admittedly by the author, nothing but a mash-up of various fictional and real-life serial killers. The two most obvious fictional killers he unabashedly rips-off are Leatherface (The Texas Chain Saw Massacre, 1974) and Mark Lewis (Peeping Tom, 1960). Leatherface's actions (cannibal, wears victim's faces) + Lewis's mind (pretentious, psychiatrist, study's human behavior, kills people to study reactions, gives long speeches about serial killers, has a supposed vast knowledge of the human mind) = Hannibal Lector. There is not a single character trait that Lector has that wasn't done nearly 40 years before he was written. Again, a kindergarten lack of creativity. I honestly don't even know how his character got past copyright laws.Not to mention Hannibal's cheesy persona. He pronounces ""liver"" with slurping sounds at the end. So did 3-year-olds, but I don't cower in fear of them. He never actually DOES anything on-screen, except talk. And talk. And when he does talk, he talks with the pseudo-intelligence of a high-school dropout who took a semester of psychology. Why? Because his psychological knowledge is laughably limited, and sometimes incorrect all together. He's supposed to be this oh-so-evil genius, but all he ever does is quote cliché phrases from dumbed-down Freud. He knows NOTHING about psychology. The pathetic writers just wrote enough cliché psychobabble between his laugh-out-loud cheesy slurping sounds to make it seem like he knew at least as much about the human mind as the average middle-school student. And then, just like all over-glamorized Hollywood, every time Hannibal is on the screen they point the camera up at his face with light shining behind his head as he stares at the ceiling without blinking. That's not good acting. That's made-for-TV directing they use in low-budget Jesus movies. Hannibal Lector is nothing but an awkward middle-aged man who is obsessed with talking and breaking copyright laws. How is that unnerving? If I met him, I'd laugh in his face and tell him to grow up.So, at root value, I'm just trying to ask: What is so great about this movie? It's a generic crime thriller. It opens up with a generic cop-meets-killer scene, and ends with a generic cheesy-killer-in-the-house scene. Everything in between is exactly what you'd expect from an over-glamorized generic Hollywood thriller. It has NO significance whatsoever when it comes to originality. And as far as entertainment value goes, I don't see what's so entertaining in watching a middle-age man talk for an hour on end. If that entertains you, I pity you.Oh my God! This movie TERRIFIED me! Why? Because an awkward middle-aged man pronounced ""liver"" like a 3-year-old.I'll say the same thing to those of you who gave this movie a high score as I'd say to Hannibal Lector: GROW UP.2/10",The Silence of the Lambs

From the psychological combination of the crime and horror genre to the exhilarating performances, there's really nothing necessary to mark this award-winner as an earnest masterpiece.The Silence of the Lambs does really well with its excellent plot. It's mightily gripping right from beginning and all the way to the credits. There's no doubt that the film doesn't lack a fair handful of times where it's slowly-paced, but it especially grows heavier, darker and strongly suspenseful.The extremely graphic and horrifying twists, the level and amount of dark edginess, and the feeling that you just can't bare to remove your eyes from the screen all depend on one specific factor. That's the mastered depiction of Hannibal Lecter, whose character is staged so keenly by Anthony Hopkins, you'll never glance at the actor in the same way as before... literally! The heroine, Clarice whose played superbly by Jodie Foster, is also the film's greatest focus.This marvellously-crafted classic's psychology and fascination would be significantly disenchanted if Hopkins and Foster hadn't been involved.

267,Aly200,Pure Thrills,10,17 January 2013,"One of the iconic characters in horror is brought to us in this terrifying thriller and brought Sir Anthony Hopkins the 1991 Best Actor Oscar. Jodie Foster (who also won an Oscar) stars as naive FBI agent Clarice Starling on her first big assignment to capture the psychopathic serial murderer known as Buffalo Bill. To assist her in the case, Starling is sent to see the infamous cannibalistic psychiatrist, Hannibal Lecter (Hopkins in a chilling performance), but she is warned that Lecter is adept at playing mind games with others and she mustn't tell him personal details. As Clarice comes closer and closer to the killer's true identity, she is thrust into a deadly game of cat and mouse with both Buffalo Bill and the sly Dr. Lecter. What truly sets this film apart from other horror/thrillers is the performance of Anthony Hopkins as Hannibal Lecter, a man who is clearly homicidal but not in an over-the-top fashion. Lecter is presented as calm, cool, collected but still frightening in the sense of the fact we know he is dangerous and has killed people, yet we are drawn to him like Clarice and we are fascinated by his intelligence. This is a clever device to present us as the viewers with a killer who terrifies us mentally rather than being a raving maniac like Freddy or Jason.",The Silence of the Lambs
268,happyendingrocks,Absolutely perfect,10,12 July 2009,"I'm going to try to be brief with this write-up, since almost everyone can already agree that Silence Of The Lambs succeeds as a nail-biting thriller, one of the best examples of ensemble acting in modern cinema, and more simply as a brilliant motion picture. I won't be able to add much on that front, certainly.However, Silence Of The Lambs is most truly notable for being the only genuine horror film to ever win a Best Picture Oscar. Now, I'm not one to consider this a particularly profound achievement, since I have almost never agreed with the choices of the Academy in regards to their silly statuettes (this one being a rare exception). But, the nomination and victory of Silence Of The Lambs is also a victory for the horror genre, a much maligned and at times unfairly targeted film classification that has been deemed damaging by the moral powers that be. It may be going too far to say that the recognition of SOTL is an acknowledgment that horror films can be accepted as art (especially since most fans would argue that landmark films like Dawn Of The Dead, Texas Chainsaw Massacre, and Halloween proved that distinction a full decade before), but it certainly speaks volumes about horror's acceptance into mainstream culture and bridges the gap between decades where genre films opened on a meager amount of screens and our current climate, where horror films routinely top the box office upon their release.It's also worth noting that SOTL is the one film largely inspired by the infamous tale of real-life sicko Ed Gein that doesn't tout this inspiration. This is further ironic since Silence Of The Lambs is a much more accurate visualization of Gein's deeds that the two most famous films that are historically viewed as on-screen representations of elements of the Gein story, Psycho and Texas Chainsaw Massacre. Since nearly any horrific deed a writer of the macabre can conjure has likely happened through the course of real events (or be found in the writings of Poe and Shakespeare, for that matter), it's unlikely that the film-makers were unaware of the connection between Gein and Jame Gumb, but their distancing actually serves the film, because we become singularly focused on Gumb instead of comparing his work to Gein's (even though I just did so here... I'm definitely overthinking this, and I'm already being way more long-winded than I was intending).So, awards and all that crap are definitely nice, but the true impact of Silence Of The Lambs must come from the film itself, and not from any historical or achievement-based standpoint. In that regard, SOTL must be considered one of the most classy, well acted, and generally terrifying horror films of all time.Every performance in this film serves as a defining role for the players, and though all eyes are deservedly on Anthony Hopkins' textbook perfect essay of Hannibal Lecter, I'd rather spend my two minutes here saying publicly that Ted Levine delivers by far the most nuanced and well-realized screen portrayal of a serial killer ever put to film. This is especially impressive considering how little screen-time Levine has in the film, and every moment spent developing his character adds a new layer to his twisted and complex megalomaniacal portrait of the sickness that dwells within humans on this planet filled with as much self-loathing and everyone else-loathing as Jame Gumb. Amazingly, despite the truly horrific deeds we seem him commit, he remains a sympathetic character, and Levine's portrayal is so precise that we always see the loneliness and misery that permeates this dejected predator between his bouts of pathos-seeking rage.The word ""masterpiece"" doesn't come from this keyboard lightly, but Silence Of The Lambs is simply a perfect film, and not only the best picture of 1991, but one of the best of all time. If you are reading this entry because you agree with that assessment, then I thank you for celebrating one of my favorite films with me. However, if you are genuinely seeking out information on SOTL because you haven't seen it, then the preceding minutes you spent reading this are only delaying you from experiencing this incredible film for yourself. Since you should have stopped reading this several paragraphs ago and just started watching the thing, I won't keep you any longer.",The Silence of the Lambs
269,illbebackreviews,"I definitely enjoyed it, but did not love it",7,3 December 2012,"I'm definitely a fan of horror films and films of most types and I certainly love movies such as the Shining and I thought that this film would greatly entertain me as Anthony Hopkins as Hannibal is like the Jack Nicholson as Jack Torrence. I must say the film is definitely very good, but I cannot quite understand why its regarded as so good. It definitely was a good mystery film and the acting by Anthony Hopkins was breathtaking and it pretty much kept the whole movie going nicely. Judie Foster was also brilliant in this film and these two are the stand outs. However, what I like about this film is that there are two completely different villains in the film and of course Hannibal stands out! The score by Howard Shore is great, as usual and the cinematography and special effects are great for a 1991 film. ***SPOILERS*** The scene where Hannibal is served dinner in his cell and he kills the two officers was absolutely awesome and to me, that was the moment of the movie. When we see the ""dying"" police officer inside the ambulance and he stands up and removes his face and it turns out to be Hannibal, that was the other standout of the film. The end of the film with Hannibal Lector calling Clarice and saying that he has an old friend to catch up with, whilst following Dr Chilton was a great and suspenseful ending to the film as the mainly focused villain throughout the movie was Buffalo Bill. This ending pretty much reminded us that Hannibal was also a bad guy. ***END OF SPOILERS***I, however wish that instead of Buffalo Bill being the main villain, it was Hannibal as the film would've been more entertaining and suspenseful that way.Overall, I certainly enjoyed the film but cannot understand why this film is so highly praised and has won 5 Oscars.",The Silence of the Lambs

273,FairlyAnonymous,Two films in one!,7,29 March 2015,"The Silence of the Lambs is two good movies... unfortunately it is packaged as one film. I won't dive too much into the plot as I'm sure most of you have seen the film by now. But just in case: The film follows an FBI student who is following a case of a serial killer known as Buffalo Bill who skins his victims. The FBI student must use a locked up serial killer known as Hannibal Lector to help her figure out who the Buffalo Bill murderer is.The performances in this movie are all very good. Hannibal Lector is very intimidating, and Clarice is also well portrayed by Jodie Foster as a woman who is trying to prove herself, but might be slightly out of her league at times. These two characters are both very interesting and their interaction is very well-done... however, the film forgets that this isn't the movie's plot.The movie is about finding Buffalo Bill. It is not about Hannibal Lector. This is such an interesting mistake that the movie makes because around 50% of the movie's run time is dedicated to learning about Hannibal and making him an interesting character yet... he only effects about 2% of the movie's plot. The movie has a whole escape sequence dedicated to him, only for him never to be seen again in the movie. The only thing that Hannibal does to effect the plot is this: He gives Clarice two hints. That is it. The movie forgets that just because you have an interesting character it doesn't mean that they are a relevant character. Hannibal Lector is IRRELEVANT to the movie's plot. If his arc would connect with Clarice's arc a bit more, then this would be excusable, but when such a large section of the movie is dedicated to him for no real purpose, it gets kind of... stupid.I can see why people adore this movie, and it is because Hannibal is an interesting character. However, the movie DEDICATES itself to making him interesting but doesn't dedicate itself to WHY he is even in the plot... and the answer is: there is no reason. There is no real reason for Hannibal to be in the plot.Regardless of the relevance of Hannibal, the movie's ACTUAL story isn't half bad. It is about an FBI student getting over her weaknesses and trying to prove herself. In the end, she proves herself and becomes a stronger woman. We see her confront fear in the face when at the beginning of the movie she would break down at fear. I would say that the character is better acted than she is developed. Her back-story and motivation is quite literally summed up in one scene of exposition. Hannibal basically says: What motivates you? Clarice: Screaming sheep. This brings us to the last minor gripe of the film: Hannibal is a gruesome murderer and even kills multiple people during his escape, yet Clarice talks to him at the end as if nothing really happened. She doesn't even seemed concerned that he makes a pun about going to eat someone in a little bit. Just because he is an interesting character doesn't mean that he is excused for being evil. Clarice, who seems to have a strong sense of justice and knowledge, is out of character when she accepts this. Her character wouldn't accept that.All in all, the movie's main story and ending sequence is pretty good. You probably know where it is going, but it is still well done. All of my gripes combined, it becomes quite obvious that this is two entirely different films: One half is dedicated to Hannibal, the other half is dedicated to the actual story. The two halves do not fully connect which then makes the film: broken. This is a broken film that doesn't know what it is aiming for. Regardless of it being broken, it is still well shot, well acted, well directed, and much better than the average. I have to give credit where it is due that this film is much better than the average film, but it could've been a great film if it knew what it was aiming for.",The Silence of the Lambs

275,brianberta,One of the best horror films,9,9 July 2016,"When hearing about how terrifying Hannibal Lecter is, one would likely be confused after they look up reviews which explain why he works so well. It's really hard to do what Anthony Hopkins did in this film. While most other actors' performances would be likely dismissed as bland and boring, Hopkins nailed his performance so well that he rightfully earned his place amongst the very best movie villains ever put to screen.A serial killer who goes by the name of ""Buffalo Bill"" kidnaps and kills women to skin them and make them into coats. An F.B.I. cadet named Clarice Starling has to confide in a cannibalistic serial killer locked up in prison to help her locate him before he kills someone who he recently captured, Catherine Martin.When the viewer is first introduced to Dr. Hannibal Lecter, Starling is walking down an ominous hallway. She walks past other criminals locked up. The first few she walk by behave as you would expect. One is smiling and saying ""Hi"" to her, and the last one is jumping up at the prison bars. When she gets to the end of the hall, Dr. Hannibal Lecter is standing up and facing her with a blank expression on his face. He is still and motionless. He says ""Good morning"" to her calmly. He seems harmless. As Starling continues to talk to him, the viewer has a minor sense of relief for what the film could've thrown at us, but Hopkins' voice gives the viewer a feeling of deception which makes that sense of relief vanish. This is the first time we're introduced to him, and Lecter is able to unnerve the viewer so much by conveying so little. The great scripting and great acting made him quite a memorable character.Seeing his calmer moments on screen are very memorable. However, it leaves you wondering what he's capable of. Eventually, about 2/3 of the way into the film, the viewer gets to see Lecter pop in one of the most horrifying and memorable horror movie scenes of all time. The scene is so unexpected, and the sheer creativity of it is out-and-out disgusting to even think about. Watching the film a second time, it's frightening to find out what could've happened to Clarice Starling if their calm meetings had played out differently. However, it becomes very apparent that he wouldn't harm her as he grows to value her company. He never threatens her, and he always acts helpful and nice to her. Also, after he finds out how they both share similar childhood wounds, the viewer loses suspicion that he'll do something bad to her. Also, it took me a little while to pinpoint how that was a very effective piece of dialogue which got me to actually identify with Hannibal Lecter.It's a great accomplishment that the film gets us to like Hannibal Lecter. The reason is because he helps Starling locate Buffalo Bill which would also save Catherin Martin from him in the process, and he proves to be very helpful to her throughout the film. Also, the audience senses that he won't hurt her. On top of that, Hopkins performance brings wit and style to the character. The character of Dr. Hannibal Lecter succeeds on so many different levels.There are several scenes from the film which work very well at terrifying the viewer. The scene when ""Buffalo Bill"" kidnaps Catherine Martin is a believable technique which seems like it would work in real life. It shows how after you get too close to ""Buffalo Bill"" for too long, you would reach a point of no return, and by the time you realize that something bad is going to happen, it would already be too late.One of the most memorable kill scenes from horror movies happens near the final 1/3 of the film. I won't spoil it, but it works very well. Earlier in the film, it hinted that something was up after he stole a character's pen. Once you realize what's going to happen, you're left waiting for Lecter to pop as you've waited to see for a long time. The scene is very gory, and the aftermath of it is even more sickening. When you think that the scene's finally over, the film pulls the rug out from under you, and it shows you a creative, yet highly appalling image which likely won't leave your head anytime soon.The scene at the end in Buffalo Bill's was an amazing idea for a climax. It is so suspenseful, and as soon as it starts, you have minimal hope that it will turn out good. Then, director Jonathan Demme adds in one final aspect into the movie to up the tension so high that it's one of the most suspenseful climax's ever for a film. He makes it seem clear that Starling won't go home unless she either gets a miracle or gets badly injured in the process. This scene is terrifying, because of the film's clever manipulation of the visuals and the fact that we've come to really like Starling, and we don't want anything to happen to her.In conclusion, this is definitely a masterpiece, and it's one of the best horror films of all time. Anthony Hopkins' performance was perfect, and this movie should be looked at and studied off of for years to come. Other horror movie directors should study off of Dr. Hannibal Lecter and many actors should definitely try to do what he did. After the viewer witnesses all of the pros that this movie has to offer, it leaves you a brilliant closing scene which lets you go off on a high note. Anyways, I do wish that I could talk about this film longer, but I'm having an old friend for dinner.",The Silence of the Lambs
276,Alex-372,I'm having an old friend for dinner,10,5 June 2002,"Silence Of The Lambs is one of the most influential horror movies of the early 1990s. It inspired Se7en and a host of other rip-offs (like Copycat). Outstanding performances by Anthony Hopkins, Jody Foster, Scott Glenn as well as Diane Baker and Kasi Lemmons make this movie extremely memorable. If you're at all into horror movies, let alone serial killer movies, this is the movie to see. The movie is based on Thomas Harris' second book featuring Hannibal Lecter, and it is one of his most researched ones, creating a sense of detail that is unmatched in most humdrum movie scripts. I think that's the real secret of this movie. The story is deceptively simple: FBI academy cadet Starling (Foster) is manoeuvred to interview serial killer Hannibal Lecter (Hopkins) in his high security cell, because Lecter may or may not have information on another serial killer on the loose, ""Buffalo Bill"". Bill's latest victim is Katherine Martin, the daughter of a female senator and the clock, as they say, is ticking. The movie's psychological battles are not only between Starling and Lecter, but between she and her boss Jack Crawford, Senator Martin, Paul Krendler and head of the asylum, dr. Chilton (Anthony Heald's breakthrough performance - Law & Order, 8MM). Also, the movie is structured as a journey of discovery, for Clarice, who must face the horrors of her own past, as well for Lecter and ""Buffalo Bill"". It's director Jonathan Demme's achievement that he puts the emphasis of the story on the psychological battles, rather than the gore. This is also what makes this movie unique. 10 out of 10, because it's one of the great and significant movies of all time.",The Silence of the Lambs
277,HelloTexas11,a few thoughts on a classic,10,15 January 2008,"One of the things that strikes me whenever I watch 'Silence of the Lambs' again is how different Jodie Foster looks at various points in the movie. I don't know if this is deliberate or just the way her face comes across when filmed from different angles and with different lighting. At the risk of sounding as though I'm only focusing on her physical appearance, she sometimes appears radiantly beautiful, other times cute in a tomboy-ish way, and sometimes downright unattractive. I mention this because there are a number of quirky details in 'Silence of the Lambs' that one only picks up on with repeated viewings, and they all fall together in such a casual, unforced way that it's easy to believe they just happened. But no film turns out this well by accident. The director, Jonathan Demme, might have gotten lucky with one or two shots but I have to believe nearly everything in this movie was calculated to create the exact effect each renders. Anthony Hopkins had, prior to 'Lambs,' never been a favorite actor of mine. I was never particularly impressed with him in any role. In fact, it would be hard to think of one part that Hopkins was really identified with. But if ever the actor and the character and the moment came together in perfect realization, it was in this film. Hopkins grasps the complexities of Hannibal Lecter and presents them in such a way that it is now impossible to think of one and not the other. Just as Thomas Harris does in his books, Lecter is on film depicted as a cannibalistic madman but so much more than that; he is polite, resourceful, intolerant of most other criminals, tasteful, sophisticated... not to mention a genius. Given what Hannibal has done in the past and has every intention of doing in the future, his character would seem the most unlikely to appear even slightly sympathetic to the audience. And yet he does. Clarice Starling is a more straightforward character, easier to figure out, but Jodie Foster embodies her in a similar way. She is single-minded, on an almost holy quest to achieve success as an FBI agent, to rescue the helpless and imprison the guilty. She pushes herself relentlessly though Starling is not typically reflective unless forced into it by Lecter. When he tells her during their first meeting, ""You're so ambitious, aren't you?"", he has her nailed, dead to rights. Over the course of the film, Hannibal Lecter begins to display other qualities that almost qualify as superhuman. He is immensely strong. He can apparently control and manipulate his body's functions to create false readings. He seems at times capable of both telepathy and empathy. Nothing supernatural is suggested, only such finely-honed skills of observation and reasoning that not even the smallest detail escapes his notice. And most importantly, he never fails at anything he sets out to do. By the end of the film, one is convinced Lecter could have escaped from that jail cell anytime he wanted. In fact, his escape from the cage in Memphis is so improbable that in retrospect it borders on magic. For everything to have happened in the order it did and with the precise timing it needed to happen beggars belief, to say the least. And yet it is so well-staged, and we are so convinced by this point that Hannibal is perfectly capable of pulling it off, the audience never questions it.",The Silence of the Lambs
278,Ziya90,"Phenomenal, but flawed",7,30 December 2009,"Silence of the Lambs is a phenomenal movie. May be it was Anthony Hopkins's best performance, or one of the bests, and the character Hannibal Lecter was unforgettable, phenomenal too. Besides those, there were a few scenes which deserve to be put in cinema anthology! However, this doesn't mean that the movie is a quintessential masterpiece. There is no problem with Jodie Foster, she shines in the movie and she is one of my all time favorite actresses. Her portrayal was so realistic in the movie. The first conversation between Starling and Lecter was epic, unforgettable. I used to watch this scene regularly, after I had bought the movie. And the famous jail scene... Brilliantly horrifying! Jonathan Demme shot this scene honorably, but this does not spread to the movie in general. At times, the movie feels like a TV episode. There are some chilling moments which also works like a real, pure detective movie, but then it turns into an ordinary drama again. There could have been more suspense or mystery. I found the climax of the film pretty weak and low key in a bad way for such a phenomenal movie, I had expected a powerful, absorbing, intriguing final, but there was none. And there is one more flaw in the movie and It is the character Buffalo Bill! He has no background, even no existence! I mean no character study which is weird for such a movie. He is not the focus of the movie, but also he is the key character of the movie. No real investigation, no cat and mouse game, no murder scene... Buffalo Bill seems like he is not an appropriate character for Silence of the Lambs, because it has no point rather than he is Buffalo Bill! Buffalo Bill might have been suitable for Friedkin's Cruising, for instance. Francis Dollarhyde in Manhunter was an unlikeable character for me, but at least, it was a well portrayed character.",The Silence of the Lambs

Hence I find it extremely overrated.The first half is good. It almost convinced me the hype around it is real. But as the second half started, I started getting bored and could not see what's so great about this. It did not seem interesting at all. Even the best scene of the entire film which is the cage scene, it's nothing I've not seen before. I'm fact they are much more intriguing and riveting in newer films. I get why people would've loved it back in the day, but having watched a tonne of films it didn't seem exciting to me.Lot of plot holes in this one. Supposed ""smart"" characters doing dumb things. It is too predictable. The film in itself is entertaining. You're looking forward to what will happen next despite knowing the outcome of the characters' actions. Thus, it's worth a watch.

Had me glued from beginning to finish. This is the best in its genre. If your looking for a great movie then look no further. Just leave your computer now and go get it.Everything in this is done to perfection. The acting, the suspense, the story telling and even its humor.The acting was great. Definitely Anthony Hopkins best performance. He brings Hannibal Lector to life. Jodie Foster also gives her best performance. She was very believable as the rookie FBI agent. Great acting from all involved.Normally when people think of cannibal they think blood and guts. Well there is blood and gusts but it is nicely balanced out.The villain in this was great. The evil was captured perfectly and the actor did a great job. If i haven't convinced you to buy this then just rent it and make your own decision. I highly recommend it.10/10",The Silence of the Lambs
281,pinkliz41,Chilling.,10,26 October 2008,"Review:The Silence of The Lambs is easily one of the greatest films of all time. From it's eerie and atmospheric opening Lambs grabs you and doesn't let go. It's plot is riveting, it's characters unique, it's direction is remarkable and it's acting is top notch. Hopkins character is by far one of the most intriguing and psychotic to have ever been portrayed on film. From the demonic looks to the glaring and unblinking eyes, Hopkins has crafted a menacing and deranged character that only will stand as being one of the greatest roles. The first time we encounter this psycho is in the dark bowels of the asylum, where Hopkins conveys an aura of pure insanity and evil by doing nothing but just standing in the middle of the cell.Lambs is an excellent and taught thriller that boasts great performances as well as an A* worked direction from Demme who works this first rate classic like a symphony orchestra. Demme creates visual style and symbolic substance that take movies and especially thrillers to a new level.Verdict:Scary as hell and thrilling in equal quantities. And a pure acting sensation for Hopkins and Foster.",The Silence of the Lambs
282,j-lacerra,Wonderful,10,9 May 2019,"This is a wonderful movie. So well acted, well constructed, and perfectly directed that it is a joy to watch over and over again. Jodie Foster, Scott Glenn, and Anthony Hopkins are all excellent, as is Ted Levine and all of the supporting players. That said, I must also say that I was never even slightly disturbed by the character of Hannibal Lector or Hopkins' portrayal of him. Actually, Lechter's character is the only point in the movie that I felt leaned just a bit to unbelievability and silliness. Fortunately, Hopkins is such a good actor that he manages to pull it off without being laughable. Great movie. See it!",The Silence of the Lambs

285,cshep,Brilliant Psychological Thriller !!!,10,14 March 2005,"Classic Psycho Drama which attacks the senses and plays mind games with whomever watches it ! Anthony Hopkins(Hannibal Lechter) gives a Tour De Force performance as the ultimate misguided Psychiatrist from Hell, whose ambitions vary from moment to psychotic moment. Lechter known for his exceptional perception,is visited by Clarice Starling (Jodi Foster)a new recruit for the F.B.I., that needs to get Hannibal's insight. Even though Hannibal is incarcerated for most of the movie, you feel that he is in total control. Hannibal gives Clarice clues thru the movie, to solve the ""Buffalo Bill"" case, and to help her advance her career and deal with her psychological problems. In effect he becomes her psychiatrist behind bars, interesting. Watch for their third meeting, where Hannibal's head seems to be floating on the reflective glass, really creepy ! Everyone in the movie , from her boss, Scott Glenn(Jack Crawford) to Jame Gumb(Buffalo Bill), is either seeking advancement or control of their own reality, amazing !!!As Clarice gets closer to solving the case, Hannibal escapes, and then things really get out of control !!!Terrific ending in the home of ""Buffalo Bill"" will leave you on the edge of your seat !!! Great Directing by Jonathan Demme and OUTSTANDING Editing by Craig McCay, take you into the world of Starling and Lechter, but will not let you totally escape from their presence, not a safe movie !!! There are a few flaws, as to how Lechter gets the pen, or how he knows where to phone Clarice, but they are minor.Ted Levine should have gotten Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor, this role could have typecast his career.This movie should be viewed by Adults ONLY !!! I highly recommend ""Silence of the Lambs"", Winner of the TOP 5 Academy Awards, only 3rd movie in history to do so !!!",The Silence of the Lambs
286,papanloveu,Officiall Father Of All Psychopath Movies!!,10,30 July 2021,"The best psychological suspense thriller movie ever made IMO. It's not only the psychological thriller movie and it is also teaches some philosophical thoughts through its core characters.!!Lets take the character Dr. Hannibal Lecter, He is a cannibalistic psychiatric psycho character but if you'd put the microscope in his character by looking in his vision ,we could say that he is looking both human and animal as a food and trying to convey that human beings also a normal living being as same as other living things.And coming to the character agent Clarice starling, she is also same as Dr. Hannibal lecter in treating both as a same living beings . She sees both human and lambs as a respectful living being by showing some kindness and mercy toward lambs which were being slaughtered by her relative and she wants to rescue the character Catherine Martin from the serial killer, Buffalo Bill.With respect to the character Buffalo bill, he loves his dog and he shows very kind and protective towards his dog and he won't respect human being by killing for his use as we the normal people use animals for our use. Our character is just vice versa of his character but emotions are same.And speaking about the last main character, the victim Catherine Martin. This character tries to escape from him by threatening and torturing the dog as we all do at that situation. The character won't mind dog's life and It is the replica of the people we call normal.And among these 4 main characters
1. Dr. Hannibal Lecter.2. Agent Clarice Starling.3. The serial killer Buffalo bill.4. The victim Catherine Martin, We the story listener should decide who is normal and who is abnormal.Talking about the performance of Anthony Hopkins and Judie Foster ,they did some spectacular work as same as the work done by the director and screenplay writer.Not surprised that it got Best five award at Oscars 1991.i recommend it 100% for everyone. - Masterpiece.!",The Silence of the Lambs

It is deep, thrilling, full of suspense, has super interesting characters, especially, Hannibal Lecter.Could very well be the best crime/thriller movie ever made, there really are no movies, you could compare it to, it is unique and elegant in a different way. Dr. Lecter(Anthony Hopkins) truly is an unforgettable character and his conversations with inspector Clarice(Jodie Foster) were the best thing in this movie for sure. There is a reason Anthony Hopkins and Jodie Foster, both(!!!) won an Oscar for this film, not to mention The Silence of the Lambs has 5 Oscars to its name altogether, surely the best movie of 1991.Doesn't matter what kind of movies you are into, you will thoroughly enjoy The Silence of the Lambs, it just has too many outstanding qualities, that it should be impossible to dislike this and even if there are any flaws, you will not notice them, since they get overshadowed by the super interesting and suspense storyline.",The Silence of the Lambs

289,Slarkshark,Psychological Thriller at its Finest,9,16 December 2020,"It would seem some actors are destined for certain roles. They are so good, you couldn't possibly imagine anyone else playing the character. For me, that's Anthony Hopkins as Hannibal Lecter. His sophisticated, yet ominous presence makes it so you can't look away whenever he's on screen.Jodie Foster is also amazing and deserves much credit to the films success. She played the naive, but ambitious trainee agent exceptionally well. She is really no match for Lecter and they both realize that, but she's able to capitalize on her gut feelings. Lecter admires her ambition and drive. When it comes to Foster, I will also automatically think of her role in this movie as Clarice Starling.Buffalo Bill had just enough screen time to make him interesting to the viewer, but is not over saturated. He is not enough to hold a movie alone, and that's what makes 'Silence of the Lambs' great. He is only a side dish, while Lecter is the main course.The ending scene is terrific. Nothing more than simply a phone call, a hint to what comes next, and that continuous fade away scene as the credits roll. It leaves you hungry for so much more.Most definitely a film everyone should see. There are a few disturbing scenes yes, but they are not unnecessary, and honestly makes the film more realistic. It's a superbly smart thriller, not just one looking for cheap thrills or scares.",The Silence of the Lambs
290,KoolCatReviews,Horrific but compelling all the same,9,7 June 2020,This movie really does draw you in and keeps you hooked in till the end. It manages to stay creepy and absorbing throughout. Iconic acting by Hopkins and iconic character in Dr Lecture. Even the minor characters are decently acted. Plot-wise its over complex but still retains enough depth to keep you guessing. The title is clever and so is movie it more about character development than the actual story itself. All in all very clever and perceptive thriller.,The Silence of the Lambs

When we all talk about a film that affected us the most, this should pop into most people minds.  It is extremely well crafted, from the acting, to the direction, editing, cinematography and screenplay.  Anthony Hopkins and Jodie Foster are both brilliant, they give us all a clear example of what good acting is all about, and earned well deserved academy awards for their efforts.  This film is so gripping, it draws you in instantly and it holds you there right until the final credits end.  All I can say is what a movie!  TSOTL delves into the human psyche, and questions the way we think, why we act on things the way we do, is anything incidental?  How can we better judge people so we may have any idea to what goes on inside people's minds.  This film is mind boggling.  While it is  excessively violent in places, it has to be so the viewer can visualise the true horror of the character's actions. Everyone involved with this film should be given a medal, what an achievement.",The Silence of the Lambs
292,patrick_dunne,"A Sick and Twisted, yet smart and satisfying thriller",10,21 October 2005,"Films don't usually get as creepy or thrilling as the top-notch, first-class creepy and chilling thriller known as Silence of the Lambs. There is nothing that can take your breath away with so much style and wit like Silence of the Lambs does. You'll need to watch this film in order to understand how thrillers are created and executed.The young and feminine Clarice Starling, who is training to be an F.B.I. agent, must find the whereabouts of a serial killer named Buffalo Bill. The only way possible is interviewing a captured serial killer named Dr. Hannibal ""The Cannibal"" Lecter.Hannibal Lecter is perhaps the best movie villain that ever lived. Anthony Hopkins plays his role with perfection, because you will hear Lecter's voice stuck inside your head. ""I ate his liver with fava beans and a nice chianti,"" will re-play in your head over and over. Hopkins deserves an Oscar for his portrayal of the most sinister character on the big screen. Creepy, sinister, devilish, clever and cannibalistic-How much better can it get? If the villain isn't enough to entertain you, then perhaps the hero will. Jodie Foster, also a gem as the role, plays the feminine F.B.I agent in training, Clarice Starling. She is seemed to be well-liked (often flirted with) but insecure and very timid. Starling is very realistic, and shows how timid the human nature can be.At a first viewing, all I could keep my mind on was the prison escape scene. I kept repeated the phrase ""Oh God,"" and kept preparing myself for what was next. During a second viewing I realized the depth of the story line and the genius behind it all.One thing this movie definitely has is atmosphere. The killings, the characters, the dialog, and everything else that leads up to the first appearance of Hannibal Lecter makes the film look so delightfully creepy. Even though Hannibal is silent when we first see him, it is considered one of the creepiest introductions ever made. Of course, we can't forget about this man. Even after the ending, he delivers one last line that sends shivers down our spines.Silence of the Lambs may make you a bit disgusted, yet thrilled and excited. You will stay on the edge of your seat.Silence of the Lambs is a masterpiece, atmospheric thriller.10/10",The Silence of the Lambs
293,arthurclay,Good performances but one sick movie,5,5 June 2005,"I know a couple who had actually saw the premiere of this film in Hollywood and actually walked out of it when it started and right past Anthony Hopkins! That alone tells you this is one disturbed film. Hopkins is perfect as Hannibal Lecter, a unimaginably smart and insane serial killer who helps Clarice Starling (Jodie Foster won an Oscar) track down another vicious serial killer named Buffalo Bill. The lines are some of the best you will ever hear and the acting is breathtaking. But it is ridiculously vulgar and sadistic. Not for kids under 18 or for the faint of heart or stomach to be more specific. Followed by Hannibal and Red Dragon also starring Hopkins.",The Silence of the Lambs
294,lagriff05,One of the landmarks of the thriller genre.,8,26 August 2009,"Everyone knows this one; it's a pop culture gem and an icon in the realm of detective/thriller movies. Clarice Starling and Hannibal Lector, an unstoppable pairing and a pleasure to watch - Anthony Hopkins' performance is amazing, and Jodie Foster is always smart, snappy and cute as hell. The supporting actors are okay, sometimes becoming a little hammy or whatever, but never distracting from the film.I think the main selling point of this is Hannibal himself, whose psychological musings and mind games make this movie stand out from others of its kind. Just take a look at his talks with Clarice Starling in the mental asylum - that is chilling. The other inmates are kind of creepy, but they're more silly than anything, and are overshadowed by Lecter himself. The dialogue in these scenes is just great, worth the whole price of admission by itself.The movie flows well, wasting no time and generally being solid in every area, albeit not truly astounding in any of them, either. The story is basically as solid a detective story as you'll get, with every scene making you wonder what is about to happen next. Perhaps the most exciting part of the movie has nothing at all to do with the whole serial killer deal, as it is when Hannibal escapes from prison. You have to see it to find out what I mean - it is truly electrifying and suspenseful.If you haven't seen this yet, you should rectify that immediately. This is a definite genre classic and certainly one any self-acclaimed movie buff needs to see. Recommended.",The Silence of the Lambs
295,mgruebel,Superb Psycho-Thriller,9,13 June 2015,"Director Jonathan Demme and author/screenwriter Harris/Tally are all very talented, but they really outdid themselves here. The more I watch this film, the better it gets. Just the close-up shots of Hannibal Lecter's (Anthony Hopkins) and Clarisse Starling's (Jodie Foster) faces.I recently saw it for the 5th time with my daughter, who saw it for the 1st time. She was on the edge of her seat just as I remember, while I enjoyed the deft plotting, the great characterization, even of side-characters (like the self-absorbed psychiatrist Chilton), who were painted with sparse but knowing strokes.Hopkins and Foster are just perfectly cast, doing the perfect mannerisms, the perfect accents, the perfect everything. The supporting cast is also outstanding, from Starling's boss, who uses her as bait to engage dangerous psychopath Lecter to solve a serial murder case, to the unpleasant psychiatrist Chilton, to the victim held captive in a pit by the serial killer, all the way to the psychopathic serial killer who is sowing himself a female identity out of his victim's skins.The clues abound, and while obvious in hindsight, are subtle enough to be interesting: Southeast Asian moth = criminal is a Vietnam War veteran. Seamstress patterns in closets to reveal where the perpetrator must have learned the sowing trade.Although the gore is very sparse in this film, it is really shocking, and built up just right to cause maximum suspense and ""yech"" factor. The director manages to make you wince even when you don't get to see all that much.So why ""only"" 9/10? After many viewings, I think more and more that the cutting between Starling and her boss at the end, when he enters the wrong house, is too cheap a trick to show that he ended up tracking the wrong person. Likewise, the ""break into the storage"" scene lays on the difficulties with forced entry a bit much. Hitchcock would have stayed away from such low-grade suspense devices. Sometimes less is more. Still, this film is better than a few of the grandmaster's thrillers, and that's saying something coming from a fan who saw his first Hitch while the grandmaster was still filming them!",The Silence of the Lambs

299,sandnair87,You Will be Led Into This Hypnotic Thriller Like 'Lambs' to the Slaughter!,10,31 March 2015,"Jonathan Demme's hypnotic adaptation The Silence of The Lambs, has a solemnity that's been entirely lacking in horror movies lately. Demme's film is frightening on both visceral and intellectual levels, inviting favorable comparison with unnerving classics of the genre. Ingénue FBI agent Clarice Starling (Jodie Foster) is sent to interview, the profoundly mad yet seemingly sane psychiatrist Hannibal Lecter (Anthony Hopkins) to prise clues about another serial killer dubbed 'Buffalo Bill', who has left a rash of unsavory murders along his trail. The killer is abducting corpulent young women, then mutilating them and dumping their bodies. Clarice summons all her courage to face the sadistic shrink, but Lecter has a commanding presence. Relishing the superiority of his intellect, he instantly recognizes her true vulnerability, watching with a self-satisfied smirk as Clarice struggles to maintain her professional composure. Still, there's a glimmer of admiration as Lecter examines Clarice with his penetrating eyes. He offers to help catch the serial killer (who is now holding the daughter of a U.S. senator hostage) but to learn what he knows, Clarice has to engage in his dangerous mind games. Forced to confront her own childhood fears, she hangs on like a terrier until he imparts a vital clue.The Silence of the Lambs is a movie without unnecessary excess, with all its facets merging perfectly in the telling of the tale. Its ghastliness is more psychological than visual, but there is enough of both varieties to shake up almost anyone. It forces us to look at things we would rather not see but it continues to have a vise- like grip on us. But the true strength of the movie lies in its exploration of a place beyond physical revulsion - in the darkest corners of the souls of both the hunters and the hunted. Jonathan Demme exercises a great level of restraint in the midst of portraying madness, running the gamut of emotions while still capturing a clever wit and a searing intelligence. He implicates the audience, dragging us into a vicarious conspiracy with a murderer.But no comment about this film is complete without a mention of the lead cast. Hopkin's Hannibal Lecter is a visual treat; a remarkably lucid portrait of lunacy. As the steely-eyed psychopath, Hopkins plays Lecter with such magisterial authority, that you can almost sense the actor relishing the part. What makes him more than your everyday villain is the piercing intelligence and irresistible charm he brings to the role. Jodie Foster imbues Clarice Starling with such humanity that one can't help but feel connected to her and her pain. It is a testament to her abilities that she holds her own against her scene-stealing co-star. The Silence of the Lambs remains in our minds not only because it frightens, but because it probes and penetrates, tickling our minds while also making our hearts race. A powerfully compelling cinematic experience!",The Silence of the Lambs

That's what it was like for me in 1992 when Silence of the Lambs swept the Oscar's (Best Picture, Director, Actor and Actress).And boy did the movie deserve it. Jonathan Demme's fantastic retelling of the classic book by Thomas Harris. Anthony Hopkins' scene-chewing Hannibal Lecter turned him into a pop culture icon (and unfortunately a slew of middling sequels).

Anothony Hopkins gives a nuanced, refined and haunting performance as the unforgettable cannibal Hannibal Lecter. Anthony Heald proves the perfect person to play an imperious minor official as Dr. Frederick Chilton. Scott Glenn is also notable as Starling's superior in the FBI.The crime story developed is excellent and remains interesting through its various turns as it chronicles the investigative process of agent Starling. One of the keys to this film's success is the well-written dialogue between Starling and Lecter, which is like a game of chess because of Leceter's manipulative tactics.

302,fredericksmith1952,There is something about this film that will continue to haunt me forever.,10,25 February 2012,"There is something about this film that will continue to haunt me forever. Perhaps it is the idea that someone like Lector could actually exist. That thought exists due to the phenomenal acting of Anthony Hopkins. While there are many actors whom I would enjoy the privilege of sharing time with, I think to this day if I were to meet Anthony Hopkins, I would like it to be in an open room with plenty of people. That is how convincing his portrayal of Lector strikes me, and I know many people who feel the same way. Scott Glenn's portrayal of Jack Crawford is cool and calm, exactly what you might expect of a senior agent and department head in the FBI. Jodie Foster's portrayal of the ambitious Clarice Starling is as compelling and haunting as Hopkins', which would account for both of them winning their respective Academy Awards. Demme and the film itself also received Oscars, as did the screenwriters of this exceptional film. The film itself is superbly written, perfectly cast, and splendidly presented in every aspect. Details are important to Demme, obviously, so important that filming was done at Quantico for the academy shots, using actual FBI personnel in the training sequences. Perhaps the most riveting quality of the film is the portrayal of Buffalo Bill, and the ability of Ted Levine to carry off that twisted and complex role. Ted shows us how innocuous evil can be, and presents it with such flair and elegance we can imagine such a man being in a rural town like that, hiding his crimes beneath a veil of anonymity and isolation. Rated R for violence, language, gore, and some partial nudity, this is definitely not a film for the kids or even the young teens, if you ever want them to trust your neighbors and you live in a small town. Collectible? Without a doubt, one of the finest dramas ever brought to the screen.",The Silence of the Lambs

304,BJJManchester,Brilliant if sometimes repellent horror thriller,9,4 September 2007,"One of the most celebrated films of the 1990's,THE SILENCE OF THE LAMBS is a superbly made and acted adaptation of the novel by Thomas Harris,with excellent lead performances,script and direction.The story of FBI rookie Clarice Starling (Jodie Foster) being put in a position of trust by her superiors to trace depraved serial killer Buffalo Bill,but with the help of the equally depraved but charming and intellectual Dr.Hannibal Lecter (Anthony Hopkins) grips totally throughout it's duration,with cleverly judged moments of violence and suspense,with some outstanding and ingenious twists in the plot and construction of the film. This was talented director Jonathan Demme's finest hour as a director,with deeply impressive performances by Hopkins as the warped psycho genius Lecter,and Foster as the somewhat naive,but courageous and gutsy heroine Clarice,one of the most vividly etched female leads in cinematic history.Their duologue's could have been rather static and stagy,but thanks to Demme's faultless handling and the great acting on show by the aforementioned,it come across as totally compelling and fascinating. Support performances by such venerables as Scott Glenn,Anthony Heald,Charles Napier and Diane Baker are also of the top rank,and arguably very few pieces of cinema have ever matched the relentless thrills,shocks and tension that THE SILENCE OF THE LAMBS achieves so successfully. If there is one problem with the film,it is that the details and actions of the depraved principals involved are so overwhelmingly ugly,nasty and repellent that one even questions the imagination and mental state of the writers and filmmakers to invent such horrid,gruesome events for our entertainment.The filmmakers are to be congratulated that THE SILENCE OF THE LAMBS is so brilliantly made that it takes away the feeling of bad taste,but with the sheer repulsiveness of certain story aspects,it is occasionally something of a struggle.The eventually seen character of Jame Gumb (aka Buffalo Bill) must rank as the most relentlessly evil,disturbed and unpleasant villain ever witnessed in mainstream cinema.Convincingly played by Ted Levine,he even makes the murderous antics of fellow nut-case Hannibal seem as relatively innocent and wholesome as a children's picnic! Despite these reservations,THE SILENCE OF THE LAMBS is a considerable success as a gripping and exciting horror thriller,which of course was deservedly rewarded at the Oscars.And if you can take it,it is probably one of the very best of it's kind ever made (if not the best).RATING:8 and a half out of 10.",The Silence of the Lambs

Ted Levine also does a gory job at the insane Buffalo Bill.Alongside with other great Horror Films such as ""Child's Play"", ""Halloween"" & ""Cape Fear"" Remake, this has got to be one of the most creepiest, most intellect films i have ever seen in years.Anthony Hopkins especially can protract his character well onto the screen as he is only in the film for 15-20 minutes.Silence of The Lambs is an unforgettable, chilling, memorable and awesome film that I put on my top 10 List of Films.

308,cdjh-81125,A Chilling Masterpiece,10,14 October 2016,"The Silence of The Lambs is one of my all time favourite movies which surprises me because I am very much not a horror movie fan but I adore this movie it just does everything right not just in terms of a thriller but as a movie as well. Probably the most iconic thing about this movie is the characters and every character has something interesting about them whether it be an unhinged serial killer that has nothing else to lose or a young FBI agent trying to find her way in the world and the latter is what makes Clarice Starling such an excellent protagonist she gives the audience something to relate to in this film and Jodie Foster is absolutely amazing in this film she perfectly captures her characters wit, innocence and fear and is never anything less than convincing. But in the end it was Anthony Hopkins incredible turn as iconic serial killer Hannibal Lector that truly stole this movie. The film takes its time to build up Lecter as an antagonist so that when he isn't on screen were dying for him to return and makes Hopkins performance all the more terrifying. Make no mistake this movie is not for the faint of heart it has a lot of blood, guts and gore but all the violence serves a purpose it allows us to get sucked into this world and know just how much theses characters mean business. While Hannibal Lector is An Antagonist in this film he isn't the main one the main focus of this film is the Hunt for deranged serial killer Buffalo Bill. Not only is the mystery and hunt for him just incredibly interesting to watch but it makes the film an entertaining one its not just a compilation of death scenes it's what gives this movie it's rewatch value along with the scenes where Starling and Lector just talk. We learn so much about these two people in these scenes not just thought exposition but by the way they act towards one and other revealing both of their insecurities. I Can't think of a single person who doesn't at least like this movie it's just so lovable with amazing performances and an excellent main mystery. A+-100%",The Silence of the Lambs

311,cosmorados,"""I've no plans to call on you, Clarice. The world is more interesting with you in it"" and the world is more interesting for this film being in it!",10,13 July 2008,"Clarice Starling is a trainee FBI agent, and although we live in liberated times she is clearly regarded as decoration by most of her male compatriots, after all, she is a woman in a male dominated world. That said we know she is something special when she is the only one left in the elevator on the way to the top. She is asked to go on an assignment by Jack Crawford, a senior figure at the Bureau to profile serial killers, perhaps, to help profile a new killer, Buffalo Bill, a man who skins his victims, different patterns each time and all dumped in different places. The Killer she is given the job of profiling is the one that will not co-operate, the infamous killer Hannibal Lector, formerly a renowned psychiatrist before he went off the rails towards the siding known as insanity.And so Clarice begins a series of interviews with Lector where they both attempt a kind of intellectual and emotional sparring as they try to find out more about each other. As they get to know each other, with Clarice giving more in terms of info and Lector giving more in terms of soul they become unwitting colleagues in the race to stop Bill adding to his list of victims. This film is a modern classic in every sense of the word. The colour seems to have been bled from every frame leading to a drab and desolate world without hope or sympathy. The use of symbolism is some of the best I've ever seen with the bug motif occurring throughout and not just in terms of the killer's signature, be aware of how his eyes look in the night vision goggles, we know that Bees can see in ultra violet and the way in which his vision is turned into one colour is extremely bug-like, however the big parallel with bugs is at the end of the film (Spoiler alert) when we see the figure dying on the floor with the night vision goggles on, with the wounds on both sides of his chest, he dies like an insect, something that many people may not notice.The film is also clever in its usage of more familiar symbolism to make us feel certain ways. As Bill's next victim is driving along we see her singing to a song on the radio, not just singing the main words but flitting between backing and the main lyrics, just the way we all do, making us far more concerned than we would be if she was just driving home, by showing her doing what we all do, she becomes us and we fear far more for her future fate.However, this is not just a film about symbolism, this is a film about the decisions that we make and the decisions that we are forced to make. Clarice is sent on a path to the FBI after the death of her father, he was her world and all she seeks is his approval and by following in his footsteps it is the closest she can think to do that, this is a decision made by circumstance that is unavoidable, and she has no regrets over it. Hannibal by contrast goes fruit loop after dealing with endless whingy whiny patients with no problems when what he wants to do is deal with interesting problems. Somewhere along the way his mind snaps and the discussions that he would have no doubt enjoyed with Clarice are soured by the fact that there are bars between them, this regret is clearly etched on his face when they discus serial killers and Clarice says, so impassively, ""No, you ate yours"", she knows what he is and he doesn't impress her like his mighty intellect should, because he is a killer and to her that is all he is, and, as he realises this and looks away it is this regret that is revealing. Lector loves battling or discussing intellectual matters with equals, and so few ever came his way, and the regret he feels over meeting Clarice clearly too late is portrayed beautifully by Anthony Hopkins who gives the performance of a lifetime in giving us this killer who still contains within him a human soul.This is the glory of this performance, although people have pointed out that his screen time is more warranting a supporting actor nod, there was simply no finer male performance, supporting or otherwise, and perhaps one of the greatest pieces of luck that the film enjoyed was Gene Hackman turning the role down. Anthony Hopkins doesn't just perform Lector, he inhabits him and we get treated to an amazing piece of acting that shows us that Serial Killers, the worst kind of people that there are, are still people, and that this is perhaps the saddest thing about them.To add to this great performance Jodie Foster not only gave a good performance but matched Hopkins perfectly, showing all of Clarice's strength's and vulnerability with such stunning realism that we feel almost every shiver that goes through her skin as she trawls society's bottom step in order to stop a monster feasting endlessly on victims that society does not care much about. Scott Glenn rounds off this acting triumvirate with a measured controlled performance that exactly matches his character.Jonathan Demme's direction is superb, the music compliments every scene with an uneasy balance that never allows you to settle in your seat and the script is first rate. After I thought about this film and considered how good it was I tried to think of some reason to give it a nine, and I couldn't. This film really is a ten and although the subject matter is not everyone's cup of tea, it is worthwhile for those who have a hard enough stomach.",The Silence of the Lambs

313,billion_mucks,Gnaw its way to the Mind Terror,10,26 November 2007,"""Silence of the lambs"" is one of the masterpieces of the last decade. And does it have its reasons. First of all, it's entirely dependant on the terror that gnaws all the way to the mind of the viewer. The decline of the Human Being is magnificently chiseled with one liners that amusingly depict the killers and psychopaths state of mind and approach us carefully into a nature that is deformed, evil and sick of the Man's putrefaction.The main spectacle is drawn between Jodie Foster and Anthony Hopkins. Both entirely relevant to the movie, they produce a bright contrast and with their performances they nail the feelings right and expose one of the best duels on movie history. This duel, although, is not conventional. Clarice Starling (Foster) will use Hannibal Lecter's (Hopkins) profound knowledge of the criminal mind to capture the infamous Buffalo Bill. But Hopkins will play a game in which their personalities will engage in a retroactive combination, in a ""quid pro quo"" mind spar: she will have to expose her most profound, hidden secrets to Lecter, so he can also dispatch on his pleasure of analyzing the suffering of others. Both of them reveal all of their character's whole personality with their eyes: Foster is in constant pressure, scared but facing the natural Hades with courage and Hopkins shows human emptiness in his eyes, windows to what is a world full of depravations.Ted Levine is truly scary. You get the impression that he is the true Buffalo Bill, twisted and perverse. He shows absolutely no human, recognizable aspect. He is a terrible villain.The movie will straightly envelop you in an obscure labyrinth where the human mind is retorted and rotten, with a depressing score and settings that are grey, murky and never joyful. One has to see it to get a close approach on the dark side of the mind it or at least, to make their spirit shake and tremble.",The Silence of the Lambs
314,shaun98,Excellent thriller/drama **some spoilers!**,8,6 December 2002,"In some ways, ""The Silence of the Lambs"" is what pure horror is made of. It does not have the excessive gore of some slasher movies, but taps into human fears in a way few films can ever hope to accomplish. Fears such as being trapped in a dark basement, being stalked by a madman, skinnings, and rotting corpses; all are incorporated into the narrative in one coherent package. This is not a cheesy horror movie; it's a dark, gloomy thriller--somber and eerie to the core, with stark, painful images. There is almost no humor or sunshine; few horror films actually succeed at being serious, but this one does, making it one of a select few along with ""Alien,"" ""Hellraiser,"" and ""The Exorcist."" Director Jonathan Demme (for whom this film may be the one he is most associated with) keeps this moving at a steady pace, with the suspense being nearly unbearable at times. There are few shock moments, but the taut direction makes them truly effective without resorting to cheap ""splatter movie"" tactics. Like other standouts in the genre, much of the horror is psychological.The real meat of the story comes from the symbiotic relationship between the protagonist, FBI trainee Clairice Starling, and the imprisoned madman Hannibal ""The Cannibal"" Lector. In the role of the latter, Anthony Hopkins is one of the most memorable psychopaths in film, delivering a performance that effectively conveys the essence of evil. Like Dracula or ""Hellraiser's"" Pinhead, he is not a mindless beast, but an articulate, intelligent creature, making him much more dangerous. However, the film is really Starling's story. Screenwriter Ted Tally and star Jodie Foster work to create a multilayered, complex heroine, struggling to overcome her unhappy childhood. Lector finds her intriguing, since she may be the only true intellectual equal he has encountered in many years. She wishes her assistance in tracking down the serial killer Buffalo Bill; he tests her, tantalizing her with subtle clues to challenge her emerging intellect (there is an interesting theme of deception running throughout the film, as every major character lies to or misleads one another to some degree). Foster's character directly defies the admittedly sexist portrayals in many other horror movies.There are solid supporting performances as well; Scott Glenn is rock-solid as Starling's supervising officer--and a father figure as well. He studied with a real detective to prepare for his role, and the effort paid off; he seems more like a real law enforcement officer than an actor. Anthony Heald plays a pompous asylum head, and he does so well enough. Ted Levine is really creepy as Buffalo Bill, the type of person you'd only expect to see in a nightmare. Unlike Lector, he's not especially intelligent or articulate--he's not even a very good liar, as it turns out--but he is truly the master of his own little domain. His character is truly nuts, and I suspect the filmmakers were thinking of Leatherface from ""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre.""It's difficult to believe ""Silence of the Lambs"" one Best Picture; some reactionary Academy Award members must have seen this as a slasher movie. Given the subject matter, it's certainly not for the faint-hearted; there are moments that practically define horror--such as Starling being trapped in that dungeon-like basement. It's not perfect either; certain details of how Bill is finally tracked down might be confusing without paying close attention. Nonetheless, for years to come, it has been regarded as one of the cornerstones of modern horror, and Hannibal Lector is destined to be a cult figure for the rest of time.***1/2 (out of ****)Released by Orion Pictures",The Silence of the Lambs

316,Chromium_5,The Grand Guignol meets the Keystone Kops.,8,3 January 2005,"(EDIT: I don't know what I was thinking when I wrote this review. Just ignore it. I'll update it someday. This is a fantastic movie. My comments about the police force still stand, though.)I think I will cover the things I liked about this film first, since it is a very short list:--Jodie Foster's performance. She is very believable and deserved her Oscar. --Ted Levine's performance. He is undoubtedly one of the sickest, most twisted villains to ever appear on screen, and, in my opinion, a lot more scary than Hannibal.--The scene where Foster is being stalked by Buffalo Bill in his house. Now THAT was scary. It is a classic suspense scene.Now, the things I did NOT like:--Anthony Hopkins' performance. Too grandiose and over-the-top; not anywhere near realistic. Everyone talks about what a fantastic performance he gives, but I think if you NOTICE what great acting someone is doing, then they're probably overacting. Plus, his character comes across as being actually likable... a guy you'd like to sit and chat with. He is not scary, just mildly interesting. He apparently has superpowers, too, since he manages to pull off the most unrealistic jailbreak of all time. I don't know how he found the time to even THINK of a scheme like that, much less actually do it. He outwits the entire police force, which brings me to my next point...--The total incompetence of the FBI. I'm not sure whether this was intentional or not, but it was ridiculous and borders on parody. The fact that a rookie like Foster is assigned to the case is unrealistic enough, but then she manages to crack the case All By Herself when she discovers a key piece of information: Buffalo Bill knew his victims. NO WAY!! My God, the girl is a genius! No other investigator with years of experience under their belt could figure this out, but Foster the rookie had a brainstorm and outdid them all. The local police are even worse. They are shown as a bunch of inept morons. During the jailbreak sequence, if it wasn't for all the human mutilation and whatnot, you'd think you were watching an episode of ""Reno 911."" And finally...--The movie is sick. Sick, sick, sick. Little sympathy is shown for the victims, and it feels like the movie is not showing these bizarre killings as a portrait of serial killers (otherwise they might have included actual motivations for Bill and Hannibal), but just for the sake of being disgusting. It's shock theater, plain and simple. I said I liked Ted Levine's performance, but his scenes were still unpleasant to watch. I doubt most people exited the theater thinking, ""Well, that was a fascinating glimpse into the mind of a psychopath,"" but more likely, ""WOW! Hannibal chewed a guy's face off! COOL!"" Really, what's the point? All the scenes with Hannibal feel more like a movie script than anything that could happen in real life. A realistic portrayal of a cannibalistic psycho would have been scary, but the majority of this movie, save for a few great scenes, is just corny and gross.",The Silence of the Lambs

318,Kubris,The nature of the beast,9,22 January 2012,"IMDb Top 250: 26Some films grab you in the first scene. Some grab you later on, and well some films don't grab you at all. The Silence of the Lambs gets your attention before you sit don to see it. It grabs you before you even think about seeing it. That's because the title alone is interesting: poetic, graceful, yet sinister. So you look it up, and the premise is more... dangerous... than the title even: An FBI trainee confides in an incarcerated, cannibalistic murderer to catch another serial killer who skins women. Wow. That's heavy stuff- now how does it relate to lambs? And from there you're hooked. Some books don't make good film material. The Silence of the Lambs made a masterpiece.It's no secret- the film is extraordinary. One of only 3 films to win all the 'major' Oscars (and personally it's the best of them), 'Silence' practically started the modern dark-crime sub genre. From Seven to The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo, it can all be traced back to this, and with good reason. Based on excellent source material, which I finished yesterday and will draw on later, The Silence of the Lambs has been imitated, parodied and drawn from an impossible amount of times, but the original still stands on its own.I've already mentioned the exquisite plot, a great mystery, or thriller, or horror, or however you define it. A huge success of the film is its atmosphere, a very dark, draining world. This is achieved through dark colours, small sets, and a haunting score by Howard Shore that is equally influential, even in his own later work like Seven. It never takes the credit, but constantly accompanies the action.The Academy will tell you how excellent the characters are. At the forefront are the two winners, Clarice and Lecter. I believe Clarice to be arguably the greatest female heroine ever. She is strong and determined, work-oriented in her male dominated world. But at the same time she can show vulnerability and fear. It's amazing. I'm glad the sub-subplot of her mild romance was removed. Hannibal Lecter. There's a name you won't forget, nor a face you'll forget. It's all been said before: Anthony Hopkins delivered one of the most legendary performances in cinema history as the charming and terrifying doctor. His facial expressions, his voice, his choice of words, even his posture. A perfect example of quality over quantity. The scenes these two share are very intense, with closeups. Lots of closeups.There's three other characters worth mentioning: Crawford, Starling's mentor, is the likable and work focused head of the Buffalo Bill case. While he suffered the most loss in transfer from book to screen, as well as the whole plot of his wife being removed, he is still likable, due to an honest performance. On the other hand, Chilton, the asylum doctor, is an absolute slimeball. He's a great character, but something about the portrayal is off. Lastly, and the most important one, Buffalo Bill, Jame Gumb. He is the single most terrifying, creepiest villain in fiction. He was scary in the book and in the film he'll make your stomach churn. The voice and look, and unbelievably freaky, scary, disturbing dance mark a CRIMINALLY underrated performance by Ted Levine, who I cannot see in any other role now. He IS Buffalo Bill.The first time I saw the film, one key thing I remember is the patience the film exhibits. Coarse language is used only when necessary, but more importantly is how violence and gore is treated. The book wasn't a gorefest, but there were ample opportunities for shock violence, like the picture of the nurse or the autopsy room. For the most part, the visual is held back, until that one sequence, and you'll know what I mean, when everything is gruesomely put on the table, and into your mind is burned several terrible images. Great films have patience, and this is a great film.I usually don't read source material, but I had to read this one. I'm not used to it, so I don't know how much films usually cut out from their books. But 'Silence' is very true to the core of the novel. The screenplay cuts out what you might expect: character development and history, as well as Bella, Klaus, the media and Southern angles, and unfortunately (for me) Barney and Bill's story. The film is short, just under 2 hours, but even with these shortcuts maintains the slow pace of the book. However the adaptation is very faithful to the book, and rises above in some places.Some scenes are handled much better with visuals. Lecter's cell is much better with glass instead of bars and nylon mesh (?), and the key sequence in Tennessee is spectacular, with the violence. And the ambulance, let to the imagination in the book, leaves viewers is absolute terror.Bookended by a great opening and closing, The Silence of the Lambs marks a milestone in film. It is an influential modern classic with brain and brawn, amazing performances and characters, and a smart plot. It's an icon of the genre, and a must see. 9.4/10",The Silence of the Lambs

On the other hand it badly tries to be a 90s action thriller, with a bad script, and horrible editing.For example, there is a lot of detail in the movie but the dialogue sometimes references events that are not clear as if the viewer would pick it up quickly. Another example is in one of the final scenes when the lead detective finds the empty house and realizes Clarice was in danger - but how could he have known. She merely stumbled upon the killer following up on an old lead in a cold-ish case, so I don't understand the reason for all the drama and that quick zoon in shot was horrible.I think the novel is probably much better than the movie - the latter appears to have been hastily made. I do not understand why it got Oscars for best Movie and certainly does not deserve the best Adapted Screenplay.

The story is very gripping and interesting and filled with great moments like the parallel editing in the end when we're led to believe that the FBI is at the right house but they turn out to be wrong and it's in fact Clarice that is on Buffalo Bill's doorsteps or Lecter's escape when he literaly puts on the face of the guard.

Jonathan Demme's taunt direction ties all the elements together flawlessly, and delivers outstanding performances from his stars.Jodie Foster brings her innate intelligence and charming naiveté to her role of FBI agent Clarice Starling, and she should receive major kudos for portraying her character's strength as stemming from her brain rather than any pumped-up Sigourney Weaver-esquire physical prowess. Anthony Hopkins also delivers a tremendous performance that and belies his relatively brief screen time with immense effectiveness. He is so menacing that it feels like he's everywhere, even though he is only on-screen for roughly one-fourth of the picture. Scott Glenn and Kasi Lemmons are fine, but underused - this is the Foster and Hopkins show all the way! The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences were certainly fans of the film, as SILENCE OF THE LAMBS swept the Academy Awards, deservedly winning Oscars in all five major categories. This was only the third film in history to do so.A perfect motion picture.",The Silence of the Lambs
327,Rino_Bortone,FASCINATING FEAR,10,26 December 2019,"Silence of the lambs offers one of the most controversial and fascinating stories in the history of cinema. A picture that for the entire duration is a mixture of comedy / theatrical tragedy and a cult film (which it later became). We witness the whole story, frame to frame, step by step from a glorious balcony of a theatre stage made of wood and blood, with spotlights focused on some of the greatest actors in history and of that time. Unprecedented direction, incessant rhythm that keeps glued to the armchair, almost as if Dr. Hannibal had chained us all himself.",The Silence of the Lambs
328,Svenstadt,"Overrated, intellectualized, ritualized trash heap!",3,5 April 2019,"This movie is just a mess from beginning to end. First of all, actors and actresses have a tendency to overact, so writers and directors will always try to throw realism out the window so that they can indulge themselves! While the character of Dr. Lecter is not technically impossible, it is highly unlikely. Sociopaths in real life are much more likely to be low functioning, impulsive, and not very good book learners. So this movie starts off with a bad premise. I'm not a very big fan of Jodie Foster movies to begin with, and her character is very annoying to me. The best part of the entire film is the Buffalo Bill (Ted Levine) scenes. The idea that Lecter would give Starling such highly intellectualized clues is improbable, but I suppose I am being overly critical here. This is still less annoying than Manhunter, but not by much!!",The Silence of the Lambs
329,martinpersson97,A captivating thriller with nuanced characters,10,1 September 2020,"(Note: this movie is not a 10. I rated the trilogy as a whole, whereas this individual movie is a 9 out of 10)!From master-director Jonathan Demme comes a very complex thriller featuring Jodie Foster in the main role as an FBI traine being forced to cooperate with a convicted serial killer and cannibal to find a murderer.Being loosely based on Michael Mann's Manhunt, as well as a series of novels, this movie far surpasses the (already great) sourc material. What really sells it all is the characters and the actors portraying them.Jodie Foster portrays the handy but traumatised Clarice in such a complex way, that is, perhaps, only surpassed by Anthony Hopkins in the role as the elegant but at the same time incredibly scary cannibal Hannibal Lecter. Hopkins gives us one of the most memorable movie villains of all time, standing side by side with characters such as Darth Vader, Norman Bates, Bruno Antony, or Heath Ledger's Joker.At the same time, Demme and the actors manage to convey a sense of sympathy for characters such as Hannibal or the serial killer Buffalo Bill, sometimes more than the actual authoritian figures.The camera work and cinematography is outstanding, and complements the artestry of the film in a perfect way.Overall, it is a masterfull standalone, that also lead to two equally good sequels, a TV-show and a movie prequel, reionforcing the popularity of these characters. Truly worthy of its spot on IMDb's Top 250 list!",The Silence of the Lambs

The sexual tension was unbelievable in some of those scenes ( when he strokes her hands through the bars).See this movie.",The Silence of the Lambs
331,Arkaan,Brilliant and fascinating,10,1 August 1999,"I have to say that The Silence of the Lambs ranks as one of the best thrillers of the decade.  Anthony Hopkins portrayal of Hannibal Lecter is nothing short of remarkable.  The first scene where we see him is beautifully done.  His voice is utterly chilling and he seduces you into liking him, a difficult task. Jodie Foster also gives a great performance as Clarice Starling, sent to interview Lecter in the hopes that it will lead to the capture of Buffalo Bill. Their four scenes together are nothing short of magnificent.  The tension that appears is real, and we feel it.     Jonathan Demme is a director whom I have never really admired.  Now, I can say that I do, and this movie is a masterpiece of direction.  Especially the climax.  He also directs the final confrontation scene between Hopkins and Foster very well.  It plays out a perverse parody of a love scene, and there is a lot of sexual tension (especially when he strokes her finger at the end of it).  Simply stated, a great movie experience, and worthy of it's place on the AFI list.",The Silence of the Lambs

333,jamiecostelo58,Hard-hitting but strong thriller,8,15 December 2006,"Not an easy film to watch, but gripping all the same. Anthony Hopkins delivers one of the most complex and disturbed characters in the history of cinema, while a young Jodie Foster shines as the ambitious and smart Clarice Starling, on the trail of a deranged psychopath known as Buffalo Bill. But in order to find this man, she is going to need Hannibal Lecter's help...The horrifically disturbing manner of Buffalo Bill is powerfully delivered by Ted Levine, and in no doubt set the standard for how other thrillers are measured.The dreadful consequences of being a victim of a deranged psychopath is displayed to graphic effect in this now legendary award-winning film as we witness the horror and evil of this person's mind which in no doubt will send shivers down the spine.I've awarded The Silence of the Lambs eight points, which may mean nine to everyone else!",The Silence of the Lambs
334,MUFCOK,One of the greatest thrillers of all time,9,9 February 2015,"I read somewhere that Anthony Hopkins has little more than 15 minutes actual screen time in a feature that runs just under two hours. For me, whenever Silence of the Lambs is brought up I instantly think of Dr Hannibal Lecter. This speaks volumes for how much of a powerful and memorable performance he gives as one of the best villains of all time, despite only featuring for around an eighth of the movie. His performance/character is faultless and gives a completely different approach to so many other villains we see in the movies, he is calm, well educated, has an intelligent vocabulary, witty sarcasm and is brutally honest. But on the other hand he is also intriguing, disturbing and very uneasy to watch. The greatest thing about him though is how he is caged off from the world in each of his scenes, like a monster, he isn't accessible and comes across as untouchable. The most baffling thing of all though is that despite Hopkins playing a serial killer cannibal who is criminally deranged, you actually have a strange sense of fondness towards him. At one point I felt myself feeling sorry for him, how is that even possible? Hats off to the creators and Anthony Hopkins for that to give the viewer that feeling, quite the achievement!Jodie Foster gives an incredible performance and this is easily my favourite out of all the roles she has played. She plays a young, trainee detective who is extremely vulnerable and is struggling to deal with the demons of her childhood. Buffalo Bill is a serial killer on the loose and the FBI are running out of time to catch him, Jodie Foster's character is sent to visit Hannibal Lecter to do research into the mind of a serial killer. She visits him in his confined mental institute where he is serving his life sentence. Hannibal Lecter starts to mentor Jodie Foster and the few scenes we get of these two, either on opposite side of reinforced glass are some of the most intense but somehow touching scenes I have experienced.The plot is perfect and stays very grounded, it knows what it wants to be and it stays true to itself throughout. It doesn't get over complicated or take any unnecessary risks, it simply does what it needs to and the actors do the rest with their fantastic characters and script. There is one scene in particular that stays in my mind when thinking of this movie and It is very tense and disturbing but shows us just what we need to see, it isn't overly gory for the sake of it. This is what Silence of the Lambs does so well, it is very graphic yet it doesn't make you want to look away in disgust, instead it connects with you very well.Silence of the Lambs has it all, it has a solid plot, characters with depth and development, incredible acting, tension and a great script. All it needs in my opinion is some more screen time for Hannibal Lector as he really is a faultless villain but then on the other hand the way he is used is subtle and could well be more effective because of this. Silence of the Lambs is one of the greatest thrillers I have seen and it deserves all the awards and accolades it has received over the past 24 years.9/10",The Silence of the Lambs
335,murtaza_mma,A Potpourr of Vestiges Review: Hannibal - The Cannibal,9,24 April 2009,"Silence of the Lambs is a quintessence of a profound character study and a rare and vivid demonstration of an actor's subtle brilliance and his improvisation in manifestation of a nebulous entity (Lecter), almost single-handedly immortalizing it and in the process elevating himself to a position of unqualified envy and ubiquitous acclaim. In fact, one is likely to suffer, either from inarticulacy or verbosity while describing Anthony Hopkins portrayal of sadistically sophisticated Dr. Hannibal Lecter. Lecter's trademark, his wide open glacial eyes, devoid of any emotion, not only makes him deviously equanimous, but also egregiously peculiar. The fast, slurping-type sound invented by Hopkins that Lecter does, is as fascinating as it is chilling and Lecter's infamous ""Good evening, Clarice"", is as enthralling as it is vicious. Anthony Hopkins's performance is the shortest ever and the most memorable to win an Oscar in the leading category. Hopkins as Lecter, is incontrovertibly and incredibly at the top of his game and it is his brilliance that gets the best out of the other actors, especially Jodie Foster. In fact, it won't be a hyperbole, that Anthony Hopkins's portrayal of cannibalistic Hannibal Lecter in Silence of the Lambs and more so in its sequel, Hannibal (which is my favorite of the series, as the story completely revolves around Lecter, giving him more exposure), is one of the best, the world of cinema has ever seen or offered. In spite of having some of the most gruesomely disturbing and viciously graphic sequences, Silence of the Lambs, is one of the most decorated and enthralling movies of all time.

The Silence of the Lambs is right in my top-10 list for the best films of the decade (1990-1999), and after viewing it, it may be in yours too.The acting is brilliant from all involved. Jodie Foster's performance is one to cheer for every step of the way, but the real star of the show, even for how his character plays out in the ""big picture"", is Anthony Hopkins. There's not one scene where we do not fear what this psychopathic genius Hannibal Lecter knows, and every moment he appears on screen your heart will sink -- even if his screen time is VERY short. Ted Levine is very good as Buffalo Bill and sightly underrated for his performance.Howard Shore's music is haunting, terrifying, and uncomfortable, making it a score I'd recommend to anyone who listens to orchestral music. From tone to realization, Shore's intense music sets the stage for what we see, making it a great achievement -- probably the best of the decade as well.The story is very graphic. The violence is pretty heavy, and the first scene between Clarice and Hannibal are disturbing -- especially the moment when she is about to leave; definitely not for young viewers.The story is very enthralling and extreme. The mystery and suspense works every time, and Jonathan Demme and Ted Tally deserve every award they get.Overall, I highly recommend this film to those who can watch such an intense film with deeply disturbing subject matter. This is just one horrifying and excellent masterpiece that you must see.",The Silence of the Lambs
342,BeanieCore,The most esteemed of horror films.,9,19 November 2020,"This may all together, be the most successful horror film of all time. It's easily the most esteemed, as one of the few more gruesome pictures whose artistry shone through enough that not even awards ceremony snobs could look down their noses at it. It also irrevocably changed the landscape of popular film, making serial killer thrillers and police procedurals the bankable industries that they remain today. Some would argue whether or not it qualifies as a true horror film, but I see no argument for it's not being one. This is a film very different from most thrillers. It focuses itself almost solely on the psychological torment of it's characters, and thusly, it's most often trying to scare and unnerve it's audience, in a manner that only horror films ever do. But it's a refined, artistic film. One more concerned with character and subtle commentary than guts and gore. What truly elevates it, is the amazing cast. Nothing really need be said for the performance of Sir Anthony Hopkins as Hannibal Lector. He crawls under the skin, and stays there. Truly the boogeyman, if he was ever captured on screen. Foster's performance is just as fantastic, and layered with emotions. Even Ted Levine brings thoughtfulness and subtlety to Buffalo Bill, despite not being given as much to work with. The film is also layered with sublte feminism, the kind that is ever-present, without ever needing to make statements out loud. Agent Starling is constantly fighting to be respected by her peers, in a clearly male dominated field. Men are attempting to manipulate her from all sides, whether it be Lector's riddles, leading her on, or creepy colleagues treating her as less. And the film's more graphic moments are handled with a sense of quiet urgency and humanism. For the mark it's had on film tropes, and the pure craftsmanship in it's making, this is forever a classic, and proof that horror can be so dignified and artful, that years later, the snobs are still trying to argue whether or not it is horror at all. It is, and it's a masterpiece at that.",The Silence of the Lambs

346,thelastblogontheleft,Where will it tickle you?,10,4 December 2017,"The Silence of the Lambs, the second film adaptation of one of Thomas Harris's novels featuring the character of Dr. Hannibal Lecter, is just a masterpiece. There's no other way to describe it. It was only the third film to win Academy Awards in all of the top five categories (Best Picture, Best Actor, Best Actress, Best Director, Adapted Screenplay), the first Best Picture winner widely considered to be a horror movie (only the third even nominated), and it is considered ""culturally, historically, or aesthetically"" significant by the U.S. Library of Congress. It's one of those rare films where everyone is just cast perfectly — an amazing feat considering Al Pacino was considered for the role of Lecter (yikes).It follows young FBI trainee Clarice Starling (Jodie Foster) as she is asked by the head of the Bureau's Behavioral Science Unit (Scott Glenn) to interview an imprisoned, cannibalistic psychiatrist-turned-serial killer (Anthony Hopkins) who is believed to be linked to a killer they are currently hunting, known as ""Buffalo Bill"". Starling gets closer than expected to the doctor as she does whatever it takes to catch the monster at large** SPOILERS! **Jodie Foster's ability to portray Starling as both vulnerable yet commanding, young and green and yet self-possessed, giving sideways glances to the many men who attempt to hold her down or hold her back while adeptly sidestepping them, is one of my favorite parts about this film. She is repeatedly shown surrounded by men — in many scenes literally dwarfed standing alongside them — and yet she doesn't shy away. But the theme of women being used is pervasive throughout, from the blatant — Buffalo Bill torturing and ritually killing his female victims for their skin — to the more insidious — Glenn sending Starling, the young, pretty trainee, to get the information he needs from Lecter, all the while excluding her, dismissing her, casting her aside.The cinematography, helmed by Tak Fujimoto, is intense and deliberate. Dr. Lecter is regularly shrouded in harsh shadow; the initial tour through Buffalo Bill's home is simple and unapologetic; symbolism is used with just enough subtlety, such as when Lecter is shown reflected and almost overlaid with Starling's face looking through the glass, or when Starling is grasping blindly through the pitch blackness of Buffalo Bill's home and world. Even scenes whose subject matter are grisly manage to carry a degree of fascinating beauty — Lecter, eyes closed, swaying along to the music, as we see the officers he just murdered with his teeth laying behind him; thick beams of light streaming in behind a body strewn up like an angel with arms outstretched; Buffalo Bill dancing, silk robe falling off his shoulders, tiny squares of light bouncing from a spinning disco ball.As I mentioned, the casting is spot on. There is no one I could imagine doing more justice to Lecter than Anthony Hopkins — he is chilling, calculated, vicious (""when your little girl is on the slab, where will it tickle you?""), fiercely intelligent. Jodie Foster as Starling is naïve and while not completely fearless she is determined. Their chemistry together is what really makes it — the entire scene with the story of the lambs is particularly incredible. Ted Levine as Jame ""Buffalo Bill"" Gumb will make your skin crawl while almost feeling a degree of pity, and his captive in the movie — played by Brooke Smith — does a particularly gut-wrenching job.The music (by Howard Shore) is fantastic — from the very first scene, with Starling running, drenched in sweat, through the foggy woods — it is captivating and haunting.It just so perfectly balances the themes of intelligent psychological thriller and horror. It regards such violence and depravity with a cool casualness that is downright chilling. The dialogue is brilliant. It is brutal and unapologetic while maintaining a neatness, an insistent intention, that makes the aesthetic quality impossible to ignore. And the tension is palpable throughout — you aren't bored for a second — but it reaches a deafening crescendo at the end, with perfect edits made to maintain the mystery and keep you on the edge of your seat. Buffalo Bill watching Clarice through night vision goggles, reaching out to almost graze his hand against her hair, has been imprinted in my memory as one of the scariest scenes ever since I first saw this movie as a kid. And let's not forget how much we're rooting for Lecter by the end, almost grinning as we watch him deliberately trail behind Dr. Chilton, hoping to catch up over dinner laterBrilliant. Just brilliant.",The Silence of the Lambs
347,Derek237,Shocking psychological thriller,10,16 March 2003,"The Silence of The Lambs explores the life and mind of Clarice Starling, a female FBI agent who has a lot of issues to deal with. Somehow by fate, she ends up meeting Hannibal Lector, and they strike up a very unusual relationship. The most interesting parts in the movie deal with the 2 of them just talking.The highlight of the movie is obviously Anthony Hopkins' performance. He's delightfully creepy as Hannibal. The whole suspense of the character is thinking he's about to do something violent, since throughout the movie you only hear stories about the terrible things he's done. When he finally does do something, it really pays off because it's one of the scariest and most memorable parts in the movie.The Silence Of The Lambs appeals to many people. That's because it can be viewed from so many angles, and that's why it's become a part of our pop-culture.

But the movie did become a little bit boring towards the end and I was willing for it to wrap up. Perhaps because something major happened in the middle portion of the movie, and then after that it quickly went flat. The ending was bland. I've watched it twice now, and I've felt the same both times. I much prefer 'Red Dragon' over this one. I easily gave that a high rating.

350,joshuafagan-64214,Still Frightening and Crisp,10,27 August 2016,"Clarice Starling is the perfect name for the protagonist of this film. A starling is a bird, a little bird, that comes in flocks. A single starling by itself is weak, innocent, vulnerable. Clarisse is harder to define, but the long 's' sound makes it sound like a wind blowing through a peaceful field. When I hear the name Clarisse, I think of a rich teenage ingénue in a blue dress leaning dreamily on a white balcony.No, Clarice Starling is not all those things, mostly because she is played by the gritty Jodie Foster, but that is the roll she is cast into at the beginning of the film. She manages to work her way out of her situation as the hunts the serial killer Buffalo Bill, but there is one man who can cast her back into it, one man who can turn her back into a ten-year-old girl and steal away all her personal secrets.Ladies and gentleman, meet the man, the legend, Hannibal Lecter. Even you've never seen this or even heard of this movie, you've heard of Hannibal Lecter. When AFI released its list of the top 50 heroes and the top 50 villains in all of cinema, Hannibal Lecter was number 1 on the villain list. It's telling that Anthony Hopkins received an Oscar for playing this character despite getting limited screen time. Hannibal can strike fear into Clarisse Starling. He can certainly strike fear into you.Humanity is afraid of smart people. Smart people can disrupt the current order of things, breezing by without breaking a sweat. Humanity is afraid of crazy people. Crazy people are unburdened by the moors of society, and have no problem breaking down boundaries. Humanity is afraid of stoic people. Stoic people can stand their ground even when the world around them turns to fire and blood, and so they can gain a leg up on their emotional brethren.Hannibal Lecter is smart, crazy, and stoic. That is a dangerous combination. Smart people are normally not crazy, and even when they are, they usually make an emotional mistake. Crazy people are normally not stoic, and even when they are, they are not smart enough to pull off their schemes. Stoic people are normally not smart, and even when they are, they typically are not crazy enough to disrupt the entire order of things.In many ways, he is the perfect villain. He even has the perfect villain name. Hannibal rhymes with cannibal, of course, but it is also the name of the famous leader of Carthage, who led elephants over the Alps in the Punic wars in an attempt to destroy the Roman Empire. Lecter, meanwhile, sounds conniving, due to both the combination of the 'l' and the 'k' sounds and its resemblance to the world lecher. It also sounds vaguely similar to the word 'specter', fitting considering his slippery, phantasmal nature. This film and the books that inspired it are great examples on how to create character names that vaguely allude to the character's personalities without being too obvious.But Hannibal isn't really the villain, now is he? He's surely not the protagonist, but he's helping Clarice on her quest to catch the real villain of the film, Buffalo Bill, a character who is interesting in his own right, but is overshadowed by Lector and Starling. But in a way, his being in the 'hero's aide' role makes him a lot more unsettling. If he were just the villain, the film would still be great, but it wouldn't be as interesting or complex, and we would lose a lot of the Starling/Lecter interactions, which are the highlights of the film.The ambiguous or outright villainous hero's aide has been done before, but usually the character in question isn't nearly as twisted or nearly as helpful. The character of Lector strikes a deep unease within the audience. His positioning within the story deepens this unease. It is not an unintended side effect that Lector's presence hangs over the story even when he is not directly in it.As of date, this is the last film to ever win the Big Five Oscars- Picture, Actor, Actress, Director, and Screenplay. It was one of the first major films of the 90's, here to signal that the light and vapid 80's had come to an end. Foster and Hopkins both deliver A-class performances, and the writing weaves together with the direction to tell a perfect story.

357,Det_McNulty,"It Earns Multiple Viewings, As Here Lie Murky Waters",7,17 January 2008,"Director Jonathan Demme's adaptation of Thomas Harris' best-selling novel swept across the globe in 1991, eventually winning five Academy Awards and becoming a prestigious topic of discussion among critics. Its moody influence crept across the popular '90s sub-genre of ""serial-thriller."" This lent The Silence of the Lambs a growing reputation for being an adult thriller (and drama) of horror-like capabilities. The mythically monstrous and deliciously manipulative Hannibal Lecter became an immediate household name, and now remains among the most popular fictitious villains in modern cinema. Such a figure could only be played by one man (has it become unimaginable to picture it any other way?), that man being Anthony Hopkins, who slipped himself into the role with matchless prestige, therefore giving birth to a cultural icon of both literature and cinema.Disturbingly accurate in its portrayal of law enforcement, psychology and crime, The Silence of the Lambs stitches a tight, finely-tuned visage of the criminal psyche. Such a narrative instantaneously drags the viewer into the murky underworld of criminal investigation and dangerously murderous mind games. Jodie Foster performs as Clarice Starling, a trainee FBI agent, with extreme ingenuity and awareness. She is a feminist symbol and a woman rightfully fighting to succeed in the job she so deserves, but because of gender stereotypes she finds herself suffering from sexist reactions. Clarice gets employed by the FBI to question the captured serial-killer and ex-psychiatrist, Dr. Hannibal Lecter. He is believed to hold the key to capturing the uncaught serial-killer, nicknamed Buffalo Bill. Unfortunately for Clarice, Dr. Lecter is not keen on extracting information easily and for personal amusement, manipulates and interrogates Clarice for every ounce of information she receives.One of the most important aspects of Jonathan Demme's seminal thriller is its subjective vision. Much of the camera-work deceitfully places the viewer in the shoes of Clarice, while occasionally reverting to even the killer's perspective of the unfolding events. Yet the key behind the ability to frighten is when one becomes witness to the meticulously considered process Dr. Lecter executes before providing Clarice with the information she so desperately needs. From these scenes we begin to learn that Clarice is suffering from her own inner-torment and childhood anguish. Dr. Lecter is not indirect with his queries, but deviously confrontational, allowing Clarice to unknowingly expose her past to the audience. Many parallels are distinctly demonstrated throughout; an example being Clarice's loss of her parents, in contrast with Buffalo Bill's abusive childhood. The scenes filmed between the two central characters define ""mise-en-scène"", a film-making technique used to convey emotion through set design. In this case, the clinical-looking prison ward emphasises a character's isolated, but systematically secured state.The Silence of the Lambs is and always will be an exciting cinematic adventure, not only for its knack of sending sudden bolts of shock through the viewer, but for its admirable talent to tell a story. There are plot holes and clichés littered throughout the surprisingly unpredictable narrative; nevertheless, it will not distract you from being more-than-momentarily immersed over the two-hour running-time. Much of the time is spent periodically conceiving a bundle of well-earned scares, while also allowing time for the audience to ponder the possibilities over what will happen next. Boasting a tremendously taut screenplay, some abrasively framed visuals and a lingering score by composer Howard Shore, this 1991 classic is a treat for film-buffs and casual cinema-goers alike. Even with those brief, glimmering compliments, it is the performances which are showcase material.",The Silence of the Lambs

""The silence of the lambs"" is the third and last movie up to date to have garnered the four major Oscars: Best picture, best actor (Hopkins), best actress (Foster), and best director (Demme).  The one thing that might make the fact that this movie won these four Oscars all the more exceptional is that contrary to  ""It happened one night"" and ""One flew over the cuckoo's nest"" which are a romantic comedy and a heavy drama, ""The silence of the lambs"" is a high-scale horror-movie.  FBI agent Clarice Starling (Foster) is assigned to track down a serial killer who calls himself Buffalo Bill (Ted Levine).  The only problem she must confront however is that to catch Buffalo Bill, she must consult with Hannibal ""The cannibal"" Lecter (Hopkins) who is an ex-psychiatrist renowned across the country.  Dr. Lecter has a clue lying in his head as to what Buffalo Bill's true identity is and how to catch him.  However, Lecter will not cooperate unless Starling lets him in onto some of the details of her private life.

367,Kashmirgrey,Good but not Great,7,7 March 2007,"There are a few items that perplex me regarding this film. First, a review posted in the IMDb on September 15, 2006 makes reference to ""too much nudity"" in the film on the part of Anthony Hopkins and Jodie Foster, yet there was no nudity in the film. That, in itself, baffles me... but I digress. The second is why the scene where the Deputy is crucified like a butterfly. Realistically, where would Lecter have had the time, and being that the deputy was a large man, where did Hopkins summon the strength? OK, with those two issues aside, ""The Silence of the Lambs"" is a good film. I think it was deserved of Best Picture for that year, 1991, as well considering its competition. I don't think it was a great movie, however.I don't usually compare films with their novel counterparts, because films and books are really two separate beasts. Sometimes, such as with ""The Lord of the Rings"" trilogy, I make exceptions, but that is more the exception than the norm. Because I have seen many reference made to ""The Silence of the Lambs"" the movie versus ""The Silence of the Lambs"" the book, I feel compelled to comment. I read the book and I found the book to be very shallow. The film was far better. And that is all I have to say about that.""Silence"" worked primarily because of Anthony Hopkins (Hannibal Lecter) and Ted Levine (Jame Gumb.) Jodie Foster did an above average job as Clarice Starling, but there is just something about Foster that rubs me the wrong way in the film. I can't quite place my finger on it, maybe her attempt at a southern accent or maybe her masculine mannerisms and boyish looks, but she ""just didn't do it for me."" As I have stated in my review of the film ""Hannibal"", I found Julianne Moore to be far better suited for the part of Clarice Starling. Perhaps it is mere preference, and that is all.As I initially mentioned, there were some mechanical problems with the film. Overall, the film worked, though. It is a very dark and disturbing tale, and the atmosphere stays quite faithful to that premise with it's dark color tones and macabre soundtrack. There are few characters that earn the eerie and sinister reputation of Hannibal (the Cannibal) Lecter, and as already stated, this is a credit to Hopkins. The film's conclusion is both suspenseful and darkly comical. Some find themselves frustrated by the open-ended ending, but I found it perfect, especially how it made for an easy transition into the sequel.",The Silence of the Lambs
368,hung_fao_tweeze,A great modern horror film - Modern classic,10,27 December 2003,I kind of wish all the newer films could be as good as this one in their respective genres. The acting is excellently convincing. You cringe at Hopkin's menace no matter how times you've seen it. You can relish in Foster's terror and dread. There isn't a bad performance anywhere. Even the dead bodies are more than convincing. You'd swear you could even smell the death. This is one of those films that you'd swear you saw blood and guts all over the place - but you really didn't. One's imagination is able to fill the gaps quite nicely. I love it when a horror film does that. Other notable films producing the same effect in me are 'The Haunting' (the original) and 'Texas Chainsaw Massacre' (also the original). This film will still be good decades from now. An instant classic. A must-see! Not my favorite film - but pretty darn close.,The Silence of the Lambs
369,matlefebvre20,Aaargh!!! It's Hannibal Lecter!!!,10,31 May 2007,"There are characters who make their entrance in the movie world in such a spectacular way that the actor or actress which played that character risks to be associated with him/her for the rest of his/her career. It's notably the case for Clarice Starling, but especially for Hannibal Lecter. From the moment they appeared for the first time, it became evident that Jodie Foster and Anthony Hopkins would forever be remembered for their iconic roles.I have to say that it's Hannibal Lecter who impressed me the most. And that's not only the case for me. I allow myself to tell you that anecdote which happened to me. My sister is some kind of horror buff and I decided to test her by showing her ""The Silence of the Lambs"". She passed the test successfully but I'll always remember her reaction during the famous ambulance scene when the movie is two-thirds over. When Lecter puts off his mask to reveal his face, my sister instantly gasped. This demonstrates without any doubt the formidable power of Dr. Lecter. His only very presence is frightening. We see him and we are afraid, period.""The Silence of the Lambs"" is the first horror movie in history to be rewarded with the Academy Award for Best Picture. And believe me that it deserves that prize. The Oscars for Foster and Hopkins' acting roles also are. We often associate horror films with ghosts, demons, monsters and other creatures which come from the imaginary and the supernatural. But nothing is more horrifying than what appears real and very plausible. Alfred Hitchcock has already shown that in ""Psycho"" and director Jonathan Demme raises the bar with this adaptation of Thomas Harris' novel.The story involves Clarice Starling (played by Foster), a student at the FBI Academy who is also a specialist in serial killers. One of her superiors, Jack Crawford (Scott Glenn), asks Clarice to interview the terrifying psychopath Hannibal ""The Cannibal"" Lecter (immaculately played by Hopkins) who is also a brilliant psychiatrist, so he could deliver clues which would lead to the capture of Buffalo Bill (Ted Levine), another serial killer actively searched by the FBI.Lecter accepts to help Clarice, but only to the condition that she feed Lecter's sordid curiosity by confessing herself about her childhood's worst souvenirs.Why is Lecter interesting himself to Clarice's worst days? Does he want to weaken her? Does he want the bad guy to win? Or is he only a sadist and a pervert? I would go with the latter affirmation.I think that it is useless to specify that, of all the characters, Hannibal Lecter is by far the best and the most fascinating. The other characters describe him in such a frightening and horrible way that we fear him well before we see him for the first time. And when we see him for the first time, we instantly remark his cold and menacing eyes, as well as his disturbing grin.Himself a serial killer, we can consider Lecter as one of the worst (or best, depending on how you read it) villains in the history of cinema, even if we see him killing only once. And precisely, his attack is very stylish. He kills both policemen on the strains of Johann Sebastian Bach's ""The Goldberg Variations"" and once he accomplished his work, we see him stained with blood, just like a painted how has just finished from making a new painting. That scene establishes a shocking parallel between murder and art.But Lecter is only one side of this story. In fact, he's only a sub-plot. The true story involves Buffalo Bill's actions. Bill, brilliantly played by Levine, acts in nearly the whole Midwest, but his victims always are rather fat young women. Unlike many movies which hide their killer until the very end, we often see Bill in this film, even if we don't know his true identity, nor the frightening motives of his crimes until the end. The only thing we can discover about Bill is his appearing mental problems which push him to kill.The horrors of the film aren't limited to the killers themselves. The movie is strewn with blood-chilling naturalistic images, especially the images of corpses who got parts of their skin removed. And how could we forget this unbearable image of the dead policeman with an open abdomen posing like an angel who is about to take off? There's also a good dose of suspense, especially at the end when Clarice is chasing Bill in his labyrinthine basement. The climax of the pitch-black room while Bill is wearing his night goggles to see in the absolute darkness is breathtaking and holds suspense until the conclusion. At this moment, we're totally absorbed in that cat-and-mouse game at the point that we totally forget Lecter's existence.""The Silence of the Lambs"" is an excellent example of the horrors of the criminal acts and of psychological horror aroused by childhood traumas. Overall, the film is an immense metaphor about the horror of modern world and wants to get sure that the viewer leaves weakened and less in security than before he got inside the theater. The sinister soundtrack of Howard Shore adds to the already sordid atmosphere and the Q. Lazzarus song ""Goodbye Horses"" adds even more with its broken notes which resonate and give goosebumps. Personnaly, each time that I hear that song, I start thinking about Buffalo Bill who cross-dresses in front of the camera with that song playing in the background.""The Silence of the Lambs"" is a grandiose spooky symphony well-carried by Foster and Hopkins whose roles are already a part of the legend. The numerous references of the movie in the popular culture keep it well alive more than fifteen years after its release. Everybody, at least those who are able to stand horror images, should watch this movie at least once in their life.",The Silence of the Lambs

373,danjakubik,A mostly effective thriller with two excellent acting performances,9,21 February 2010,"Only the third film ever in Academy Award history to sweep the top five awards. Also, the first time a thriller wins a Best Picture Academy Award. ""The Silence of the Lambs"" is most famous for Anthony Hopkin's memorable chilling performance as the clever, charming, cultured, well mannered serial killer Dr.Hannibal Lecter. Hannibal Lecter's character is a composite based on several real life serial killers, including Ted Bundy. Jody Foster gives a powerful, intelligent complementary acting performance as the FBI agent trainee recruited to help catch another serial killer, Buffalo Bill, with the help of Lecter.What's most impressive about the film is the pairing of Anthony Hopkins and Jodie Foster. They both bring intelligence, believability and a strong minded directness. They play exceptionally well off each other: Lecter is intelligent, but obviously crazy, while Starling is very sane, determined and intelligent enough to match wits and will against the evil, charming, well mannered and clever Lecter.Not having seen the film in several years, with a fresh perspective, it came across to me as an unusually creepy, strange psychological film. That's a compliment. We have a rare portrayal of a transvestite serial killer, Buffalo Bill. The film contains two scenes I've never seen before, ever, in any film. The first involves Clairice Starling at the beginning of the film, shortly after she first meets Hannibal Lecter in the insane asylum dungeon. The second scene is near the end of the film and involves a very bizarre disguise used by Hannibal Lecter. Hopkins performance in this film, is my all time movie villain favorite.

He stands perfectly still in the middle of his cell floor, arms at his sides, and we sense instantly that he is not standing at attention, he is standing at rest - like a savage animal confident of the brutality coiled up inside him. His speaking voice has the precision of a man so arrogant he can barely be bothered to address the sloppy intelligence of the ordinary person. The effect of this scene is so powerful that it underlies all the rest of the movie, lending terror to scenes that do not even involve him.Like all great entrances in the movies, his is carefully prepared. We learn that his character, Dr. Hannibal Lecter, is both a brilliant psychiatrist and a mass murderer, known as ""Hannibal the Cannibal"" because he eats his victims. He is already behind bars (and unbreakable Plexiglas) when the movie opens, and indeed ""The Silence of the Lambs"" is about the search for another mass murderer, named ""Buffalo Bill,"" who skins his victims.Operating on the theory that it takes one to know one, the FBI agent in charge of the case thinks Lecter might be able to provide useful clues in the search for Buffalo Bill. But Lecter toys with most of his inquisitors, or dismisses them, and so the agent hits on the idea of sending in an untried young female trainee (Jodie Foster). Perhaps she will appeal to the monster.Foster is inevitably upstaged by Hopkins' rich and gruesome creation, but her steadiness and pluck are at the heart of the movie.Some interesting aspects have been provided for her character: She is ""one generation up from white trash,"" as Lecter correctly guesses; she tries to disguise her hillbilly accent, and she has to muster up all of her courage to order a roomful of lascivious lawmen out of an autopsy room. The movie has an undercurrent of unwelcome male attention toward her character; rarely in a movie have I been made more aware of the subtle sexual pressures men put upon women with their eyes.We are frightened both because of the film's clever manipulation of story and image, and for better reasons--we like Clarice, identify with her and fear for her.

381,sc8031,Human cuisine could be more delicious,6,29 July 2008,"I'm not downgrading ""Silence of the Lambs"" for failing to live up to its hype, for no movie could deliver on the amount of praise this one has received. I think it is an entertaining film, but it is hardly realistic and breaks down in several clumsy scenes, ones which were excessively convenient moments to advance the plot.The movie functions as a capable FBI thriller (yet is still not quite as engrossing as something like ""L.A. Confidential""). What is engrossing about this film is kind of cheap: the fact that it is about a couple of very disgusting serial killers. These kinds of characters are absolute tabloid gold-mines. No wonder people are so mesmerized by this movie: it's a decent thriller that revolves around gruesome murders.I give Hopkins credit for doing a good acting performance, but the character of Hannibal Lecter, PhD, is too over-the-top to be convincing. I get it -- he's a genius and a sociopath. He's a classier version of Maguyver (so classy he even appreciates piano sonatas!) who has no empathy but loves riddles and tooling people around. Entertaining but not entirely convincing. Really brilliant killers don't wear their gifts on their sleeve.As I said, there were a few moments with supporting characters doing stupid, clumsy, unrealistic things to advance the plot. For one thing, nobody does their job clumsily when guarding super-brilliant cannibal serial killers. Sorry. And methodical serial killers (as deranged as they may be) are not clumsy when it comes to tracking someone in their own lair.The movie is entertaining and paces well. It is certainly engrossing, but the violence does seem over-the-top and unnecessary. Without the obscene gore factor, this movie would not be nearly as famous as it is, so it strikes me as a gimmick. The gore never carried any emotional resonance or impact on the storyline. It was at times almost comical for the way it suddenly shifted the tempo of the movie.I will say I did like the Appalachian, rust-belt, mining-town motif that was prevalent throughout the movie and tied Jodie Foster's character, Clarice, to the story. The contrast between Clarice, the victims of the killer Buffalo Bill, and the seasoned murderer, Lecter, was pretty decent. And Jodie Foster was pretty good, she's always been a capable actress.But let's face it: the kind of cinematic thrills the mainstream movie-going public desires cannot deliver realistic portrayals of sociopathic killers. I mean, ""No Country For Old Men"" is a little closer to the mark here, and at the center I'm thinking along the lines of ""Henry"" or the more humane and psychologically driven Fritz Lang classic, ""M"". Unfortunately, most movies about serial killers are all glossed up with shiny production and sensationalized fictitious qualities to the extent that they make these characters look glorious. (Even ""No Country"" did that a little bit) The whole movie felt kinda like a Tom Clancy thriller, but with a couple of twisted serial killers as the focal point. But it was an archetype for both '90s films and serial killer films. So many movies copied this one in the '90s in pacing, aesthetic and so on. Pretty much every movie about some genius murderer is a take on this one.It's mainly worth watching for Anthony Hopkins. There are (unfortunately?) some laugh-out-loud moments but he's not on-screen for most of the film. Still, I didn't find the gore in this to be as convincingly disturbing as most new episodes of South Park. This was just grimier and less funny.",The Silence of the Lambs
382,starlit-sky,Put the lotion in the basket!!!!!!!,10,13 September 2010,"Silence of the Lambs is probably the best movie of its kind. Its sheer intensity is unmatched. It is a superbly well-written story that involves multiple very dangerous characters, most notorious of which is Dr. Lecter (Hannibal). An FBI agent, Clarice Starling (wonderfully portrayed by Jodie Foster) needs to extract information from a dangerous psychopath Hannibal Lecter (amazingly brought to life by Anthony Hopkins) about a serial killer called Buffalo Bill (Ted Levine).There are so many elements that make Silence Of The Lambs chillingly scary. Buffalo Bill chooses young female victims and skins them. He kidnaps the daughter of a senator which quickly prompts an FBI hunt. Agent Clarice visits Dr. Lecter who is held in a maximum security prison to ask him questions about Buffalo Bill's psychological profile because he was Dr. Lecter's patient many years ago....when Dr. Lecter was a normal human being (if you can call it that).I have always found the idea of a psychologist going insane and becoming a human eating monster very scary. I mean he is supposed to be the expert about human behavior to cure psychological disturbances and he is the most disturbed of all. However, he is equally brilliant. Dr. Lecter's brilliant mind brings depth to his character. Clarice's difficult task of understanding and deciphering the mind of -not one but- two psychopaths creates multi-dimensions.I don't want to say too much about the story and what happens next. But let me say that the movie is full of suspense and literally breath-taking moments. After 20 years, I have not seen any other similar type of movie that I enjoyed as much as I enjoyed Silence of the Lambs. This movie completely changes the serial killer characters in movies and adds depth to them in an unprecedented fashion. Killers in movies like Texas Chainsaw Massacre, Friday the 13th, Halloween (the major horror franchises) gave us faceless monsters with no character depth. They wouldn't say a word or even make a sound (this was probably done to disassociate them from regular human beings). Even though this seemed to have worked, Silence of the Lambs' depiction of killer monsters in more elaborate fashion works even better.",The Silence of the Lambs

The antithesis within the horror/thriller genre is the 1991 Academy Award winning film The Silence of the Lambs. Although not thought of as a ""women's movie,"" a feminist undercurrent is present in the film through its protagonist, a strong female character who contradicts previous genre stereotypes.

He perfectly conveys the charming sophistication of Hannibal Lecter. In fact, I think he was so good that he outshone Buffalo Bill (Ted Levine) as the true antagonist of this film. This is no disrespect to Ted Levine who was great in his own right, but Anthony Hopkins was even better. Although I was very disappointed with Scott Glenn as Jack Crawford.

388,crickwill,Gimme Gimme Shock Treatment..,7,10 January 2020,"Watching The Silence Of The Lambs again some 30 years later, you come to realize it's greatest strength being, is that it is an 'actors piece'. This is what raises the picture up to it's still seminal and legendary status today, whilst the background story, events and supporting cast can seem slightly dated and diluted, due to the sheer number and diabolical content offered by thrillers since its inception.Both lead performers have weathered and survived the years immaculately however and is primarily the root source of why this film still holds up as strongly as it does.Both are exquisite in their creation and to watch.The haunted house finale is a bit wobbly and unreasonable even back in 1990 but probably not enough reason to carp.I don't think, in regards it's honouring, the Academy sweeps the thriller/horror genre under the rug in so far as accolade, more like a case being that films of undeniable excellence such as The Exorcist and this one are just so few and far between.",The Silence of the Lambs
389,Funky A,Great acting make this a great thriller,9,6 March 2001,"In the surprisingly small screen time Anthony Hopkins has in The Silence of the Lambs, he has been able to make an intense character and gives one of the most incredible performances in movie history. Hannibal Lecter is a fascinating character and Hopkins is marvelously mad as this maniac. His performance is nothing short of brilliant. Jodie Foster too is very good as Clarisse Starling. She is very believable as a young FBI agent who has to be against a mastermind such as Lecter. The scenes between her and Hannibal are spectacular. Actually, the story between her and Lecter make Buffalo Bill's part of the movie seem weaker than it really is. When you have such great scenes and have to live through good ones, you just hope the greatness will come back... And when Hannibal is back, so is greatness. The script in these scenes is just fantastic. They make an otherwise good movie excellent. The story in The Silence of The Lambs is very well written. As for the directing, Demme overuses the zooming in in some less important scenes a bit but his directing is still very effective and even excellent in some scenes. One near the end is seen through the eyes of Bill and is very well done(which is a good thing in a thriller). Because of the marvellous job done by the actors, Anthony Hopkins becoming one of the most frightening men in the history of movies, very good script and good directing, this movie is an excellent thriller that I highly recommend.85%",The Silence of the Lambs

The silence of the lambs is the only horror / thriller to win an Academy award for best picture. It also won for best director, best actor for both Jodie Foster and Anthony Hopkins. Buffalo Bill is murdering and skinny women across the country. Clarice Starling a student is sent to interview Dr. Hannibal Lector in hope that they will be able to create a profile for Buffalo Bill. Dr. Lector is called Hannibal the cannibal you can pretty much guess what he did. Dr. Lector keeps giving Starling clues in an exchange for answering his questions about her childhood. Anthony Hopkins performance stuns me every time it's simply brilliant. Scott Glen performance as the psychopath who wants to be a transvestite was bravo as well. Jodie Foster received an Academy award for her excellent performance as well. The scene when Jack is watching Clarice as she goes through the house is chilling.

394,adeckofcards,Building terror,10,14 June 2020,"When talking about horror film classics, it is inevitable to think of 'The Silence of the Lambs', a film that undoubtedly marked the history of cinema in various fields.
Based on the Thomas Harris book, the film tells the story of a rookie FBI agent who has been assigned the task of questioning Dr. Hannibal Lecter (an amazing Anthony Hopkins) about the psychological profile of a new criminal who is sowing terror in the city. With this plot, the film portrays a chilling story and an unhealthy situation of mutual collaboration between the protagonists. Although probably the film's greatest achievement is the way that Jonathan Demme directs and constructs terror in a way that the viewer is as involved in the story as the protagonists, a technique that is reused to this day.
Currently the legacy of 'The Silence of the Lambs' is still present in horror movies. The way he treats the plot, the characters and his way of constructing suspensive terror has been a guideline for current cinema. And today very few would dare to question its quality as a masterpiece.",The Silence of the Lambs
395,KillerLord,The Most Brilliant Psychological Thriller,10,5 October 2008,"The Silence of the Lambs is the only Horror genre movie to win the Best Picture Oscar. Both its male and female lead have won the Oscars for their performances. Sir Anthony Hopkins holds the record for the shortest on-screen role to get the Lead Oscar award. He hardly spends 16-18 minutes on screen and produces magic. These factoids and the well deserved high rating on IMDb was what drove me to watch this movie. And at no point of time, I felt that the movie enjoyed more praise that it deserved. It is a brilliantly done movie that deserves all the cheers and applause. Jodie Foster is one my favorite actresses of all times. Her work in Contact, Flightplan, Anna and the King and other movies was praise worthy. And her role in Silence of the Lambs is perhaps her best role ever. She plays an FBI trainee who has been sent by the FBI to try and talk to Dr. Hannibal Lecter and seek his help in finding a serial killer. Dr. Hannibal Lecter is a serial killer himself, a brilliant psychiatrist with extremely intellectual insight into the human mind. Agent Starling is scared of her interaction with this madman Lecter. And you are scared of him because she is scared too. One of the very few actors who can show fear so beautifully on her face. She faces situations everyday in her life where is ends up being the only female in a room full of men. This no doubt is a source of discomfort for her and you can see it all over her face. Dr. Hannibal Lecter is not an average serial killer. He is a brilliant psychiatrist. His understanding of the human mind and his skill to dissect your thoughts by observing your facial expressions and listening to your voice is demonstrated early on in the movie. He is willing to help Agent Starling catch the serial killer but in return wants to diagnose her for he in her past he sees a tragic set of events that have contributed and are still contributing to her life. The game is on! Lecter gives his insights to Starling in exchange for her honest and candid information about her childhood. Every tiny aspect of this interaction is handled so wonderfully. The director Jonathan Demme does not fail in any aspect. He builds the perfect package. The eventual track down of the serial killer, the suspense and the overall story is so well done. At no point of time does he resort in showing something that makes the movie conventional or unrealistic. The movie grips you with fear and keeps you at the edge of your seat till the very end of it. The movie is not about the serial killer and his mind but it is more about Agent Starling and her peculiar relationship with Dr. Lecter. But that still does not allow Demme to ignore his development and portrayal. The serial killer is believable and complex in his own right.This movie is a classic. It is destined to be in the list of great movies for a very long time to come. And I am sure that should any actor try to step in the shoes of either of these characters, he or she would be taking a very big risk indeed. The characters are so strong that it is hard to imagine any other Agent Starling other than Foster and any other Dr. Hannibal than Sir Anthony Hopkins. (I'd recommend you see The Manhunter to see another actor try playing Dr. Hannibal and see for yourself.)A must watch for all movie fans! Cheers!",The Silence of the Lambs

Hopkins performance was one of the ten best I've ever seen. Demme's direction was almost flawless and kept the viewer feeling disturbed throughout the film with his use of uncomfortable situations (ie- someone following you in the dark, being stuck in a well, being locked in a room with no way out). What struck me most about this film was the glorification of Hannibal which seemed to portray him as a good guy even while the viewer knows about his murders, cannibalism and mind-manipulating.

This is the pinnacle of dark, disturbing, and smart thrillers. A classic in its own right, some of the most memorable scenes are featured in The Silence of the Lambs, as are some of the quotations. Make no mistake the film is no horror, not really; but it's so creepy, haunting and unforgiving it might as well be one. The film has some wicked camera shots and angles, a great actor to character dynamic, and is purely a masterpiece from start to finish. The writing, acting and directing are, to put it simply, amazing. It is astounding that Sir Anthony Hopkins gets a bit more than 15 minutes of screen time and it is still a mesmerising portrayal of Hannibal Lector. I love Hopkins' portrayal as Hannibal. Much to my surprise watching for the first time only a few years back, the film didn't only revolve around him, but also the serial killer, Buffalo Bill, whose creepy expressions and voice and overall movement/mannerisms and the whole night goggles thing certainly added to the thrills that this engaging, meticulously crafted, horrifying and magnificent thriller leaves you with from the minute it starts. Movies these days suffer from lack of imagination, banality and if they're horror they rely on jump scares and forced shock schlock, again, if they're horrors or close to said genre, or tedious writing to execution or they suffer from lack of good setup into satisfactory payoff.. Or they forget what they're doing or what it hopes to achieve half way through or at its end, or they even suffer from lack of a good narrative in general, which is sad. This doesn't just mean thriller, or horror, but all of film, from action to crime. I think The Silence of the Lambs is a perfectly executed, performed, written film that absolutely achieves legendary status, achieves everything it sets out to do (without trying) and is so utterly and effortlessly captivating. The pacing, camera work, atmosphere, acting, writing, directing and music are all excellent. No weak or tiresome moments or out of place character or writing. I would love to come across a thriller so terrifying as this one, (Well, Seven comes close). I get nervous watching this. I get creeped out. I get panicky and a feeling of claustrophobia or dread. I get the thrills. I get lost in it. I embrace it and I never get bored. I didn't finally see it until just three years back, since then I've seen it at least eight or nine times. If there were just one classic thriller and terrific movie you should see in your lifetime, make it The Silence of the Lambs. I highly recommend it to anybody who loves this genre of film, films in general and loves a good fright and chills every now and then.It rubs the lotion on its skin and does whenever it's told.",The Silence of the Lambs

I ate his liver with some fava beans and a nice chianti"" What more could encapsulate the psychotic nature of this charged thriller? Silence of the Lambs follows Clarice Starling's FBI investigation into a string of sadistic murders by a killer known as 'Buffalo Bill'. A break-through in the case can only be found through the interrogation of the brilliant yet outlandishly insane confined psychologist, Hannibal 'The Cannibal' Lecter. Hannibal will only provide the information in exchange for Clarice to tell him about her own personal life which acts as the fantastic foundation for the title of this lucrative masterpiece.The story was structured and shot perfectly. The film was constantly charged with suspense and tension, littered with thought-provoking dialogue oozing with intrigue. The performances were just awe-inspiring as the academy acknowledge. Anthony Hopkins was simply chilling as the twisted, genius that is Hannibal Lecter. Chills also arise through Ted Levine's frightening invention of the character of Buffalo Bill. Levine should have notched up a nomination for a best supporting actor at the Oscars due to the performance's flawless ability to chill and disturb. Also, Foster can not be forgotten as she played the multi-faceted character of Clarice Starling.

401,Xophianic,Excellent movie,9,19 April 2017,"Finally, I saw this movie for the first time yesterday. I bet everyone has already seen it, but just in case: Spoilers Below!I've always heard and read that SILENCE OF THE LAMBS was a great movie, but I'd never seen it. Now I have, and I've learned that it wasn't all hype.Silence of the Lambs is about an FBI-trainee named Clarice Starling (Jodie Foster) who is trying to track down and stop a serial killer named Buffalo Bill (Ted Levine) who has been killing girls throughout the country. In order to do so, she questions Dr. Hannibal Lector (Anthony Hopkins). Dr. Lector is a brilliant physiologist who is a convicted serial killer. He appears polite, but is actually a very dangerous and intelligent psychopath who eats his victims.I can't express how great I thought this movie was. Just about every scene with Anthony Hopkins was mesmerizing, especially his dialogue with Jodie Foster. The last conversation between the two in this movie was chilling to the bone. Dr. Lector's escape was probably the greatest scene in the movie, while also one of the most disturbing. When he beats a helpless guard to death with a nightstick, it reminds you that he is not the harmless man that he looks like.Anthony Hopkins, of course, stole the show. He stole every single scene he was in. Jodie Foster did a very good job also as the young, ambitious FBI trainee trying to put an end to another madman's reign and, in doing so, smother the pains of her past. Ted Levine also did a notable job as another very different madman than Lector. I sincerely hated Levine's character by the end of this movie.There are many memorable scenes in this movie. The prison break, as I mentioned earlier, is one of the more memorable ones. The most intense scene of the movie, in my opinion, is when Jodie Foster is being stalked in the dark near the end of the film. Anytime that Lector talks, you will probably feel shivers up your spine. This is one of the best movies I've ever seen. If like me, you have not seen it in all these years, do it today. There is a reason this movie is a favorite of many people and crosses many genres.",The Silence of the Lambs
402,maxastree,"excellent performances, great writing",9,1 May 2016,"Silence of the Lambs is a psychological thriller that positions its most dangerous (and interesting) character in a prison cell for much of the screen time, so his character can be shown through intuitions, subtext, hindsight narrative and general creepiness.That character is Anthony Hopkins as ""Hannibal Lecter"", a cultured psychiatrist imprisoned among psychiatric criminal scum who longs for decent human contact or escape, except he himself has a history of killing people and eating the mutilated parts.All of this is described off-screen, and the film doesn't indulge in unpleasant gore or cheap shock effects - the films main secondary character is Buffalo Bill, a man who applied for gender reassignment, but Lecter explains he was repeatedly denied on basis of his psychological profile. Due to repeated abusive childhood trauma, has become an anonymous, dysfunctional recluse who randomly assaults and kills women. Lecter suggests that his victimhood narrative contributes to his inhumane treatment of others, he drops other details and secrets about the killer but isn't fully cooperative about providing a complete psychological profile of the killer due to the indignity of his life in prison.Clarise Starling is an FBI rookie, chosen for her attractiveness, to get information from Hannibal Lecter on his former patient and contact Buffalo Bill. The reverse-symbolism of having Dr Lecter behind bars whilst Starling is just beyond them is a brilliant bit of staging, as much of the film's subtext is about the gender coding of behaviour, identity and social roles. Its also genuinely scary, but mostly on the level of dialogue and performance, Silence of the Lambs is rightly considered one of the best films of all time in the drama/thriller/psychological horror category, also the police procedural scenes are taut and realistic, or as realistic as you could expect. A second underlying theme of the piece is that the state ultimately protects its own interests, but is unable in the last instance to truly protect the public from crime.There is a 'happy ending' of sorts in the picture, in that Starling, a lone female FBI agent in a predominantly male service, overcomes a male aggressor mentally and physically. An empowering ending that's more of a relief than an actual closure.Silence of the Lambs is brilliant, but also the hubbub surrounding the films release and its subsequent awards greenlit some terrible sequels where this movie's lead, director and screenwriter didn't even contribute. Some audience members aren't aware but this film bares similarities to the previous Thomas Harris adaptation ""Manhunter"", released as a film in 1986.

409,DorianWynHowells,"""You spook easily?""",10,4 December 2001,"It was one of those films that teenagers would have stayed up late to watch on a Friday night, and the school playground would be buzzing for weeks after! This film achieved that very easily. Other film's that achieved this was Basic Instinct, and Se7en.From the moment the film is over, you NEED to see it again. Was it a dream? Was it a nightmare? Did what you just see happen, or was it your own imagination? That's how good this film is. It introduced us to Dr Hannibal Lecter, arguably the greatest screen villain ever. Who could forget those claustraphobic scenes between him and Clarice Starling? That frightening noise of his Liver slurping antics? And that eerie ""Good evening Clarice"".It won all five 'major' Oscars, and deservedly so, even though it was realeased as early as February! A gripping storyline, and performance's make this a must see film. Just as me and my teenage friends talked about this film many years ago, many of our discussions continue to this day. That's a sign of a good film. Psycho is another! The way the focus is thrown from Starling, played magnificently by Jodie Foster, to Hannibal Lecter, Anthony Hopkins (need I say more?!), and Buffalo Bill, a splendid Ted Levine. We are forced to observe their actions, be they honourable, horrible, or homicidal, these are the key factors that make this intense viewing.Of course another stroke of genius is to have a woman as the hero, heroine. Starling, is a student at the FBI, so we feel for her as she tries to unravel the mystery of Buffalo Bill, and her encounters with Lecter. Never has there been such a strong overwhelming performance from a woman since Ellen Ripley graced our screens. Starling also has a past, all hero's usually do, and this serves as an underlying psychological issue in the film. It's also what interests Lecter. He is very fond of her.
Director Demme, never lets us and Starling forget that the world she occupies is mostly a 'man's world', and this makes us identify with her whether we're male or female. We WANT her to succeed. (PLOT SPOILER!) In a perverse way, we want Lecter to escape and succeed too, but the way in which he does so is shocking, very shocking. That scene where he discards the officer's face is gruesome, but neccessary to further Lecter's character.A taughtly directed thriller/horror, this film delivers on all levels.

411,lucianomarzo92,The Silence of the Lambs,8,21 August 2009,"This movie is very suspenseful and features incredible acting from Anthony Hopkins as ""Hannibal Lecter"". Jodie Foster was also great and played a very strong female lead as the FBI agent Clarice Starling. This movie has a very intriguing plot, which is what made me rent it. I found it very interesting that an FBI agent would interview a imprisoned serial killer who is a cannibal, to find out more about another serial killer on the loose. Hannibal is almost presented as the good guy in some scenes. Of course, he cannot be the actual ""good guy"", he sure is in contrast to that creepy Buffalo Bill. Clarice Starling is a unit agent of the law, and Hannibal is a being who defied it, but they are paradoxically, on the same side. This movie didn't disappoint me but was still creepy, but then again it didn't exceed the creepiness I expected. The Silence of the Lambs has very intense scenes mostly involving the autopsy of a filthy cut-up person, a kidnapping, and not to mention Hannibal eating a warden's face. It might be a good idea to watch out for these scenes before watching. I wouldn't really recommend that anybody under 16 watch this. The entire premise for the movie is very disturbing itself, with the movie becoming even more unsettling than the general plot. The Silence of the Lambs is still creepy, but I really felt like I was watching a movie made in the 90's. It really shows its age. It is well made for the most part, but I really think that it's too disturbing to truly be one of the greatest movies movies of all time, as IMDb votes would lead one to believe.",The Silence of the Lambs

The villain is legitimately creepy and scary, and every scene and sequence with Hannibal and Buffalo Bill are particularly evil.

Its greatness shines through wherever you watch it but the experience of watching it on the big screen must be breathtaking. I never tire of watching this film because it is utterly compelling from the the start and had my complete attention. There are some really dangerous and disturbed people out there in the real world but this film graphically reminds us that some of them are extremely intelligent and capable of virtually anything. The Silence of the Lambs is not full of violence and gore although there is some but it is the suspense and the tension and the quality of the way the story unfolds which lifts it out of the ordinary. For me this film is perfection and everyone who sees it will probably describe how uncomfortable they feel when watching it. I don't think everyone will like the film but I cannot imagine anyone not being affected by it in one way or another. Please watch this film and you will understand why.,The Silence of the Lambs

I thought that this movie would be good based on it's critical success but damn it was much better than that. It was astonishing. This is one of the most suspenseful and thrilling films that I have ever seen. The Silence of the Lambs will definitely go down in my top ten must-watch films that I have ever seen.Raw, brutal, thrilling, exceptional are just some of words to describe this film. Jodie Foster as Clarice Sterling and Anthony Hopkins as Hannibal Lector share the most remarkable chemistry on screen. Both performers and the film itself absolutely deserved all the awards it received and probably more.I was transfixed, sitting intently on my couch with my mouth aghast at the real and raw human emotions portrayed by Anthony and Jodie. I was terrified of Lector but also felt him to be a type of anti hero. And I was sympathetic to Sterling despite her being strong and determined I also felt her vulnerability and I admired both performers for their on screen brilliance.There is so many moments of genius and cleverness in the film. That it is close to flawness. Some scenes are brutal and horrific and others are brutally tense and you will sit back biting your nails or putting a hand over your eyes for a split second to break the suspense.I must have also mention Ted Levine as Buffalo Bill who was just something creepy, terrifying and fascinating. The reason this film is so successful is that you forget that these people are only actors. You truly believe that they are the characters they portray in the film. It is as if they are not acting at all because they are just so frighteningly good.So my final comments are that I won't give away anything at all as this film is just too satisfying to give anything away. Do yourself a favour and spend a night at home on the couch, grab the popcorn and sit back and watch this masterpiece because you won't be disappointed.10/10",The Silence of the Lambs

The direction is outstanding and really good. The acting is also top-notch especially Anthony Hopkins and Jodie foster, both well deserved Oscars! About the plot itself I consider that the visual experience is better than the plot and I personally figured out what the serial killer was intending to do before it was even revealed, that doesn't make the plot bad but I think the story wasn't as great as the visuals, it was a pretty interesting one but not worthy enough to be portrayed as masterpiece like many are doing. There are a lot of actions and scenes in this movie that set an example and where copied by a lot of recent movies so in a certain why this created a precedent.

The popularity of this film was such that I knew the plot when  I was ten in 1991, although I only saw it about a month ago. I will usually never watch films that are disgusting, and I didn't really want to watch this. But rather than being a disgusting horror, it turned out to be a psychological thriller of the highest order. The movie is amazing. It presents a gritty, realistic world like that of a documentary, with no typical Hollywood cliches whatsoever. That way we don't know what to expect. The actors are actors first and stars second, and the two central performances are simply superb. Hopkins is so effective in his role, you could easily believe Hannibal Lector really exists. In fact he is so good, he won the Best Actor Oscar for a supporting role.Even better is Jodie Foster, who has surely proven herself now to be one of the best actresses ever.

It has a very dated feel to it now.But it's worth seeing for Anthony Hopkins' brilliant recreation of a monster and serial killer. If you haven't seen this film yet, you owe it to yourself to see Hopkins at his most creative best and for some of his classic lines and scenes - especially his now-famous improvisation regarding his culinary desires. (You'll know what I mean when you see it.)Jodi Foster is solid here, though her range as an actress is limited. Her face is largely emotionless unless it's showing anger - that's the one emotion she can amply express, for my money. I know I'm probably in the minority here, but I'm not a big fan of hers. She's like a female Tom Cruise. Great for action films, not so great for films requiring a lot of emotional depth. But she's good here.The sequels? AVOID THEM AT ALL COSTS!!! THEY'RE HORRIFYING AND GLORIFY IN INHUMANITY - IN ALL OF ITS GORY DETAIL. THE SEQUELS ARE MOVIE OF A SLASHER-STYLE BREED. I am so sorry I saw the sequels. They sicken me to this day.

""Hannibal the Cannibal"" (Anthony Hopkins),a  a veteran serial killer, a former psychologist, and a rare living psychopath.  Starling is assigned to interview Hannibal because of a new serial killer in the public dubbed Buffalo Bill, because he ""likes to skin his humps"".  The FBI suspects that the secret of Bill's compulsive killing is somewhere inside the mind of Hannibal.

I've probably watched Silence of The Lambs over 20 times, and every time I watch it, I ""jump"", get startled. Anthony Hopkins is a great actor, and I was really happy to see him get Best Actor for this movie, he's brilliant and very freakish-like. Jodie Foster, also a huge congrats on the Best Actor win at the Oscars, brilliant job by her.Here's the story there's a maniac out there by the name of ""Buffalo Bill"" and the FBI sends trainee Clarice Starling (Foster) to interview a psychiatrist named Dr. Hannibal ""The Cannibal"" Lector (Hopkins). Lector agrees to give Clarice hints about how the Feds will catch ""Bill"" if she tells him stories about her own troubled past.It's an amazing film, the thing that makes this movie different from a lot of other horror films is....this movie barely has any blood or gore.

424,xiaoli7377,Hitchcock Would Be Proud,10,5 September 2020,"""The Silence of the Lambs"" is the story of young FBI agent Clarice Starling (Jodie Foster) as she tracks down serial killer Buffalo Bill (Ted Levine), a transvestite who has a penchant for skinning his female victims. The agency assigns Starling to interview another serial killer who is confined in a maximum security psychiatric prison, the mysterious Dr. Hannibal Lecter (Anthony Hopkins). Lecter was a renowned psychiatrist before he became a cannibal, and Starling needs his help in order to track down Buffalo Bill, a former patient of Lecter's. Through repeated interviews, Lecter and Starling play mind games to both get what they want from each other.The star of the show is Anthony Hopkins. The character he brings to life is utterly disgusting, shocking, and vile. Hopkins was able to win the Academy Award for Best Actor in the very short screen time that he has in this picture (about sixteen minutes). The dialogues between Foster and Hopkins are definitely the highlights of the film, but the other actors give off phenomenal performances as well. I think that Levine as Buffalo Bill is a bit underrated, to be honest.The brilliance of this movie is the fact that it turns genre conventions on their heads. The real threat is not Buffalo Bill. Yes, there is an obvious threat in the fact that he is a serial killer psychopath who is holding the daughter of a United States Senator captive. But the real tension and plot are driven through Lecter. Buffalo Bill merely acts as a vehicle for Lecter to get what he wants out of Starling. This movie still would have worked well as a simple murder mystery, but we are shown much more than that in the way that the stories of all three main characters are interwoven, each manipulating each other to serve their own goals.

428,mrrockey,Disturbing yet Entertaining,8,20 April 2014,"When it comes to horror films of the 90's, I can't think of many films as iconic as The Silence of the Lambs. While there were certainly other iconic horror films at the time such as The Sixth Sense and Scream, the one thing The Silence of the Lambs did that those films didn't, was win the Oscar for Best Picture. Not only that, but it also won for Best Actor for Anthony Hopkins, Best Actress for Jodie Foster, Best Adapted Screenplay for Ted Tally, and Best Director for Jonathan Demme. It also became the fourth highest-grossing film of 1991. So with all that, you expect something special, right? Well, is it? Let's take a look, shall we?The plot follows a young FBI trainee by the name of Clarice Starling who is pulled from her training academy to interview Hannibal Lecter, a former psychiatrist and incarcerated cannibalistic serial killer to find another serial killer by the name of Buffalo Bill under the order of Jack Crawford. After some interrogation and investigation, Bill abducts Catherine Martin, one of the U.S. Senator's daughter. Leaving it up to Starling to find Bill by dealing with the darkest of all minds, Hannibal Lecter.The appeal of Silence of the Lambs lies in its mix of realistic depictions of police investigation and serial killer antics while retaining a cinematic panache to keep things entertaining. The film depicts its police investigation very realistically with a great attention detail to the dead bodies and the way the main serial killer Buffalo Bill operates is actually pretty realistic. His motives are very opaque, never completely clear to the audience, just like how serial killers are to people in real-life. He's trying to make a dress with a woman's flesh throughout the film because he thinks he's a woman but you never get why he wants to kill people. You have to pay full attention to see what's behind his head. But at the same time, the film doesn't feel TOO realistic to the point where it's boring and dull to sit through, there's still a certain entertainment factor to this film. For one thing, the film is scary. While this isn't exactly the type of horror film you can have a good time with when you call over some friends while having a few beers, it still has plenty of good scares to keep you entertained from beginning to end(especially towards the end).But I think the main reason why this did so well was because of the characters. While most horror films would feature the serial killer as the most interesting character of the film while the main character is as dull as a rock, this film did something a little different. Clarice Starling in this film is equally interesting as the serial killers themselves because she's not just some girl who just happen to become a target for the killer somehow but instead, she's ASSIGNED to find the serial killer herself and actually has a personality and she actually goes through an arc. She starts out haunted from her childhood memory of seeing lambs being slaughtered so she feels guilty about seeing such a thing happen but not doing anything about it considering her dad was a cop and hears sounds of lambs screaming in her dreams but she overcomes this towards the end when she saves the senator's daughter and kills Buffalo Bill. And thankfully, they got a great actress to play this part, Jodie Foster. Foster has a believable intelligence to her that helps you buy her matching wits with Hannibal Lecter. It's great that the filmmakers chose not to cast the most attractive actress but instead, the one that could act.The rest of the characters are equally good. While Hannibal Lecter is certainly not a realistic portrait of a serial killer, he works well as this great, unstoppable force of evil that Clarice has to match wits with to find Buffalo Bill. Anthony Hopkins gives the performance of a lifetime here with all his creepy stares, sinister line deliveries, and wicked intelligence. Ted Levine is equally creepy and unsettling as Buffalo Bill, but in different ways. He feels a lot more like a realistic serial killer with his strange sexuality and cross-dressing habits. Scott Glenn is also convincing as the authoritative, determined Jack Crawford. Lastly, I want to mention Brooke Smith as Catherine Martin, the girl kidnapped by Buffalo Bill. I love how she starts out extremely terrified when she's captured just like anybody would but I like how her character actually tries to escape by threatening to kill Bill's dog if he doesn't let her out. Smith's fear and determination is very believable throughout the whole film.Overall, The Silence of the Lambs is a chilling, disturbing film that also has some excellent performances to spare. Great film. 10/10",The Silence of the Lambs

I went back to the dormitory and found a lot of background information about cannibalism. An allusion mentioned in a short movie review is very relevant. What is said is that eating people may be related to a primitive sense of power. When a person tries to gain strength, the primitive man kills another strong man, so that he can obtain the strength and wisdom of that strong man. This kind of strength is called Manner in religion. After reading these, I was relieved to the fact that he was eating people. Hannibal, a man with a strong heart comparable to the existence of God, is there really such a perfect person in the world? Perhaps, I have no way of answering this question. Hannibal is just a speculation about the savior. Unlike the savior known as the strong human body, such as Spider-Man and Iron Man, this savior is spiritual and human. Hannibal, this character, in the end, I completely ignored his bloody background. I only remember that he killed the police and deliberately made Jesus die on the cross and wiped his fingers with Stalin's fingers. The scene, the touch of tenderness was the deepest, and his sketch of Stalin's clothes: Stalin was quiet and quiet, holding the lamb in his hands, as holy as the Virgin. Hannibal, in my opinion, is a man with God's cleanliness. Maybe he shouldn't be human, and he is not worthy of such a great existence.",The Silence of the Lambs

Thus I thought it quite apt the a policeman asks Clarice if Lector is a 'vampire'. Indeed he is, but he doesn't want blood. Lector is so totally devoid of emotion, or suffering depression to such a desperate degree, that he has to resort to the most heinous act possible, cannibalism, to evoke any emotion, any feeling whatsoever. Lector is indeed dead inside - no good, no bad, no nothing - that is the ultimate tragedy of this empty shell of a man. Lector is played as a man who always has a quiet steady voice and even indulges in classical music as he commits acts of cannibalism. The scene in which Hopkins talks to the camera is nothing short of miraculous. Ted Levine as Jame 'Buffalo Bill' Gumbis also is nothing short of astounding in his portrayal of someone seriously lost mentally, a man who so despises his own flesh, that he adorns himself in the flesh of others, to achieve a feeling a normalcy.

438,abum190,An incredibly thrilling movie,9,3 September 2006,"If The Silence of the Lambs had been about Clarice chasing after Buffalo Bill, the movie would have been boring, and would have gone on a list filled with every other average thriller ever made. If The Silence of the Lambs had simply been about Clarice and Hannibal, we would've been deprived one of the most thrilling sequences ever put to film. All three of the characters- Clarice, Hannibal, and Buffalo Bill- are essential to why this movie is so good.The movie works effectively as a thriller in Clarice's chase of Buffalo Bill, there's no doubt about that. But the added dynamic of Hannibal probing into Clarice's psyche makes it so much better. When Clarice (Jodie Foster) is sent to Hannibal Lecter's (Anthony Hopkins) cell to learn from him and get information on the serial killer Buffalo Bill (Ted Levine), she is told not to give Dr. Lecter any personal information. He is a former psychiatrist who ate his victims, and he can deduce volumes about a person just by looking at her. Clarice, in an attempt to gain his trust, does give him personal information. I wouldn't call this a mistake, even though she went against her supervisor's advice, because she does gain his trust, and in the process, we learn more about Lecter and Clarice than we could've otherwise.A plot summary would have you believe that the story of this movie is Clarice's search for Buffalo Bill through Lecter, but the real story lies in how Lecter reveals information about Bill to Clarice and what we learn about the two of them in the process. A lesser movie would have depended on action and violence to tell this story- and make no mistake, there is definitely violence in this movie. But the brilliance of The Silence of the Lambs is that it depends on character to tell its story.And thank God for Jodie Foster and Anthony Hopkins being in it to make those characters. Jodie Foster plays a woman in a man's world, and she conveys the awkwardness and defiant streak that this brings out in her. There are moments where she plays the sycophant to get what she needs from the men around her, and others where she takes charge and we can hear the self-consciousness in her voice. Hopkins plays a creature that also happens to be human. He plays Lecter creepily, of course, and he pulls that aspect off quite well; but there is more to Lecter than just being creepy- he is also brilliant, and he has desires just like any other human being. Hopkins makes this noticeable. Ted Levine has less of a chance to show his chops, but what we do see of him is compelling and unsettling- he makes a wonderful villain.This is one of my favorite movies, now that I've finally seen it. It deserves it's place as one of the top movies of all time because it exceeds all expectations of what it's kind of movie should be, and in the process it surpasses great movies of more dependable genres.",The Silence of the Lambs

I give it a 10/10. Goody, goody.",The Silence of the Lambs
440,hbdave_77,Dr Hannibal the Cannibal will stays in memory forever,9,1 February 2009,"Its brilliantly made dark psychological thriller which gave one of the most dangerous character of Hollywood cinema - 'Dr. Hannibal Lecter. The movie is a screen adaptation of best selling novel by the same name written by Thomas Harris. Clarice is FBI trainee goes to interview Dr Hannibal the cannibal to solve the puzzling serial killer Buffalo Bill who skins his victims & keeps them in a pit in his basement. The current captive is US senator's daughter & Dr. Hannibal is the only available clue of the case. Its interplay between Clarice & Dr. Hannibal which made it unsettling thrill ride of 2 hours. As he helps to solve Buffalo Bill case, he digs deep into Clarice's hidden psyche. Every technical aspects of the film are just immaculate & gives you thrill feel from the beginning to end. It's waste of words if I say much about the performances since the film swept the Oscars, winning Best Actor (Anthony Hopkins), Best Actress (Jodie Foster), Best Director (Jonathan Demme), Best Picture, & Best Adapted Screenplay (Ted Tally). This is the third film who won Oscars in all 5 major categories; the other two were- 'It happened one night' & 'One flew over cuckoo's nest'. Hopkins won the Best Actor despite being in the film for about 30 minutes, may be the shortest screen appearance for any best actor winner & that itself proves that Anthony Hopkins has delivered his best in it. I have watched 'Red Dragon' & 'Hannibal' made in the same legacy of this one but after watching this today I must say this will remain matchless classic.Ratings-9/10",The Silence of the Lambs
441,skiop,Kinda boring,6,29 June 2006,"Somewhat an inferior sequel to ""Manhunter,"" we find Jack Crawford (Scott Glenn) assigning FBI trainee Clarice Starling (Jodie Foster) to interview Lecter about killer Buffalo Bill, who has been kidnapping young women throughout the southern United States.Much like ""Manhunter,"" this movie focuses on the investigator. However, Clarice Starling isn't nearly as interesting as Will Graham. She thinks she's one of the big boys, but hasn't done anything to prove herself and actually shows herself unworthy of that recognition.Anthony Hopkins, replacing Brian Cox, hams up the role of Lecter, taking away a bit of a creepy edge. Jodie Foster proves that accents aren't one of her talents. Scott Glenn is once again great in a small role.The movie unwraps slowly, but without worthy characters, we don't find ourselves interested in what develops. The movie doesn't really pick up until the climatic confrontation.A year after this movie's release, ""Basic Instinct"" was badly received for its perceived homophobic content. However, ""Basic Instinct"" only had a killer that happened to be a lesbian, where ""Silence of the Lambs"" creates an explicit link between the killer's killing and his sexual confusion, definitely making it the more homophobic of the two.It's a good story of a young woman's growth, but it's not compelling or thrilling.",The Silence of the Lambs
442,suryanmukul,Raw psychological crime thriller.,7,20 July 2020,"The silence of the lambs -1991A psychological crime thriller, fully agree to say it wow on the basis of raw crime scenes of brutal killings and FBI investigation of a psycho killer to catch another!The story is presented simple and not too much complicated by the director and writer i.e. to catch Buffalo Bill - a psychopath killer who kills the ladies and uses their skin to make an outfit with the help of another psycho killer psychiatrist Dr. Lecter, who is behind the bars. FBI trainee Clarice Starling is the investigation in charge and goes through multiple visits just to find out who is the killer and where he is. Although the story is not about too much mind games, it's just of some psycho killings in which the director created some ruthless killing and postmortem scenes which will be very difficult to see if someone fears to see the blood.Technically it is a well-crafted movie where the camera is used very beautifully to capture closeup shots and especially breaking the fourth wall. If we talk about acting performances, every character did a good job and helped three main characters to show their ultimate performance skills and kudos to the production designing team to create amazing crime and postmortem scenes and to create raw locations such a house of Buffalo Bill with all those dirty room with bugs and his makeup and dressing room.Overall its will be a delight to watch this crime thriller in which viewers will not have to put their mind. It is just to experience a few brutal killings and crime scenes and How FBI agent ables to catch the killer. The movie ends with a call from Dr. Lecter to the agent Clarice Starling asking "" have the lambs stopped screaming "" is a conclusion of the story leaving the viewer to think what is gonna happen ahead.",The Silence of the Lambs

444,Ryan_9,Incredible thriller!,10,4 June 2020,"I absolutely loved The Silence of the Lambs. Everything about this film was perfect. It starred Jodie Foster as Clarice Starling, a student at the FBI's training academy, assigned by agent Jack Crawford (Scott Glenn) to interview Dr. Hannibal Lecter (Anthony Hopkins), a former psychiatrist and cannibalistic serial killer to see if Lecter can help them solve the Buffalo Bill (Ted Levine) murders and tell them who is behind it.First off I'll say that the acting in this was phenomenal. Anthony Hopkins put on one of the best performances I've ever seen and to think he's only in it for a total of 16 minutes! He really got into the craziness of Hannibal Lecter with his dialogue, characterization, and emotions. Hannibal Lecter is for sure one of the most interesting characters of all time. Jodie Foster was excellent too, as I liked Clarice. She was really someone who you could get behind and root for. I liked how much she developed into a smart FBI agent. It was intriguing to see Foster in a more normal role considering I watched Taxi Driver recently and whom she played was VERY DIFFERENT from Clarice. There's no doubt that Hopkins and Foster deserved to win the Oscars that year for best actor and best actress. Ted Levine, who played the Buffalo Bill was also great as he did a good job of making the Buffalo Bill such a creepy person.The cinematography was outstanding and there were some nice camera angles. I especially liked the POV shots. Lots of great suspense in this such as when Lecter escaped from his cell, and they had the cops, swat team and medics looking for him and when Clarice chased the Buffalo Bill around his house. Those were my favorite parts. I was on the edge of my seat during the house chase. I loved the ending as it was a great way to leave things opened and a nice way for us to know where Lecter is.Overall, I'll rate The Silence of the Lambs a 10/10. Incredible film, that rightfully deserved to win the five main Oscars that year.",The Silence of the Lambs

I have seen many thrillers and I can honestly say that this one is not even in my Top 20. Although I think Hopkins did a terrific job in Lecter's shoes, his 30 minutes on screen just were not enough. This was supposed to be a horror film but I think it barely managed to create the suspense atmosphere and it certainly did not scare me or made me feel uncomfortable at all. Perhaps I expected more since I have been hearing all the fuzz about this movie since I was a little kid. So I watched this film several times and I am still not enjoying it that much.",The Silence of the Lambs

However, on the suggestion of a friend, I recently watched ""The Silence of the Lambs"" and very much enjoyed it. It was a terrifying movie, but it was good for far more than just some jump scares. The terrifying sophisticated psychiatrist Dr. Hannibal Lecter was played wonderfully by Anthony Hopkins, and Jodie Foster also did an intense Academy Award winning performance as FBI agent-in-training Clarice Starling.A gripping movie from beginning to end that left me with more questions than answers, ""The Silence of the Lambs"" is a very good movie that deserves all the praise it has earned.(I saw this on June 29, 2017.)",The Silence of the Lambs
448,meurernick,A Horror Classic,8,7 October 2020,"I watched this back in my freshman year of high school. Revisiting it almost 8 years later, I enjoyed it even more. Let's talk about the acting first. Anthony Hopkins is in the movie for less than 30 minutes of screen time, and he steals every scene. The thing that made him so chilling, was how he could dissect a person both mentally and emotionally. Everyone I've heard has also agreed with this claim. Then there's Clarice Starling. She held herself together with Dr. Lecter. She'd take what Dr. Lecter would throw at her, and throw it right back at him. She might've broken down in the parking lot, but she didn't show weakness in front of someone who who could take control of the conversation so quickly. The scenes between Clarice and Dr. Lecter were my favorite. A battle of wits and intellect. Clarice didn't take s**t from anyone, and was even able to outsmart Dr. Lecter and the FBI at points. And she was only in the academy! Finally, there's Buffalo Bill. He felt like a mix of Ted Bundy and Ed Gein. He was also creepily funny. Mocking Catherine's screams, calling one of his victims, a ""great, big, fat person"", and not really taking Clarice seriously when she tries to arrest him. He's a mean guy, but he had fun with his role. I like the production design of Buffalo Bill's house. Looks like a normal house from the outside, but then in the basement, it's like a maze, and then a giant hole in the middle of the room. And then all the moths flying around. Gross. There's also some very good editing, especially during scenes with Clarice and Dr. Lecter. The score was also pretty solid.",The Silence of the Lambs

The conversations between Starling and Hannibal Lekter are shot so well and dialogs are written so fine that even though the character of Hannibal don't appear much but still its the one that you'll never forget. Even the character of Buffalo Bill is very much creepy but Lekter wins for me. Anthony Hopkins as Hannibal has delivered a stunning performance. Jodie Foster has also done a good job. The psycho-thriller theme is well established throughout the movie. Its creepy in a sense. The movie is nearly perfect in every aspect. Even the background score settles well enhancing the environment. Its one of the movie you won't forget. Though the character was introduced first in manhunter, its now that it marks its true nature. I would really recommend it to all.",The Silence of the Lambs

The characters are amazing and there is a lot of shown development with them, especially with Hannibal Lecter, who has to be one of cinemas greatest Villains. The film tells a gruesome story that you want to leave your memory immediately after you've watched it. The Silence of the Lambs is more a thriller than a horror. There are few intense/scary/suspenseful scenes, but besides that it's just a story of a creepy mystery.

Sir Anthony Hopkins was incredibly chilling in this film and its one of the few films that does send tension and chills through my spine.

454,matjusm,Silence of the Lambs- a decent thriller but not a horror,8,24 January 2005,"Having seen Hannibal before this and enjoying it, I really got my hopes up since this was supposed to be even better (after all, it won 5 Oscars). And in many ways it is. Agent Clarice Starling has just joined the FBI and her first assignment is to track down a serial killer known as Buffalo Bill. To do that, she enlists the help of Dr. Hannibal Lecter, an infamous cannibal who is being held at a maximum security psychiatric hospital. From there on it is an excellent duel between Lecter and Starling, both delivering top notch performances (though unfortunately, we don't see too much of Lecter). As the FBI is closing in on Buffalo Bill, Lecter is growing over Starling. Though at first she was instructed to only 'get the goods and nothing else', she crosses that line. And from there it continues into the hunt for Buffalo Bill and the relationship between the two main characters. This movie was above all a thriller. It was tense, interesting and included everything that one could hope for. However, despite being listed so, it is not a horror. There are a few remote and moderately creepy elements but nothing to truly send chills down your back. The direction by Jonathan Demme I would describe as competent. It is strong but in a few places I felt that he could have made it a bit creepier and maybe even bloodier. Tak Fujimoto's cinematography which in this movie is represented by a heavy use of steadicam and well used hand-held shots is excellent and right on the mark. Overall an excellent thriller. 8/10",The Silence of the Lambs

458,dillylamar,The Silence of the Lambs,10,23 June 2020,"The Silence Of The LambsThe Silence of the Lambs is a 1991 film directed by Jonathan Demme, written by Ted Tally, and starts Jodie Foster, Anthony Hopkins, Scott Glenn, and Ted Levine. This film is one of my favorites. Flawless. Its direction is precise, meticulous, and unique, making this film such a game changer breaking the preconceptions of the thriller/horror genre. The screenplay is phenomenal, captivating, and detailed, based off of the book by Thomas Harris. Its performances are iconic. Jodie Foster does a great job portraying a young female trainee aspiring to be a hard nosed FBI agent, whom is vulnerable, constanly objectified by men, and constantly preconceived for her gender, and emerged in her past, yet strong and determined. Anthony Hopkind gives the greatest performance of all time as Hannibal Lector. He dominates every second of the screen for his total 16 minute screentime. He is a psychiatrist turned serial killer and cannibal, who is locked in a maximum security facility for the remainder of his life. Hopkins terrifies the audience with his deep gaze, his meticulous and detailed speech, his lack of blinking and showing weakness, and his constant psychoanalysis, purged with the creepy and chilling presence of the character. Lector is a cannibal, yet respectful and courteous to those he deems as such. He constantly five steps ahead of you and in your head. He is at full acceptance of his identity, and is a aristocratic man. Enjoying the fine and classic tastes. He is a master manipulator. Scott Glenn does a fine job in his role as Jack Crawford. While Ted Levine, only getting limited screentime, does a great job as Buffalo Bill, a serial killer who skins women trying to make a body suit. He was a patient of Lectors, and despises his identity, desperate to become a woman, most likely due to a rough and horrid upbringing. The films cinematography and use of the close up on the face camera during the dialogue sequences are one of a kind and brillant. Investiging the audience. The themes of this film are as such. Its about transformation. Clarice is desperate to become a hard nosed FBI agent, rejecting the preconceptions of feminity. She is also trying to put her past at ease, by catching a killer and saving a girl. She is trying to silence the lambs. The loss of her father put her a place of unknown, she tried to save a screaming lamb but it was slaughtered. She is always met with the male gaze and the either sexual objectification or gender preconception, thay she constantly tries to defy. Lector is the only character who pretty much accepts his identiy. He was born the way he is, and nothing made him the way he is. He respects Clarice Starling's determination and perservance. Buffalo Bill mirrors Starling. A man whom hates his identity and desperately tries to change, and become a woman. He most likely had an abusive childhood making him what he is. He is the opposite of Clarice but also the same. His transformation his physical, while hers is psychological. Katherine (Bill's first victim) is also revealed to have desires to transform. She is overweight and wants to be desirable and thin. That is shown through the items in her room. The ballerina and the pictures. Starling is a determined, strong woman in a mans world of chauvinists, killers, manipulators, who is vulnerable, fearful, and human. She is trying to silence the screaming lambs of her past and insecurities, and accomplishes that. Lector is what he is. Bill and Clarice mirror each other. The films symbolism through colors, design, and images are prevalent. The cocoon, moth, and butterfly are the main focus. A representation of transformation, whether good or bad. This film breaks preconceptions of genre, characters, through its characters, camera angles, dialogue, and its payoff the Oscars. Lector gives Clarice hints to test her. He wants to know about her past. Possibly he respects her as a person, or he is attracted to her. He escapes in the end and plans to kill the psychiatrist at the end, who constantly tries to get information out of him, and tried to transfer him. He only kills people who he deems rude. He is an old fashioned gentleman yet a killer. Clarice subverts the male gaze. Lector is a superior man in intelligence, senses, and thought. Bill sees women as objects. Wants to be one to become sexy and because he hates himself. At least that is what he thinks. He loves his moth garden. Creating a woman as cocoon to become a woman. He has butterflies and moths flying around his house. The killers in prison are animals and are different than Lector. He admires her bravery, intelligence, and determination. She makes him belive in goodness a little bit, by her showing him her motivation in reality is the protection of innocence. She defied his expectations.",The Silence of the Lambs
459,yellowtail_tuna,Starling holds up on the verge of fear,10,29 May 2020,"The first meeting of Clarice Starling and Hannibal Lecter in the prison is thrilling. Security surrounding Lecter is like that in a nuclear lab, which you will later know is not overly cautious. At the first appeance of Lecter, his posture alone is already somehow weird.Starling, a diligent, stoic, grade-A FBI trainee, nervously, and trying to hide her nervousness, sits in front of Lecter. Instantly Lecter sees through her vulnerability, laying out his profiling on her ""with your good bag and your cheap shoes.. you look like a rube...not more than one generation from poor white trash..."" In her face twitch, we see her fear to get intruded into her past.To get help from Lecter for the case of the serial killer Buffalo Bill, Starling keeps in touch with him. She comes to fully trust his ability to analyze. Lecter also seems to be amused by her visits. Lecter is not a villan at all. Generally speaking, at least in movies, we love psychopaths, especially when they help the protagonist. It is almost exhilarating to see how he outsmarts the guards and officers in the middle of the film.No matter how iconic the psychopath Dr. Lecter is, my highest praise goes to Jodie Foster. Clarice Starling is the type of person whose intelligence directly reflects her sensitivity, and it is probably the nature that the actress herself has. Starling holds up on the verge of fear, and go through risky paths to reach the truth. Foster's delicate expressions show Starling's internal conflict, contemplation, and judgement.Large part of the film consists of close-up shots, which means you spend much time to watch the characters' faces, closely enough to examine their pores. This may subliminally make remind you of the important object of the story: skin. Throughout the film, you keep feeling the softness of skin, whether the owner is alive or dead. I suspect this is one of the secrets that make this film so creepy.Aside from the character close-up shots, the camera always wabbles anxiously. Most locations are set in gloomy local neighbourhood. I like a scene set in a victim's room, where Starling finds many private objects that maybe the owner would not want the others to see. Someone's private space is where you might find strangeness, physically or mentally. And the film digs into each character's deep private space.",The Silence of the Lambs

Most of the scenes in the film are closed indoor environment, the overall scene structure makes people feel more confusing, and the closed indoor environment will give people a feeling of action breakthrough. The atmosphere created by the entire movie is like introducing all people into the confusing of the whole film.

That one movie could contain two of the greatest performances of all time, the greatest detective story ever put on film, and remain endlessly entertaining 28 years after its release is truly amazing. Every actor, every shot, every scene, and every line is brilliant. Clarice Starling is maybe my favorite movie heroine and certainly one of my favorite characters. Foster's Oscar-winning performance creates someone who's both brave and honest but also very relatable, allowing the audience to be so emotionally invested in her story that it's impossible to turn away during any of the movie's 118 minutes.Then of course there's Anthony Hopkins as Hannibal Lecter - by far the best performance of his career. Hopkins manages to be both menacing and gracious as this cultivated serial killer, it's one of the most unique pieces of acting in cinema history and his Best Actor Oscar was well deserved. Jonathan Demme's direction is spot-on: he crafts a chilling atmosphere and a realistic, believable world that makes the film's story all the more engaging. Another director might've turned Thomas Harris' novel into a cliche slasher movie, but Demme transformed it into one of the most effective dramas of all time.

It exploded on to the screen as a complete surprise, and fully deserved the extraordinary level of the plaudits it received.It is not realistic, but do all films really have to be? The central character of Clarice Starling is easily recognisable as the modern career woman struggling with something to prove, played to perfection by Jodie Foster. But of course she is overshadowed by the entrancing performance of Anthony Hopkins as Hannibal Lecter. At once terrifying, fascinating and slightly surreal, he lurks in the mind long after the movie ends, even though his time on-screen makes up a relatively small proportion of the film, and it is worth seeing for him alone.It is hard to say that the film would have scored the success it did without this mesmerising performance. But as so often with films which are dominated by one single aspect, the fact that you are made to look closely at it reveals a number of other qualities. Tension is admirably maintained, despite the far-fetched plot, and at times it is genuinely frightening, keeping you on the edge of your seat.It's a thrilling ride; one which requires you at times to suspend your sense of reality and go where the director wants to take you.

So what's up with this movie?1. Acting: Jodie Foster as Clarice Starling and Anthony Hopkins as Dr. Hannibal Lecter deliver one heck of a performance! The way Hannibal's character gets described makes me AFRAID of him without him doing anything!2. Witty Story: The main story is structured in two parts: One goes backward (Calrice's memory/story), the other goes forward (Buffalo Bill pursuit). So the film consistently demands your attention with purposely incomplete information. Your brain just begs to know what's gonna happen next! Those 2 hours flew like NOTHING! I was FULLY ENGAGED throughout the entire movie!3. More Than Meets the Eye: As the story unfolds you can tell that this movie has a DEEPER meaning behind it: Even though Hannibal is a lunatic, he is the NICEST person to Clarice Starling! He treats her as a human being with RESPECT, he wants to know more about her, while the other men seen in this movie, only see Clarice as an object, a pretty woman. That's why during the story, Clarice is constantly asked out by other men instead of them taking her seriously. This movie is about how men mistreat women!4. Camerawork: I am not sure if you noticed, but the camera work in this film is just GENIOUS! Whenever someone talks, the shot zooms and focuses on the person speaking. It makes you feel like the present person is talking to YOU! Making this movie way more realistic, and engaging.Conclusion: The Silence of the Lambs (1991) is worth your time!

The conversation's between Clarice Starling (Jodie Foster) and Hannibal Lecter (Anthony Hopkins) must be some of the best dialogue I've ever heard. It keeps you constantly on your toes. The jostling for superiority of the conversation is brilliant-It almost feels like a game of chess.
The cinematography is haunting at times. It utilises the narrow shot to perfection, this is perfect for when Lecter is talking to Starling. The narrow shots here make a sense of claustrophobia, implying that Starling is frightened and does not really want to be there.
The performance across the board are sublime however Hopkins' and Foster's are unbeatable. Anthony Hopkins portrays Hannibal Lecter as the genius yet disturbed man he is, he does this so well that just from body language alone it feels intolerable to be with him. Foster's Clarice shows a beautiful development from a person scared of Hannibal Lecter even from behind glass to a woman going toe to toe with buffalo Bill.

HannibalThe only horror film in history to win a Best Picture Oscar (1992). One of the only three films in history to win all the five major Oscars: The Big Five (Picture; Leading Actor; Leading Actress; Director; Screenplay), after ""It Happened One Night"" (1934) and ""One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest"" (1975).A young FBI recruit Clarice Starling (Foster) is asked by her superior to visit a notorious serial killer Hannibal ""The Cannibal"" Lecter (Hopkins), a former psychiatrist held in a subterranean prison who may provide some insight into the motivation of an another serial killer, a madman who skins his victims, which will help the FBI catch him. For his help, Lecter demands personal information about agent Starling's childhood in return, treating her as a patient of his.Apart from this being an excellent detective thriller, the real horror element comes from these little discussions with Lecter. His menace isn't rooted in gore or terror but rare, profound authority. We fear the power of villains because they wield weapons, supernatural might or brutality. We fear Lector because of his sheer psychological influence. Despite the thick glass in-between, there's absolutely nothing you can hide from him, he sees everything (he even blinks only when he actually consciously wants to), he knows everything and there is nothing you can do about it. Imagine if Sherlock Holmes didn't use his gift to catch criminals and unveil mysteries, but to commit intricate murders and pick other people's brains (literally and figuratively) so that they go insane just by listening to him. With 24 minutes and 52 seconds of screen time, Sir Anthony Hopkins' performance in this movie is the second shortest to ever win an Academy Award for Best Actor in a Leading Role. In preparation for his role, Hopkins studied files of serial killers, visited prisons, studied convicted murderers, and was present during some court hearings concerning gruesome murderers and serial killings. Truly, the most frightening cinematic villain of all time.Jodie Foster's performance as Clarice only seems bleak in the huge shadow of Hopkins; she managed to pull off the reaction of sheer terror during the most psychologically daunting of the scenes, although a huge chunk of that was due to the directing. The directing of this film is, for me personally, the embodiment of the word ""perfect"". The most obvious thing to notice is the way they used extreme close-up of actor's faces during intense scenes to show the maximum range of emotion possible; the same feature that they, funnily enough, efficiently used in ""The Queen's Gambit"" and that isn't nearly used as much as it should be. There are too many other little details to talk about, that you will also notice once you decide to actively pay attention. It's really sad this was the directors Jonathan Demme's only masterpiece.Another thing that contributes to the horror, is the realism that was admitted even by the FBI themselves, who fully supported the production of this film. They praised the realism of how people behave in a hostage situation, and the depiction of pathological behavior of serial killers. Despite this film not being based on a true story, it gets ever more horrifying when you realize how many equally grotesque true stories are out there, some of which might have happened right next door.

This film was kind of strange, but I really liked it. Anthony Hopkins did a really good job playing Hannibal ""The Cannibal"". I really liked how he ate that cop guy.

One of few movies that are gripping right from the beginning to the very end. There is a pinch of hidden jet black humour here and there and a sprinkle of camp every now and then only enhancing the atmosphere of desperation and disgust. I thought the killer's motivation and backstory somewhat lacking, I'd given Foster less screen time as she was well acted but boring character in the end, stiff, ambitious student, one you would not be friends with in high school.

473,Global_Marketing_Pros,"Moral and Ethical Vs Immoral and Unethical characters, or the Silk Worm Vs the Merchant",10,5 March 2007,"In The Republic, Plato puts the tale of the ring of Gyges in the mouth of Glaucon, who uses it to make the point that no man is so virtuous that he could resist the temptation of being able to steal at will by the ring's power of invisibility. In contemporary terms, Glaucon argues that morality is a social construction, whose source is the desire to maintain one's reputation for virtue and honesty; when that sanction is removed, moral character would evaporate.What is the screenwriter trying to tell the audience other than another gruesome tale of human nature. The entertainment of the doctor, Hanibal Lecture, must be as equal to the thrills of the audience. Just as the good doctor hears the evils of man baptized by the oath of Hippocrates he is obligated by the oath to remain secret. At least until that oath can be legally dealt, and still due to personal intelligence the details not recorded are his duty to disclose.Almost like a shield that mirrors his own reflection his conscience maintains his own character, but it consumes him. This reminds me of the scene from Superman II as well during the hour of judgment of the State criminals. Where they become imprisoned in a mirror for their crimes. Was it really three different criminals or just one with three personalities of a mute, military general, and women.Just as the beginning of this analysis ancient myth of human nature could play on many aspects. Perhaps the reason for the use of the Deaths Head Moth being placed in the mouth. Or, based on history of film this could be the screen-writers reference to Der Fanger, 1966. A German movie that deals with a butterfly collector who develops a super-ego of power that deteriorates into a psychosis of mania where he begins to collect women.Myths such as the emperors new cloths may play a significant role. Hence the use of women to make a new image that is respectable. The women are used to conceal the hidden emotions of the dual character of cross-gender nature. Thus the suspect makes a physical outer appearance as apparent as his illness inflicts is physical character.Just as a garment is made from silk cloth at the expense of the moth the image of mentally ill must be at equal risk concerning human virtue. As the story is told and what is known about society and human virtue without both the individual is naked to the morals and ethics of the society. Thus as an analogous relationship just as the moth is destroyed for the sake of the merchant because of the separation of Buddist values and economic values the mentally ill individual destroys women when he truly separates from the moral and ethical obligations of society to promote his own individual image.Actor Anthony Hopkins plays a fantastic role as the doctor. His practice at being cold and clever makes him seem the more distant. This is the exact opposite in his role as Ted Brautigan in Hearts in Atlantis. Anthony Hopkins recently became a US citizen from the United Kingdom. His duty to the UK military and theatrical skills have propelled him in his own career that is highly noted by his peers from around the globe. Good job Anthony Hopkins.",The Silence of the Lambs

It does a perfect job at cutting together sequences and building the tension. The cinematography here breaks a lot of rules, but it does it at the right time and adds the right effect. The film is very tense and has plenty of scary elements. Would I call it absolutely terrifying? No, but it definitely has scary elements throughout. The performances here are all pretty good as well, Anthony Hopkins gives a really fascinating performance that is made possible by the script. The dialogue and relationships between characters are great, and I'd almost call this a psychological thriller with more than one character as the focus. The score here is pretty good, I wouldn't call it amazing, it wasn't incredibly terrifying or anything but I think that comes from more of general sound design which wasn't the style the film went with here. Overall, I wouldn't call it one of my favorites of all time, but it's worth checking out if you want something more disturbing and a psychological aspect thrown in there. 7.5/10.",The Silence of the Lambs

The movie deserved its five Oscar wins. The genre does not get much better than this.Clarice Starling (Jodie Foster) is a young and attractive FBI trainee. She is called on an ""interesting errand"" by director Jack Crawford (Scott Glenn) to try to make a profile of Dr. Hannibal Lector (Anthony Hopkins), an imprisoned and insane former forensic psychiatrist. There is also a killer on the loose who kidnaps and skins young women, known as ""Buffalo Bill""/ Jame Gumb (Ted Levine). Hannibal Lecter offers to help capture him before he kills again.Hannibal Lecter is simply one of the most unforgettable villains in history. Hopkins's portrayal chilled many audiences (including my mother lol) and became a phenomenon. Hopkins deserved more recognition than an Oscar! Jodie Foster was great for the part. She also deserved her Oscar. Her and Hopkins make a good acting duo.Ted Levine was creepy as Jame Gumb. His accent made me crack up sometimes. He portrays the homicidal maniac to a horrifically authentic degree. I can hardly stand to watch in his little ""dance sequence"". The characters all together are simply unforgettable.As the case with most of the Hannibal Lecter movies (with the exception of ""Manhunter), ""Silence of the Lambs"" sticks close to the book.

This is a movie with no light moments in it at all, although a film all about serial killers is not going to be a laugh a minute in any case.The performances are all excellent. Hard to say which is better , Jodie Foster or Anthony Hopkins. Hannibal is played with chilling air of menace by Hopkins, giving the feeling that if the glass between you and him ever came down, you'd survive about thirty seconds. And yet, as a previous reviewer stated, he makes Lecter seem somehow human at the same time. Foster makes the role of Clarice totally her own, and what her so much more convincing for some reason, was giving her dark hair. A special mention must also go to Ted Levine as Buffalo Bill, a complete fruitcake for most of the movie but when Clarice calls to his house appears almost completely normal.

Everyone knows the story by now of how Clarice Starling(Foster) has not yet passed-out of the FBIs famous academy at Quantico when and where she is under the close supervision of one of its chiefs Jack Crawford(Glenn)and they are on the hunt for a serial-killer 'Buffalo Bill'. They or perhaps SHE seeks the assistance of Dr.Hannibal Lekter, a brilliant but disturbed criminal killer himself and she has intimate talks with him in his cell to garner information she hopes will help find 'Bill' before he kills more innocent young women in his most deranged and brutal way mutilating them. The only criticism I saw throughout the film was the plausibility of the situation Foster finds herself in towards the very end and whether that would be possible? I don't know - I 'm NOT in the FBI and having read the 'Trivia' I think this has been explained.

This movie has everything a good thriller needs, from the long, slow shots that hide more than what they show, to the creepy music and creepy scenarios. The mysterious dialogues in which the actors are watching at the camera are particularly good, and that sense that Hannibal Lecter is actually talking to you is difficult to forget. And Anthony Hopkins' character didn't get a well-deserved place in popular culture and Haloween costumes for nothing: it is by far the best of this movie. From his amazing way of speaking, to his lines, going through all the security paraphernalia around him (which undoubtedly help to create the feeling his quite a dangerous man), everything shouts ""You're gonna have nightmares with this"". Not to forget the quite memorable scene of his escape, one of the highest peaks of the movie.Buffalo Bill's character is also pretty damn good, and every time a scene involves him you just want the scene to end before anything bad happens (which, given the character's unstable personality, might happen at any time). The final persecution scene is heart-stopping, and is way too long for any viewer's sanity (specially the last tiny bit with night Vision glasses).And Jodie Foster? Yes, she is not bad.

This movie is brilliant as it shows two actors in great performances like Anthony Hopkins and Jodie Foster. But these two have become so overrated, that we even, sometimes, may forget the others from the great cast, like Ted Levine, Anthony Heald and Brooke Smith, all of them in great performances. I tried to watch this movie for the second time without anything nearby disturbing me like sounds, phone conversations and lights turning on and off. Glad I am as those things didn't happen the first time I watched it, so I could absorb the movie quite well. In conditions like that, I became completely frozen when I saw Hannibal Lecter for the first time, on screen, standing up, still, in that green prisoner outfit, in his prison cell, saying only ""Good Morning"".Well, Hopkins has proved himself he can deliver quite a good performance, whether he stands still or not, whether he's silence of not. The movie features many brilliant scenes like Lecter's escape from his cell in the police department, his conversations with Agent Clarice Starling and the breathtaking few scenes of Catherine Martin screaming for being held hostage by the never ending sinister psychopath, Buffalo Bill, played by Levine.The Silence Of The Lambs' plot is one many people might already know. But this review, of course, like all my others, are intended to be read by people who have already watched the movie. Foster goes on an assignment to meet Hannibal Lecter and take from him clues in order to catch the assassin. But Lecter gives Starling the chance for them to perform the ""quid pro quo"", which suggests that whenever he gives her information, she will have to tell him about her life. This makes character developing take place in most of the entire movie.This won 5 Oscars, as I think it deserved. The only thing I didn't like in it was when Foster withdrew her pistol in order to arrest Buffalo Bill, as she did it very slow, a minus for a winning performance like Foster's.

491,NEFARlOUS,Silence of the Hams,1,25 March 1999,"Having read both the Prequel (Manhunter) and Silence of the Lambs, I was looking forward to seeing how the transition to the screen went.A while back ""Manhunter"" was released, and although abridged and with a different (but better) ending, I loved it. Particularly Brian Cox as Hannibal Lecter, soft spoken, analytical and very, very calm. However, always an undercurrent of danger and a mere whisper of insanity.Now on to ""Silence of the Lambs"" - Hannibal Lecter has gone from being an all too believable real-life monster to a giggling Hollywood psycho - a veritable troll complete with his own dungeon (alas, no smoking torches) and a set of eyes wide enough to make Marty Feldman blink.Serial murderers such as this, particularly highly intelligent ones, do not prance about revelling in how evil they are, nor do they speak in such ridiculous snidley tones.They appear quite normal - the reason why they managed to get away with what they did for the length of time they did. Occasionally they speak in monotones and look at nothing in particular. Check out interviews of real-life serial killers - you won't find Anthony Hopkins's fairground pastiche there.The story itself rambled, the interplay between the two characters did'nt work - Hopkins possibly due to the material, Foster due to the lack of a believable protagonist. They have thankfully both done far better work than this both before and since.

493,theresamgill,The Silence of the Praise,6,12 June 2018,"The Silence of the Lambs is only the third movie to win all 5 major Oscars (One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest is another): Best Picture, Director, Actor (and Anthony Hopkins has some of the least screen time for a best actor winner), Actress, and Best Adapted Screenplay. It is the only horror film to ever win Best Picture, and it made all sorts of money-- staying on top of the box office for like 5 weeks and already having made back its budget in the first. So the data coming in would say that I would probably write a review on how good Anthony Hopkins and Jodie Foster were, and how this is such a landmark horror film that would rival The Shining as being the best ever. But I'm not going to. I believe this movie has been highly overrated, and if you allow me to explain, perhaps you'll end agreeing with me too. When you think about this movie, the first thing you think of is either fava beans or Hannibal the Cannibal. But the star is Jodie Foster... What's her character's name again? Clarence, Karen, Carly? You know what, doesn't really matter. We'll save Jodie Foster for later because Anthony Hopkins is really what this movie is known for. And there's a lot of good to indeed say. His looking right at the camera as his character is introduced, his improv mocking of Foster's accent, his unblinking eyes and famous lines. Oscar Winner? Sure. It's all there. My criticism will be discussed later when we talk about the director. What I will say, however, is that Ted Levine is vitally underappreciated as Buffalo Bill. First, I'm glad to see Teddy in a role that isn't a sheriff or cop. Buffalo Bill's luring of women and skinning his victims already made him a viable villain, but it's his dancing in front of the mirror that takes the crown and serves as the creepiest thing in the film.  Okay, I can't hold back any longer. Gotta talk about how this movie suffers. Over the course of filming, I have no issue with the directing. It's not too special, but it's not bad; the camerawork is a different story. It's inconsistent, sloppy, and moves around too much. It tries creating a style that just doesn't work for the film. The exception is Dr. Lecter's scenes. Everything works there, but it seems like the film basically was built around what happened there. Which brings me to the actual story and the editing. We start with Jodie proving herself in the FBI and toughing it out as a female there. It's brief, and some exposition is quickly thrown in to establish her character because, after all, we have to hurry up and get to Hannibal. Which still doesn't seem totally logical. They go to one of the most dangerous and cunning psychiatrists to help catch the notorious Buffalo Bill, and they send an FBI agent who hasn't even graduated? That doesn't add up for me. Fast forward a scene or 2 and we get introduced to Buffalo Bill. It's a disturbing scene, but now we know who everyone is looking for. So the small amount of film dedicated to detective work really hardly serves any purpose because, after all, let's just get back to Hannibal. However smart the Hannibal scenes may be, they're also predictable. And the music really is more nonchalant than anything, and when you mix it all together, you get a film that really isn't all that scary. It's a cop story with a good, not great, female lead and an unremarkable story, so it all dwindles down to Hannibal. And he's truly a pretty great movie psycho, but surround him in a film that is surrounded around him, and the result is just eh.  The climax has predictable moments, but it was leading up to the tense finish I was hoping for the entire film. And then the decisive moment happened and it was so lame. The redeeming part is how the movie ended because despite my criticism from before, I thoroughly enjoyed the ending. So there is that. But if you want an actually scary film with a cool, strong heroine, go watch Alien, Zero Dark Thirty, or just something else.

The reason behind why the guy was killing the ladies was the stupidest thing I have ever heard.  Hannibal Lecter's character and his escape scene were really the only things I liked in the whole film.  It pretty much sucked.",The Silence of the Lambs

The performances are uniformly strong with Hopkins having the most colorful and making the very most of it. The direction and screenplay mostly are also extremely strong.So why that ending?  Part Collector, mostly Wait Until Dark, and several slasher films have gone this very same route.Because the film is so very very good the ending is a let-down.

496,Lunchbox-8,"""I ate his liver with Fava beans and a nice Chianti...""",9,16 January 2001,"Dr. Hannibal Lecter: incredibly brilliant, amazingly deceptive and manipulative, and unspeakably evil.  ""The Silence of the Lambs"" delves into the depths of the mind of Hannibal Lecter. In 1991, when ""The Silence of the Lambs"" was released, audiences were shocked when the previously mild-mannered Anthony Hopkins delivered the amazing performance as Hannibal Lecter.  It was the the third movie in history to recieve all five major Academy Awards, Best Picture, Best Actor, Best Actress, Best Director, and Best Screenplay.  The Academy was right in giving the awards to this fantastic movie. Clarice Starling is taken away from her normal training as an F.B.I. agent and is dispatched to speak with Lecter, a formerly well known psychologist and now imprisoned murderer.  Her mission in this is to get a mental profile of Buffalo Bill, the current serial killer who the F.B.I. are desperately hunting down.  Maybe, if they had a mental profile from an actual serial killer, and cannibal, they could get inside the mind of Buffalo Bill and catch him.  Hannibal then more or less informs Clarice that Bill was once a patient of his.  As Clarice again interviews Lecter, the story unfolds. This film is more than just the pursuit to catch a serial killer, more than the actions of a serial killer, it is a journey into the mind of an enigma, Dr. Hannibal Lecter.",The Silence of the Lambs

I still agree with the point that ""Spoorloos"" is a really good film, but you have to realize that was only what I thought at that particular time, when it was a long time ago since I last saw ""Silence of the lambs"". Last week I saw this film again and immediately remembered why I used to like it so much.

499,xanderlm,Very thrilling and great film!!!!!,10,16 October 2021,"The best psychological suspense thriller movie ever made IMO. It's not only the psychological thriller movie and it is also teaches some philosophical thoughts through its core characters.Lets take the character Dr. Hannibal Lecter, He is a cannibalistic psychiatric psycho character but if you'd put the microscope in his character by looking in his vision ,we could say that he is looking both human and animal as a food and trying to convey that human beings also a normal living being as same as other living things.And coming to the character agent Clarice starling, she is also same as Dr. Hannibal lecter in treating both as a same living beings . She sees both human and lambs as a respectful living being by showing some kindness and mercy toward lambs which were being slaughtered by her relative and she wants to rescue the character Catherine Martin from the serial killer, Buffalo Bill.With respect to the character Buffalo bill, he loves his dog and he shows very kind and protective towards his dog and he won't respect human being by killing for his use as we the normal people use animals for our use. Our character is just vice versa of his character but emotions are same.And speaking about the last main character, the victim Catherine Martin. This character tries to escape from him by threatening and torturing the dog as we all do at that situation. The character won't mind dog's life and It is the replica of the people we call normal.And among these 4 main characters
1. Dr. Hannibal Lecter.2. Agent Clarice Starling.3. The serial killer Buffalo bill.4. The victim Catherine Martin, We the story listener should decide who is normal and who is abnormal.Talking about the performance of Anthony Hopkins and Judie Foster ,they did some spectacular work as same as the work done by the director and screenplay writer.Not surprised that it got Best five award at Oscars 1991.i recommend it 100% for everyone.",The Silence of the Lambs

'Scare me.' The movie was about to end. 'Scare me.' And then it was over. I didn't find it scary at all... I mean... Boyz In The Hood should've won the Best Picture Oscar... That one had a heart.

It is my second favorite movie of all time next to The Godfather. I still catch little details that I've missed over the hundreds of times I've seen this remarkable movie. They don't make them like this anymore. This movie still scares the lights out of me. Everyone in this movie was amazing. The scene where Buffalo Bill is talking to the girl in the well and she replies that she wants to see her mommy; he bit his lip so he wouldn't cry. That wasn't in the script. They were friends and he said it felt so real when she was begging for her life. Another piece of trivia is during the line; ""I ate his liver with a side of fave beans and nice Chianti, and he makes that sound with his tongue...."" -not in the script either.I can go on forever.

505,Ham_and_Egger,'I'm having an old friend for dinner.',10,6 September 2005,"I ate 'The Silence of the Lambs' up the first time I saw it and I've gone back for more who knows how many times. I can clean my plate and watch the whole thing, or just snack on certain scenes and be satiated. It is fine dining.I admit it's a little bizarre, but if I'm in low spirits I sometimes put *this* movie on to cheer myself up, especially if I'm depressed because I've watched some garbage modern movie. The sheer perfection of it never fails to raise me up a little, and the fact that it was made in 1991 gives me hope that the current crop of Hollywood actors and directors isn't unremittingly bad.The scenes between Anthony Hopkins and Jodie Foster are masterful, they're like the cadenzas to a violin concerto. I've watched those scenes by themselves about twice as often as I've seen the full movie. To see them feeding off each others performances is beautiful, a feast in itself, it doesn't even require fava beans or a nice chianti.But it isn't just Hopkins and Foster. There really isn't a poor performance in the entire film, maybe it's because I'm biased and I've seen it two dozen times but it seems like even the actors in the bit parts are far above average. The bug guys, Miggs, the deputies at the funeral home in Elk River, the chauffeur who ""detests physical labor.""Jonathan Demme's directing is so brilliantly subtle that it's easy to overlook given the gripping story and the incredible acting, but the last time I watched the entire movie I did indeed, ""feel eyes moving over Clarice's body."" I'd read about this before, and undoubtedly processed it subconsciously, but I'd never seen it so starkly. The fact is that throughout the movie men are staring at Jodie Foster, judging her, ordering her around, lusting after her, and finally trying to kill her. This produces an undercurrent of suspense even in scenes that don't necessarily have any other suspenseful elements.Finally, that they managed to do all this and still keep it so realistically lurid is, to me, nothing short of amazing. The pictures of the flayed girls, the bloody fingernail stuck in the wall of the pit, whatever that thing is in the bathtub, it's all so marvelously grotesque you get the feeling that certain too-polite elements of society would love to shun it, but the film is so good that it demands to be watched.",The Silence of the Lambs

His 16 minutes screentime is enough to call this one of the greatest masterpieces ever made. Only Heath Ledger as The Joker in The Dark Knight beats Hopkins' performance by the slightest of margins in my opinion.The brilliance about this movie is that if you choose to call this a horror movie then yes it's the greatest horror movie ever made and if you call it a thriller then it's the greatest thriller ever made. For me it's both the greatest thriller ever and the greatest horror movie ever. The silence of the lambs is forever a terrific movie.10/10.",The Silence of the Lambs
508,Diego_rjc,The perfect psychological thriller,10,9 March 2010,"'The Silence of the Lambs'. This movie literally made cinema's history in the evening of March, 30th, 1992. It was Oscar's night, and Jonathan Demme's thriller went home with all the five major awards - Best Picture, Best Actor in a Leading Role, Best Actress in a Leading Role, Best Director and Best Writing, Screenplay Based on Material from Another Medium, becoming only the third movie is history to ever achieve this accomplishment (the other ones are 1934 Frank Capra's 'It Happened One Night' and 1975 Milos Forman's 'One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest'). And the Academy was perfectly right, as 'The Silence of the Lambs' is easily the best movie of 1991 and one of the best thrillers of all-time. It deserved all the awards it got.'The Silence of the Lambs' is based on one of Thomas Harris' novels about serial-killer Hannibal Lecter. But Lecter only appears in the movie within 13 minutes of runtime. Before that, we are presented to the movie's major plot, that is centered around Clarice Starling (Jodie Foster). Clarice is a young FBI agent that is assigned to the case of Buffalo Bill (Ted Levine), a serial killer that skins his victims and then throws them in a river. But in order to gather information for the case, Clarice must talk to Hannibal Lecter (Anthony Hopkins), the most feared and dangerous serial killer in the world. The story here doesn't have a lot of originality, but the way the movie explains it to the audience is simply amazing. The character development is incredible, the dialogs are outstanding and the montages are breath-taking. I couldn't blink not even for one second, which proves how good the writing is. The first of the five major Oscars was certainly very well-deserved. Thumbs up for Thomas Harris for the novel and for Ted Tally for the excellent adaptation.Now, let's talk about the acting, and there is only one thing to say about it: it couldn't be any better. The whole supporting cast is outstanding, with the exception of Brooke Smith, as one of Buffalo Bill's victims. She was just average, nothing special to it. But the member of the supporting cast that stands out is certainly Ted Levine. He should have been at least Oscar-nominated for his performance as Buffalo Bill, a quite creepy interpretation. Aside from the supporting cast, also composed by Scott Glenn and Anthony Heald, all the attention here goes for the two leading roles. Both Jodie Foster and Anthony Hopkins are perfect, specially Hopkins. Even though he has only 27 minutes of screen-time, Hopkins managed to deliver one of the most memorable performances of the 1990's decade. All his gestures, that creepy coolness, the tones his voice reaches... it's all perfect for the character. None other actor could have done a better job, another very well-deserved Oscar. The other leading role here goes to Jodie Foster. Of course she is not as great as Anthony Hopkins, but she also delivers a very memorable performance. Her naiveness, the hidden South accent, her desperate struggle to impress her superiors - Clarice Starling and Jodie Foster are only one. Again, a deserved Oscar award - this time for Best Actress.The fourth Oscar award this movie received was Best Director for Jonathan Demme. And the guy really impresses you on his directing work. The movie wouldn't be the same nor it would have the same recognition if it wasn't for him. The places Demme puts the camera are excellent, as he did it for the audience to feel in the skin of Clarice Starling. And in order to do this, Demme makes all the characters look straight into the camera, except for Clarice, that never does this, always looking at another direction. There are also a few scenes (most tracking-shots) designed to be like the the eyes of Clarice. And her childhood memories only increases the audience's approach to Jodie Foster's character. Another deserved Oscar-award.The movie was also Oscar-nominated for Best Sound and Best Editing. The Sound here is nothing out of the ordinary, with nice Sound Effects, but a lousy musical score. Nothing that takes away the movie's accomplishments, tough. As for Best Editing, it should have got the award. Craig McKay's editing work is outstanding, as the audience is fooled to believe in things that turn out to be others. I'm not gonna spoil it here, but you are gonna feel pretty dumb once you find out the tricks McKay used. The cinematography here is also nothing out of the ordinary, such as the other aspects. Nothing that's worth mentioning.Overral, 'The Silence of the Lambs' is the perfect psychological thriller. The fact it won all the five major awards at the Oscars only proves my point, and they were all extremely well-deserved. The writing is amazing, the acting is perfect, and the directing is outstanding. You put that with one of the most memorable performances of the decade by Anthony Hopkins, join with a great editing work, ferocious dialogs and an impressive directing, and you have the best movie of 1991. From all the five major awards, the last one was the most well-deserved: Best Picture.10/10",The Silence of the Lambs
509,ShadySovereign,Will the lambs break their silence?,10,24 January 2006,"""The Silence of the Lambs"" is truly a masterpiece. It's a thriller that requires brains to figure out the twists and turns. It's not a mindless horror movie either; the horror elements are very psychological and tend to be disturbing. Furthermore, the film is almost exactly like the novel of the same name.I really love the characters in the movie because they stayed true to the characters in the book. Jodie Foster played the role of FBI rookie Clarice Starling in a very realistic setting, and Anthony Hopkins played his role as the cannibalistic Hannibal Lecter superbly. Both characters were very convincing, thanks to the powerful performances done by Foster & Hopkins.The cinematography is outstanding. Everything about the background imagery mentioned in the book sprang to life in this film. Some locations look very beautiful, while others are downright creepy.The theme music throughout the movie is good and scary, enough to make your nerves tingle. There are also little scenes where familiar popular songs are featured.To conclude, this is a very rich film and sticks to the book very well. It is just as enjoyable as the novel.I give this film a 10/10.",The Silence of the Lambs

Whenever this movie is mentioned among people, they ALWAYS say it's incredibly scary. No one can sleep after watching it, and that's why I was so intrigued to watch it. I was a bit nervous while watching Silence because everyone made such a big deal about how scary it was. While watching it, I realized Silence is an incredibly action filled movie. It is done so well, the acting is perfect and the way everything turns out is amazing. I have to say that I didn't find it very scary ONLY because I had seen Hannibal before Silence. However, the ending is very, very intense, and I can see why people say it's scary. Also, just the fact what Hannibal Lector and Buffalo Bill do is scary enough. It's scary and not a movie to be seen alone on a rainy Friday night, it is a movie to see though because it is very well done.",The Silence of the Lambs
512,stallone-9,The most chilling of all thrillers!!!,10,29 February 2008,I have seen this movie so many times and every time it gets better and better.What makes it so special you ask?Well the great actors for start.Sir Anthony Hopkins as Hannibal Lecter is the best choice for the role.He was born to play the brilliant but psychopathic at the same time cannibal with a taste for livers.I have read the book three times and be sure that the movie follows it closely.Jodie Foster as the unexperienced but intelligent Clarice Starling is also the most perfect choice.She gives depth to her character and it shows.Scott Glenn is great as her mentor Jack Crawford.Wonder why Glenn never became a bigger star he sure deserved it with his performance here.Be warned that the movie has quite a few chills and will take you to the edge with its intense music score and actors.Director Jonathan Demme created a masterpiece and Thomas Harris should be proud.Hannibal and The Red Dragon are good on their own but they just can't touch this movie.Its just too perfect to compare to.,The Silence of the Lambs

515,cassiewright-89520,A Perfect Thriller,9,6 September 2019,"The horror genre has constantly gotten a bad rep over the years for being nothing but mindless gore, shocks, and popcorn entertainment. Even still, there have been many horror films that have managed to leak their way into the mainstream and capture the imaginations and hearts of a wide audience. The Silence of the Lambs proves that you don't need buckets of blood or a shock a minute to tell a thoughtful, unnerving, and unforgettable horror story.Clarice Starling is an up and coming FBI agent who gets the opportunity of a lifetime - probing the mind of the deranged (but oddly charming) Hannibal Lector - a cannibal. Clarice needs information about a recently captured girl who she fears might be the next victim of an even more damaged psychopath who wants to wear her skin. Clarice and Hannibal end up working together to find him, but will Clarice be too late?The trick of Silence of the Lambs is that it spends as much time with character development as it does with the action, thrills, and horror. We get to know Clarice and Hannibal over the course of the film and Jodie Foster and Anthony Hopkins have never been better (hence their well-deserved Oscar wins).It also helps that every frame of the film feels real. Even small cameo roles are drenched in a quirky realism. We feel like we know or have seen people like this. The locations all feel like places we've encountered before. All this adds up to make the film way scarier than it has the right to be. There aren't any major jump scares in the film, but due to its realism and attention to every day detail, the film becomes all the more terrifying, because it's a world we recognize and we know we could very well be the next victim.",The Silence of the Lambs

How wrong I was though and I was overwhelmingly surprised. It was the first film about a serial killer where it did not rely on strong elements of violence and gore but simply left it to the imagination. Obviously Hopkins and Foster get all the plaudits and rightly so but this is one of the only films that has so many superb minor characters such as Barney, Ardelia Mapp and Bill himself. I urge those who like this movie to watch the making of documentary as it is truly fascinating.

For a production to have you wanting to know more about each and every character, you know they've done something right.It's a shame that the sequels weren't nearly as good as this - they lost this Hannibal Lecter somewhere along the way and transformed him into a dull, intelligentsia type with no inner-animal, or one that's barely manifested in the confronting way that it is here; but, I digress.Watch this movie, and watch it in the dark.",The Silence of the Lambs

521,JerBear-2,At least it was better than the book.,2,30 May 1999,"Academy Awards are rarely the sign of a great movie. The children of the Academy members, who do the actual voting, have notoriously pedestrian tastes. This movie does add some dramatic scenes and character development to improve on a poorly written novel. This movie's big draws, it would appear, were cannibalism, masogeny, and over-acting. Really great acting is transparent. If you're marvelling at the fantastic acting during the movie, then what you're enjoying is watching someone ""ham it up"" on the screen, not fine acting. The important thing is that the villain didn't have sex with the women, he just murdered them and skinned them, thus avoiding an x rating. And the females that we were aware of that did have sex were properly tortured for their sins. What I really find offensive is that Hannibal the Cannibal is portrayed as a likable monster, even after cutting off the face of an innocent guard in order facilitate his escape. Hannibal's a winner and American's love a winner, regardless of the atrocities he commits in order to achieve his goals. This movie sends the message that if we are clever and have no moral limits as to what we are willing to do, we'll succeed -which Hannibal does!

At the same time I was giving my nervous system a workout, I was sitting there in awe of how well written the film was, how excellently defined and sketched all the characters were, how intellectually challenging the piece was, and how unbelievably good Jodie Foster and Anthony Hopkins performances were- thank God they both won Oscars. Frankly, I was disappointed to learn that there would be a sequel, as I think this film, and its story, stand so well on their own and need no elaboration. As excellent and terrifying as JAWS, only with people... which is somehow even scarier, once you really start to think about.

525,eeq,Excellent as high level psychological drama (but the book is better),9,12 June 1999,"All right you guys.  It's simply not appropriate to compare Silence of the Lambs with its 'prequel' Manhunter (Red Dragon). SOTL is a high level psychological drama targeted for the big audiences with top actors--with minimal procedurals. Manhunter is more of a procedural with attempts at psychology and targeted at a different (and smaller) audience with a virtually no-name cast.  Each does its job very well, but its really unfair to compare the 2.  After not getting to play Hannibal the cannibal in SOTL, I am glad to see Brian Cox getting other juicy (albeit smaller) roles, usually as the villain, in other action/suspense movies.  As far as the novels go, Red Dragon is better written, but SOTL has a superior (virtually perfect) ending.",The Silence of the Lambs
526,DrEbert,Taut film-making that results in a chilling and influential psychological thriller,9,28 December 2007,"The late Gene Siskel hated ""The Silence of the Lambs,"" thinking of it as being far too gruesome and distasteful and as having zero originality to it. Roger Ebert gave the 3.5 out of 4 stars, saying that he did enjoy the film but that some scenes were lacking, such as the ending.Siskel missed the point. The chill from ""The Silence of the Lambs"" doesn't come from revolutionary originality, which it doesn't have. The chill of ""The Silence of the Lambs"" is in how it maximizes fear and suspense in a plot that one could simply describe as ""police on the hunt for a serial killer."" It is here where ""The Silence of the Lambs"" set the bar; it takes a B-movie concept and raises it to the level of a taut A-level thriller.The plot has the FBI on the hunt for a serial killer known as ""Buffalo Bill"" (played by Ted Levine). Stuck, the lead investigator (played by Scott Glenn) wants to get the perspective of another serial killer, to try and see inside the psychotic mind. He recruits the young FBI trainee Clarice Starling (played by Jodie Foster) to talk to the brilliant and cannibalistic psychiatrist Dr. Hannibal Lecter (played by Anthony Hopkins). Lecter agrees to help Starling, but only if she will grant him the sadistic pleasure of allowing him to see inside her mind.Even though the plot is about Buffalo Bill, with Lecter only having 16 minutes on screen in a 2-hour movie, Lecter and Starling are way more interesting and end up being the driving force for the film. In many films, an excellent performance by the villain can steal the show away from the hero. (Tim Burton's ""Batman,"" featuring a brilliant performance by Jack Nicholson as The Joker, is a prime example of this.) In ""The Silence of the Lambs,"" we have strong performances by both of the lead actors. Hopkins' Lecter is clearly everybody's favorite character, but Foster's performance as Starling is powerful enough to not get eclipsed by Hopkins.Not getting eclipsed is something of a theme for this film. Our heroine is not trying to be heroic. Starling is strong and courageous and could kick anyone's butt, and yet she comes across as vulnerable. She is a woman in a man's world and everywhere she goes, there is a sense of being dominated. She is 5'3"" in a film where most other characters are over 6' tall. (The camera often skillfully has Starling occupying only the lower half of the frame; seeing so much space above her head makes her look shorter and more vulnerable.) Her black hair (which is different from Foster's natural light brown) makes her appear paler than she really is. Other characters are always hitting on her. She always whispers and is always giving a nervous smile. Even her slight Southern accent gives her a ""country girl"" appeal that helps the audience identify with her. Starling is an FBI agent-in-training and is clearly quite skilled at handling dangerous situations, but she still shares our vulnerabilities. As a result of this, her fears are our fears. This is the true skill of Jodie Foster's performance; she manages to play Starling as a woman of great strength and vulnerability at once.Credit should also go to the film-makers. One strong point is their choice to only be selectively gruesome. This is one key difference between ""The Silence of the Lambs"" and garden-variety serial killer movies. The latter often derive their scares by showing incredibly brutal images and portraying utterly disgusting scenarios. Fear is generated by the audience's own horrified reaction to what is being shown on screen. ""The Silence of the Lambs"" does not give in to that temptation though. It casually shows us several rather gruesome images to get us nervous, but then keeps some of the most disturbing stuff cleverly off-camera. Of course, this serves to only make them scarier; what could be so gruesome that not even this creepy film is willing to show it on camera? I do have criticisms. My main complaint is that Buffalo Bill is a lightweight who left me longing for the much more interesting and menacing Hannibal Lecter. Buffalo Bill is sick, twisted, and downright nauseating, but he also is a coward, who has to resort to trickery and gadgetry to make himself formidable. Lecter, on the other hand, has all the tools he needs right there in his brain. He is the smartest character in the film and he knows it and he loves it. He is so charismatic that he can enter the mind of anyone, no matter how hard they resist. This makes Lecter scary even when he is off-camera. Buffalo Bill is not really all that scary even when he's on camera; he's more just plain gross.The thrill of this movie is psychological. We don't feel thrilled because of cool action sequences or original plot ideas but rather because of the fear that we can relate to and the mind games that Lecter plays. Something of a void is left in scenes in the latter half of the film, where Lecter is absent. (Here, I agree with Ebert.) Nonetheless, Foster's performance makes up for that. Even in the final showdown with Buffalo Bill, the thrill is still there because we feel Starling's fear, even though the audience has not been particularly scared of Buffalo Bill up until now. (Here, I disagree with Ebert, who feels the showdown is lacking.) ""The Silence of the Lambs"" is thrilling and chilling. The main villain is a lightweight, but the secondary villain is among the most menacing and evil in cinema history. I think that after we walk away from this film, we somehow are left with the feeling that, at least for those 2 hours, Hannibal Lecter managed to get inside our own minds as well.",The Silence of the Lambs
527,magic_marker,Someone needs to rescue this film from the inexplicable bad opinions on this list,10,16 August 2002,"""The Silence of the Lambs"" is one of the best films of the 1990s. A police procedural that shapeshifts nightmarishly into gothic horror, it is one of the most intense, brutal and elegant thrillers of all time.
Those who claim the film is boring probably first saw it on video, where much of its impact is lost due to the tinny sound and the tiny screen. This film derives its power from the intricate use of sound effects and the masterful evocation of clausrophobia, which is best appreciated when the screen is 20 feet across and you are trapped in a theatre. The cinematography is both grittily realistic and otherworldly, not superising since the film was shot by ""The Sixth Sense""'s Tak Fujimoto. Jonathan Demme, a comic director, somehow manages to create the only Hitchcockian film that is truly worthy of the name. The wonderfully paced final act, in which we assume the SWAT team are on the way, but... is one of the greatest hoodwinks I have ever seen. Ted Tally's script is phenomenal, outclassing even the novel on which it is based. But ultimately, this film belongs to its actors. Not just Hopkins, who of course creates the greatest screen monster in history, or even to Foster, who delivers the performance of her career (and seems to have had a talent-ectomy shortly afterwards), but to Ted Lavine, for his courageous performance as a killer transvestite, and to the world weary Scott Glenn.",The Silence of the Lambs

The narrative moves swiftly to accommodate a rather uncomfortable storyline (there isn't a false note on either script or direction), the pace and characters give it an extra vigour (Anthony Hopkins's performance as Dr Lecter is chillingly mannered), and the movie treats psychopathology with a genuinely perversive delight.

The sound and editing all function in creating and maintaining the film's eerie atmosphere. Reviewing this film, how could one not mention Anthony Hopkins chilling and creepy performance as Dr. Hannibal Lecter. He portrays, without a doubt, one of the best psychotic characters in cinema history. He's so good that at one point, you may start to, dare I say, root for him? The chemistry between Hopkins and Jodie Foster's character is brilliant and the dialogue between them is masterfully crafted. Once you let Hannibal into your mind, you can never get him out.

I mean, you don't see any really brutal scenes. Basically, I really appreciate this. Nor is it up to shock effects and frightening scenes in any sensational way. I still hope it's possible to take away these features without taking away intensity... they didn't manage.I wanted to get scared when I watch the movie but I didn't. (Nearly) All the scenes are good, the story isn't too bad, but it all lacks the connection, the fluent, flawless line. Thus we don't get worthy intensity, worthy suspense, worthy fright. After all, the movie is Jodie Foster, a bunch of other actors and beautiful photography.I mention Jodie Foster because she carries the movie, if simply with her being Jodie Foster. I don't mention Anthony Hopkins because he is less a character and more the scenes he's in. The scenes are good and they are due to him.The scene at the airport is given a flair of importance by the appearance of Diane Baker, the way she appears - that's for instance what I mean by the movie belongs to the actors - the surroundings - belongs to photography and yes, I guess I connect this to art direction.It's a good movie.

535,MikeSmash,#1 Thriller of our Time!!!,9,27 January 2006,"There should be no questioning why Sir Anthony Hopkins & Jodie Foster won Oscars for their roles in Silence of the Lambs. Hopkins as Hannibal ""The Cannibal"" Lecter is terrifyingly superb portraying the fiendish & super-intellectual imprisoned psychiatrist. Hopkins speaks eerily, never blinks, & commands fear from all those near him. Foster as FBI trainee & former farm orphan Clarice Starling gives a very convincing naive, wide-eyed, & reluctantly courageous young woman faced with finding a sadistic ""Buffalo Bill"" serial killer & getting to know the infamous Dr. Lecter. Both actors make you believe in their characters & leave you further engrossed in the movie.SOTL is the story of a manhunt for a serial killer dubbed ""Buffalo Bill"" because he skins his ""humps"" or victims. FBI trainee Starling is summoned by Behavioral Science Dept. guru agent Jack Crawford to make a visit to Baltimore Psych. Hospital & talk to its most famous patient, Dr. Hanibal Lecter. Starling is briefed on the physical procedures used with Lecter by conceited & aloof hospital director Dr. Frederick Chilton, who Lecter despises. After a brief encounter with Lecter, Starling uses the doctor's clues to find a patient of his, also a victim of the serial killer. The decapitated head is that of Benjamin Raspell, who Lecter knows intimately. Lecter gives Starling clues to catching the killer as long as she provides him with very personal information about herself. Starling is warned about Lecter's devious ways but decides to cooperate with him to get more clues. After more victims & a U.S. senator's daughter kidnapped by Buffalo Bill, Starling is on a race against time to save her from certain doom. Starling goes to W. Virginia with Crawford to examine the body of one of Bill's latest victims. Starling discovers a object forced into the girl's throat which happens to be a moth, scientifically known as the Death's Head Moth. After Starling & two entomologists index and identify the pupa, she discovers the moth is a grisly calling card. Starling also finds the same moth pupa in the head of Benjamin Raspell, a former patient of Lecter & lover of Buffalo Bill. With Crawford leading the way & Lecter agreeing to guide her for favors, Starling follows the trail to Memphis, TN., where she meets the Cannibal on last time to pick his remarkable brain for clues. Lecter makes a deal with Memphis authorities & Senator Ruth Martin to assist in identifying Buffalo Bill in exchange for access to books, etc. & an annual trip to Plum Island for a short retreat under S.W.A.T. team surveillance. Starling speaks with Lecter shortly as she is escorted to a plane back home by Chilton & Memphis police. Lecter makes his move by ordering a 2nd meal consisting of extra rare lamb chops in Starling's honor. Lecter upchucks a small metal object behind a screen in order to free himself of handcuffs used by police to enter his make-shift cell. Of course, Lecter escapes confinement by trickery, kills the policemen guarding him, & makes his way out of trouble posing as a wounded cop.Starling stumbles upon a surprised Bill at his home who must either run from or kill the young trainee. Starling prevails by killing Bill, saving the Governor's daughter, & graduates from Quantico at the delight of Agent Crawford. Lecter, now on the loose & following his nemesis Dr. Chilton, licks his chops at the notion of ""having an old friend for dinner"". Lecter slyly walks the streets abroad to surprise Chilton with his usual ""calm sociopathic demeanor.""SOTL will scare you, surprise you, & make you remember Hannibal Lecter for days to come. If you like a thriller with ""bite"", this film will give you your fill in spades. Superb nail biter that will have you on the edge of your seat from start to finish.

It really agitates me because in fact this is almost the opposite of the truth.  ""THE SILENCE OF THE LAMBS"" is not a horror, but an intense drama - a thriller.  There is violence only when necessary or to accentuate a particular scene.  However, it is the manner in which the film is presented that intensifies the plot.  It is a mature drama.All scenes are grim and eerie; director Demme is to blame for all the bold, creepy images and camera work.  But still, ""SILENCE"" retains something more than just a creep-fest: the plot is as tight as a rope holding a two ton piano, and the dialogue is crisp and sophisticated.  Howard Shore's haunting score is equally as jarring.In short, this film rings truth and still manages to creep.  I wouldn't say ""scare,"" although I'm sure some would.

538,crendine,An Extremely Well Done Thriller,9,11 March 2015,"This movie has to be one of the most unique and gripping thrillers of all time. Anthony Hopkins' performance raised the bar as to how a villain can be portrayed as he turned in one the greatest performances of all time. His Dr Lecter extended way beyond convincing as he became this character and is considered by many to be the greatest movie villain of all time. It is very difficult for me to visualize any other actor in this role. Jodie Foster also turns in an outstanding performance as Agent Starling, an academy student seeking entry into the FBI. The storyline is very original and the supporting cast is simply amazing.

539,DemonKiki,Psychoanalysis,8,30 April 2020,"In the story, the heroine's feelings for Hannibal are very complicated. He has both his idealistic traits, such as professionalism, calmness, restraint, keen insight, and fear of him as a brutal attacker. Therefore, the heroine is more an idealized empathy for Hannibal than the Oedipus complex of Oedipus. Because the heroine does not lack father's love, in the critical period of psychological development (1-3, 3-6, 6-10), the father has always existed as a good object (betting on the object of feelings). Hannibal and his father are not the same kind of person. The heroine's internal courage, courage, and perseverance are all derived from the identification of his father. And Hannibal is more like that ideal self (of course, this refers to the positive side).The whole story of the play is driven by the traumatic needs of the heroine. Saving the daughter of the MP is the need to save the lost object. Working with Hannibal is the need for idealization. Killing the Buffalo Bill is the need to defeat the attacker. And these three people perfectly played the role of the heroine to fulfill these psychological needs. All in order to silence the lamb in Starling's heart.",The Silence of the Lambs

541,Dignan_Tenenbaum,Truly the greatest movie of all time.,9,26 June 2001,"Why is this the greatest movie ever, you might ask.  Well, for starters you can watch the movie several times over and get something different out of it each time.  Let me just clarify that by saying that I'm not a person who watches it over and over because 'Lecter is the greatest character ever and I idolize him.'  I like the movie because of the extreme detail we see in character development, the cinematography, and the tension that's built up. I can't sympathize with people who were shocked and horrified that Lecter would actually act the way he did in 'Hannibal.'  These people obviously never actually realized that he had been in that cell for a reason.Anyway, every character in this film (except maybe Dr. Chilton) is changed by the end of it.  And isn't that why we choose to show the sequence of events that unfold in a story?  Every character has a great arc that is logically followed and believable.  Clarice is a wonderful character, and you really understand how she could affect a psycho-path in the manner that she did.  Crawford is presented as an interesting foil to Lecter in that he is the other predominant male figure in Starling's life.  After the loss of her actual father, she seems to seek these father figures to help her through her life.  That is, until the end when she has grown enough to strike out on her own.As for getting more and more out of it with each viewing, to give you an example:  I recently revisited the film and the scene where Lecter is in the actual cage came up.  As Clarice is being dragged out, he hands her the case file and, in the process, brushes his finger against hers.  That particular shot of their hands has always given me the creeps.  But I finally realized that it was 'The Birth of Man.'  The ceiling of the Sistine Chapel (please forgive my ignorance if I'm misspelling anything) depicts God bestowing life on Adam by touching his finger in a similar manner.  By handing Clarice the case file, Lecter is helping to save Catherine Martin's life.  She has taught him to care (even if it is only sometimes).  Now, maybe this wasn't the intent for the shot at all.  Or maybe it was the intent and it's so obvious that I'm a big dope for not having noticed it before, but I find these sorts of things every time I watch this movie.  And that, to me, makes it wonderful.",The Silence of the Lambs

543,tylerkom,A great film with slight missteps,7,27 November 2020,"This is a film that has entered the pop culture consciousness on behalf of the supporting character Hannibal Lecter (Anthony Hopkins') chilling performance. And if there is really anything that makes this film noteworthy it is his legendary performance.Beyond his performance, there are other reasons to like what this film does. It's very well paced and the dialogue is well done. The characters are mostly logical and smart. The classic thriller trope of ""finding"" new evidence is done tastefully and the investigation that takes place in the film seems mostly believable. The characters are well written with nice depth for the lack of time spent on character development. And finally, the film wraps pretty well into a very nice package. Jodie Foster also does a solid job in the lead role.Unfortunately I must point out some small...missteps that happen throughout the film. This isn't a spoiler: Starling is a member of the FBI academy and not a fully fledged agent yet. I am led to believe that this relationship is more fleshed out in the novel, but as the film presents it, it's hard to say why she would be a prominent investigator on a high profile FBI investigation. Without spoiling the plot of the film, I will also say that she makes somewhat questionable decisions to the end of the film. Furthermore, her deductions, although fine on the surface, seem problematic in that they are quite elementary. It seems like whatever investigators were previously on the case should have checked out the things which Starling ends up investigating.

Foster's visit to Hannibal Lecter (a cannibal who lives in a maximum security prison), for example, takes us down endless flights of stairs, each level heralded by ominous dialogue, a prison warden even pausing to show Foster a photograph of Lecter's mutilated victims. But importantly, while characters in the film flinch in horror at the image on this photograph, the photograph itself is never actually revealed to Demme's audience. This happens throughout the film: horrors are talked about, emphasised, hyped, our appetite whetted at every turn, but never actually revealed. Here is a film which respects our imagination and treats the macabre with a certain amount of apprehension. Even the film's ending, in which an escaped Hannibal Lectre walks confidently off into the horizon, is the kind of dramatic tease-climax more common in super hero movies.

The direction is spot on, the acting across the board is first rate and Sir Anthony Hopkins truly brought Dr Lecter of Thomas Harris's book to life and in just sixteen minutes or so of film time created one of the most memorable and chilling figures in movie history. Jodie Foster was exceptional as Clarice Starling, vulnerable, incisive and courageous in turn; and Ted Levine gave one of the most remarkable performances ever seen on film as Jame Gumb. The film grips the viewer from the first moment and never lets go, with an atmosphere that is frightening, horrifying and suspenseful. It is one of those films that one wishes one could see again for the first time, but no matter how many times one sees it, never loses its power. Simply the best.",The Silence of the Lambs
556,ebtsamryad,Not impressed,3,6 August 2019,"It was nothing .. silence of the lambs is such an OVERRATED movie .. doesn't deserve 5 oscars nor the high rating of 8.6 .. When I saw the 8.6 I was like damn this must be good and it will shock me .. but it didn't .. I barely felt anything..The main character (Jodie foster character ) actually annoyed me , she was supposed to be high trained , best of the best , yet when she confronted the criminal , she freaks out and lose it ? , *she was supposed to be high trained*Dr.lecter wasn't scary at all .. I liked him in the first half of the movie .. u would imagine a cannibal who eats his victims ... u think oh he's gonna be a nightmare .. yet no he wasn't .. they portrayed him more like calm smart person ..
The characters was poorly written , we barley even expos and see how the background of each character and what it isThere was a lot of plot holes , for example, when dr lector used the pen .. okay we get it .. but how the hell he managed to take it in the first place ? .. the person who was in charge, kept telling people to be carful and warning them to give him a pen or anything, yet he's the one who was the most careless, and again , lector was tied up , couldn't even move , even when they will in tie him ofcurs they gonna clean his cell from everything, still don't understand how he got the pen .Second plot hole
If he's in high security jail .. how the hell would he manage to run away , how is it high secured when there's no cameras watching him 24/7 , it's confusing how some time they show you that they r super carful with how they treat him .. other minute no one is keeping an eye on him , even the cops , why the hell THE TWO of them needed to be in the cell while feeding him .. he's a dangerous criminal, how can the government put these kind of stupid cops to watch him ..
and when the doctor pushed the other uncuffed cop .. the other one who only has one hand cuffed .. didn't pull a gun and shoot the criminal !! Wtf is that ?Third plot hole :
Why did buffalo bill needed to Load his gun right in front of starling , he had so much time to do it before , why !!
I'll tell u , so starling could hear it and kill him so the story could end .. such a morons
Boring scenes and lots of other scenes that if u skipped them u wont even miss anything
For example, the scene where starling is running after bill
That was WAY TOO LONG
There were many things that were irrelevant to the main story , I wish the movie was all about the canibal dr lector",The Silence of the Lambs

What it is is a suspenseful, well acted thriller with a villain who is physically as well as verbally aggressive (kind of a rarity). It's also noteworthy for giving us a tough, but still vulnerable heroine (also a rarity). But I don't understand why people applaud his escape at the end; to me it's just as much of a cheat as so many horror movies where the killer is seen in the last frames. I also don't think Lecter is as scary as Scorpio in DIRTY HARRY or THE HITCHER's John Ryder.

It's very hard to shake out this movie once you have seen it. Each and every element is a visual feast for our senses.

Various guy communities and all were hurt by this as this idea has been frequently been adopted by Hollywood. Please don't think wrong about this when you watch the movie. Frankly, I never even thought of this. I always thought the killer to be crazy because Lecter himself described him to be: ""he thinks he is a transsexual. look for severe childhood disturbances"".

564,shafatqadri,Silence!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,8,21 March 2008,"At times it seems that there aren't words to describe ""The Silence of the Lambs"", it truly is an endurance trial of the mind. The film is dark and psychologically disturbing throughout while also dealing with issues of sexism and strength. Director Jonathan Demme's adaptation of Thomas Harris' best-selling novel swept across the globe in 1991, eventually winning five Academy Awards and becoming a prestigious topic of discussion among critics.Its moody influence crept across the popular 90s sub-genre of 'serial-thriller'. This lent The Silence of the Lambs a growing reputation for being an adult thriller of horror ike capabilities. The mythically monstrous and deliciously manipulative Hannibal Lecter became an immediate household name and now remains among the most popular fictitious villains in modern cinema. Such a figure could only be played by one man (has it become unimaginable to picture it any other way?) that man being Anthony Hopkins, who slipped himself into the role with matchless prestige, therefore giving birth to a cultural icon of both literature and cinema.The movie starts with Agent Clarice Starling (Jodie Foster) who is an FBI trainee, being called up from her classes to acquire information from a serial killer, Dr.Hannibal Lecter (Anthony Hopkins), about a current killer known as Buffalo Bill. Bill is a man who wishes to be a transsexual but has been turned down for sex reassignment because of his volatility. Starling acquires a sort of cordial relationship with Lecter, who wishes her to divulge personal information about herself in return for his assistance with the case. The film is tense throughout. Scott Glenn turns in a pretty good performance as a director of the FBI division that Starling is entering. Lecter is chilling as he gives Starling information about Buffalo Bill and the Senator's daughter who has been kidnapped by Bill. The film is extremely suspenseful, I felt like yelling at the screen to tell me what was going to happen next. The suspense is most definitely on account of the film's taking you through out the twists and turns of your own psyche.The acting is one of the most crucial aspects of the film. Since the film only revolves around a few characters a big cast of mixed stars in not necessary. Instead, the quality over quantity formula works exceptionally well. Anthony Hopkins got best actor award despite being confined to only seventeen minutes of screen time. He does his best in every scene and practically pours his heart as he makes such a realistic and haunting performance.However Hannibal would obviously be a complete waste without Jodie Foster giving an equally impressive performance. She has a nice south American accent with a good amount of innocence to her. She is desperate to find Bill but has a weird relationship with Hannibal along the way. Ted Levine is the last major character in this film and probably the whole reason why everything happens. He doesn't have much screen time but still manages to put on a creepy and believable performance. He is somewhat humorous but still manages to remain sinister.The Silence of the lambs works for a lot of factors. The cast plays a big part and so is the mood, setting, and cinematography. The movie is very dark most of the time and the cinematography complements this perfectly. The detail to the scenes works well as the setting is creepy and suspenseful. Hannibal's jail cells are nicely designed and contain a lot of aspects that show his character nicely. The movie keeps an excellent balance of suspense and drama. It is suspenseful throughout but has a nice dramatic element that is lacking in many films today. The climax is pulse pounding and the film has excellent closure that has it come full circle.Even the DVD cover scares me. I would NOT recommend this for children obviously!!!!",The Silence of the Lambs

If a director can make a good thriller that actually goes into the psychosis of a person, then it will usually hook me. Vertigo and The Game are two examples of these kinds of films. These films, however, could be considered slow by the new age of movie goers. Silence of the Lambs really takes over where Vertigo finishes. They are two very similar movie (yes, I said similar). You have a man who has gone insane, with a mysterious past and nothing left to lose. This man manipulates a woman into relaying many of her secrets, and ultimately allowing him so far into her mind that he starts to change her. The relationship between Hannibal Lector and Clarice is very similar to the relationship between Vertigo's two protagonist( to me anyway). The one big difference between the two is the violent nature of the plot, and the speed at which Lamb's is delivered. This is not necessarily a bad thing for either movie. Lamb just takes a more 90s spin on a classic genre and idea. It is, in my mind, the best fusion of horror and psychological thrillers that has been made so far.

Now I understand why this movie is so much famous and loved. It deserves to be called a masterpiece of thriller. I guess it will be fun to catch some homage for The Silence of the Lambs in later films. Anthony Hopkins was just Dr. Lecter himself. His existence was very irresistible. Buffalo Bill was also great, but it is well described in the film that he is just a cocoon compared to the moth, Dr. Lecter. The actors play their characters wonderfully.

But it didn't. It wasn't involving, it wasn't chilling or scary or compelling in any way.

Dr. Hannibal Lecter, the second greatest movie villain of all time next to Lord Darth Vader, was so convincing that he more than deserved the Academy Award.  I am glad that he will reprise the role again. Jodie Foster was so good in her role of Clarice Starling that I am glad that she won the Academy Award.  She should come back for a sequel. More praise should go to Ted Levine.  With the exception of the nude shot, he was incredible as Jame Gumb, a.k.a. Buffalo Bill. I think it was interesting how he kept refering to Catherine Martin as `IT' instead of `SHE' OR `HER'.  Very convincing.  As I said before, a sequel is WAY overdue.

Rare is the movie that gets everything right, but ""The Silence of the Lambs"" comes awfully close to providing the perfect example for a modern thriller. It's so disturbing to watch for some people that it's often described as a horror movie, which says more about other films involving serial killing, in my opinion, than it does about this one. We're not used to crime thrillers that actually show killing and its aftermath in gruesome, clinical detail-- ""The Silence of the Lambs"" does. We're not used to films showing us psychopaths of unnerving ferocity-- ""The Silence of the Lambs"" does. Most importantly, we're not used to seeing this kind of story presented in such a matter-of-fact way-- ""The Silence of Lambs"" is never showy in its camera work or its performances.

It was so intense, but executed masterfully, with Jonathan Demme not overdoing it at all. Sir Anthony Hopkins is, without a doubt, a standout performer. Doctor Hannibal Lecter is burned into my memory, and the shock of hearing his voice in the final scene is done perfectly. In 16 minutes, he managed to chill me, with his mechanical voice and those electric blue eyes. Jodie Foster also is brilliant, particularly in the monologue about the screaming lambs, conjuring up images with no unnecessary flashbacks in one of the most well directed and acted scenes in cinematic history. However, the best performance, for me, was Ted Levine as Buffalo Bill. I was revolted by him, with his creepy voice, his psychopathic tendencies, and the moment of humanity as we hear him scream ""YOU DON'T KNOW PAIN"". The music composer deserves praise as well, for delivering a bone chilling score, and it's subtle changes, especially in the final scene from triumphant to eerie are brilliantly executed.

While the story is terrifying and grizzly, Demme never lets it become schlocky or sensational. He plays is straight, so to speak, never letting the plot become secondary. Perhaps a more... ambitious, director would have added more creepy atmosphere (like David Fincher does with ""Se7en""), but Demme smartly keeps it real, which makes it all the more terrifying. Nothing that happens in this movie couldn't happen in real life (and it does happen). This approach also harnesses the lead performers. He never lets Foster get too melodramatic, and never lets Hopkins become a flat Halloween mask. As frightening as the film is, there is a moral core throughout that neither hides completely nor brow-beats you.

He manages to be menacing yet charming at the same time, which is often a quality of our most infamous serial killers.  Jonathan Demme did an excellent job directing this move, and rightfully received an Oscar reward for best director.  He kept everything going at just the right pace and allowed enough time for character study to flavor the film further.  ""Silence of the Lambs"" is loaded with memorable scenes; my favorite one is where Jodie Foster has to feel her way around the dark while the killer (wearing night-vision goggles) just toys with her for a while.

594,mjg32,Hello Clarice....,10,28 February 2007,"A very interesting storyline, a determined rookie agent and the most chilling character ever depicted on film make The Silence of the Lambs an all-time classic. Not many films have won the top 5 Oscars and this certainly deserves to be one of them. The camera-work in this film is brilliant, showing you the action through the eyes of Clarice Starling with all other characters speaking into the camera, getting you involved with the film, and you can almost feel the fear of Clarice's assignment. Anthony Hopkins' performance as Hannibal Lector is something else. There are very few evil characters that you find yourself rooting for, and even despite knowing that he is a sicko mass murderer, you want him to escape from the prison. He is one of the best characters ever, certainly the creepiest! The Silence of the Lambs is one of the most thrilling films of all time, and the twist at the very end is the icing on the cake. 10 out of 10 - easy!",The Silence of the Lambs
595,mshackletonchavez,Unforgettable.,8,1 December 2018,"What a movie. Stark, cold and yet rich in character, development and suspense. Truly an achievement in all aspects.Most notably I must praise the decorous performances from all actors. Anthony Hopkins as Dr. Hannibal Lecter is truly a performance for the ages, something to be remembered for its sheerly raw portrayal of such a twisted, crude, manipulative and frankly evil character. It could have very easily fallen into cliche and been corny and uninteresting, but due to Anthony Hopkins caliber as an actor and Jonathan Demme's masterful directing, it is truly a performance to which all others in its field must be compared for the decades to come. The audience feels the shrill and cruelty oozing from his every word, it is an archetypal career defining performance.Jodie Foster was absolutely spectacular as Clarice Starling, once again. this is a career defining performance. It plays on par with Anthony Hopkins, as they spar between the glass, going to and fro between emotion, disgust, curiosity and fear. For they both feel these emotions to one another, and it gives the audience a true experience, unseen in many films. She plays the hard Agent Starling to near perfection, displaying her wonder and fear of the case, and her young naiveness but displaying that it is suppressed. A highly multi-layered character that very few actresses could perform with such gravitas and capability.The rest of the cast must be commended, for they all deliver in their respective strengths. Most notably Scott Glenn as Jack Crawford and the other prison inmates. As well as Ted Levine as Buffalo Bill, playing the confused, conflicted and disgusting character whose emotions and frustrations for not being let a sex change led him to take 'revenge' on women. I believe that Ted Levine delivers this moral inner conflict extremely well, most notably when he is silent, in particular the dancing scene where it is only him and a woman's scalp upon his head. Truly disgusting but absolutely masterful acting and film making.The directing by Jonathan Demme very much shines through into the final product. Although I have not seen his other features, his style is highly distinctive as is shown within the film. When put in tandem with the cinematography, the extreme closeups on faces and the lack of many wide shots makes the feature feel constricted, like a lack of breathing space. This works to its advantage, as it adds to the fear, bemusement and harrowing nature of the subject matter. Then when it does pan into larger atmospheres, it indicates that turmoil is to come. Such as how the holding facility in Tennessee for hannibal Lecter is an open room, then it devolves into calculated chaos.This clever use of cinematography works as great strength to the film, further aided by Howard Shore's distressing score. It truly compliments the film and does not dictate emotion, it heightens them. As it works with the film and not for it, this makes it stand out within the Horror/Thriller genre.The more technical aspects, such as the sound design all are eerie to further heighten the distressing suspense and are great additions to the feature. The costumes are all well designed and help to compliment the character traits, most notably with Ted Levine and Clarice Starling they help to indicate their characterisation and emotional story, particularly where they start in the beginning of the film as characters.Although I greatly enjoyed this feature, it has some weaker aspects. Hannibal Lecter disappears for a good portion of the film, and as he of such note in his long disappearance it actually somewhat detracts from the film. However when he reappears it is a exceedingly good moment. The film portrays the violence extremely gruesomely, which I understand it part of the narrative and genre but does not match up with my taste exactly, but I understand why it is as prevalent as it is and I cant criticise it as filmmaking since this simply a personal view of mine.I felt as if some characters were only servants to further Starlings characterisation, although the scenes in which this takes place are effective, those other characters feel a little wasted, such as Anthony Heald as Frederick Chilton, although his characters final fate is highly effective, but also Jack Crawford felt a little too bland as a character and not developed as strongly as could have been, but this doesn't detract from the film much as his characterisation is present but not as strong as it had the potential to be.On the whole I very much liked this film, the acting, directing, score, sound and screenplay are all great strengths to make such as stark and memorable film. I would definitely recommend this film and give it a truly good and firm 8/10",The Silence of the Lambs

599,Science_Fantasy_Guy,Take notes,10,12 August 2005,"Every once in a while, a film is released which revives its dead genre. In the early '90s, for the horror/thriller genre, The Silence of the Lambs was that film. After a tribe of awful horror flicks (e.g. 1988's Child's Play) with recycled story lines like serial killers hunting dumb teens, The Silence of the Lambs took the serial killer movie to a new level.The Silence of the Lambs swept the 1991 Academy Awards, becoming only the third film in history - after 1934's It Happened One Night and 1975's One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest - to win all five major categories (Best Picture, Director, Actor, Actress and Screenplay), and the first horror movie to win Best Picture. This is a tremendous achievement when it was released more than 12 months before, considering the Academy's notoriously short attention span. Each award was well deserved, with Best Director Jonathan Demme both marvellously pulling off the most gripping scenes and never losing sight of the human element of the picture, Best Actor Anthony Hopkins and Best Actress Jodie Foster both delivering unforgettable performances as the dangerously intelligent cannibal serial killer Dr. Hannibal Lecter and the less-than-perfect but strong willed rookie FBI Agent Clarice Starling, and Ted Tally's Best Adapted Screenplay both delivering snappy, quotable dialogue (""Oh, and Senator, one more thing: LOVE your suit!"") and perfectly tapping into the mind of a serial killer.This is the horror film that they all want to be, but almost all of them won't. I've only ever seen one other that is in quite the same league as this, and that is The Sixth Sense (M. Night Shyamalan must have watched TSOTL about 12 times while making that film). This groundbreaking masterpiece of horror is the standard by which all other horror movies are measured, and it is indeed the film that for which Hopkins, Foster and Demme will all be remembered. 10/10.",The Silence of the Lambs

I remember she had to explain some of the scenes to me as I was only 12 and maybe a little young to watch it (but our parents always let us watch movies that as an adult looking back now, am shocked they did). Love the ""feel"" of this movie - dark, dingy and cold. Anthony Hopkins is amazing. Very chilling, but you can't help but like him. Watching this as an adult still gives me the creeps. Its a way better alternative at this time of year than a horror movie. The sequels are OK-only worth watching because of Hopkins. But this is a classic.",The Silence of the Lambs
601,JackRice100,Great Suspenseful Thriller!,9,1 November 2014,"Silence of the Lambs is about Clarice Starling (Jodie Foster) a trainee FBI agent assigned to get help from notorious psychopath Dr. Hannibal Lecter (Anthony Hopkins) who use to be a respected psychiatrist to help locate and find another killer Buffalo Bill who cuts his victims skin off. The only catch is she has to give Lecter personal information before he revels anything. After prominent senator's daughter is kidnapped its a race agents time to try and save her but will Hecter keep playing games? Silence of the Lambs is a really good movie they make you care about Clarice Starling and know about her personal life in a really cleaver more realistic way and not her just blurting it out when necessary like you see in other films. Anthony Hopkins gives a performance so chilling and powerful, you want to know what he dose next every time he's on screen, doing this in a very calm and polite manner (most of the time) makes it even more suspenseful. The other serial killer in the movie, Buffalo Bill was just as gripping to watch, a man who kills and skins young women was truly scary. One of the best most suspenseful scenes iv ever seen, was near the end, a scene in which they find Buffalo Bill which was for me the most scariest scene in the whole move and props for the rest of the film for building up to the that bit so well! Just as i thought it could all be all sunshine and rainbows Clarice gets a call from none other than Hecter who ends the call on a line that just makes you wanna watch more.

602,nathanielqwilson,Everything with Hopkins is great but otherwise...,5,25 August 2018,"Everyone remembers Anthony Hopkins' delicious take on an epicurean monster and they should since its good enough to hold the whole the movie, near enough...But asides from these startlingly well written little monologues it's remarkable what a bland movie this otherwise is. I have an issue with any narrative that at its centre just follows law enforcement tracking down a killer. It leaves very little room for any meaningful development of either the plot or the characters, no matter what the details of the case, it always treads a familiar path. A big part of a story for me is what motivates the main character but with these kinds of things the answer is ""it's their job"" and Jodie Foster laying on the Saccharine about a bunch of farm animals only strikes me as a contrived way to humanize a basic, taciturn character type.The movie is obsessed with suggesting there is some type of spiritual connection between Hannibal and Clarice, but it is entirely an informed attribute.
The whole murder at its centre just feels like an arbitrary McGuffin as an excuse to get Anthony Hopkins out, so I guess I can't blame it.",The Silence of the Lambs

604,Beauq81,"A bit lacking, don't know what the fuss is about",7,24 January 2011,"When this movie came out, I was just a kid, so it wasn't till years later that I saw it. I liked it, but didn't understand what the fuss was about. I found it quite lacking in many aspects, especially Jodie Foster's acting, which reminds me of a bad soap opera. I, simply, found that the movie was missing a lot of things.Then, a few years later, I read the book and saw just how much the movie missed, mostly in character portrayal. The only person who, actually, did the role right, was Scott Glenn, but it was never explained why he was always so sad and melancholic (his wife's illness and death).Ted Levine was also pretty good, I liked the way he played a psycho, especially since I've seen some of his more uptight and comic roles, eg., in Monk.As far as Hopkins goes, I think that Lecter suited him better in Hannibal and Red dragon. It seemed that he was so relaxed in the role. In this movie, not so much, but I don't think it was really his fault, being a truly great actor. Like I said, the overall character portrayal was bad.I, actually, don't like Jodie Foster that much, and her whiny Clarice is not much different from, say, Nell.Demme did capture the gruesome atmosphere really well and I have to give him that.Even though it is a good movie, it is not a great one and I certainly hope someone decides to do the book a little more justice some day.",The Silence of the Lambs

After several victims have come up, but no luck in catching Buffalo Bill, the FBI sends Clarice Starling (Jodie Foster) to interview a demented, yet brilliant prisoner named Dr. Hannibal Lecter (Anthony Hopkins). Hannibal used to be a very respected psychiatrist, and FBI agent Jack Crawford (Scott Glenn) believes that this genius prisoner can help them into locating Buffalo Bill. But before Starling can get any information out of Hannibal, she must gain his trust, and then the hunt will begin.The story to The Silence of the Lambs was brilliant in every way possible. When I first started watching this it seemed as if it was just going to be your typical mystery film, But in no way was this movie typical. It is packed with surprises, plenty of suspense, and some of the most unforgettable characters that you will rarely see in movies such as these.Anthony Hopkins gives one of the best performances I have seen, and it is easily his career performance. As soon as this movie was over I instantly became a huge fan of him, and since then I have always enjoyed his movies, whether I thought it was a good film or not. However, I think because of the unbelievable acting on the part of Anthony Hopkins, people often overlook Jodie Foster in this film. Even though her performance might not have been quite as jaw dropping as Anthony Hopkins, it was still in my opinion the best of her career, and for an actress like her that is saying quite a lot.Overall, The Silence of the Lambs is probably in my top 20 best films of all time. It absolutely blew my mind. If you have not seen this movie, then I recommend watching it as soon as possible, because I can assure you that if you are a movie fan you will like it.",The Silence of the Lambs

Anthony Hopkins appears in his first and most effective performance as Dr.Hannibal Lecter aka Hannibal The Cannibal . And Jodie Foster plays Clarice Starling the FBI agent in training who hopes to catch a serial killer nicknamed Buffalo Bill with the help of Lecter . Both Hopkins and Foster are great and they truly deserved the Best actor/actress oscars . The rest of the cast is also very good.Director Jonathan Demme puts his money on suspense rather than blood and guts and yet he shows violence in a brutal way when it is called for which is certainly a very good move .

I always have loved Anthony Hopkins, but also Jodie Foster as well. Put the two of them together and you have a surprise that shouldn't work, but does. They are as different as night and day. I honestly believe that's why I prefer this movie to the sequel. For me, not having her in it just took away 80% of its attitude.I'd recommend this movie even 13 years later to any lover of suspense and even though the subject matter deals with many things that are less than appetizing or pleasant, maybe that's what appeals to me about it. It's not scared to make you believe these things happen. There really are people out there like Hannibal. He does think that way, and he is that horrid and beautifully sinister. It's like looking closely at a black widow spider. The beauty of its nature is so perverse that you almost hate to stop it, but you know that you must.I have never seen a movie before that made me feel like this one did, and I'm not easily scared by movies.

It's no wonder it destroyed at the 64th Academy Awards (Ted Levine should of won, and he wasn't even nominated fyi). The film is truly disturbing and will stay with you for quite some time. No, there aren't any jump-scares or ghosts, but this film shows that the ones that you truly have to fear are the living. While the film is fictional, it is inspired by true events, and Buffalo Bill was created under the model of real serial killers (so the events depicted aren't too far from things that have actually happened). This information alone should send shivers down your spine. The film is beautifully shot, directed, and acted. The dialogue is also incredible. One of the few films that truly deserve an 10/10 rating. If you have not seen ""The Silence of the Lambs"", you are truly doing yourself a disservice.

613,Kevbo1985,Are The Lambs Still Crying?,9,17 May 2012,"This is one of those films that sticks with you. The psychological horror of Anthony Hopkin's Hannibal Lecter is like a thick fog that remains in your head, sticking to the corners of your subconscious in a way too few villains have ever managed. It's one of those career-defining roles that, having seen someone so naturally take it on, you cannot imagine anyone else stepping into. Having read Thomas Harris' fantastic novel beforehand, this was one of the biggest selling points to me. As anyone who has read the book(s) can tell you, Hannibal Lecter is an extremely deep and complicated character that demanded an actor capable of both sophisticated mannerisms and a terrible underlying nature of pure evil. The moment Jodie Foster's Clarice Starling meets Hopkins' Lecter, you can see it all in the intense gleam of his eyes.As a best picture winner, this film was righteously recognized for it's strong merits of precise storytelling, incredible lead acting from Hopkins and Foster and a strong supporting cast, and most of all for truly engaging the viewer in it's atmosphere of horror. The little touches round out the fantastic experience, from Lecter's disturbing facial appliance to Clarice's slow unveiling of her troubled past and Lecter's bizarre way of showing his empathy and affection, all the way to Ted Levine's superb portray of the psychologically disturbed Buffalo Bill.A movie that still gets under your skin all these years later, it's a crime if you haven't seen it.

616,slayerholmes,One of the most overrated movies ever,5,8 August 2006,"First problem: this could have been quite shocking and groundbreaking movie in the 1970's, not after the decade of splatter, gore, mad slashers and all kinds of overwhelming violence, the 80's. And of course especially not after the first film-version of the Thomas Harris' book ""Red Dragon"", aka ""Manhunter"" by Michael Mann, which intensity and credibility is in a whole different level. So there was nothing exceptional happening on the screen to me when I saw this even back in 1991, being of course much more dated now. Sure, the majority of moviegoers bought this whole, at least partly due to being the one serial killer- horror-movie that also women could understand and relate to through the main character.Second problem: I've had this little rule of my own how one can quickly define a director's talent while watching a film. I'll do it by close-ups, especially of the faces. The more close-ups the worse as they lose their effect. Martin Scorsese, Roman Polanski, Steven Spielberg, Sam Peckinpah, Stanley Kubrick... they all use them only temporarily, on the right occasion as they should be. Then there are these guys who cherish those facial close-ups in almost EVERY scene like Tony Scott or Renny Harlin, which is, annoyingly, Demme's way of depicting major confrontations in ""The Lambs"" too. When Hopkins' or Foster's face fill the screen, either delivering or receiving, there's nothing frightening or emotional to me. It's manipulative and ridiculous, destined to be followed by all kinds of mockery spoofs and rightly so. It's soap opera. In the last resort, and to make the problem worse, the interplay between characters just isn't that intelligent and challenging as everybody and his sister seems to think.Third problem: Anthony Hopkins and Jodie Foster are widely regarded as one of the best actors in (movie) history. I don't agree. While they're no hams either I still find them to be on top only in the category of ""mannerism"". Which is a little odd because judging by many many interviews I've seen over the years they are clearly quite intelligent persons. Particularly in this movie, they're are SO self-conscious in every scene. They are not talking to each other, they are talking to that scary middle-aged lady in the aisles. And what really is so special in Jodie Foster's performance? She behaves all the time perfectly normally and logically (why in the first place someone even WANTS to see a 'vulnerable' woman as an FBI-agent is beyond me), so how come Lecter-Hopkins has that unusual interest in her? And being a true female police, she almost screws up busting that serial-killer by making wrong decisions in every turn in the climax... Many actions are too unbelievable compared to reaching for realism in many other levels.I don't mind that much about this movie's success in the box office and not even it's undeserved but ongoing status as sort of phenomenon, but those five main Academy Awards for only the third time in Hollywood history was incomprehensible. Even just considering ""serial killer""-depictions, this is somewhere 6th or 7th best in its genre on my list. But so that leaving you all ""Lambs""-lovers with more positive feelings I have to admit there is one good, clever and truly exciting scene after all: Lecter's escape. Glimmers among the rest of the garbage like a shiny kitchen knife....",The Silence of the Lambs
617,mlee-reclaw,One of the most over rated movies of all time...,5,17 February 2021,Both Hopkins and Foster over acted so much that it was difficult to take them seriously.

618,livstrongeva,The collision between first impression and true identity in Silence of the Lambs,8,24 August 2013,"Finally the time came and I decided to watch all of the Hannibal movies (because after the end of Hannibal's season 1 I was left with a void that only Hannibal Lecter could fill up). So I started with the famous Silence of the Lamb.If you are familiar with this movie, you probably know the plot: FBI agent Clarise Starling plaeyd by Jodie Foster needs the help of an incarcerated prisoner Hannibal Lecter played by Anthony Hopkins to catch a serial killer on the loose.So what was most interesting for me is that people aren't what they seem from the first impression. Yes, we see Clarise training but that is because she is the character with whom we are growing together, the main character. She is running through the forest what might be a metaphor that she is trying to defeat evil as forest always was a gloomy and scary place where monsters were hiding. But that is not how she is viewed by others. There are various scenes where she is the only woman in male company and everybody is looking at her as if she is not capable of anything, but she proves them wrong.On the other hand we see Hannibal as a calm person standing in his cell. You could not tell that this person is a heartless murderer who eats his victims. But that's what everybody knows about him. And that is why he is in the cell. Later we see his change when he attacks the guards, but I think more important is his entrance scene. It is just radiating with innocence, but you still have this feeling that something is wrong. Maybe it's not the cell, but most probably it's how he looks, how he smiles. But that you notice just a bit later.So that's what I saw in this movie – the difference between first impression and true people's nature. It's a bit scary how wrong can we sometimes be. Maybe next time we will regard the innocent looking person with more care.",The Silence of the Lambs

From the acting to editing, from the score to the cinematography, there isn't an aspect of the movie that I'd change, nor is there an aspect that does not stay with me for hours and days after I watch the film.Hopkins puts on a clinic. The brilliance of his performance is his ability to captivate the viewer and Agent Starling with his gifts of psychological study and underlying aristocratic being while also delving ever so suddenly into moments of sheer lunacy. He lets the animal out of the cage so flawlessly and so momentarily that its just amazing to realize that its all an act.Then there are the minute details, and side characters. I love Demme's underlying 'woman in a man's world' theme that he never overtly introduces. Instead, he just puts Foster in these great scenes, the best of which is just before she examines the body found in W. Virginia, where she is left in a room with a dozen W. Virginia state cops. Classic. Then there are the characters, like the moth experts or the latest victim's distraught father who lets Foster into his home to examine the victim's bedroom or the cops who try to catch Hannibal when he escapes in Memphis. All are peripheral characters, but they all resonate, they all somehow fit perfectly. I cant explain it, but nothing takes away, everything just adds to this movie, and it truly will be one of my favorites for as long as I live.",The Silence of the Lambs
623,colebt33-780-179547,A hybrid of genre's that can only be described as perfection,10,13 July 2010,"The1992 Academy Awards was a very specific year in the acknowledgment of great film-making, and all because of one movie, one movie that accomplished something that very few other movies have. Sweeping all five of the major Oscar awards including Best Picture, Best Director, Best Actor, Best Actress and Best Screenplay, Jonathan Demme's ""The Silence of the Lambs"" is a thriller, a horror, a psychological study into the mind of the serial killer, and a very powerful example of what film can turn out to be when actors, writers and directors are all at the top of their game.Clarice Sterling (Jodie Foster) is a young FBI trainee who is pulled out of training and assigned the case of finding a serial killer named Buffalo Bill. She is sent to the mental institute to gain insight on the character by interviewing another serial killer, the notorious Hannibal Lecter, or ""Hannibal the Cannibal"", played by the great Anthony Hopkins. While Hopkin's gave one of the most chilling and disturbing portrayals I have ever seen, it's Foster's performance that keeps this movie rolling. Clarice has a troubled past, full of fear and repressed memory. Hannibal is the monster she is trying to learn from, but he is not going to give her anything without something in return, in this case, access to her deepest, darkest secrets. The relationship between these two figures is tauntingly fascinating. There's a certain poetry involved here and it's so provoking to watch. Some may call this chemistry, but I think it's just two talented actors with and an equally talented director playing their part, and doing one hell of a job.Despite my gratitude for both actor's performances, if I had to choose which one I'd call my favourite, it would have to be Jodie Foster as Clarice Sterling. I fell in love with Foster after I saw this movie. Every time I think of her now I think of those old-fashioned clothes and burgundy shoes. I think of her amazingly delicate portrayal of a woman haunted by her past yet still trying to save the life of a teenage girl. Which reminds me, one thing that was really nice to see was that it wasn't a man trying to save the day for once, it was a woman. Almost every other Ameircan movie I've seen it's always been a man saving the damsel in distress. There was never a time where a woman got to have the acknowledgment or the parade, and I think Johnathen Demme picked up on this fact and expressed it as another theme to the movie. Close to the start of the film when Clarice was on her way to the office for her assignment, she walked into this elevator and she was surrounded by huge blokes, it made her like the smallest thing ever. It was quite funny, and I think it really said something. Clarice was a woman working in a man's world, guys would often chuckle or question at her presence, and occasionally even sexually harass her in mild ways. Witnessing all this it makes you think that there's something to prove here and that it was going to be interesting to find out how it would manifest into a final ending. Jonathan Demme is probably never going to be able to do something like this ever again. It's possibly my most favourite film ever, but if not it's certainly in my top 3. It's perfectly acted, perfectly written, and perfectly directed. This is a top-notch movie that for me scores a perfect 10 / 10, no doubts, no regrets, AWESOME!",The Silence of the Lambs

625,LuckyGraveyardBoots,a compelling portrait of human evil,10,9 May 2006,"Wow. Just wow. The most deeply frightening movie I have ever seen. The plot revolves around Clarice Starling, an FBI trainee, who, to track down serial killer ""Buffalo Bill"" (who kidnaps and skins women) must talk to another captured killer and psychopath, Hannibal ""the Cannibal"" Lecter. Her relationship with Hannibal evolves into something slightly sado-masochistic, and becomes a twisted version of the father-daughter dynamic - Clarice has issues with her father, and with guilt. Deep consideration of what constitutes ""higher"" and ""lower"" forms of being in a human, what exactly is psychopathic and what exactly is evil, and all forms of destructive being are taken into account, symbolized by the death's-head moth. The character Hannibal is extremely intriguing and multi-dimensional, especially compared with Buffalo Bill...while the latter knows that what he's doing can get him in trouble, he still doesn't perceive himself as psychopathic, but Hannibal does. He continues to do what he's doing when possible, to acknowledge it, to even use it to his advantage with the weapon of fear, and all the while functioning on a higher, very intellectual and thoughtful level. His morbid curiosity in Clarice's past runs parallel to the desire to consume another human being.

It's not without flaws, but it certainly offers some of those most riveting examples of mainstream filmmaking.The plot: lt. Jack Crawford sends one of his top academy students, Clarice Sterling (played with unwavering focus by Jodie Foster), unbeknownst to her, as a covert, but feeble and desperate attempt to extract information about a serial killer on the loose from genius psychiatrist Hannibal Lector (Anthony Hopkins, who, I imagine, will never be able to usurp this performance) who is incarcerated in an asylum for the criminally insane.  She exchanges information about the killer for biographical details about herself. Through F.B.I. missteps, Lector manipulates the situation towards freedom while guiding Sterling to the killer and recognition for her efforts. All the while, there is the subplot involving the killer and his current victim from her initial kidnapping towards the end of her captivity.  The killer feels he is a transsexual failed by society and modern medicine, who takes his aggression out by selecting over-weight females, kidnapping and starving them, before killing them and removing their skins.The film takes itself mostly seriously with a slightly off-beat tone one could expect from director Jonathan Demme.  However, it's the ending, while fun and clever, that throws into question the film's integrity.  Did we just witness the emotional journey of a young woman's plight to deal with her childhood ghosts while trying to save another young woman from dying or are we rooting for a truly psychotic man too intelligent and bored with this world while our tongues are pressed firmly in our cheeks?  The film is mostly representational of the novel, which has an easier time alluding these questions with its pulpish nature.Whatever the case, the interaction between Foster and Hopkins are chilling and mesmerizing.  The scenes with Ted Levine as James Gumb are mostly gruesome and disturbing, but hardly worth protesting for negative gay stereotyping. (I feel the same sentiment towards Basic Instinct was unfounded; however, it probably did help them both at the box office, I imagine)  For a film where you know who the serial killer is from the beginning, it's engaging and suspenseful none-the-less.  And Clarice Sterling offers its audience a modern heroine which they embraced, which isn't that frequent, if you think about it.  She's just finds herself in the confines of a film whose intentions are somewhat dubious.The success of `Lambs' ignited an inferno with the serial killer genre wh ich became hugely popular with inferior-quality, even more dishonest films like `Se7en' and `Fallen.'

Later, there was the printing press and books such as Dracula or Frankenstein appeared. But since the 20th century, humans have found another way to portrait our darkest corners inside our minds.A reason for this nature is simple. We like to read or watch people in scary situations, but still knowing that we, as audience are kept safe from the evils portrayed.If we are to name one character that on the late years has managed to gain a position on popular culture, it has to be Anthony Hopkins' Academy Award winning portrayal of Hannibal ""The Cannibal"" Lecter.Along with its counterpart, FBI trainee agent, Clarice Starling, played by Jodie Foster, these two characters are placed as #1 villain and #5 hero of all time by the American Film Institution. Also to add, that this movie is one of the only three movies to have won the five major Academy Awards for Best Actor in Leading Role, Best Actress in Leading Role, Best Director, Best Adapted Screenplay and Best Picture.The movie is directed by Jonathan Demme and is based on the novel of the same name by Thomas Harrison. It deals mainly on this two characters, and how the young agent interacts, relates and tries to understand the once psychiatrist and now psychopath, in order to find and capture another psychopath by the nickname of ""Buffalo Bill"".Previously to their encounters, Starling's superiors warn her to beware of the subject and not to reveal any personal information about her, information which she needs to share in order to get clues about the whereabouts and identity of Buffalo Bill. The movie proved to be a success and has given several sequels and prequels in order to explode the license. To me, the movie's success and position on almost any list of the best movies, is due not only to the great performances, but its also achieved by its directing. Jonathan Demme has created a style of his own, this can be observed on the changes from third person to first person and back again, and the many first shots of faces that reveal to us the reactions of the characters.This is a movie I would like to recommend to anyone interest in cinema, though it has some scenes not proper to the young audience.",The Silence of the Lambs

657,Cinema_freak,"A good piece of cinema, but seemingly overrated beyond oblivion.",7,26 December 2017,"I find ""Silence of the Lambs"" to be one of those movies that is hailed by one and all, and yet is underwhelming once watched - definitely good, but still underwhelming. You wonder what the hullabaloo was all about.The settings were cartoonishly murky and dungeon-like, to the point that Lecter's asylum (and at points even Clarice's FBI training centre) looked like Hell itself. I also personally disliked the ""screaming lambs"" scene; it felt unnecessary and dragged, and Jodie Foster's emotional reactions to Hannibal's questions felt absolutely out of place. As if he miraculously healed her of her long nightmare-sufferings in an Osho-esque way.
Overall, the camera work, sound and direction are all great. I especially loved those first-person shots with Hopkins and Clarice. Very claustrophobia-inducing.Coming to the acting, Anthony Hopkins, though mightily entertaining - very often chuckle-inducing with his sly sarcasm - came across as far from real. His performance was in no way what a true psychopath (especially one so well educated) would be like. I honestly did not find the man scary, though I did find his screen-presence charismatic and imposing.
Jodie Foster was excellent , her vulnerability, her subtle pretence in font of Hannibal, everything.
Ted Levine was marvellous - that strange voice, his quirky dialogue and body language - it all added up perfectly. A great example would be the scene where he gives a slight chuckle, and then runs behind a corner, when confronted at his house. Hard to believe this was the same man who played Pacino's subordinate cop in ""Heat"".
Scott Glenn underplays his role so well, that he seems disarmingly real - cool and calm. It's no surprise that Clarice wanted to work for this guy.Conclusion: SOTL is by all means a very a good film, but to be called one of the greatest movies of all time? I don't think so.
It's predecessor ""Manhunter"" (1986) is by all means the superior Hannibal film, and in my humble opinion, much, much more significant a film (and by significant, I mean more worthy of being preserved in archives for times ahead, than ""Silence of the Lambs"") . Sadly, ""Manhunter"", although a cult classic now, has always been criminally under-appreciated and misunderstood (strong emphasis on ""misunderstood"") and has since remained under the shadow of this one.",The Silence of the Lambs

Of course it is, but what makes it fantastic?It is astonishing that a movie can make you feel so uncomfortable throughout.

All three of the performances were brilliant in their own right. The young Jodie Foster, 29, brought to the table a very curious and strong character (Clarice Starling). When you usually hear about the performances in this movie you always hear about Anthony Hopkins and Ted Levine. Due to this when it comes to the movie you would think both of these actors blow the young Foster out of the water but this isn't quite how it turned out. Yes, she was slightly overshadowed by the their performances but not enough to the point where Jodie's performance wasn't noticeable. Also the other twos performances were some of the best performances known to date. While Anthony Hopkins' portrayal of Hannibal, The Cannibal, Lecture stole the show from Ted Levine, again it wasn't by much. Both had their moments of making you feel uneasy and even physically cringe in places. Although only small, the only issue I have with this movie is that all other characters were out shined. This is down to their performances just not being good enough to stand up to the three main characters' as named above.

I just don't think it's anywhere near being the greatest thriller of our day as some gushed.  With Hannibal Lector's story still breathing (in the new release ""Red Dragon""), I think that the first attempt at filming a Thomas Harris novel, Michael Mann's ""Manhunter"", was more suspenseful and interesting than ""Silence"". In all, this is a tight, well-crafted thriller.  Yet I just cannot tell you that it was worthy of being named Best Picture by the Academy...Grade: B",The Silence of the Lambs
660,shadock-2,Thriller for Thriller haters,9,8 February 2001,"This film is supposed to be scary, and it is.  The tension throughout is unbelievable.  However, unlike others in the ""thriller"" or ""horror"" genre, the horror is never gratuitous or hard to take.  As such, being a hater of this genre, I only got around to watching this several years after it was made.  Now I wish I had seen it before.  Unlike the villains who cut and slash in the standard horror films, we understand that the psychos in this film have motivation.  You actually feel empathy for these people, even the man who doesn't have any - Hannibal Lecter.  You feel sorry that this obviously cultured, intelligent and, yes, dedicated man is trapped not in a prison, but by the fact his brain can't stop him from carrying out the worst things he can imagine.  As such, this film sheds as much light on the criminally insane as any twelve films that could be made about Charles Manson or any of his ilk.  Demme actually tries to understand what makes Hannibal the man he is, and in the end we start to understand as well.Add to this an excellent plot, engaging characters, and ""good guys"" that seem more out of it than the villains and you have a must see movie even for the most squeamish.That being said, I hope the sequel can live up to the original.  I have my doubts, but all being said, I hope Ridley Scott pulls it off.",The Silence of the Lambs
661,The_Vigilante,Don't let him inside your head,9,26 July 2001,"""I ate his liver with some fater beans and a nice chanti"". This classic thriller based on the novel by Thomas Harris is an all time gem. A serial killer helping to find a serial killer, this is not something that you see very often.Women are being hunted by a somewhat deranged serial killer known only as 'Buffalo Bill'. His name refers to his trademark, skinning his victims. In an attempt to secure a lead on Bill FBI trainee Clarice Starling (Jodie Foster) is sent by her superiors to question the infamous Dr. Hannibal 'The Cannibal' Lecter, so called as his victims were eaten. Lecter is being held in a maximum security mental institute for life, of which he has already served eight years.Hannibal asks Starling personal questions, questions which she has been told not to answer. However after a sixth victim is found skinned Starling is at Lecters mercy. She is forced to tell Lecter everything about her childhood which includes the slaughtering of the lambs. For these questions that are answered Lecter rewards Starling with information about Buffalo Bill.A bond is formed between Lecter and Starling, though it is not clear if Lecter is sexually interested in Starling. He does kill Miggs, a psychopath who is in the next cell to Lecter, by making him swallow his own tongue. However, you do not know if he did this because he threw semen at Starling or he did it to amuse himself.I don't want to ruin the film for those reading this who haven't seen it, so I'll let you experience this movie for yourself.Marks out of 10 - 9. Quite simply a brilliant film, with flawless acting and superb direction from Jonathan Demme.",The Silence of the Lambs

Jodie foster impressed me more in this film than she has in any other that I have seen her in.

As if it is beyond what we have today. But 10 or 20 years from now, they will do the same thing with what we have today.That is what happened with The Silence of the Lambs. It is good, but it isn't a perfect movie. There were some major plot holes. There were also parts that would be far better done by today's filming techniques. A plot hole is how Hannibal Lecter escapes... he was a life sentence prisoner. Anyone who has ever been to jail or prison knows, there is no escape. Because you're in a cage within a cage within a cage within a cage within a cage. and even when you are moving to a new cage, you are foot cuffed and handcuffed to a chain that is tied to like 15 other prisoners. All jails and prisons now a days also have drop off points, where giant cement gates close behind the car, as big as the wailing wall, before they let you out of the cop car. Jail is big business for the government.Also, he has some stupid way of escaping from the building that the cell was in. Totally unbelievable. The ending ""dilemma"" between the protagonist and antagonist is very poorly done by today's film standards. Maybe they didn't have access to great technology and programs, but still it could have been better done. The camera view was supposed to be 1st person at one point, but it could have been more realistic to how a person would be acting in such a situation... far more.Worth watching, and good. but remember how the media tries to sell it's past to us.",The Silence of the Lambs

Jonathan Demme's astute adaptation of Thomas Harris' last good book entwines the horror and detective genres to enduringly shocking effect, while Anthony Hopkins' Lecter and Jodie Foster's Starling fizz up an unsettling chemistry that was utterly lacking in the sequel.I haven't seen a movie this perfectly wrapped in a while. I recently re-watched it and it blew me away and it only gets better the more you see it.The performances from everyone are great. Foster sold every scene she was in. But, of course, Hopkins stole every scene he was in and was a powerful anti hero who was scary even when concealed because you know his mind is working at every second. Always planning and he's rarely wrong. His escape was an amazing scene. Levine gives a suitably scary performance but just doesn't stand up to the greatness of Foster and Hopkins.All the characters main characters are deep people are deep people with clear motivations. The police officers are the complete contradiction to this who abuse their power to do what they believe is right, and end up being wrong.

675,varun-mentor,Mindblowing psycho thriller!!! *spoilers*,10,25 May 2009,"I have seen almost all the major titles in IMDb top 100 but this one stands out on its 17 minutes camera time. All the fans must know what that means, Dr Lecter blows your psyche away with those close face camera shots (superb cinematography, best I have seen), penetrating eyes, unflinching wilfuly crafted dialogs and layer by layer account of psycho analysis of a crime and criminal.I watched this movie last night only and I wasn't able to sleep properly, the intense sequences and the confrontations between lecter and clarice were so dramatic and real, they totally grips your psyche and pulls it deeper and deeper inside the mind of a serial criminal slowly making you believe the thin line dilemma between how criminal a crime could be and the other side of the delusion.Silence of the lambs is mainly about 3 characters, Clarice, Lecter and Bill. Clarice (Foster) is a young FBI agent sent as a curve ball after failed attempts to grill Dr Lecter (Hopkins, hail hopkins, generation after generation will praise thy performance as the greatest screen presence and portrayal of a psychotic cannibal), the motive for which changes gradually in getting Lecter to catch a dreaded serial psychopath killer, lady skinner, Buffalo bill. As the movie progresses, you feel the synchronicity between Clarice and Lecter so amazing, their eyes doing the communication and you reading between the intervention.Especially the escape from prison scene of Dr lecter and initial confrontation of Clarice with Dr Lecter when you get the justification for the title is awesome and mind boggling cinema at its best.My personal favorite: Lecter kills the policemen and then looks up with light focused on his face and his face covered with blood while he tuning his finger to symphony with closed eyes in peace.Kudos Hopkins! 10/10",The Silence of the Lambs
676,easternmoviecritic,Legend,10,21 August 2009,"Before 1991 horror movies were less about psychology and more about the actual killing and monsters. The Silence of the Lambs changed the genre.The story starts with our main hero, Clarice Staling (Jodie Foster), a novice FBI enforcer, being sent by her boss to an asylum, where she must talk to one of the most ruthless serial killers – Hannibal Lecter (Anthony Hopkins). His alternate name, ""Hannibal the Cannibal"", sums up why he is so notorious. Dr. Lecter apparently has some information regarding Buffalo Bill, another serial killer, who gained his name because of his sick ""tradition"" of skinning his victims, all women, and who, unlike Hannibal, is on the loose. Clarice must find out where Bill is and stop him.Jodie Foster is great as Clarice, playing the role of an average woman, who has wanted justice since she was little, when her father was killed by two thugs.But the forte point of the movie is Anthony Hopkins, who won an Oscar for the role, the shortest Oscar-winning performance in cinema history. He's screen time is about 20 minutes, but the impression is beyond powerful. He managed to show both sides of Hanibal Lecter – the gentle, calm and yet diabolical Hannibal and the monster.Ted Levine, who played Buffalo Bill, never got the same reputation that Foster and Hopkins got, despite giving life to a twisted freak.The movie is part horror, part psychological thriller. Clarice is trying to do the impossible, while the clock is tickingThe Silence of the Lambs is an absolute masterpiece, recommended to all cinema fans.Final Score: 5/5 or 10/10",The Silence of the Lambs

I'm not even sure why they picked her: I remembered her as somewhat mousy, but boy, does she look like a secretary. Not only that, on repeated viewings, it's obvious her character was written much smarter than she is: out of the blue, she suddenly burps out something very clever, but you can tell by her delivery and the look in her eyes that she just would have been able to come up with that on her own. Very weird.Another thing that occurred to me this time, how come the nurses in the asylum are so, I don't know, sympathetic to Lecter? At the very beginning, we're told that he gruesomely and cold-heartedly maimed a nurse (presumably female) while she was trying to give him an EKG. Granted, he always 'justifies' his killings (most of them patients of him, often revolting, like his cell mate), but still. I could never treat a man maiming someone who was trying to help him with anything except extreme contempt and caution.

678,Merkin4pres64,Absolute Chemistry,10,10 September 2005,"""The Silence of the Lambs"" is a modern day classic for a number of reasons. It features Dr. Hannibal Lector, bringing Anthony Hopkins a well deserved Oscar, a pshycotic cannibal behind bars with a brilliant mind. Clarice Starling, a definitive female hero that feeds Lector memories of her chilling childhood, who makes it cool for women to kick butt. And Jack Crawford the FBI Behavioral Sciences Director who encourages Clarice as she investigates the serial murderer Buffalo Bill.Usually when one who doesn't truly appreciate the beauty of a film, sees ""The Silence of the Lambs"" as a crime movie with a nude dance scene, a man eating another man's face, Miggs, the Death Heads Moth, and a the hockey mask of Hannibal Lector. But I truly appreciate the chemistry between Jodie Foster and Anthony Hopkins in this film. The performances of these two brings what could be mistaken for a budding relationship. In their final scene before Dr. Lector's break out, the chemistry is clearly evident there. The close up shots of their faces would be slightly annoying in another movie, but these shots show the anguish and anxiety of Clarice Starling and the cunning and brilliance of Dr. Lector. As Dr. Lector questions Clarice of the lambs, her mental anguish is forced and she must relive memories of the murder of her father, the town marshal, which could help fuel her search of Buffalo Bill. As Lector educates Clarice on coveting, his face transforms into a slightly evil glare that shows the brilliance and evil coinciding in Dr. Lector's mind. This scene is my absolute favorite because of the past of Starling is revealed. In this scene we see the true evil of Dr. Lector begin to form and show in the movie.The chemistry is brilliant and perfect. The only other on screen chemistry that could even compare to this would be that of Frankie Dunn and Maggie Fitzgerald, portrayed by Clint Eastwood and Hilary Swank, in ""Million Dollar Baby.""",The Silence of the Lambs

What a stunning performance, I was amazed by how the role of the psychopathic Hannibal Lector was filled perfectly by Anthony and it couldn't have been done ant better. It is a great storyline based on the novel by Thomas Harris, and I haven't mentioned Jodie Foster's Oscar winning performance as rookie FBI agent Clarice Starling, but let's face it, Jodie Foster's performance is good but it was overwhelmed by Anthony's performance. But still two good Oscar winning performances and good acting from the rest of the cast especially Ted Levine's role as Jame Gump (Buffalo Bill). This legendary movie swept the main five Oscar's which were: Best Picture, Best Actor, Best Actress, Best Director and Best Screenplay. The soundtrack of this movie also made the movie what it is. The soundtrack made it more dramatic and dark. As in many scenes the music increased the darkness and pure horror of this legendary thriller.Overall the Silence is one of my all time favorite's, deserved it's five Oscars, amazing acting and of course the best performance I've ever seen by Anthony Hopkins and deserves to be #23 in the top 250.

Anthony Hopkins will forever be remembered as Dr. Lector. Who else could play the role? Johnny Depp, as fine an actor as he is?On to the most despicable characters; they are so easy to hate, more so than Lector's murderous cadre of acolytes, who, after all, have an excuse. In order of increasing odiousness: 1. Catherine, the rich, loudmouthed senator's daughter. Whatta bitch! She would have done better as a capacious frock. 2.

It's only the third film in history to win Academy Awards in all the top five categories: Best Picture, Best Actor, Best Actress, Best Director, and Adapted Screenplay and that imply something about its technical quality as a film. It features expertise level of craftsmanship in all departments of filmmaking, and takes a huge bonus from the exquisite performances put in by its stellar cast. After all these years The Silence of the Lambs remains in a league of its own and is a perfect exemplification of just how great a movie can become when all the right elements come together and work in perfect harmony to form a complete whole.Based on the novel of the same name, Jodie Foster stars as Clarice Starling, a top student at the FBI's training academy. FBI agent Jack Crawford (Scott Glenn) wants Clarice to interview Dr. Hannibal Lecter (Anthony Hopkins), a genius psychiatrist who is also a violent psychopath, serving life behind bars for various acts of murder and cannibalism. Crawford believes that Lecter may have insight into a case of a serial killer called Buffalo Bill (Ted Levine), that murders and skins his victims and that Starling as an attractive young woman, may be just the bait to make him help with the case.The direction by Jonathan Demme is marvelous, as the film introduces its chilling sense of dread and has the audience on the edge of their seats, from the moment Howard Shore's ominous score hits the screen till the end of the film, especially during the climax with a lot of perfectly crafted suspenseful and nail-biting moments. The editing is perfect as the pace is methodical from start to finish, and each and every sequence is relevant to the story. The cinematography by Tak Fujimoto is fantastic as it fully succeeds into creating a very dark and brooding atmosphere that captivates as well as terrorize the audience, while also exhibiting excellent camera work that makes heavy use of close-ups which increase the creepiness and tension along with displaying an optimal color palette and minimal lightning from start to finish, which further enhances the darker ambience the story was aiming for. Moreover, the production design team has done a magnificent work as every set piece is meticulously crafted, richly detailed and very well-lit. The script by Ted Tally, also packs a very well structured and tight plot, every character has a well-defined arc, all the themes are smartly addressed, the attention to detail is quite impressive, and the complete story and narrative are perfect.The performances are incredible. Jodie Foster as Clarice is absolutely brilliant and gives an impeccable performance as a woman who is desperately trying to forget her painful past and yet at the same time tries to prove her worth in a male dominant world. Anthony Hopkins as the genius psychiatrist and cannibalistic serial killer Hannibal Lecter is the perfect amalgamation of charisma, high intelligence and destructive violence, and gives a bone-chilling and memorable performance that will stand the passage of time as one of the absolute best. The small amount of screen time that Hopkins is given is a definitive testament to his acting capabilities, as with such an elegant and minimal performance, he solidifies himself as one of the most iconic villains of all time. Due to the charisma and electrifying chemistry between the two actors every scene they share becomes an instant classic.In conclusion, the Silence of the Lambs is one of the greatest films ever made and a masterwork of brilliant direction, smart screenplay, splendid camerawork, tight editing, marvelous score and exquisite performances, that cemented the legacy of both Anthony Hopkins and Jodie Foster by engraving their iconic characters into the annals of cinema. The film absolutely deserves all the accolades and recognition it gets, for both its contributions to cinema and the immense impact it had on pop culture. Jonathan Demme's magnum opus is an outstanding achievement in genre filmmaking that has inspired and influenced countless thrillers since its release, and is not only the quintessential suspense and psychological horror film but also an ingenious observation of humanity's dark and violent nature and a masterpiece that every film lover must see.",The Silence of the Lambs

Although movies seldom live up to the respective novels in which their based, this one equals it, but in different ways.  I have to hand it to Ted Tally for his script adaptation; his script keeps the core of the story while stripping away the more complex and unnecessary aspects of the novel and still makes it suspenseful and interesting.  The acting is magnificent, Foster plays Clarice with what looks like such ease, and yet keeps the character complex, smart, strong, and comfortably flawed, and aware of those flaws.  Hopkins is equally brilliant as Lecter: he is everything Clarice is but more charming and unaware he possesses any flaws at all.  One of the things I love about the film is it's simplicity.  The sets and clothes look normal, unimportant, everyday, cheap.  Nothing's flashy or overly ornate looking.  It still holds up very well after 13 years.  Won Oscars for Best Actor, Actress, Adapted Screenplay, Director, and Picture.  Highly recommended.",The Silence of the Lambs
694,AshCaton,Wonderfully Chilling,8,5 December 2008,"Anthony Hopkins gives the performance of his career in this suspenseful thriller as the cannibalistic Hannibal Lecter. It is, in a manner of speaking, Hopkins' film, a character study on his behalf. Any fraction of second with him on screen is electrifying. His manipulation, deception and fleeting seconds of violence are all so brutally portrayed; Hopkins' succeeds in creating what surely must be one of Cinema's finest villains. Jodie Foster does her 'I'm a bit damaged' thing and personally, I don't think this is one of her best performances, perhaps because she is so thoroughly upstaged throughout. Ted Levine manages to shine as the woman-skinning serial killer known only as Buffalo Bill. There are sequences where the script verges on being slightly hammy, but its raw impact and consistent tension always gets the better of it. What's so brilliant about this film is it's claustrophobia. The sense that, even from behind bars (or glass, as the case may be) Lecter manages to have people wrapped around his fingers, is far more terrifying than if you gave him a knife and fork and stuck an apple in your mouth. You don't quite get the feeling that Starling is anywhere close to being a match for Lecter, and perhaps if she had given him just a bit more of a run for his money, it could have been slightly more exciting. Then again, perhaps the most numbing thing about Silence of the Lambs is how easy it is for a monster to have his way with the world.",The Silence of the Lambs

697,Gymnopedies,A Lesson In Psychology,8,4 April 2020,"The Silence of the Lambs based on the novel by Thomas Harris - featuring Dr. Hannibal Lecter, (played by Anthony Hopkins who steals the film and was deserving of his Best Actor award) who is perhaps the most iconic character in film history and Agent Clarice Starling (played by Jodie Foster who really holds the film together and her performance is her greatest in my view). The film is a rare example of where a film wins several Oscars for Best Screenplay, Best Director, Best Actress, Best Actor, and Best Picture. It is regularly listed by critics and fans alike to be one of the greatest and most influential films of all time.The film has a timeless like quality to it, which from previous lessons, we are able to tell the year the film was made from the styles of clothing and also the production quality of the film. The storyline is enthralling throughout, which has a perfect mix of criminal investigation and criminal psychology. Jonathan Demme's, the director was superb, in respect to how the film is shot, it is shot with a unrelenting atmospheric dread throughout which never ceases, the suspense never drops. We talk about how ideas are in your head before they are put onto paper - even though this film was based on a book it still had to be brought to life without losing any of its atmosphere, that is the greatest test of all. The Silence of the Lambs, which in less capable hands may have just turned out to be another cheap thriller film. It is rather intellectual, a surprise given similar movies in the genre. It can be argued that it is more psychological than violent, even though there is a fair amount of blood.The fact is that with the tense score, marvellous cinematography and with an almost bleak aspect in regards to theme and the aesthetics - just really all adds to what in the end is not only is the perfect thriller but the perfect movie.",The Silence of the Lambs

As I said, this is the first psycho movie to me so my criteria of the same kind of movies is based on this movie; super clever criminal, a detective of the sense of justice and of course creepy crime scenes but not too grotesque.

Breathtakingly suspenseful and eerie.I don't want to give away too much. But its darn right creepy and atmospheric. Finely intuitive depiction of the friction between Jodie and Anthony was Oscar heralded and allowed Foster to reinvigorate her audience and ratchets up the tension.Stands as the finest period documents of Pittsburg. The Silence of the Lambs is a 1988 novel by Thomas Harris, his second to feature sociopathic psychiatrist and cannibal Dr. Hannibal ""The Cannibal"" Lecter.

706,Shinobu_Sensui,A magnificent Classic of cinema!,10,14 July 2007,"I have always been interested in serial killers. How exactly they go through the process of killing their victim etc. Well, this serial killer ridden dramatic masterpiece was a very interesting attempt to tell of the subject.The story has potential. Clarice Starling, an FBI trainee is sent by her boss, Jack Crawford, to Dr. Hannibal Lector. A former psychiatrist who murdered many people, eating them shortly after. Lector is held in an asylum in Baltimore Maryland, where he is dealt with very carefully. Lector's brilliance and genius are renowned and he is very dangerous, even behind bars. It will be a real advancement into the field of forensic science to be able to unlock Lector's mind. And a huge career advancement for Starling, but when she actually meets Hannibal, he attacks her mind with his strange workings and is only semi-cooperative. At the same time, another serial killer, Nicknamed 'Buffalo Bill' is on the loose who kills women to cut off parts of their skin. Starling takes it upon herself to get information from the reluctant Lector who directly knows the answer to the case, but he reveals it in hints, thus Starling must interpret them before Bill kills his next victim, who is being starved for several days in order for her skin to loosen up.First of all, I would like to say that this movie's photographic quality is like someone trying to curl a barbell that is barely too heavy for them. The weight is almost lifted, but just can't be. The photography is weighed down from an acceptable quality.This movie is overall very well directed however, the lighting is perfect, and the other artistic elements run together very well. The sets are well constructed, the score fits flawlessly, and the story is handled in a gritty, disturbing manner. The entire production is just amazingly well done, and has a very strong atmosphere.But Hopkins really makes this movie. I don't see why everyone thinks that Foster gave such a great performance. As Lectr, he is sophisticated, yet quite psychopathic at the same time. His performance really makes this movie. Also worth mentioning is Anthony Heald as Dr. Chilton who runs the asylum Lector is in. He brings a vanity and villainy to the role that contrasts well with Hopkins's demeanor.So overall, Silence of the lambs was a very entertaining and compelling drama. I fail to see any flaws except for a bad performance by Scott Glen as Jack Crawford. Silnce of the Lambs will be remembered as one of the better films of the 1990s",The Silence of the Lambs
707,GloreMag,"Demme's disturbing, powerful and poignant masterpiece!",10,7 February 2010,"""The Silence of The Lambs"", simply one of the greatest films ever made. Swept all five major academy awards, only ever done twice before (One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest, It Happened That Night).It centres on a young FBI trainee Clarice Starling (Jodie Foster) who becomes increasingly obsessed with solving the the murders of a deranged killer known only as ""Buffalo Bill"" thanks to hid trademark of skinning his victims. Starling is mentored by the brilliant intelligent yet atrociously psychopathic Dr. Hannibal ""The Cannibal"" Lector.The two protagonists have a number of exchanges throughout the film which unyielded dark and unsettling personal disturbances that Starling experienced in the past where she witnessed the slaughtering of innocent spring lambs juxtaposed with their terrifying screams. This is an extremely powerful image and connotation in the film as Starling believes that capturing ""Buffalo Bill"" will be silencing the lambs and ultimately silencing the soul-shattering experiences of her orphaned childhood.There are a variety of effective techniques employed by director Jonathan Demme such as extreme close-ups of Dr. Lector to illuminate the madness in his eyes and the unsettling rhythm of his breathing. These are few of the elements that contribute in Anthony Hopkins delivering the performance of his career as Lector.The first time Starling visits Lector in his cell is outstandingly effective. Just by the camera gliding slowly past the other institutionalised psycho's, it builds slowly up the true madman, Lecot. He stands still in the centre of his cell, staring at Starling. Spine-chilling and brilliant. One of the most effective techniques I have ever noticed in a film.The film does have its gory moments, which is fine considering that it deals heavily with serial killers and cannibals so it is nothing that exceeds expectations.But it's the performances that make this film simply incredible. Hopkins is extraordinarily creepy as Hannibal Lector where as Jodie Foster portrays such vulnerable courage, such fear and determination. Both were well deserved of their Oscars as was the film and Demme for his Best Director Award.The film's ending is exciting and well wrapped-up which is always a positive in any film and compliments the rest of the film beautifully as every scene comes dripping with intensity, drama and wondrous camera work.This a genuine cinematic accomplishment that has spawned sequels and prequels that are respectable in their own right but will never match up to the brilliance of Hopkins, Foster and co.10/10 True masterpiece!",The Silence of the Lambs

She is totally convincing as the FBI trainee, and her scenes with Hopkins are among the best film scenes ever. Good supporting performances are provided by Scott Glen and Ted Levine, the later as a despicable transexual serial killer, shows skill in his limited screen time.The scene in which Hannibal Lecter escapes his prison cell is superbly directed, and the result - the famous face removing incident, and the subsequent positioning of one of the bodies are fantastic.Hopkins performance is such that I felt glad as he escaped, and walked free at the end.""I'd love to talk but I'm having an old friend for dinner.""This classic quote could be quite disturbing - until you see who the intended victim is.Overall a quite brilliant film expertly adapted from a quite brilliant book. 10/10",The Silence of the Lambs

Clarice Starling is pulled from her FBI training at the Quantico, Virginia FBI Academy by Jack Crawford of the Bureau's Behavioral Science Unit. He assigns her to interview Hannibal Lecter, a former psychiatrist and incarcerated cannibalistic serial killer. Lecter's insight could prove useful in the pursuit of a serial killer nicknamed ""Buffalo Bill"", who kills young women and removes their skin.At the Baltimore State Hospital for the Criminally Insane, Dr. Frederick Chilton makes a crude pass at Starling before he escorts her to Lecter's cell. Although initially pleasant and courteous, Lecter grows impatient with Starling's interviewing and rebuffs her. As she is leaving, a prisoner named Miggs flicks semen at her. Lecter, who considers this an ""unspeakably ugly"" act, calls Starling back and tells her to seek out his old patient. This leads her to a storage facility, where she discovers a jar containing a man's severed head. She returns to Lecter, who says the man is linked to Buffalo Bill. He offers to profile Buffalo Bill on condition he be transferred away from Chilton, whom he detests. Another Buffalo Bill victim is found who has a death's head moth lodged in her throat.Buffalo Bill abducts Catherine Martin, a senator's daughter. Crawford authorizes Starling to offer Lecter a fake deal, promising a prison transfer if he provides information that helps them capture Buffalo Bill and rescue Catherine. Instead, Lecter demands a quid pro quo from Starling, offering clues about Buffalo Bill in exchange for personal information. Starling tells Lecter about her father's murder when she was ten years old. Chilton secretly records the conversation and reveals Starling's deceit before offering Lecter a different deal. Lecter agrees and is flown to Memphis, where he meets and torments Senator Martin, then gives her misleading information on Buffalo Bill, including the name ""Louis Friend"".Starling deduces that ""Louis Friend"" is an anagram of ""iron sulfide""-fool's gold. She visits Lecter, who is now imprisoned in a cell in a Tennessee courthouse, and requests the truth. Lecter says all the information she needs is contained in the Buffalo Bill case file, then insists on continuing their quid pro quo. She recounts a traumatic childhood incident of hearing spring lambs being slaughtered on a relative's Montana farm. Lecter speculates that Starling hopes saving Catherine will end the recurring nightmares she has of lambs screaming. Lecter returns the Buffalo Bill case files to Starling as Chilton arrives and has the police escort her from the building. Later that evening, Lecter kills his guards, escapes his cell, and disappears.Starling analyzes Lecter's file annotations and deduces that Buffalo Bill knew his first victim, Frederika Bimmel. Starling travels to her Ohio hometown and discovers both she and Buffalo Bill were tailors. At Frederika's home, she notices unfinished dresses and dress patterns identical to the patches of skin removed from the victims. She phones Crawford and says Buffalo Bill is making a ""suit"" with human skin. Crawford is already en route to make an arrest, having cross-referenced Lecter's notes with hospital archives and finding a man named Jame Gumb. Gumb smuggled death's head moths into the U.S. and was refused sex-change operation, mistakenly believing he was transsexual. Starling continues interviewing Frederika's friends while Crawford and an FBI HRT storm Gumb's address in Illinois, finding the house empty. Meanwhile, Starling goes to interview another person who knew Frederika. At the house, she meets ""Jack Gordon"", but realizes he is Gumb after spotting a death's head moth flying loose. She pursues him into a cavernous basement where she finds Catherine trapped in a dry well. In a dark room, Gumb stalks Starling with night-vision goggles, but reveals himself by cocking his revolver. Starling reacts quickly and shoots Gumb dead.At the FBI Academy graduation party, Starling receives a phone call from Lecter, who is at a Bimini airport. He wishes her well, and says he must hang up because he is ""having an old friend for dinner"". He trails a newly arrived Chilton into the crowd.",The Silence of the Lambs
711,witch king,This movie takes a real bite out of you!,10,22 October 1998,"The normal human being's fear of being attacked, bitten open in a violently impersonal manner and then taken in as food is as old as the first human being's shattering witness of such a primordial act. In the thousands of years of human evolution, intelligence has armored [most of us] against predations of that horrible sort. But even more incomprehensible is an attack, for mere hunger's sake, by one human being upon another! When first we see Dr. Hannibal Lecter, his madness is merely the subject of comment, responsible or otherwise. As we view him [uncomfortably] from the safety of a theatre seat, we can only imagine the deep wells of need which forced him to savage his fellow human beings in this manner, and this makes all the more terrible the awful scene in the Memphis courthouse. Into all this walks Clarice Starling, her innocence and anxiety both touching and troubling. She is essentially tricked into taking the assignment to ""interview"" Lecter by her superior, Jack Crawford, who callously deems her expendable. She somehow summons the rural courage of her youth, forged from the furnace of her weary sufferings, and becomes the blank sheet for both Crawford's and Lecter's amusement. As the result of being pulled in opposite directions in the murderous tug-of-war between Lecter and Crawford, Starling is almost totally alone in the film. In spite of her genuine liking for Aredlia Mapp, Starling's isolation is nearly so complete as to be claustrophobic. Director Jonathan Demme's finely-nuanced work here is well served. Her enlightenment takes place primarily in darkness, whether the setting is Lecter's cell in the dungeon, or whether the apotheosis takes place in the demon's lair. There are almost no likeable characters in the film save Starling. This makes it easy to root for her to overcome the furies which have pursued her since her tenth year. Clarice's predatory instincts are to bring a vicious psychopath within the scope of punishment. In sharp contrast, the other main characters in the film are possessed of predatory natures of a baser, more primitive kind, whether it is Dr. Frederick Chilton's need for sex, or Crawford's need for control, or Lecter's need to destroy for pleasure. The music score by Howard Shore is reminiscent, in a eerie way, of Bernard Herrmann's work in Psycho. Shore's opening theme foreshadows the loneliness and desperation of Starling's dual quest, which is to kill both beasts: the one without and the one within.",The Silence of the Lambs

It is a credit to the writers and producers that they left the original storyline intact, when in todays hollywood features, it is often likely to change the ending so everything turns out in a happy way.The only unfortunate aspect of the movie is that it spawned so many copycat movies, from Along Came A Spider to Watcher to the numerous other pyscho-maniac thrillers in which the filmmaker tries to cause some sympathy towards the maniac as you do with Anthony Hopkins.

Its artistry is also very praised, that spirit. The confrontation, the sharp contrast between angels and demons, the inner philosophy based on a slower pace is impressive, so it can be used in film history. Leave a sum on it.
The conversation between the two of them across the iron cage was my favorite part of the play, with delicate performances and deep music touching. There were a lot of symbolic dialogue, Clarice said, and at first she wanted to release the lambs, but they ""didn't know to run away, just stood there confused and didn't want to go."" How similar these lambs are to the dull world, even if the freedom given to the body is still the prisoner of their own hearts, they all say that the strong save themselves and the saints save themselves, but most mediocre people do not know how to escape the tragedy of life, or even sadly do not realize that they are in the tragedy, only with a fragile heart and wandering soul, constantly free from the gates of heaven, constantly indulging in pain. Keep screaming dying in your heart. And this-cruelty is covered up by a colder silence between heaven and earth.. As ""The Sound OfSilence"" sings, when silence becomes a voice that makes the world think everything is normal, can we tear open this appearance that we are not in front of us with a scorching sun burning hell? the pain of life and the weight of life will fall unbiased on the top of each-individual, as Clarice said, ""they are too heavy.""",The Silence of the Lambs

That is as astonishing and appalling as the films five wholly undeserved major Academy Awards. To be shocking and unsettling for the purpose of art can be admirable. To be shocking and unsettling for the purpose of creating a lurid freak show is another. This movie never even makes the most cursory attempt to look at what motivates the serial killers it portrays. It just wants to be creepy. Creepy it is, and full of suspense, too. But since when does that earn you a Best Picture Oscar? ""Jurassic Park"" was creepy and full of suspense, in far skillful and artistic ways, yet the suggestion that it was award worthy would have brought guffaws.The performances of Jodie Foster and Anthony Hopkins are good, but definitely not Oscar worthy. In fact, for Hopkins supporting role to be included as Best Actor is abysmally ridiculous. And for all the hype that has surrounded the character of Hannibal Lecter, he is nothing but a by-the-numbers Hollywood pshycopath. In short, parts of this film are well done (others are not), and unlike most contemporary horror films it's genuinely frightening. But never for one millisecond does it begin to approach a level of depth beyond B-Grade exploitation.

721,thomas2193,Fantastic Thriller,9,8 September 2014,"Spoiler alert: This review contains spoilers, revealing parts of the plot.Have you ever seen a main character that both inspires and frightens you at the same time? That's exactly what Anthony Hopkins with his role as Hannibal 'The Cannibal' Lector accomplishes with his mind-blowing performance in Silence of the Lambs. This film is one of the most awe-inspiring thrillers ever produced on screen. It's deeply psychological, with a strong story. The most amazing irony that this movie delivers, is that you both respect Hannibal, but also despise him. He has an incredible role within the film and Hopkins certainly manages to portray Hannibal perfectly. All the credit to Hopkins for the amazing performance. Jodie Foster portrays the role of FBI trainee Clarice Starling, who certainly manages to put op a great performance as well. We've seen here role as Clarice Starling portrayed by other actresses in the sequels to Silence of the Lambs and none of them managed to outperform her, or even come close to her performance in Silence of the Lambs.This film is a really exciting thriller, with a lot of strong moments that manage to keep up the pace, which is important to a thriller in my view. Clarice Starling follows a special FBI training, until her boss wants her to participate in a special task. He wants her to interrogate the dangerous Hannibal, who is in prison for his cannibalistic crimes. When she does, she seems afraid at first, but Hannibal shows his respect for her and she starts being intrigued by Hannibal. The main goal for the interrogations is to follow the trail of a murderer named Buffalo Bill. This insane murderer kills and skins young woman, because he's an insane cross dresser. They want Hannibal to help them with the difficult case, because Bill used to be a psychiatric patient of his. Bit by bit, Hannibal delivers some information, but he wants to hear the live story of Starling in exchange. Agent Starling offers him a fake agreement, put together by her boss, so Hannibal will give them all the information required. But the prison guard Jack Crawford, a rival to Hannibal, tells him it's a lie. Starling slowly starts to find out more about this mysterious Buffalo Bill. Hanibal the Cannibal has been locked inside a cage, but when two prison guards attempt to give him some food, he manages to escape and murders both men. He then manages to escape prison. Meanwhile, agent Starling ends up in the house of Buffalo Bill and attempts to rescue the daughter of the governor, but she gets trapped in a deep well, until the FBI discovers and they are rescued. Starling isn't afraid of the fact that Hannibal has escaped prison, because she knows he respects her and is too decent to go after her. The strongest part of the film happens in the last minute, when Starling receives a call from Hannibal and he tells her he's not going after her, because that would be a pity for the world.Really strong performances by most of the characters. Buffalo Bill is an insane murderer and his role has been portrayed very well. Hannibal is really intriguing in Silence of the Lambs, which really adds up to the film's quality. I'd go on and say this is actually the best thriller that has ever been made.",The Silence of the Lambs
722,manojmagecha,A Sophisticated Killer,10,24 December 2019,"There are psychological thrillers and then there's this. I cannot think of anyone other than Sir Anthony Hopkins to play the lead role of A serial killer/ cannibal/ sophisticated psychopath. He's a conversational artist, and someone who knows what he's capable of without fear of expressing his interests in what we refer to as cannibalism. The initial meeting between himself and the FBI agent Clarice, gives his character a sense of meaning, and purpose. It's not everyday he has the pleasure of indulging in a conversation, and being locked up you would think his social skills are little rusty! But quite the contrary.I'm expected to believe that this DR knows he's aging and on the verge of never seeing daylight again, and so Clarice becomes more of a confidant, and helpful test subject for the DR to engage with, in context of the finer, more simpler pleasures of human interaction.He gives off a sense of honour; it's not everyday a psychopathic killer is approached by an agent that seeks advice on a case which she cannot understand! The DR has been caught for similar acts of violent murders and knows no-one else is better equipped to advise young Clarice.And now we have reason, we have a plot, and we have established the characters influences on each other. The Dr Seems to be more than willing to help, so helpful in-fact you feel as though Clarice will truly understand the mind of such a character. The Dr (aka Hannibal lectar) effortlessly allows the agent to believe she is the only form of communication he has, and that he needs her just as much as she needs him, however under false pretences, to give her the impression that he's worthy of her trust and at the same time asserting his mannerisms. No-one truly knows what Hannibal lectar seeks, except Hannibal himself! Perhaps to be remembered? By consolidating with the detective? A more exciting challenge presenting itself with Clarice in the frame? After all Clarice is the only person that can truly reveal the DR to be more than what society has labelled him to be! Through Clarice, a young in-experienced agent, the doctor sees opportunity, to tell A story, presents his theories and ideology like A conductor leading an orchestra, like a father leaving behind a legacy, like a master educating his disciple. It begs the question, if you were in the detectives position, how comfortable and relaxed does Hannibal lectar make you feel? Do you feel closer to his mind? Are you forming a bond?...... The answer is YES! And this exactly how he begins to lead his victims into a false sense of security, to eventually get close enough to you too............ EAT YOU!!!!!! Muhahahaha!!!!As a member of the audience I was lead to believe the DR is creating a calm and relaxed environment with his tone of voice, but at the same time I felt he created a somewhat eerie atmosphere, as his reputation truely begins to preced him, from the moment he is introduced!A film worthy to be considered as one of the most sophisticated and eerie performances to date.

Anthony Hopkins is creepy as hell as Hannibal Lecter and Jodie Foster is perfect as Clarice Starling. It's too bad that she won't be in the upcoming Hannibal, but I'm sure Julianne Moore will play the part well. A lot of people think I'm weird, this being my favorite movie of all time. I don't doubt them, but it doesn't matter. This is just a really good movie, but it does have some gory scenes so it's not for the squeamish. But anyway, I recommend it to people who like psychological thrillers such as The Sixth Sense and Psycho.

After all, rarely does a film come along that's as delicious as this.Well anyway, while on my appetizer I lost my appetite a bit while I tried to swallow Anthony Hopkins's excellent acting and the vulgar themes of the film, but then as I chewed on the cannibalism, skinning, serial-killers, and dark tones a little more, I began to enjoy the meal.THEN I was launched into a SUPERB main course.  As I dove deeper into the course, I found that my meal had more of a special flavor (and Anthony Hopkins can certainly cook up a memorable line), and not to mention the excellent Jody Foster, whose explosive dish is in no way overshadowed by Anthony Hopkins.Then I came crashing down to the end...A delicious dessert that leads right into the sequel (which you can enjoy after February 9).And so, if you can stomach it, I dare you to make this YOUR main course.

727,BoJangles-3,Superior Suspense Thriller,10,3 January 2001,"Jonathan Demme's Silence of the Lambs is perhaps the best suspense thriller that I have ever seen.  Anthony Hopkins is extraordinary as serial killer Dr. Hannibal Lecter, and he gets to play off of an excellent performance by Jodie Foster as Clarice Starling.  Both won Oscars, and both deservedly so. Hopkins is so menacing as Lecter that even behind the bars or the glass you are terrified of him.  The direction of the film provides a tight moving suspenseful storyline that moves along at a perfectly timed pace.  Demme's film is a landmark film elevated to the level of masterpiece by the performances of its two stars, Hopkins and Foster.  A definite must-see for anyone with the courage to do so!",The Silence of the Lambs
728,k-08062,The silent lamb,9,3 April 2020,"Starling is not a simple woman, only ignorant people can be really simple. Starling's character is complex, she is rational, smart and ambitious, which is said by Hannibal herself, and she also knows how to deal with interpersonal relationships quite tactfully. These traits are one of the reasons why Hannibal likes her. Hannibal said he hates rude people, and ""etiquette"" and ""restraint"" are precisely the suppression and domestication of human anti-animal instincts. Most simple people follow their own nature and act bluntly without thinking, and Starling is definitely not one of those people. On the contrary, she seems to be a little too self-restrained, causing this cold beauty to constantly reveal her fragile fragility under her strong appearance, adding a bit of lovable beauty to her. but in addition, you can strongly feel a cold heart and an unshakable belief that you are in a weak position. Hannibal has always been a man with excellent mental control and seems to have transcended all the limitations of human inferiority. He advocates reason, intelligence, and appreciates classical literature and music (remember the Gothenburg variation in the background when he was in a cage, Bach's music is recognized as the most rational). He must have loved the grandeur of classical tragedies more than the pleasures of earthly life. So there is no doubt that Starling is typical of his favorite image: rational, strong, neat, self-respecting, sensitive, and because of the shadow of childhood or her nature, she has a strong melancholy temperament and the lonely beauty of isolating the crowd. a little neurotic can also please a psychiatrist. So Hannibal should be attracted to her at first sight.
In the end, however, it was the story of the screaming Lamb that eventually prompted Hannibal to fall in love with Starling, which was so idealized and symbolized that it had a certain allegorical color. That kind of compassionate feelings, the great love for human suffering, make Starling exude a kind of holy martyrdom, but also make Hannibal explore her story again and again and be deeply shocked. Hannibal has always been sure of analyzing people's minds, and Starling is an exception. He had speculated that she might have been sexually abused by relatives or wanted to escape from a poor and barren childhood, no matter which kind of trauma was limited to her personal misfortune. It is common for people to hurt themselves because of bad luck, even if it is reasonable and reasonable, because it still cannot escape the scope of personal grief, and the resulting tragedy is marked by a particular experience. And the real profound tragedy should be a more universal, not based on this appearance, based on the origin of life shudder. It needs to put aside the abusive self-catharsis and resonate with it with a rational and simple soul. So Starling's story was a big surprise to Hannibal. She saw other creatures suffering, grieving for them, and giving up everything to save them, a state that few people could achieve. It is an exaggeration to say that there is an awareness of Christ carrying the cross. So Hannibal would give an infinitely gentle sigh, ""Thank you, Starling."" I think the second half of what he didn't say should be ""Thank you, Starling, you have given me a little bit of confidence in human beings."" So ""the world is more interesting because of you"". The only physical contact between the two men in the film was a touch of the index finger, reminiscent of Michelangelo's famous mural Genesis, and God's finger turned Adam into a spiritual connection between God and man. this passage in the film may suggest a subtle shift in the relationship between Hannibal and Starling. The dialogue between the two of them across the cage is my favorite part of the play. The exquisite performance and deep music are very touching. There was a lot of symbolic dialogue, and Starling said that at first she wanted to release the lambs, but they ""didn't know how to run away, they just stood there confused and didn't want to go."" How similar these lambs are to the dull world. Even if they are given physical freedom, they are still prisoners of their own souls. They all say that the strong save themselves and the saints pass from one person to another, but most mediocre people do not know how to escape from the tragedy of life. They are even so sad that they do not realize that they are in a tragedy. They only keep wandering outside the heavenly gate with a fragile heart and a wandering soul, constantly indulging in pain. Keep screaming in my heart. And all this cruelty is masked by a colder silence between heaven and earth. As sung in ""The Sound Of Silence"", when silence becomes a sound, making people think that everything is normal, but tearing apart this layer of appearance, is it not the execution ground of hell burning in the scorching sun in front of us? The pain and weight of life will unbiased fall on everyone's head, as Starling said, ""they are too heavy."" Did Starling really hear the ""scream"" of the lamb when she was a child? I think the answer is probably no (for movies only). It's winter night, everyone is sleeping, and the butchers shouldn't have started yet. How could the humming of a few weak lambs be big enough to wake up Starling in the room? Why can't other people just hear this sound? So this ""scream"" is probably an abstract intention, a voice that exists only in Starling's heart, and echoes again and again like a nightmare as an adult. This is the symbolism used in the film. The title of the film tells us that ""the Lamb is always the most silent animal"", but only in Stelline's eyes they keep asking for help and struggling because of suffering. In the final analysis, it is because she has a sensitive insight into the world. Many times as sensitive as ordinary people and several times as compassionate as ordinary people, Starling is not destined to be a happy person. Hannibal's sketch shows her dressed in white with a lamb in her arms, and her eyes seem gentle but exude a desolate and resolute strength, which bears a resemblance to the Virgin Mary. In fact, if we talk about the topics of ""the strong"" and ""the weak"", is it true that each of us is not a ""weak"" in front of nature and fate? And the world itself may be the greedy eyes that Hannibal said. People come to the world with the original sin called desire, unconsciously fighting against each other, forming an invisible and huge net, each person is not only the giver of evil, but also the victim of evil; both greedy peeping and frightened escape; both a sinner and a victim, there is no escape, no escape. Like poor bad boy Bill, like the man who looked at Starling at the airport, like those contemptuous male policemen, like you and me. Perhaps, in the eyes of Hannibal, human beings are pathetic, struggling for their own interests, but can not escape the butcher's knife of fate, and will eventually be mercilessly swallowed up by life, just like stupid and frightened lambs waiting to be slaughtered, ignorance, numbness, pitiful and pathetic. It can be said that Hannibal has been looking down on human beings with a cold reason, just like a ruthless god, who does not know what benevolence is, regards all things as a ruminant dog, and cannot change human tragedies, so he is indifferent. Until he met Starling, a shepherd girl who, sensitive by nature and aware of human tragedies, was crying to save even one lamb, a thin, frail girl who tried to carry all the sufferings of the world on her shoulders. The two people are both similar and completely opposite. So Hannibal's love for Starling is not only a sympathy for each other, but also a guardian of the beautiful soul of dissidents. ""Brave Clarice, if one day your lamb stops screaming, will you come and tell me?"" If this world can really become the kingdom of heaven one day, even the ruthless gods will be a little moved, right?",The Silence of the Lambs

730,wicket177,One of my few 10s,9,5 March 2002,"may contain some spoilersI saw this movie when I was 16 and I loved it.  It still amazes me how good acting can get... There are very few movies where there are two actors this good.  Anthony Hopkins is absolutely fabulous as Hannibal Lecter and Jodi Foster is perfect for her role as Starling.  The way they interact is so bitter-sweet it's incredible.  However, as good as the acting is, the feeling of their scenes together could not be achieved without the wonderful cinematography.  When Lecter touches Clarices' hand when he gives her the notes back is almost emotional.  That is the only time they make physical contact in the movie, yet it feels like they've loved each other forever. The pervertedness and gore is used very well.  I am so glad that Silence of the Lambs didn't turn into some kind of a Scream slasher and it remained a true suspense thriller until the very end.Oh, and Senator, just one more thing: love your suit!**********10 stars**********",The Silence of the Lambs

You counterbalance the character with another who is worse, someone who is making a dress from female human skin and you find an attractive, intelligent woman, an FBI agent, who needs this cannibal to stop the dressmaker.

I guess if you took the word horror out, you'd still have the truth. I'm a movie addict. And this is The Perfect Movie. As a matter of fact, this film is the reason I love horror movies, and movies in general. I read the book the summer after my eighth grade year (a little too young, still to really appreciate it.) The novel, let me say, as an aspiring horror writer, is excellent and ranks in my top 10 desert island books. The film changes only minor aspects of the film, and is in itself almost as brilliant, with great writing, great directing and top notch acting from Jodie Foster as FBI agent (in training) Clarice Starling, Scott Glenn as her boss, Jack Crawford. Ted Levine plays a great villain as Jame Gumb. But of course, the crown jewel is Anthony Hopkins as the demonic cannibal madman Dr. Hannibal Lecter, who offers the key to solving the film's over arching serial killer mystery. As far as horror villains go, there are two kinds. The silent embodiment of rage: Jason, Michael Myers, xenomorphs, Leatherface. And then, there are the truly terrifying, intelligent villains: John Doe, John Kramer, the cenobites and of course Hannibal Lecter.

741,TheFilmGuru,The Overseer of HELL finds reason to climb MT. PURGATORY,10,3 September 2001,"My comment (may contain spoilers, if that is still possible) is focused on a particular reading of ""The Dantean Mind of Hannibal Lecter""; that is, based on the three novels by Thomas Harris and the three film adaptations, to date.Demme's excellent portrayal of the entrance, into Hannibal's labyrinthine Limbo, of our new ""Special Agent, Clarice Starling"" -- who is so unlike the permanently damaged ""Will Graham"" who'd originally captured Lecter [""Red Dragon"" ends on some disturbing evidence of corrupting influences by ""Dr. Lecter"" and his ""mindset"" (psychologically, a 'to the dark side' partial conversion is alluded to in the novel; not Michael Mann's flawed 'happy Hollywod ending' to his 1986 MANHUNTER !)] -- is simply, hauntingly stunning. My critical point about how 'the Jodie Foster character' conveys exactly that un-cynical combination of highly moral, ethically-beyond-reproach, innocence and 'purity' so very attractive to our Florentine aesthete and ""monster"" / for Anthony Hopkins' ""Lecter,"" will find it's fullest pay-off with Julianne Moore's street-wiser ""Clarice"" in Ridley Scott's HANNIBAL, of course. But, already in the 1991 SILENCE, the ""people will say we're in love"" trope of a COURTLY (""dark,"" to-be-sure !) LOVE affair between the politically naive ""well-scrubbed hustling rube with a little taste"" and a Nietzschean Uebermensch (taken to one logical conclusion Hollywood has never quite succeeded at before !), our ""psychiatrist"" of ""Chaos,"" is intriguingly presented for the very first time. The heroics of this sincere ""Special Agent,"" in that corrupt ""stale bureaucracy"" our consummate cynic, ""Dr. Lecter,"" contemptuously holds such institutions as the FBI to be, quite obviously resonates with Dante's view of the ""Donna Gentile,"" ""Beatrice"" -- too pure and noble for this ignoble world. Is it any wonder that the question is raised : ""Do you know Florence ?  That's the Palazzo Vecchio and the Duomo, seen from the Belvedere."" Indeed, ""a trainee"" with ""Such sweet decorum"" (Dante) and her special relationship with ""everyone's favorite, gentleman, genius, cannibal,"" might have made his quick capture in Florence quite a simple matter. If it were not for the 'functional illiteracy' one must suppose also the FBI-like institutions suffer under today. The manipulations of ""Clarice"" by ""that awful Jack Crawford,"" to bring ""Lecter"" out of his ""memory palace"" -- ""Memory, Officer Starling, is what I have instead of a view."" -- are clearly cynical attempts to get him to assist in their hunt for ""Buffalo Bill."" And if he'd condescend to do so, it would be because ""he did it to amuse himself."" Such is the understanding between this ""Behavioral Science Dept. Section Chief"" and ""Hannibal the Cannibal."" If he had noticed the Dantean ""contrapasso"" of 'poetic justice' Lecter's making ""multiple Miggs"" swallow ""that offensive tongue"" displays, there is no evidence of it.What is so impressive in both the novel and the film's (closest of the three) cinematic adaptation(s), is that there is a deeper, closer and more intimate, 'understanding' between Starling and Lecter at work. And it is the very ""straight arrow"" nature of Clarice's idealistic 'purity' which will forever spare her the unpleasant fatal visitations of Hannibal, after his genial escape : (although) ""I think it would be quite something to know you in private life."" ""I have no plans to call on you, Clarice, the world being more interesting with you in it."" He knows that, despite his enigmatic clues and help in getting ""Jame Gumb,"" Clarice judges herself ""with all the mercy of the dungeon at Threave"" (novel; Scottish ""Dungeon of the Supernatural"" with no escape), and her temporary respite, within the contemporary corrupt City-State of some Washingtonian Intelligence & Law Enforcement community, sleeping ""deeply, sweetly, in the silence of the lambs,"" will never long endure !She IS ""the honet in the lion,"" after all !

Truly, that is an immensely important aspect of this film's greatness, but it is but a fraction of what it has to offer. If Hannibal Lecter were replaced with some random mental patient with a fraction of the presence Lecter has, this would still be a great film. They basically made just that very film with Red Dragon. Do not mistake something left out of this review you may have heard is good about Silence of the Lambs to mean that I think it's overrated. Everything everyone says is good in this is likely to be at least interesting to any viewer. My intention in this review is to merely cover the less praised aspects of this film which deserve praise.The soundtrack does the work of setting mood impressively well. It gives texture to the entire film as a whole, ensuring everything feels bound together. It has a pleasant wallpaper quality where I couldn't list out my favorite parts or tracks from the score per se, but I can attest the film would not be the same without it. It just textures everything in endless atmosphere.Set design is incredible. Sure, you'd expect the serial killer Buffalo Bill's lair to be well designed, and it sure is, filled with both plot relevant items and completely irrelevant bits of eye candy that make perfect sense for such a killer to possess despite their irrelevancy to the plot. Would you expect the FBI training grounds to be the same, with every background shot having some fascinating insight into how FBI agents train? What about the lush bouquets in the funeral home that invite the viewer as well as the main character herself to leave the room and enter a flashback? How about the dozens of posters and cherished mementos in the room of Bill's first murder victim? Every room in this film is decorated as though it were going to be the focus of the film. No detail was spared, no shortcuts taken. This is a film that gets better every re-watch because of these details, as well as the layered consistency of its plot.The main character is really likable. She starts off as a bit of an enthusiastic blank slate, but a really complex tapestry of past trauma, wants, and present anxieties really comes to shine as the plot presses on. The most brilliant thing about this film's premise to me is that it's the perfect excuse to have characters teasing out the minute, near imperceptible facets that make the primary characters tick.In short, this film has a lot more to offer than one great character and a few great scenes. It has several great characters, amazing scenes, and setpieces that make sure the movie is never boring. It's always horrifying, or wonderful, or beautiful, or interesting. It invites you into this world of awful crimes, broken psychologies, and psychological masterminds in their prime. It's just an incredible film I can wholeheartedly recommend.",The Silence of the Lambs
745,Al_James,No film scares me like this one can.,9,17 July 2001,"This is simply the scariest film of all time. Piece together some of the finest suspense-filled camera shots, a creeping, slithering score, some cut throat dialogue, and two of the greatest screen performances EVER, and you have the basis for The Silence Of The Lambs.I know exactly why this film scares me so much. If it were not for this one ingredient, I would pass up this movie as just another psycho-thriller. But this movie scares me to my bare wits because of a character called Hannibal Lecter, and the virtuoso actor that is SIR Anthony Hopkins. It frightens me that there are people as sick and twisted as Hannibal Lecter in the world. It frightens me more that people as sick as him can be so intelligent and charming. And Hopkins makes me believe it. He makes me believe that Lecter could be real.I don't want to get sidetracked into giving Hopkins all the praise, but every time he is on the screen in this film, my hair stands on end, my back starts to sweat and my hands start to shake. The first shot of Hannibal Lecter, stood erect and tall in his prison cell, waiting for Clarice, will flash in my mind for years to come whenever the movie is mentioned.Foster is amazing too. Hopkins couldn't have been as good without an actress of her intelligence to gel with. She gives him just the right amount of respect while they share the screen, and this rubs off on her character. It is because of Foster that we are allowed to feel suffocated, frightened, almost ravaged by Lecter's intelligence, but equally intrigued by his knowleadgable and brilliant mind.Ted Levine is excellent also. It's a difficult role that he takes on in this movie, yet he manages to be as sickening and disturbing as he needs to be. This is no easy task when you compare his screen time to that of Foster and Hopkins.I can't buy this  movie. Simply because I buy movies to watch them alone when I have nothing else to do, and I can't watch this film alone. I symathise with Lecter too much, and that's probably what scares me the most. He enjoys exploiting people that are less intelligent than he is, and unfortunately, I can relate to that. The fact that I don't feel the urge to eat them is my only comfort.All in all, you will not find a more tense, intelligent, disturbing thriller than this. Having watched Hannibal recently, I realised just HOW good this film was. And what a waste Lecter is when he isn't using his mastermind to get what he wants, to play with people. It's a role that only one actor could truly 'get his teeth into', and in Silence Of The Lambs, Sir Anthony has never been better.If you're going to watch this film, make sure there's someone with you to hold your hand. Because otherwise you WILL forget that this is a film, you WILL become Starling, and Lecter WILL be truly in YOUR head too. And that's when the lambs start screaming.....",The Silence of the Lambs

It allows you, the viewer to fill in the gaps; giving you a peep into a world of depraved madness and letting you imagine the rest. Which makes it in turn such an effectively scary film.In much the same way as someone like De Niro or Pacino will create suspense through a simmering, measured agression, Anthony Hopkins' Dr. Lector delivers a veneer of polite and almost affable doctor which conceals a hideous monster within, waiting to surface at any point. This creates a great tension.Joined with this is the interesting relationship between the up and coming FBI trainee Clarice Starling (played beautifully by Jodie Foster) and the psychotic Lector who builds up (through a series of meetings regarding another serial killer) a kind of odd kindredship and mutual fascination.This film will always rightly stand out as one of the most iconic films of the last nearly 30 years.",The Silence of the Lambs
749,ModKuraika,Psychologically thrilling until you've fallen from your chair.,9,1 January 2011,"The Silence of the Lambs is a film directed by Jonathan Demme, adapted from the Thomas Harris novel of the same name. It currently stands (at the time of this review) as my favorite film of all time.The plot follows FBI agent in-training Clarice Starling, who is called in by Jack Crawford to get some inside collective information on the mind of a murderer by imprisoned, former psychiatrist Hannibal ""The Cannibal"" Lecter. Starling uses Hannibal's intellect to help track down the serial killer dubbed ""Buffalo Bill"".Starling is ambitious and keen, albeit somewhat naive. Lecter (my favorite film villain of all time) is intellectual, courteous, and classy. The more he and Starling interact, the more he learns about her, and affects her mind, all the while helping her figure out the identity of Buffalo Bill.Howard Shore delivers a chilling score that blends quite nicely with the theme and tone of the performances and pacing, similar to his great score in The Fly (1986).The film offers a brutally realistic aspect of the mindset of particular murderers. It's frightening, and Anthony Hopkins and Ted Lavine's performances in particular add a huge weight to the presentation. My favorite scene in the film is when Starling tells Lecter the story about the ranch and her lamb, explaining the title of the movie. As the scene progresses, the camera switches back and forth between the two, getting closer to Lecter's grim complexion every time it switched back to him. The scene represents Lecter's slow but deep integration into Starling's mind as he reads her further as she continues to talk.The climax is exciting and throws you for a complete loop. At the end of it all you just feel almost out of breath with widened eyes, no explosion required. Lecter can be antagonizing when he wants to be, vague, teasing, and observational. He does so much with such a limited amount of space, and is like a ghost when he escapes his confinement at last.The Silence of the Lambs is a character study, and a great one at that.",The Silence of the Lambs

751,aaronlmadden,Disturbing and powerful,9,26 July 2012,"Jonathan Demme's masterpiece stands out as one of the greatest films of all time. It is distinguished in every aspect. The direction, the writing, the acting... all superb. It captivates, disturbs, and fascinates the viewer. This is a film that plays on the senses; on fear, on imagination, and on emotions.The director's visual style paints a dark, bleak, yet colorful world that depicts the ugly side of humanity. The story itself is phenomenal. It is intriguing, unsettling, and is told so effectively. The cast is its strongest point. They are what make this film unforgettable. Anthony Hopkins is a powerhouse in this film, dominating the role of Hannibal Lecter, with his leering stare and his creepy demeanor.Yet there's a charm and wit that draws you in. You forget that he's a psychopathic killer. Jodie Foster is incredible. She gives her character so much depth. She disappears in her role with her subtle mixture of strength and vulnerability. Ted Levine deserves more recognition for his role as serial killer Buffalo Bill. He is so disturbing and appalling in this film. He gives a chilling performance. The scenes with Foster and Hopkins are undeniably the strength of this movie. Hopkins picks away at Foster's inner demons, forcing her to open up her troubling past. In exchange, he reveals more and more information on the identity of a notorious serial killer. Foster's desperation does nothing to budge Hopkins from his request, and her vulnerability is more and more present as their scenes progress. They are both remarkable in this movie.I highly recommend this classic if you've never seen it. It hasn't aged at all, in my opinion. The failed attempts at cinema today make this film even stronger today than it was in 1991. It is truly a masterpiece.",The Silence of the Lambs

Although some parts aren't for kids (as in Buffalo Bill and some blood), it's a good movie to see if you're home by yourself if you want to watch a mystery combined with adventure.

755,Joey_w7,Ok what LOOOOL,1,30 April 2020,"8,6/10? really?It took me months but i finally finished this movie!Why did i take so long?The first five times that i opened it i passed out cause they all sound like they're giving lectures when they talk(and most of the film is people talking miserably attempting to sound poetic).
The fifth time i played it i just stopped cause It felt wasteful to watch a movie where everyone is guilible like a 14 year old, and Hannibal is like a 16 year old bully.... who hurts their feeling with his pointy words and makes them do very intelligent and not dumb at all things like... Convincing a guard to release him? Lmaooo whaaat (the funniest scene was when they strapped his body head to toe to a chair and he still managed to snatch a pen 10 feet away from him... like ok what, at that point I was checking if I was watching the parody version)My imaginary girfriend made me watch it.and i did a research to find out what was special about it cause i really wanted to like it man, cause i wanted to understand my imaginary girlfriend's taste... like i really hoped she didnt just like it cause it's mainstream... cause that'd mean she's stupid and id have to break up with her..... OR the second scenario is that that im blind to some element of art that 90% of people can perceive, which would be strange cause normally i'm only blind to the 89%.So i went a head and did the research and ... apparently, what phases people is, hear this, ""the peculiarity of the characters"". you know? with the whole eating people and using almost 16th century theatrical phrases to describe simple things, that no one would use in real life.So im like ok thats it!
THAT'S what im missing!Im not really impressed by their words... Youtube comment sections have more resonance and cut deeper.
Not phased by their immorality......cause have you even seen what animes are up to?? they make eating human flesh look like ghandi.So basically this movie only appeals to snowflakes and feathers who are easily phased by immorality....Maybe ill read the book, cause my imaginary girlfriend, even though i realized that ill have to break up with her now cause she follows trends, she's still not the least artistic person on the planet.OH AND!! the serial killers are too scientifically incoherent in their behavior, which makes it hard to take them seriously... anyway the whole movie was a joke.THANKS FOR LISTENING PEOPLE!",The Silence of the Lambs
756,GayFrogMaiden,"A smart, and tightly directed psychological thriller",10,1 October 2018,"This film is really about alot of things, things that affect people, how past experiences can affect people in the long term, how destructive in nature we become when we are stuck in horrible situations, this film is a lot more than just a psychological thriller/horror film.
on the surface this film is your typical thriller, with a frightening killer on the loose, Clarice (played by Jodie Foster) Is tasked with hunting down this killer. But,
If you look past the surface level there is a lot more hidden underneath the surface, besides the brilliant building of suspense that never allows our main protagonist or the audience a chance to breathe.
The thing that really made this film for me was Hannibal Lector, (Anthony Hopkins), who steals the show as this character, keep in mind that he doesn't get a lot of screen time, but with the screen time he gets, he uses it to explore the human mind and the destructive nature of humans, through talking to Clarice, these are the best scenes in the film for me, these scenes are filled with tension, and create a lot of insight into what makes a human, human.
On the technical side of things, the cinematography adds to the atmosphere and makes the film that much more claustrophobic and disturbing. The soundtrack adds a lot to the film, which again adds more to the incredible atmosphere this film has. 
Claire, (Jodie Foster), is our protagonist, she shows her struggle as a human, as she tries to leave her past behind, but realises that its not easy to let go of the past. This is created through the lambs. *Spoiler section now*, here we go. 
So during these scenes with Hannibal Lector and Claire, they talk out about the lambs, he says,""Have the Lambs gone silent yet?"", symbolising her past, and how it can never go away, no matter how hard she tries. Its symbolised this way because, Claire hears screaming in the middle of the night, she tries to let them out, but they just stood still, therefore, breaking down the title of the film and what it means. 
The Silence of the lambs challenges its audience with deep subject matter, while also presenting it in a much more unique way to other thrillers, it gives you hints to look deeper into the film to discover more about this film, with its deft direction, stunning camerawork, brilliant score and absorbing performances, The Silence of the Lambs is a great example of how to make a suspenseful, and creative psychological thriller.10/10",The Silence of the Lambs

758,colindrayton,A ugly disgusting film with MANY flaws,3,8 August 2020,"When I watch a film, I don't care about the story or the characters because no character or story has ever interested me. Instead I focus on the things that matter like the acting, special effects, the scenery and the cuisine. There's a lot of things that can go wrong with those 4 things, I always award a film 10/10 if they get all those 4 things PERFECT. But this film was a disaster, the acting was unrealistic, made me depressed to the point I cried with all that unnecessary emotional weight in the acting as well as making me wet myself with fury. The special effects looked like they came out of the Middle Ages, the scenery was bland, overly American, too modern and too dark for my taste. The cuisine was terrible, it made me sick when Hannibal drank red wine because it looked like blood and he drank it like it was human blood.The actresses were very sexy though, I couldn't see many flaws to complain about in the actresses but there was too many males so I couldn't get aroused constantly due to the lack of women in this film. I would prefer if this film was about an English woman hoovering up a carpet and debating about whether it was evil of her to kill all those insects that were bound to of been killed by her hoover, whilst she eats a roast dinner with the film camera constantly zooming in on the roast dinner all the time.

Sir Anthony Hopkins' performance as Dr. Hannibal 'The Cannibal' Lecter is truly haunting. His demeanour throughout is terrifying.Jodie Foster is brilliant as Clarice Straling.

So finally, I rented it from Blockbuster, expecting good things, because it won 5 Oscars, has Jodie Foster(who has since become my favorite actress and dream wife) in it, and it's notoriety. I got more than I asked for. Jodie Foster plays Clarice Starling to the ""tee-est"" of ""T's"". Young, beautiful, determined, brilliant, vulnerable. Hopkins scares and intrigues me simultaneously, amazing how I would never want to be in the same room as Hannibal Lecter, yet would not mind terribly if he sat down next to me on a park bench. Hopkins calculated every movement, every speech, and basically brought Hannibal Lecter to life in which maybe no other fictional character has been brought to life, made a part of human consciousness. In 2010, he will face Keyzer Soze for the title of the most feared movie villain ever. This and ""Fatal Attraction"" have the distinction of being the only two films to ever scare me, frighten me, seriously unsettle me.

It truly at its heart is an actor's film.  The camera is always right next to there noses so they are forced to look right in the lens and the result is one of the most thought provoking and brilliant pieces of film ever made.  Many will never forget the scene where Lector (Brilliantly played by Anthony Hopkins) is talking to Clarice (Jodie Foster) about why she ran away from here uncles home.  The filmmaking is so tender and so beautiful that you almost don't notice how great the film really is.  It is a scary film, and a touching film an unlikely mix when you talk about a cross dressing serial killer and a cannibal.  Claurice is so innocent and so confused not one person can't relate to her, Jodie foster gives the performance of her life and pushes the viewer to new heights of humanity and fear.  I love this film aside from Coppola's `The Conversation' I think this is the best suspense film there is.  It offers so much in every aspect, artistic and entertainment.  The cinematography by Tak Fujimoto (The Sixth Sense) is as humanly oriented as it gets, the way that camera `walks' and zooms is sort of how the human eyes work.  All these aspects are in the film so finely that it almost is hard to acknowledge it is there.  Jonathan Demme has since made a film that captivates its subject matter as well as this one. The characters are metaphors themselves, film and criminal investigators have all agreed that Claurice is a lot like the serial killer Buffalo Bill, which they both are searching for what they want and what they are.  They are a lot alike I must admit, they are different in their physicality towards there desires obviously.  The film is a piece of fact that of which `Saving Private Ryan' is.  It is not true in its narrative but in its background facts it is completely factual.  Hannibal Lecter is haunting and almost unrealistic but then again he is supposed to be.  He is so polite and so snooty that he is evil.  This film is just brilliant, that's all there is to it.  In all of it's amazing scenes it truly gives the best acting of the 90's.  This film may never be surpassed as one of the greatest horror/suspense films.  This film does so much on so many levels, beautiful acting, great direction, screenwriting, and its thought provoking cinematography.  It's sequel Scott's `Hannibal' does not offer the same depth charge that `Silence' offers,  the film falls to much around how Hannibal is an evil cannibal and he is gonna get you.  `Silence of the Lambs' is a brilliant scary film that will never be forgotten.",The Silence of the Lambs
783,crisp_morning_2004,A gripping film that well deserved its Oscars,10,11 August 2006,"It is a creepy and taken-by-storm experience with the film, background music is darker than the film itself and too ominous, plot is brilliantly constructed, conversations are thought-provocative, to crown the whole, Jodie Foster and Anthony Hopkin are the cream. They take ownership of Clarice and Hannibal respectively, transforming them into the most unforgettable screen images.The psychological path of Hannibal is hard to trace. He is so odd a mixture of intelligence, cruelty, insanity, grace and charisma. In the depth, fledgling FBI trainee Clarice is no match of him. She is still naive yet very ambitious. On the trail of the serial killer Buffalo Bill, she's sent to interview him, a psychiatrist-turned-cannibal. Hannibal is willing to provide clues to finding the killer but only in return for personal information about Clarice herself. He calls it Quid Pro Quo. In those mind games, the two dance backward and forward between cannibal and FBI agent, mentor and student, psychiatrist and patient, father and daughter. It is Clarice who breathes life into the multidimensional sophisticated psychopath and Hannibal who nudges the aspiring student FBI agent and helps her achieve her first success in a world of Y chromosome where her guru Crawford uses her, embarrasses her, excludes her; Doctor Chilton regards her no more than a simple-minded woman and tries to flirt with her. Frankly speaking, though no lack of other impressive scenes, it's really the nerves fights between Hannibal and Clarice that carries the film.Some of the horrible scenes involve Buffalo Bill who, a transvestite, skins his victims, especially woman victims. But the most terrifying one is Clarice's single-handed trace in Buffalo Bill's gruesome den, which also has become another irony to the self-important testosterone-dominated world. Crawford's misjudgment and stubbornness makes him out of the right track, a special anti-terror deployment resulting in vain. But Clarice, though excluded from the business which she should be on, still holds onto her intuition and through on-the-spot investigation finds the serial killer at last. She has to take on him herself. (Demme uses ""deceptive cutting"" there to enhance the tension.) It is definitely a life-or-death fight, especially when Clarice is in the dark, groping her way in absolute terror. I have no doubt everyone holds the breath when the film rolls to that part.A gripping film that well deserved its Oscars",The Silence of the Lambs
784,rodneyrude01,Brilliant,10,3 September 2002,"Never forgetting the first time i saw this film, after having just watching it again, i was reminded of how much of a brilliant film this is. After reading the book a year ago, i was amazed to see how much was included in the screenplay, which is a rarity for many adapted films. Although the book is 500 pages long, writer Ted Tally was able to include every detail to make it one of the best adapted screenplays ever.In terms of the actual film, it is flawless. The performances are superb all round with Foster and Hopkins giving their much deserved oscar rounds. Without a doubt, the most accolades go to the director Jonathan Demme, who by his skill, has crafted one of the best modern day thrillers along with David Fincher's Seven. With a surprisingly simple style of direction, his choice of povs, tracks, freaky closeups and making actors stare down the camera all accumulate to create an unnerving yet awesome anchor to Harris' story. Although Demme has been quiet since, He has taught many amatuer filmmakers and major directors that flashy direction is not appropriate all the time.Special mention goes to the editor and composer. After watching the escape sequence and Starling's entrance to Gumb's apartment, editor Craig McKay cuts tension filled sequences that keep you on the edge of your seat. With this and along with the expert, furious pacing, this film never wastes one second of screentime. Howard Shore's subtle and ominous score fits the mood perfectly and makes an excellent contribution to the film.Being a filmmaker myself, many other people and myself admire the sheer talent and craftsmanship in this film and with big expectations for Red Dragon in October, I hope Brett Ratner and co. will do the Thomas Harris book justice and take notes from this thrilling masterpiece.

Well researched, there are minimal flaws to ruin the credibility of the gruesomely graphic files of both the cannibal Lector and ""Buffalo Bill"".Ted Bundy, Jeffery Dalhmer, Clifford Olson, and lately Robert Picton have exposed the world to the sensational world of the serial killer.  The media exploits the stories of these demented murderers as the consumer watches in disgusted amazement.Silence of the Lambs showed a somewhat accurate, yet oversensationized view of the takedown of a mysterious freak of society.  The killer, first portrayed as an unknown to his victims, makes you feel vulnerable, like it could be anyone.

On a humanistic level, I prefer RED DRAGON, for its marvelous payoff at the end and for its humane characterization of the villain (played by Ralph Fiennes). But back to THE SILENCE OF THE LAMBS. Despite its grandeur, there is a huge flaw in the script. Yves Lavandier has expressed it well in his book WRITING DRAMA.Remember. To help Clarice understand Buffalo Bill's mentality, her superior (Scott Glenn) suggests she visit another serial killer, Hannibal Lecter (Anthony Hopkins). Lecter is reputed to be fiendishly manipulative. Clarice is warned by her superior: ""You tell him nothing personal. Believe me, you don't want Hannibal Lecter inside your head."" The warning is clear-you do so at your peril. Soon afterwards, we learn that Lecter has driven the man in the next cell to commit suicide. And it is very clear to us that Clarice will need to be extremely cautious. When Lecter, at their first meeting, asks her questions about her private life, we feel concern. When, at their next meeting, Clarice starts to talk about herself, we fear the worst. But nothing happens-Clarice opens up but suffers no consequences. Her superior's warning and Clarice's subsequent attitude do not lead to a payoff.I was disappointed by this unkept promises since it represents a lost opportunity for further conflict. But there is more to it than that. If the writers had established a close link between Clarice's confidences and Lecter's subsequent break-out-the former contributing to the latter, for example-not only would the film have gained in rigour and unity of action, it would also have shown more clearly that in order to catch one dangerous psychopath, the FBI trainee has been obliged to allow free another, much more dangerous psychopath. In other words, the powerless of American society would have been demonstrated more convincingly.Another missed opportunity.",The Silence of the Lambs

Thus, starting a relationship between Lecter and Starling. Not a love relationship, a personal info relationship: Starling must reveal secrets about her past in order to get Lecter to talk.

I thought that Hannibal Lector sounded like a really cool character and of course I anticipated excellent film-making with the sort of praise it has received.I saw it, and I would say that as far as movies like this go, it is excellent. But for cinema in general, Silence is unremarkable and, really, given the hype and awards, ultimately disappointing. Jodie Foster was good, but she is haunted by the slaughter of a lamb from her childhood? Ridiculous. Anthony Hopkins was great. I think he deserved his award, though his performance is overrated. Not exactly a very complex or hard to portray character...The story was not particularly exciting. It was fairly clumsy and failed to capture my attention. I was repelled by Buffalo Bill but not interested in his character whatsoever. I watched the movie for the rare encounters with Hannibal Lector, and the search for Buffalo Bill was an uninteresting but necessary backdrop. Also, how on Earth would the FBI bring a SWAT team to a house that is a false tip, that is hundreds of miles away from the killings...? It makes no sense - they completely ignored the evidence and conclusions they had already made. And so, when the so-called thrilling doorbell scene took place, I was not surprised. Of course he's not in Chicago. Ridiculous.I can honestly say I enjoyed Lector's escape. It was clever and suspenseful (if a bit illogical) and to some degree makes the movie.And is this movie scary, as has been said? No. Definitely not. The serial killer is creepy, not terrifying. Hannibal is intriguing, but not too scary. I've heard of people not sleeping for days, others having horrific nightmares... I don't understand it.This movie is worth watching if you like thrillers/serial killer/ kind of movies, but if you go into this film expecting a great piece of cinema, some groundbreaking technique or idea, or a thrilling scene or two as I did, you will be disappointed.

Anthony Hopkins is very good too, although at times I feel he overdose it a bit. The camera angles are generally very simple and, along with the score, combine to give a creepy feel.

797,tk-93740,Stellar casting/acting and great cinematography,8,18 September 2018,"I thought Anthony Hopkins and Jodie Foster did amazing work with their roles in this film. One scene in particular I'd like to note is the last time Clarice talks to Hannibal in person, the framing of Clarice's face between the bars to make her feel isolated, and the intense zoom on Hannibal's face to make us uncomfortable was just done very well in my opinion. I also liked how Clarice sat in a chair when she talked to Hannibal to set that power dynamic, Hannibal towered over her when he spoke. Another aspect of Hopkins' performance I want to talk about is the stillness of his head when he speaks. I don't know if this is unique, or even worth talking about, but I loved how when he spoke, only his mouth moved. His eyes were unblinking and his head was still as stone. I also thought Hopkins' appearance was absolutely perfect for the role he was put into. Great casting. I didn't like the lack of depth put into Buffalo Bill's character, however. I feel like there was a very one sided approach to the way they showed us this story. We only really saw Clarice's perspective, we only saw Bill in like, two scenes really. The one where he kidnaps the senators daughter and the very few where he's talking to her (I can't recall her name). He was also portrayed as just being completely insane, but when the detectives were talking about him they seemed to believe he was intelligent and good at what he does, but he was just mentally deranged whenever he spoke to the senators daughter, so I feel like Bill's character is the weak point of the film that made me drop the rating a little bit.

This is one of the few times I felt differently!  Jonathan Demme's adaptation of Thomas Harris' Silence of the Lambs is quite literally the most suspenseful, perfectly cast, exceptionally scored thriller in years. Kudos are due largely to the extraordinary performance of Sir Anthony Hopkins.  (To be truthful, even hearing him narrate this year's Grinch movie gave me the willies - imagine Hannibal Lecter in Whooville!?!).  Hopkins is delicious in his portrayal of the imprisoned doctor and Jody Foster's Clarice Starling is the perfect blend of intellect and innocence.  Both the tension and their rapport is instant and the sequel ""Hannibal"" will sorely miss this - Clarice will be played by actress Julianne Moore.  The screenplay was so true to the novel ( - agreed -  condensed as required - but true none the less).  My only complaint is the casting of Scott Glenn as Jack Crawford.  Unfortunately Glenn seemed a little too 'spit and polished' and a little less haggard (remember in the book he had nursed his terminally ill wife as well as made finding Lecter a crusade).  A more world-worn Nick Nolte may have satisfied my appetite better (no Hannibal pun intended).

I like Anthony Hopkins as an actor but he was hamming it up as Lecter and made the charcter look cartoonish rather than scary. Jodie Foster gave a good impression of a woman trying to reverse out of a parking space.
What surpised me most about this film was that it won several Oscars including best film. It's obvious to me now that the people at the Academy know less about film than most five year olds. Remember when Kramer v Kramer won best film, that was the year Apocalypse Now was released and who can remember the former?I've learned my lesson since then and have avoided Oscar winners such as Titanic and The English Patient. Silence of the Lambs is an above average thriller but no work of art. The plot is also absurd and goes for cheap thrills with the usual gore and when Buffalo Bill gets his kit off you simply have to yawn, it didn't shock me.

There is a mad person who is trying to kill people someone and a detective who needs to find out who he is. Silence of the Lambs partially follows that idea, but with a genius twist.Instead of making the killer the main villain in the story, they chose to give that role to Hannibal ""The Cannibal"" Lecter. And that was the best choice they could make. Hannibal is a very intelligent and calm characters and the way Anthony Hopkins played the character is just perfect. That little smile, the way his eyes are fixed on people, his very calm voice -no matter watch the situation is. All those aspects make him so intimidating.Another aspect that makes this movie so great is Clarice Starling, played by Jodie Foster. She is the detective that has to find the killer and for that she needs Hannibal's help. She understands that she can't come too close to Lecter but her curiosity and objective need her to. Every time these two characters are together you just feel something is going to get wrong eventually but you also know that there really isn't any other way. Also Clarice is a perfect way for the viewers to understand what is going on. She is a rather young detective and new at the job which makes her very relatable character for the viewer.The intensity created in this movie just by the way characters talk to each other is amazing.

Let me say that it was just now that I finished Silence of the Lambs, and I moved directly onto Hannibal, the sequel. Can anyone tell me if Manhunter or something like that (an 80s movie) is an installment to this series? It seems like it would be, but I've stumbled upon many that have the same kind of title, or the same characters that have absolutely nothing to do with the intended film (i.e. Halloween II) Aside from my banter chat, I believe this movie was excellent and I regret not wanting to watch it earlier.

808,torturedsoul,Disturbing but exciting,10,21 June 2001,"Silence of the Lambs has got to be the greatest Thriller ever made. Hands down. It is so good. The acting is perfect, the camerawork is perfect, and the story is perfect. Can a movie be better than this? Yes, but very rarely is a movie better than this. Hannibal Lector is one of my favorite movie characters ever created. He is brilliant and he is psychotic. He is what every person has nightmares about in their dreadful dreams. He is what wakes people in the middle of the night and physically forces them out of bed to take a cold shower. Hannibal Lector is the epitomy of everything that is evil. Lector is the type of man that would make you vomit and make you smile at the same time. If you listen to every word he says, you will see the definition of ""genious"" spill out all over your mind. I think Hopkins deserved more than an Oscar for his perfect acting as Lector. That is how well he acted in that role. Of course Jodie Foster was great as Clarice Starling, but Hopkins steals the show. If you want to see a movie that will stand the test of time, watch Silence of the Lambs.I give it an A+++++++++++",The Silence of the Lambs
809,chimpanzee_boyuk,Bloody amazing! An excellent film,10,24 December 2006,"I never really got off on this film until first saw it whilst on holiday in a hotel in New York. I didn't get off on it at first but then my parents bought it on DVD. I saw it again and I just couldn't take my mind off it! Hopkins is delicious as Hannibal Lector with his amazing acting and brilliantly menacing speeches. You can't help that there is a monster just waiting to appear from Hopkins. I just couldn't help laughing with amazement. However, one of the biggest breakthroughs of the movie is probably Ted Levine as Jame Gumb (Buffalo Bill), playing the main psychotic serial killer. He has a way of playing the part that you is so mad that it is excellent.Despite this, I don't really understand or believe the stories of people fainting in the cinema at the film's release in 1991. It is a horror, yes, but not a film worth having a nervous breakdown. Even so, it is and excellent piece of acting and film making, a great way to start the 90's; 10/10!",The Silence of the Lambs

The story-line is boring and stringy, very much NON-VIOLENT and really really drawn out stalking scenes.I will give credit to the FLAWLESS acting though, Jodie foster and Anthony Hopkins were Outstanding. I really feel that more could have been done with this movie than what they did.The main reason people like this film is because its a ""psychological"" thriller, implying that if you dont like this film you are considered dumb.(which is not the case).This is a very overrated film...very overrated but its worth seeing..so you can say ""I have seen silence of the lambs.""

813,translator_of_t,Never forget Starling and Dr.Lecter...,10,22 January 2010,"The acting is brilliant! Especially Dr.Lecter played by Sir Anthony Hopkins. He's absolutely the best movie's villain I have ever seen. Although he was just in the movie for less than 17 minutes, Dr.Lector will scared you to death. Believe me, you'll never want to meet him during waiting for the bus or in the elevator. And Jodie Foster did a fantastic job in Clarice, an FBI cadet who tried to catch a murderous serial killer. To do that, she had to face Dr.Lector, an even more murderous and psychotic killer. She maybe one of the bravest heroes I've ever seen, along with Indiana Jones (who maybe better, I don't know...). Dr.Lector and Clarice are unforgettable and haunted. You'll never forget them...And I have have to say about the direction too. Jonathan Demme deserved his Oscar. For making his audiences' heart to jump out many times. This movie should be considered as a horror. Because the way it was made and directed made it even more scary than a normal horror. Trust me, you'll want to watch it twice. And if you like this film, I also recommend Mysery and The Game. Have fun with your watching!",The Silence of the Lambs
814,xbabe82517,"Brilliant masterpiece, and utterly unforgettable!",10,18 June 2003,"A few years ago I tried to watch The Silence of the Lambs but there were many distractions and I was unable to follow it properly. Having had Red Dragon delivered to me accidentally (my own fault, through not cancelling the order) and thinking it was brilliant, I decided to invest in The Silence of the Lambs. And I am delighted that I did. It is the best psychological horror/thriller I have ever seen, and Anthony Hopkins is undoubtedly one of my favourite actors, especially after seeing his first class performance in this film. He has such presence on-screen, a real intensity, and fantastic chemistry with his co-star Jodie Foster. He completely underplays his character, largely only talking for the majority of the film, yet you cannot help but watch him in awe when he is on the screen. I also found - and I'm sure others did too - that I was unable to hate Hannibal Lecter. Despite what he has done, and seeing what he is capable of, Hopkins's portrayal of him makes you think that somewhere inside him he is capable of feeling, and his developing relationship with Clarice shows this. What also makes The Silence of the Lambs exceptional is it's surprising lack of violence and gore. There is only one scene that some may find disturbing (but it had to be in there somewhere!), but other than that it is the gripping storyline, and the wonderful acting that keeps you glued to the screen. The Silence of the Lambs does not need to rely on the cannibalism issue to interest people, and when you think about it, the film is not really about cannibalism. Hannibal Lecter is a serial killer - oh, and he's got a taste for cannibalism as well. Perhaps the only reason it is remembered so much for this is because - in my opinion - no other film has managed to use this subject in an effective way. There would be nothing entertaining in seeing bloody, gory images of someone cannibalising someone throughout an entire film. A good storyline is needed to make this kind of film work, and that's exactly why it does work - it's brilliant in every way, and I cannot fault it.",The Silence of the Lambs
815,SolNigerWithin333,Decent movie but WAY to overrated,1,13 April 2015,"Came into this movie expecting to be scared out of my wits by Anthony Hopkins (Hannibal Lecter) performance; a pretense resulting from many many top 10 lists of ""Chilling performances"" or ""Best movie Psychopaths "" boy was I let down. For the 90s it may have been unique and freaky, but i really couldn't attain what all the constant hype is about, yes there are some tense moments here and there but Lecters character is really inconsistently acted out for half of his screen time. Don't really believe in being pretentious in this context but if you payed attention to Lecters dialogue you would see one moment he is a to the core amoral being who does not feel one iota of sympathy for humanity and the next he is interested in some rookie FBI agents childhood and not to mention infatuated enough to create art pieces of her, excuse me if i am mistaken but this is a chronic sociopath who eats humans. I don't know if you've watched interviews with psychopaths or insane persons but i can assure you none of them behave the way Lecter does and please spare me the ""but that's what makes him so different and ""good"" "". The writers who came up with Lecters lines got way too artsy by letting their creative exhibition blanket the brutal reality the character was meant to portray. Lecter was intriguing and enigmatic for the first few minutes of his appearance but his mysteriousness and guise got completely obliterated as the writers gave too much away too quickly leaving nothing to further entice the viewer on the central character. Other major detractors regarding Lecter included the scene where he escapes a HIGH SECURITY complex SURROUNDED by ARMED and TRAINED personal which was supposedly ""blocked off for 10 block"" or something along those lines, keep in mind that Lecter had been locked in a cell for 8 years straight, talk about muscle atrophy right? the man suddenly had the strength to scale fences and walls while avoiding only a couple dozen patrols...Buffalo Bill was just a medium for the movie creators to include shock material: close ups on his nipple ring, full nude frontal shot, dialogue of him saying he wants to copulate with himself and something about putting the lotion in the basket? the effect of that sentence was much more profound in South Park. Buffalo Bill was not even minutely interesting or relevant it just seems they added him their just to fill in some blanks and add in some really ""ewwy"" moments. The ending scene where Lecter calls Starling is just a redundant and rubbish attempt to further strengthen the absolute awkward bond between relationship they had and also I'm guessing they wanted an excuse to include Lecter again before the credits rolled, I'm not sorry to say this but the only decent thing about the ending was when Lecter commented he was going to have ""dinner"" with his past captor. The characters in this movie were just very poorly written and implemented, the acting was believable but thats not even 1/4 of what makes a movie ""good"". I know i missed out on Jodie Fosters character oh and could i go on but i really feel likes there are enough negatives here to indicate just how overly high rated this movie is . Lecter could have been portrayed so much more ferociously and searingly through presence and psychologically alone rather than having mens extremities ripped off or them beaten to a pulp. Joker from Christopher Nolans movie is probably the epitome of an antagonist with an unstable mental state (no I'm not a 13 year old emo who's favourite is unquestionably the joker) and i might even mention the main antagonist from I Saw the Devil that is also a very raw representation of how a psychopath might function in real life.The Buffalo Bill character could have been implemented more naturally as opposed to having it seem like there are two points of focus in the movie (Lecter and Bill). The movie really needed to end on a much more satisfying note and don't get me wrong i have seen plenty of films where the ending is ambiguous but Silence Of The Lambs was just the protagonist receiving a phone call at a party and Lecter walking off into a crowd of people as Sarling sobs i mean come on it would have been better to just end it after Bill was slain. I would give the movie 1/10 to ever so slightly balance the overall score but 7/10 for having some depth and substance to it despite being majorly overrated and just a mediocre film.",The Silence of the Lambs
816,gameplacereviews,Fueled by it's atmosphere and great performances The Silence of the Lambs is a horror masterpiece,9,21 May 2014,"The Silence of the Lambs Director: Jonathan Demme Starring: Jodie Foster, Anthony HopkinsI honestly feel bad sometimes for the people faint of heart. Not in an insulting way I just do. I love movies that can scare me and some of the greatest are great because of creepy atmosphere that creeps up on you and grabs you and throws you into a world where everything is mysterious and scary. This is one of those movies. Dr. Clarice Starling's (Jodie Foster) tale of finding the killer Buffalo Bill with the aid of the cannibalistic Hannibal Lecter (Anthony Hopkins) is a creepy, well acted, and not for the faint of heart film that has many thrills in store for the viewer. The greatest thing that this film has to offer is the atmosphere. It's engrossing. The dark hallways,and the unblinking eyes of Hannibal Lector shake you to your core. That alone without the well done mystery could make the movie. Oh, but it is a good mystery. Jodie Foster is Clarice Starling a new FBI psychiatrist who is ordered to interview the cannibal Hannibal Lecter (Anthony Hopkins) for the purpose of finding a killer. Foster's character is optimistic and more upbeat. This is good because of the dark nature of the rest of the film. She's kind of like the balance for the creepy stuff happening, and light in the darkness. That also kind of help her character. See she's optimistic at first, but as time goes on she seems to fall deeper and deeper into this world her character changes to someone more hardened. This is perfect character development. Then there is Anthony Hopkins. This is one of my favorite performances of all time. He is unblinking,scary and smart. It's unsettling. Hopkins said that the way he played Hannibal Lecter was still. I now know why. See people are always moving and doing something. Lecter is completely still and extremely soft spoken. Even more menacing is that Lecter is actually smarter than Clarice. He outsmarts her. This just adds to the fact of how menacing he is. He's not the villain though. The real villain is a creepy transvestite murderer named Buffalo Bill. His story arch is interesting, but it comes to an abrupt close. He is scary none the less and is also a little weird. I mean a transvestite who I'd rather not write it. It's messed up and the details will shock you. The actors really do drive the story and everything comes off very shocking and convincing. For better or worse.The acting is really good,but so is everything else. The production design in this movie is grounded in reality,but still is creepy. The prison set that was built for the film looks very good and the darkness of the whole this adds to the atmosphere and makes everything pop. The camera-work is good, but also nothing special, yet at moments the camera having a staring contest with the wide eyes of Hannibal Lecter add to the sheer unsettling nature of the film.This is overall an incredible movie. Scary, atmospheric, and chalk full of performances that are Oscar worthy (and won Oscars). I give The Silence of the Lambs a 9.8 out of 10 Seriously though it's really messed up.",The Silence of the Lambs

The plot is unique in that FBI cadet Clarice Starling has to investigate the brutal murders of the Buffalo Bill serial killer by using the specialist advice of incarcerated serial killer Dr Hannibal 'the cannibal' Lecter. Sir Anthony Hopkins is that good as Lecter that you forget that he's not actually the main villain in the film, which makes his escape all the more shocking, and he brings a new layer to the character that Brian Cox was slightly lacking. Jodie Foster puts in another top of the range performance as the aforementioned, toyed with FBI cadet. Yet she manages in certain cases it seems to hold her own and even rattle Lecter. Jonathon Demme's direction is very good as he always keeps a sense of realism in the film without holding back on the shocking moments. This is a very deep and dark thriller that shouldn't be watched by people with nervous dispositions.

I was waiting for you...It´s wonderful to see how a movie can determinate a style, and change the perception of horror films in so many ways.Clarice Starling, FBI student, is told to have some interviews with a cannibal psycopath called Hannibal, in order to find about psycophaths´s psycology so they could find a serial killer called ""Buffalo Bill"". But Hannibal will talk to Clarice only if she feeds his sick curiosity. Clarice will face her fears, and will also face an intelligence and evilness that don´t seem to be human.It has been the third film that has got the five most important Oscars: Best picture, director, actor, actress and script.One of the best things of the movie is the constant feeling of danger until the end titles. That´s mainly because of Anthony Hopkins, as Hannibal: he IS Hannibal. When you look at his eyes, you can see nothing but an intelligent killing machine. And that´s scary, boy. The sensation of facing someone evil and so intelligent that he could be ""God"" is one of the scariest feelings anyone could ever have (although it has never happen to me, thank God). But that´s too because of Jodie Foster, as Clarice. She IS scared. She really is. She is scared because Lecter sees through her head like he could see though a window. She is scared because a person´s life depends on her (the woman ""Buffalo Bill"" kidnapped). She is simply scared of looking him at the eyes.The mood is wonderful and creepy, even sick and macabre, it´s perfect for the film.Demme did a marvellous job directing the actors. The script has absolutely no line you can dislike.¿The best of the movie? Well, the dialogues between Hannibal and Clarice. They´re full of energy, of power, spinning inside a countdown. He enjoys the power he helds on Clarice, mental power, he likes humilliating her, because the recognizes every one´s weak point.¿The worst?

My writings for this is backed by results- the United States Academy Awards. They gave this film Best Picture,Actor, and Actress (and other awards as well). Anthony Hopkins deserves 20 Oscars from the Academy for his magnificent work for this piece of cinema. I also believe Hopkins could have won for The Edge or Meet Joe Black. However, I somewhat disagree with Jodie Foster receiving an Oscar for this film because her West Virginian accent wasn't that well executed by the actress. This film is a true classic and I would highly recommend that you rent this film if you want to be afraid. Hannibal Lecter (Hopkins) is like no other horror movie character that we have seen in film before. I found Hannibal's style, words, mentality, and his plain creepiness to be one of the best horror characters ever written or acted!

828,laughter_continues,Cannabilism vs. Humanity,9,4 October 2002,"Anthony Hopkins, as we all know, is a remarkable actor. A man with charisma and intelligence. When Hopkins plays Dr. Hannibal Lecter, the audience will quickly refer to his off-screen character, but without the part of him biting people. Jonathan Demme took us to a spine-chilling journey, unsolved mysteries by a potential killer, and an intelligent man who is danger to everyone around him shows a young woman to the killer. Both Hopkins and Foster took in roles that ultimately showed them the true experience of a case, that significantly refers to murders. But this case really gave nightmares to everyone. This film did not at all show terror and gore which made it unbelievably scary. If you think that horror flicks today are scary, think again. Classic films to me are more horrifying and they give me nightmares. So choose carefully with the right horror film you want to watch. Enjoy them.",The Silence of the Lambs
829,farfromperfection,Silencing the Lambs,10,4 June 2004,"**Deemed spoilers**No matter how many times I watch this film, I always get the deep sense of brilliance taken from the first time I watched it. This is certainly one of the better films of our generation - In light of the a-typical ""horror"" movies of today, Silence of the Lambs is in a considerable class of its own. Although gruesome in parts, it perfectly balances the sense of fear and psychological reliance's the different characters have upon each other. The play between Lecter and Starling (Hopkins and Foster) is a duo that rarely is seen on screen, and was utterly plausible. Starling walks into Baltimore as a trainee FBI agent (and as others have commented before me, this perhaps is the only bone of contention, the reality or lack of henceforth of a training agent being assigned to the case) and you feel she leaves Lecter's cell a completely different person. Relenting all the pressure people have hyped around Hannibal ""Cannibal"" Lecter she reaches him with no airs and graces and willingly accepts the feat. The relationship develops into something on a level of trust, Clarice recognising Lecters needs and desires, and when he escapes towards the end of the film she is aware and sure he will not come and find her. This is the kind of rapport they built up during the movie, almost the blind leading the blind. Lecter had a sense of dependency on Starling as much as she had upon him, although she to a more extreme extent. Hopkin's and Foster play the characters with absolute precision and to this day I know anyone else having been cast in those roles would have not found themselves anywhere near the on-screen chemistry (platonic, of course) that the aforementioned actors had. Hopkin's is in a class of his own as the mentally inept yet frighteningly intelligent Lecter and Foster is equally magnetic as the vulnerable, shielding Starling trying her hardest to face the horrors in front of her. Her reliance on Lecter is more than just meets the eye - Her main priorities were to deal with the ""Buffalo Bill"" case but you can see having spoken to Lecter on numerous levels she took a sense of knowledge and experience out of it. The connection on an emotional level was fantastic to watch, especially as Lecter purges out Starling's memories of her troubled youth. Foster, in particular, played this part wonderfully.My favourite scene is most probably when Clarice is visiting the home of one of ""Bill's"" victim, and whilst looking around the rooms she notices the closet, adorned with fabric reading in dress making. Realising what Bill is doing to his victims (and without trying to give too much away) she immediately phones HQ and the desperation in her voice as she tries to articulate her discovery is the first in many climax's the film offers.Behind the clear thriller sense of the film and the tendency to sit on the edge of your seat (the first time you watch it, you will have a completely new concept of a ""thriller/horror"" movie, especially if you are seeing it for the first time from here forth) the stories of the character weave so well together and as well as enjoying the build up of suspense, you also come to appreciate the characters themselves. In my humble opinion the prequel and sequel of Silence of the Lambs didn't get near what this 1991 excellence gave to the audience. A definite 9/10.",The Silence of the Lambs

And the idiocy of a main character whose parents named him Hannibal and he just happens to grow up to become a cannibal. Really? Sounds like an idea Chester Gould would have discarded as corny and unbelievable.While Jodie Foster displays no personality at all, Anthony Hopkins gives an outrageously hammy performance that would make Donald Pleasence wince. In fact, Hannibal Lector eats so much scenery in this film, how could he possibly have any room left for people?The reaction to this dog after I saw it was truly amazing - and very depressing.

His Oscar-winning portrayal of Dr. Hannibal Lecter is one of the best performances of all time, and AFI actually listed him as the #1 villain in their top 50 heroes and villains list. There has never been a more creepy, scary, and at the same time, fascinating character before or since The Silence of the Lambs was released. The closest I've seen is Heath Ledger's Joker in The Dark Knight.As great as Hopkins is, let's not forget how the great the film is as a whole. Jodie Foster was outstanding as Agent Starling and she even won an Oscar for Best Actress in a Leading Role for her efforts. The film is also beautifully directed by Jonathan Demme, who also won an Oscar. For those counting, The Silence of the Lambs won five of the biggest Oscars, the other two being Best Picture and Best Writing/Screenplay based on the previously published novel of the same title by Thomas Harris.The Silence of the Lambs is one of the best films of the last 25 years and it is one of those films that any fan of great films must watch at least once in his or her life.",The Silence of the Lambs
832,samkrainak,brilliant!! great minds think alike! be ready to enter world of two human monsters.,10,16 November 2005,"A brilliant dark thriller. It shows how evil and dark the human mind can get. Out of all the 5 awards it won Mr.Hopkins deserves it the most, who better to play an evil psychotic genius then him.When Lector talks to her at his cell in museum with camera up close to his face that must be seen in the theater. Some may not reallies that Stariling is also a innocent pretty sparrow, and that Clarcie Starling is the same. We see Lecter as the deadly monster, in two scene's's when Chiltion explains the physical safety measures taken when visiting Lecter. When Crawford quotes""just do your job Clarcie, and never forget what he is."" We also see Lector walk along his cell at the museum following Clarcie as she is being haled away, he walks as if he were a tiger pacing in the cage. The moth was especially nice touch, because on the movie cover on DVD and VHS the moths head has seven naked women that create the moth's creepy skull. The women represent ""Buffalo Bills"" six victims and Kathren the seventh whom he abducts. When Starling dream of her trying to save a lamb its like way she is trying to save Kathren. The movie title is very unique for a dark creepy film. if you don't have a clue about the film and only heard the title you would wonder what kind of movie it is. would horror,dark, thriller come to mind. You might think its take place on a farm, (in some respect yes) or sweet loving drama? romantic drama? or a comedy? doubtful. Who would suspect it was creepy movie about a young FBI trainee,a brilliant and infamous psychopathic serial killer locked away, and a deadly serial killer on the loose. Be ready, its a thriller about two brilliant powerful minds , one good one evil, as the good has to match the evil, to find a human monster on the loose of unspeakable evil.

834,williambertram,My favorite psychological thriller of all time,10,17 October 2020,"The silence of the Lambs is director Jonathan Demme's 1991 movie adaptation of Thomas Harris's eponymous bestselling novel. It is the story of FBI recruit Clarice Starling's pursuit of the deranged serial Buffalo Bill. To catch Buffalo Bill, Starling must enlist the help of serial killer and former forensic psychiatrist Dr. Hannibal Lecter.The movie opens with recruit Starling (Jodie Foster) running the obstacle course at FBI headquarters in Quantico, Virginia, working hard in her spare time. Many of the movie's opening scenes reinforce Starling's dedication to being accepted by the FBI and the many obstacles she faces, such as institutionalized sexual harassment and a police force that is reluctant to accept female cops.Jack Crawford (Scott Glenn), director of the FBI Behavioral Science Unit, and recruit Starling's presumed boss-to-be sends her on a ""routine"" errand to Baltimore State Hospital for the Criminally Insane. He needs a new face to interview Hannibal Lecter (Anthony Hopkins), ostensibly, to gather data for a new database of serial killer psyche profiles. It seems Lecter has tired of Crawford's staff and now refuses to talk to them.Cut to the next scene, and Hannibal Lecter's caseworker Dr. Chilton (Anthony Heald), leads Starling through a dramatized dungeon and gives her the ""rules of engagement"" for the interview with Dr. Lecter. It's clear Dr. Chilton views Hannibal Lecter as his ""big fish"" and resents Starling withholding the finer details of the interview from him.Starling's interview with Hannibal Lecter is one of the most famous and chilling scenes in movie history. Very few (if any) performers could have conveyed the tasteful, almost delicate side of what Dr. Chilton refers to as a ""true psychopath"" so well. Dr. Lecter insists on a cultured protocol of manners, mutual respect, and honesty, and if he doesn't get it, he might eat your liver with a side of fava beans. Lecter gives Starling well-timed glimpses of the brutally insane animal beneath the cultured facade and inexplicably decides he likes her.Will Dr. Lecter help Clarice to save her lamb?The silence of the Lambs is one of the best-acted movies ever made. In addition to the ""top of their game"" performances that I've already mentioned, Ted Levine gives Anthony Hopkins serious competition for the ""best portrayal of a serial killer in this film."" The Silence of the Lambs has no bad performances.I have not read Thomas Harris's book yet, but The Silence of the Lambs is at the top of countless ""best psychological thriller"" lists for a good reason. As far as movie plots go, this is one of my all-time favorites. Tension is built from scene-to-scene until it reaches an almost unbearable climax, and the few passive scenes are almost more tense than the active ones. The Silence of the Lambs grabs you from the opening scene and doesn't let go until the credits are rolling.The Silence of the Lambs also features one of the best-regarded soundtracks ever made. Composed by Howard Shore and the legendary Munich Symphony Orchestra, the score is beautiful, urgent, and technically brilliant. I have listened to this soundtrack on its own on many occasions. Each of the tracks is perfectly-placed within the movie, driving Jodie Foster's fast-paced investigative scenes and exploding during major scenes, Hannibal Lecter's grande finale in particular.Director Jonathan Demme earned his place in movie history with The Silence of the Lambs and the film's five academy awards, including Best Picture and Best Director. The film is nothing short of a masterpiece, thanks in no small part to Jonathan Demme, who passed away in 2017.Whether you are in the mood for a horror movie, psychological thriller, something to watch for Halloween, or just having trouble finding something to watch on your streaming service, it's hard to beat The Silence of the Lambs.",The Silence of the Lambs

I read the book first, so I knew what was going to happen, but the movie was still an amazing experience for me.The camera work was amazing. That must not be underlooked, but that was most definitely not the only reason that it was perhaps my favorite movie of all time.The acting was amazing. Anthony Hopkins was the perfect choice for Hannibal, and I think that the best performance OF ALL TIME was given by him in this movie. He also worked perfectly with Jodie Foster, and she worked perfectly with him. Not even Einstein could have created better chemistry than what went on between those two. When Clarice was interviewing Hannibal, I started shivering in fear. And as the movie went on I kept on getting more and more scared.But the acting would not have been so great were it not for the plot itself. The plot was scary and thrilling in itself.

It shows the problems we face as society when we neglect trans americans. As buffalo bull is trying to find his inner self, the film shows great attention to how people treat him as a lunatic.

No one in the cast sees the qualities of Clarice Sterling (and she has many - one of them being best of the class). The only person (different from the audience) that acknowledge the qualities of this women and sees her by itself and never less than any other man, is the maniac and psycopath homicide. And by this, you automatically love Hannibal, even if he is a serial killer that eats his victims. He doesn't have preconcepts between men and women, although everyone else in the society has.
This only upgrades the confidence of Clarice along the movie, and she overcomes her mentors' one by one in the investigation. The same ""mentors"" that judge her for their sex.
This is why we ""fell in love"" with this 2 characters, because they see the things from another different perspective, although being completely extreme. It makes us think: how can a maniac eat his victims and still thinks that a woman is at the same level as him? How can the thoughts of a maniac/homicide being the most correct on?

Silence of the Lambs answers that question in a chilling and disturbing way.  Through a smooth script, clever directing, and superior acting, SotL is a thrilling ride through the mind of the common serial killer. Script 10/10- SotL has a very consistent plot with all the twists and turns that make any thriller great.  Ted Tally does a terrific job at telling the story from the serial killer's point of view. Acting 10/10- The acting is indeed the movie's strongest point.  SotL wouldn't be so good if it weren't for Foster and Hopkins, who work so well together.  Nobody else could have made Clarice Starling and Hannibal Lecter such a dynamic duo.  You can't forget to mention the supporting cast, either (especially Ted Levine, Scott Glenn, and Anthony Heald). Directing 9/10 Jonathan Demme does a fabulous job at pointing out what the actors need to do.  He sets the tension up and can easily put us at the edge of our seats. The cinematography is also flawless, because all the close-ups he does lets us see the emotion on everybody's face.  My only complaint?  Sometimes the lighting effects bother me a little. Other 9/10 The score is great, the editing is very smooth, and the set designs are also decent.  Costumes and makeup are exceptional (especially the human mask at the end).  All the technical aspects do wonders to make SotL more authentic Overall 10/10 This is the best thriller of the 90's and is appropriate for those looking for more than an ordinary slasher flick out today.

The 1990 critical and commercial success Silence of the Lambs was never a film I even considered viewing. However, after sweeping the top categories at the 1991 Academy Award (Picture, Director, Screenplay, Actor and Actress) I admit I had to reevaluate. Still an actual viewing of the film did not occur until after 2000. Yes, I was scared, and slightly horrified, yet completely captivated by the superior filmmaking. This film is a tour de force. Anthony Hopkins embodies the character of Hannibal Lecter to perfection, each syllable spoken with intent and hidden meanings. A monster, yes, but a brilliant one. In later films his Hannibal becomes almost a cartoon of the original, but in the beginning this man could send chills up and down your spine. Jodie Foster finds the perfect balance of innocence and steel determination trying to impress her superiors, but also following her gut instinct. Throughout you can feel her struggle to be accepted is what motivates her though never spoken it is apparent through her true skill as an actress. There are no dull moments this film keeps moving, not letting the viewer become restless and feel ahead of the story. There are displays of horror, blood, violence and true moments of tension, but they are not included for shock value, but integral to the mood the film creates. Every viewing I find something new to be intrigued by, whether it be a camera angle or a supporting player I hadn't paid much attention to in the past.

Jodie Foster is amazing as Clarice Starling, a F.B.I Trainee that has to track a Serial Killer Named Buffalo Bill who is skinning woman across the state. In their desperate search to catch this monster, They turn to Dr Hannibal The Cannibal for help. Hannibal is himself a serial killer, and a brilliant one to boot. Always outsmarting his doctors and snubbing his nose at authority, Hannibal turns Clarice's plead for help into a psychological game of cat and mouse that not only puts insight in the case at hand but puts insight into Clarice's own fracture past as well.

I've seen it enough where I can now quote it line by line, but the very first time I saw the movie in its entirety, I was stunned. I was blown away. I continue to get that feeling even now when I watch for the 25th time or so. As a whole, it is such a though provoking movie. Think of the plot of Se7en, the Departed, Pulp Fiction, Inception - they all make you think and really understand the movie. To me, Silence of the Lambs does that better than any other film in history. Not to mention how great Jodie Foster as FBI trainee Clarisse Starling and Anthony Hopkins as Dr. Hannibal Lector/Hannibal the Cannibal. When you watch this movie, don't take it for its goryness and horror. You have to take it for its deep meaning. The moth, the biggest symbol of the movie, as Dr. Lector says ""represents change"".

Yes, Jodie Foster and Anthony Hopkins are outstanding, but the other 3 Oscars are way overpriced. No way it is in the league of One flew over the cuckoo's nest - both movies won 5 Oscars (film, director, script, leading actor and leading actress). It just doesn't compare.So I began to search for a reason, and part can be attributed to the poorer quality of films produced that year. But the most part is the conservative attitude of the Academy itself. JFK was the big winner for me with all it 's thought provoking acting, lighting, filming and script. Other films overlooked are cape fear and the fisher king. Especially now that a lot of us are complaining that both directors (Martin Scorsese and Terry Gilliam) haven't received an Oscar yet.-since my the original writing, Scorsese has won the Oscar for best director, the departed.-And let's not forget the script written by Ted Tally. After reading the book itself I can't help thinking that he copied the book itself with a piece of tracing paper and cut some minor parts out. There is hardly any change made. But maybe this can be attributed to the writer of the book - Thomas Harris. Surely Talley's effort can't justify an Oscar. Incidentally: Ted Tally hasn't written anything that can support this ""big effort"", any guesses why...The Camera style that Jonathan Demme uses doesn't seem to work for me. The straight in the camera that he uses to intensify the situation is just not right, it's just forcing the situation. He uses the same thing in Philadelphia, but to my opinion that film is overrated as well, although not as much as this one.I give it an 7 out of 10.

As a secondary antagonist, he was somehow able to make the film feel about him rather than our main characters, and steal the show with his magnificent performance and brilliant escape.The film excelled in its direction and is now universally used in most film academies as an exemplar on how to demonstrate power dynamics using the angles, dialogue, lighting and tone.This is a staple in almost all of cinema and will always be widely appraised because of what it was able to accomplish.",The Silence of the Lambs

865,Brian-268,An overrated but sporadically very good suspense thriller,1,20 May 2000,"That the film has its moments cannot be denied. Hopkins is slightly over-the-top as the diabolical yet urbane Lecter, but it's an enjoyable performance all the same. Lecter's finest moment is when, bound, straightjacketed, and face-masked, he is brought before Senator Martin and, after relentlessly goading her about the fate of her daughter, blurts out the identity of Buffalo Bill and adds, ""Love your suit.""Beyond the superficial appeal of a character who can interject such misanthropic witticisms, Lecter embodies the repulsive seduction of this thoroughly erudite monster, utterly free of societal constraints in spirit if not in body. His intelligence is, if remorseless and amoral, open and searching and methodical. We are time and again shown his superiority to the FBI, who rush hither and yon after clues they don't begin to understand, and to the pettiness of his jailor, Dr. Chilton, who subjects Lecter to televangelist broadcasts as punishment for brutal misbehavior.Yet Lecter is poorly contrasted throughout the film, and his intelligence is falsely elevated by comparison to the unimaginative mediocrities he is up against. Starling is a dreary feminist with a white trash inferiority complex, Dr. Chilton is a preposterously snide asshole, and none of the other characters rise above their status as plot devices. There is something particularly prim and humorless and unlikeable about Starling, and it is impossible to determine why Lecter would take an interest in her childhood trauma about lambs.Several points regarding Lecter's escape make no sense at all, and at crucial stages the total incompetence of his captors is required to pull it off. That Hopkins manages to keep the suspense going is a testament to the actor's ability to rise above the script. Regarding the ultimate capture of Buffalo Bill, it is too much to swallow that Starling's success hinges upon uncovering photographs in the victim's abandoned bedroom years after it had been scoured for evidence by FBI agents. This twist hangs one ridiculous premise on another and is a sorry attempt to justify Starling's centrality to the story.The cinematography and direction do contribute something interesting to the tumultuous descent to Lecter's asylum cell, but are otherwise unremarkable. Buffalo Bill is more bizarre than chilling, and the final confrontation between him and Starling is contrived. The film ends on a note that suggests it could have been alot better.Warning: If you purchase the DVD of THE SILENCE OF THE LAMBS, resist the urge to listen to Jodie Foster's commentary. While the lambs may be silent, it is next to impossible to get her to shut up. Her grating, man-hating (and totally outdated) style of feminist rhetoric comes close to self-parody, although not often enough to be truly entertaining. Conclusion: this über-bitch is a gaseous windbag. But if you don't believe me, listen for yourself.

871,factualnatural,"Amazing Script ,Amazing Acting",10,1 July 2006,"Silence of the Lambs has perhaps the best script translation onto screen I have ever seen. Jodie Foster and Anthony Hopkins mix so seamlessly in this psychological thriller that it pulls you in farther than you expected a movie could do. It won numerous awards, and for good reason, it simply put is in a league all its own. Hopkins performance as the now infamous Dr. Hannibal Lectar is perfect. A psychologist genius, who eats his patients is detained in the insane ward for life due to his total threat to society. Meanwhile one of his old patient's lovers (Buffalo Bill) has become a serial killer pursued by Jodi Foster/the FBI recruit. Only Lectar knows the identity of the killer and has the mental aptitude to elude the FBIs questions long enough to enjoy the numerous conversations between him and Jodie Fosters character Clairice. The true terror of Hannibals character, genius and cunning , is contrasted by Buffalo Bill who skins his (female) victims after holding them hostage for days. This film gives you interesting glimpses into the FBI's pursuit of a serial killer, putting you in the shoes of an investigator piecing together a puzzle in order to save a young womans life. This film is purely psychological, and extremely clever with subtleties that most people who have seen the movie have never caught themselves. Examples are the numerous hints Hannibal gives in very unconspicous ways about the killer Buffalo Bill. The movie has a couple big twists that are hard to see coming among all the SUPERB acting and dialogue. One of the more memorable scenes are of the Buffalo Bill home and torture levels below ground that seem to go ON AND ON forever. It almost looks like he'd been living down there since the 60s or 70s and never moved junk around..very cool prop work. I just can't say enough about Hopkins performance...finally, a SMART villain. Amazingly, Silence of the Lambs proved that the scariest villains aren't supernatural but could be the people next door.",The Silence of the Lambs

873,vanalosswen,Could have been better,4,7 June 2007,"I'll confess, I prefer reading a good book to seeing a movie. There's something about the way the words come alive in my head that will always beat out even the best of movies. But when a book I love is turned into a movie, I have to see it. Call it morbid curiosity if you like; I always wonder if the story will survive the transfer from book to movie and if the director will be true to what the book does. Sometimes, the transition is better than other times. Lord of the Rings was spectacular. This moviewas not, I'm sad to say.I think the fault does not lie with the actors, at least not entirely. Anthony Hopkins shone as Hannibal (how could he not?), but his scenes were handled badly. The scene that stands out for me as the worst in the movie was, unfortunately, the first meeting between Clarice and Hannibal. This is most unfortunate because that particular scene is one of my favorites in the book. I wonder if the director actually read the book this movie is based on. To the director: with all due respect, Hannibal is a gentleman. He would not shout for Clarice because gentlemen do not shout for women as if they were dogs. According to the book, he called her name repeatedly as she was walking away, and only her desire for advancement brought her back. Also, this scene was horribly abbreviated, as were all the other scenes between Clarice and Hannibal.Part of the blame is on the shoulders of the director, but Jodie Foster in the role of Clarice must take some of the blame as well. There were moments when she made Clarice shine, and I saw in her face all the strength and courage that I loved and admired in the book. The final showdown, however, ruined it for me. Jodie may have won an Oscar for this performance, but I suspect that those who decide on those awards never read the book. Jodie showed good emotion, if the director asked for fear. Shaking hands, fast breathing, fumbling for bullets, the whole spiel. But that's not the character of Clarice. In the first place, Clarice was at the top of her shooting class; she'd practiced taking her gun out of its holster four thousand times (according to the book). She was smooth in her draw, not fumbling. In the second place, Clarice doesn't show fear. She's fully aware in the cellar that Buffalo Bill could be around every corner, and being a female and showing him fear is giving him the advantage. She knows that. According to all I've read in the book, she knows how to control her fear.Now, I'll admit, I'm biased about this movie because I love the book. And there were moments when there was a definite shine in the movie: Crawford was brilliantly good, and while Jame Gumb was a little too retarded, he did well. But what made the book brilliant was sadly lacking. I'd never buy this movie.",The Silence of the Lambs

Then when we learned of 'Red Dragon', i was worried that the studios were only in it for the money.  And yes, they were.  Be that as it may, Silence will always be the first thing to come to mind when we hear the names Anthony Hopkins, Jodie Foster and even Hannibal Lecter.  The others will be forgotten whereas this true originator of the Hannibal Lecter series (minus Manhunter) will always be remembered until film reaches its end.

The relationship between Clarice Starling (Jodie Foster) and Hannibal Lecter was the thing that made the movie so interesting for me cause you never really knew until the end of the movie what the relationship exactly was.The part of Hannibal was very interesting for me because he was very smart man that despised live itself and his brutal ways of killing.

885,pieintheface,Nothing Short of Spectacular,10,1 June 2003,"Silence of the Lambs is a modern day classic. That is all anyone can say about it. From the day it hit theaters, this was the movie that defined the psycho-serial killer drama. Even more, though, the movie is able to escape the horror genre and explore other themes, which is perhaps the main reason it has garnered as many accolades as it has. In recent cinema, I cannot recall another movie that had won the top five awards at the Oscars (Picture, Director, Screenplay, Actor, and Actress) and all deserved for that matter.The movie still keeps me on the edge of my seat every time I watch it, and believe me, I've watched it numerous times. The best part about it is that I find new things to marvel over every time I watch it and the special features on the DVD version enlighten me to even more exciting new things. This was the role of a lifetime for Jodie Foster. In fact, Foster's portrayal of Starling was a pivotal part of the movie. Her humility and vulnerability contrasting with her strong convictions and go-get-em attitude created the perfectly believable character. Her role as a young FBI agent separated from her male counterparts opens the door for gender analysis as well. Furthermore, the chemistry between Hopkins and Foster was so strong that it created the `Beauty and the Beast' relationship originally intended by author Thomas Harris.It's hard to pinpoint exactly what is so remarkable about Demme's film, other than that it's just a good movie.

890,jade-howells,A thriller that never fails to grip you after multiple watches,9,1 October 2017,"*Very slight spoiler within the second paragraph, and big spoiler in third* Silence of the Lambs is a must watch for thriller fans all around, with a story that will entice you within the chase to catch a serial killer.The plot involves Clarice Starling (Jodie Foster) trying to catch a serial killer with the help of Hannibal Lecter (Anthony Hopkins), another serial killer already captured with insight into the case. The dynamic between Clarice and Hannibal is enthralling, with Clarice working through Hannibal's cryptic clues about the case and witnessing the growing interest Hannibal has in Clarice, especially as more of her personal life gets revealed to him and we have to wonder what he will do with the information he has obtained.The tension within this film has to be one of the biggest strengths of the film. Every scene with Hannibal and Clarice has you feeling the tension as you become enthralled within every interaction. Special mention also has to go to a scene near the end of the movie, which I will just refer to as the ""night-vision scene"" which manages to make me worry for Clarice every time I see it despite knowing what will happen at the end.One criticism of the film I have however is with Hannibal's involvement within the movie and how it's presented. The movie presents him as an intelligent and extremely manipulative and dangerous person. However, it seems like he only knows anything about this case because he just so happens to know about the serial killer and details about him already, so rather than him showing his intelligence. If you wanted a film which actually sees him working out who the serial killer is, then Red Dragon is probably the better film within this one instance. In conclusion, Silence of the Lambs is a fantastic film, and certainly one of the strongest entries within the Hannibal franchise (this and the Hannibal TV show are neck and neck in quality), and the strongest within the movie entries.",The Silence of the Lambs

Recently re-watched it, and had a more critical opinion. 1) What was the deep inner turmoil that Starling was suppressing all those years? That she saw a lamb get slaughtered on a farm as a young girl? So what??? 2) Did she REALLY surmise ANYTHING from the ""clues"" he gave. Seems she somewhat randomly stumbles onto his house. 3) Too many closeups; too many plot contrivances. Nearly every scene is a closeup shot. Adds intensity at first, but quickly becomes annoying. That Lechter could uncuff himself from behind with the tip of a pen and overtake the two Keystone cops, not very believable. Less believable that he was ever placed is some makeshift iron box in the middle of a library or gymnasium. 4) She chases him down into his night vision dungeon? C'mon!!

It has never left popular culture still heavily influencing films today and is instantly recognisable from its many references to famous movie quotes.Apart from the really impressive performances by the entire cast (who literally all bring their A-Game), The Silence of the Lambs greatest strength is that it doesn't wallow in depravity, given the nature of the book and the screenplay, wisely choosing to keep a lot of the grisly violence off the screen which makes it even more terrifying. The film is a character study into the minds of two psychopaths and the young rookie cadet trying to match wits with them.The dialog is still snappy and sharp as ever and the first part of the film is very procedural and slow moving (although no less absorbing) but once the second half kicks in, with a fantastic bait and switch twist it becomes a roller coaster ride of pure unnerving tension as the young cadet finds herself alone in a mad man's dungeon trying to save his next victim.I saw the film in theatres and vividly remember people hiding underneath their chairs the films tension was so unbearable in its climax. Of course we have been desensitised in the intervening years since this film released so some may look upon the film today and not understand why it frightened so many people upon release but you have to remember no film from this genre had played cat and mouse with its audience the way this film did back upon release, so it caught everybody off guard.Absolutely brilliant stuff, highly deserving to be in a class of only three films to ever win all five major Academy Awards and easily in my top 5 films of all time.",The Silence of the Lambs

I taped it, and watch it every chance I get.I did not get the scares that you would normally get from a thriller, but from the movie, I got the emotion of each character, and the suspense that made it simply irresistible.The plot for this movie is outrageously original. You don't just get one serial killer, you get two for the price of one. Dr. Hannibal Lecter (Anthony Hopkins) is so spine-tingling and ominous, that it is hard to imagine how he could of been a psychiatrist. Clarice Sterling (Jodie Foster)is the perfect choice for THomas Harris, the man who wrote the novel, to have chosen for a mission such as the one she is facing in the movie.Buffalo Bill (ted Levine) is disturbing as well. He has contributed one of the most famous lines from a thriller into pop culture: ""it rubs the lotion on its skin, unless it gets the hose again"" The acting is so realistic, that you can hardly believe that this is not really happening, but it is actually playing out in front of your eyes, almost as if its true.

Through Hopkins' performance, Hannibal Lecter becomes more scary than Dracula, Wolf Man or any other monster in movie history. Lecter is the proof that the greatest horror comes from the mind. It is not the though of Lecter coming into our house in the middle of the night and eating us that is scary, its what he can do just by looking and talking to us. That evokes true fear. Hopkins is so affecting, he alone gives this 7 stars. But thats not to say the rest of the film is weak. Jodie Foster redefines the heroine as Clarice Starling. She is head strong and...............vagina sure? I suppose that would have to suffice as cock-sure. Starling is also weak though, and its a testament to Fosters' acting chops that Starling doesn't just swoon at Lecters speeches, but rather fires back equally acidic comments at him.

Maybe its just a thing I have with seeing the movie first). I'm not saying the book wasn't good, but I'm more of a visual person, so watching the movie a second time was all the more interesting and just as suspenseful.I swear, Anthony Hopkins is the creepiest human being portraying Thomas Harris's Hannibal Lecter. He isn't exactly the main character, for that spot was taken up by Jodie Foster's portrayal of Clarice Starling, but he fascinates just as well. I was more afraid of Hannibal Lecter than the actual problem in the film, Buffalo Bill; that's how fantastic he played his part.After watching this movie about three or four times, I finally decided to buy it on DVD!

The Silence Of The Lambs has an edge to it that's quite exceptional, but its central core is more memorable not for what it says but for how it says it. And here Demme's almost spiteful humour is at least as important as Harris' balefully brilliant seriousness.",The Silence of the Lambs

Jonathan Demme is at his absolute best here building suspense and tension into a blend of physical and psychological terror rarely matched in film.But, the reason this film works and kicks so much ass has everything to do with its stars: Jodie Foster (Genius) and Sir Anthony Hopkins (Knight). The chemical reaction that takes place between these two on screen is so palpable and acidic you find yourself hardly able to watch.Their dynamic is what sets this film apart from any other serial killer/horror/suspense/thriller ever made.

908,omophagia-2,"For once, the Academy wasn't entirely inaccurate!",10,25 March 2000,"When most novels-- the ones worth reading, at least-- are converted into films, the results are, in most instances, vastly inferior; on rare occasions, the movie adaptations equal or even surpass the creative impact of their written forms._The Silence of the Lambs_ is one such film. Though it is quite different from Thomas Harris' widely revered novel-- and I will refrain from elaborating upon these differences because everyone should, at some point, sit down and read Harris' finest work-- the film is no less an artistic triumph.The strength of _The Silence of the Lambs_ is in the tense interplay between Jodie Foster's Clarice Starling and Sir Anthony Hopkins' Hannibal Lechter. The rapport between their characters is both riveting and bone-chilling in its intensity, and the thought of lesser actors tackling such scenes is perhaps as frightening as any of this masterful film's horror. Their performances are the driving force behind the film.Jonathan Demme's direction is also first-rate. Though the score is occasionally too obvious and overpowering, his decisions-- from sweeping camera pans to tightly framed close-ups-- are generally wise, and they give the film the uncomfortable atmosphere needed to create the dramatic tension that sustains the viewer's interest through to the movie's unsettling climactic scenes.Easily one of the best films of the 1990s, a decade characterized by extravagance, _The Silence of the Lambs_ is sufficiently daring, while managing a certain restraint within all of its elements-- the intelligently-composed screenplay, Demme's direction, and the ensemble acting-- that allows it to transcend to an artistic level far above most every other film of the past ten years.RATING: 10 out of 10. It's not entirely perfect, but _The Silence of the Lambs_, with its unrivaled intensity and passion, epitomizes the psychological thriller genre. A decade from now, it will be considered a ""canonical"" film with the likes of _Citizen Kane_ and _To Kill a Mockingbird_.",The Silence of the Lambs

Jonathan Demme directed very well: he knew what to do to feel claustrophobia in the prison-scenes, and to be afraid when we are in the house of the serial-killer.

How justice itself revolves around the concept of murder just like being an adult involves the symbolical need to murder ones parents. (Symbolical murder of the idea of parents is needed for the idea of parents as actual separate people, other adults.) One cannot have a view on justice without a willingness for a symbolical murder of injustice.Where in Clarice Starling do we see this soul of a murderer that is supposed to be depicted in this story? Nowhere. Because the story of ""The Silence of the Lambs"" is not included in this movie.

The whole idea of putting two maniacs in the story, where dim twistedness of one of them is hardly a match to a brilliance of another, is refreshing. The story develops well and has more than a couple of grabbers on the way. One of the personal highlights is a cellar scene-music works just right,getting tension to almost unbearable level.

I don't have to say much more.  I give this movie a 10/10.",The Silence of the Lambs
917,vikramas1109,The American Nightmare,10,18 March 2009,"So I recently had a conversation with a friend who is ten years younger than me about the relative merits of the new wave of horror thrillers and remakes (Last House On The Left, The Hills Have Eyes, Halloween, etc.). She is a fan of the genre but remarkably she hadn't seen this film. We watched it together and she was understandably blown away. ""That might be the most tense climax I've ever seen on film!"", as she put it. I figure moving into Hitchcock is the next logical step, but I digress.It's still amazing to me that the Academy deigned to recognize a psychological thriller that opened in the first quarter of 1991, and not only that but made it the third film ever (and so far the last) to sweep all 5 ""major"" awards. But the appeal of Silence of the Lambs has little to do with its critical accolades. This is a film with deceptively subtle themes, a brilliant screenplay and superb direction, and two of the most outstanding performances in film history. All thrillers since owe a debt to SOTL and probably could learn a thing or two about the power of sustained tension and suspense from it, instead of the ""gotcha"" sensibility of modern horror.The story follows Clarice Starling (Jodie Foster), a fresh-faced FBI agent with obvious ambition, as she becomes involved in the case of a serial killer named Buffalo Bill. Bill has a predilection for skinning his victims, and other bizarre character traits which become apparent later. He is also exceptionally smart and due to a lack of evidence, the FBI can only glean a pattern of his crimes but nothing about the man himself. In desperation, her boss Jack Crawford (Scott Glenn) suggests that she seek insight from another notorious killer, Dr. Hannibal Lecter (Anthony Hopkins). And that's when everything is really set in motion.One of the most overlooked aspects of SOTL is the buried symbolism of America. Director Jonathan Demme and his DP Tak Fujimoto use heavy reds, whites, and blues all throughout the film. Sometimes, the tinted effect emphasizes tension; other times, danger. Aside from the opening training sequences in Quantico, you'd be hard-pressed to find many well-lit bright shots. A key scene in which Bill takes another unsuspecting victim is foreshadowed by that victim singing Tom Petty's ""American Girl"". Location and colloquial dialects of many characters are extremely important in highlighting American culture. There is definitely an ""only in America""-type of recurring motif. If The Godfather represents The American Dream, SOTL is The American Nightmare.Another brilliant choice that Demme makes is to use a lot of closeups with no camera movement on Clarice and Hannibal. He trusted that his two actors, with such compelling facial expressions, could handle the material and they don't disappoint. Much has been said about both Foster and Hopkins' work here so I won't repeat much, except to say that Starling's vulnerability vs. Lecter's unflinching, probing gaze is one of the fundamental reasons that the film sustains so much pressure and both actors are marvelous in some excruciatingly emotional scenes.Finally, the screenplay elevates the material to that of a classic. Consider how strong a character Clarice is. She is not submissive to her superiors, who initially dismiss her talents because she is a female with no real experience. However, though she starts out as a timid, passive agent her strength of will and perseverance shine through and eventually HER efforts lead to the resolution. She also refuses to succumb to Lecter's psychological torture, and that is why he finds her so intriguing and continues to push her deeper and deeper into her rawest emotions. Rarely has there been such a well-developed, strong female lead in all of film history. On top of all that, the screenplay affords equal time to Buffalo Bill, a decision that makes him all the more interesting since we see and learn of his process, methods, reasons, and true brutality. The night-vision climactic standoff is so effective precisely because we truly care about Clarice and genuinely fear for her safety if she fails.In short, instead of watching the high gore, low impact crap that passes for a good horror thriller these days, you could do much better and see one of the most effective and revered movies in the genre. With edge of the seat tension, powerful imagery and a chilling masterclass of acting by Anthony Hopkins (in only 16 minutes of screen time!) along with great work by Jodi Foster, Silence of the Lambs is rightly considered among the best of its kind. Now if you'll excuse me, I'm having an old friend for dinner...",The Silence of the Lambs

The story is only so-so, with a few logical holes. For example, why should one serial killer be able to understand another serial killer better? It really makes no sense to me. The acting is good, but nothing special either. I believe it is only so very popular because it broke one of the last taboos (cannibalism) in a mainstream movie. But that is not enough for a good movie. I admit I am a bit old fashioned about movies; for some things it is better if they are not shown but only hinted at.

920,JSValentine,Stunning and unforgettable cinema,10,4 March 2015,"Now over twenty years old, Silence of the Lambs is still one of the most intriguing films ever made. Ambitiously blurring the lines between the genres of horror, psychological thriller and crime drama, Silence is intense but not overpowering, and complex without ever losing sight of its grand narrative. As with all great films, many components come together to create a masterpiece; excellent screenplay, directing, cinematography and musical score to name but a few. However for me, the acting is what makes Silence the unforgettable experience that it is. Jodie Foster's portrayal of the young and inexperienced FBI agent instructed to investigate the actions of a serial killer is as flawless as acting can be, inspiring many later performances from actresses in similar roles, and providing the audience with a first person narrative to stabilise some of the more horror-centred segments of the film. Anthony Hopkins' performance as Hannibal Lecter is equally magnificent. Despite appearing in less than a quarter of the film. his combination of intensity, calculated calmness and slow-burning character development without ever truly revealing the character's true history or even motivations, the audience is presented with, in my opinion, one of the greatest psychopath film characters of all time, breaking stereotypes of violent and out-of-control villains and creating something far more terrifying.It is the lack of prolonged scenes of graphic violence, blood and torture that give Silence its edge over almost all other horror films. It is unassuming when watched for the first time, and slowly becomes increasingly fascinating, impossible to watch and not become totally immersed into this world which is, after all, the real purpose of fiction. A timeless classic that will never lose its terrifying yet understated charm or relentless quest to redefine chilling and breathtaking cinema, this is a film that the viewer will dwell on long after the credits roll.",The Silence of the Lambs
921,dogancelik17,My Reviews about The Silence of the Lambs,10,23 May 2013,"Because of The Silence of the Lambs comes some much needed identification for the horror category. It is a first-rate production all around. It boasts a witty and dramatic script based on the Thomas Harris novel, full of great lines. It has marvelous direction from Demme. Demme creates suspense very well throughout and uses some great directorial shots such as the twin frames of Clarice ringing a doorbell and the FBI men breaking into a home. The two lead actors won Oscars for their performances...each deserved. Foster is very good in her role, but it is Anthony Hopkins that literally lights up the screen with his complex portrayal of a complex serial killer. Hopkins does the seemingly impossible. He frightens you with his outrageousness and yet forbidden some pity/compassion(albeit not a lot) for his situation. He says his lines with reservedness when needed and brashness when needed. The rest of the cast is also quite good with Anthony Heald a standout as a unethical, petty doctor in charge of Hopkins. Of course the story of the other killer is very very chilling as well.

923,nickpal1983,It's a classic!,10,17 July 2005,"There is little doubt that the most memorable aspect of The Silence of the Lambs is Anthony Hopkins' incomparable performance as Lecter. Taking over for Brian Cox, who was effective, but not especially memorable, as the good doctor in 1986's Manhunter, Hopkins instantly makes the role his own, capturing and conveying the charismatic essence of pure evil. To his dying day, no matter how many roles he plays in the interim, Hopkins will forever be known for this part. (It is a credit to Hopkins' ability as an actor that this part did not result in stereotyping. His post-Silence career has been greatly varied, with roles as widely diverse as a stodgy butler in Merchant-Ivory's The Remains of the Day and an action hero in The Edge.) I can throw out any number of superlatives, but none of them do justice to this chilling performance, which I labeled as the best acting work of the '90s. Want to feel the icy fingers of terror stroke your heart? Watch this mixture of brilliant eloquence and inhuman cruelty. As portrayed by Hopkins, Hannibal is both a suave, cultured gentleman and an unspeakable fiend. He is gracious and monstrous at the same time. (Hopkins also provided one of the most quotable lines in recent film history with ""I ate his liver with some fava beans and a nice Chianti"", which was followed by an inimitable slithering slurp.)",The Silence of the Lambs

IMO Hopkins is one big caricature of a serial killer which to me is funny - not scary. The visuals in Silence of the Lambs, is also dull and uninspired compared to those in Manhunter where there is lots of beautiful scenes often in deep marine-blue or other clean cut colors - that's art. Just like the audio. It may be kind of 80s with a lot of syntheziser, but it works perfect. Silence of the Lambs is not art.

934,kpat,"Jodie Foster is sent to the depths of psychological terror as she interrogates imprisoned serial killer Anthony Hopkins in the hopes that he might lead her to serial killer at large, Buffalo Bill.",10,26 October 1998,"Silence of the Lambs is a well constructed suspense/thriller taking us to depths of the human psyche that are repugnant to the Christian soul.  And while we turn our heads and hide our eyes at grisly demise and naked evil, at the same time we are intrigued by the motivations and actions contained therein.  Jodie Foster plays the role of Clarice Starling with a hardened vulnerability which surfaces in her encounters with Hannibal Lecter (Anthony Hopkins).  The first time I watched the movie, I was engrossed in all aspects of it- the disappearance of the senator's daughter, the mystery of Buffalo Bill, and the terrifying aspect of Hannibal Lecter.  But in successive viewings, the part that stands out the most is the interaction of Jodie Foster and Anthony Hopkins.  It is this interaction that allows this movie to transcend the genre of suspense/ thriller and defines a class unto itself.  Lecter uses his finely tuned manipulative instincts to peel away the layers of Starling revealing the closely guarded motivation for her entire life's work.  He delves beneath her mask of coolness and self sufficiency revealing her inner vulnerability.  And somehow, while revealing the most intimate secrets about herself, she still manages to deceive Lecter and gain the upper hand- if only for awhile.While this interaction is the core of the movie, there is a plot, and it is a very good one.  For what I have outlined thus far could easily be a romance, but the twist is Hannibal Lecter is a serial killer with a very loose sense of morality and Jodie Foster is an FBI agent whose moral code is strict and uncompromising.  And while Lecter is peeling layers from Clarice Starling's walls, he is chilling us with his icy demeanor- describing how he loves to eat human liver and fava beans- and leading Starling on a merry hunt for clues to the name of the elusive Buffalo Bill; who has captured another victim with time ticking away.

It's the last point that I'll mention about first:  has a more pretentious, breathy performance ever been seen on film before (outside of the Richard Burton oeuvre)?  As for plausibility:  can you imagine the FBI sending a trainee to interview a serial killer, seeking information about another serial killer on the loose?  That was a major flaw in the (also overrated) novel.  I guess it's easier to write about, or make a movie with, a younger woman who's still apt to get all scared-ified and emotional and who doesn't have those annoying crows-feet.  The script is terrible, too--it tries to present Hannibal Lecter as being some kind of 'psychic vampire'.  Witness Hopkins' expression after Jodie Foster tells him her tale of lamb-napping woe--like a famished person who's just been given a good meal.  Give me a break!  And don't tell me that the FBI couldn't have made a connection between the missing skin pieces on the dead girls' bodies and figured out what the loony-tunes they were chasing was doing.  It takes Jodie Foster's character seeing a dress pattern with darts on it to make the connection.  What a group of dim bulbs.  And they wait until HOW MANY young women are killed before they scratch their heads and say, ""Hmmmm, maybe the killer knew one of the victims!""  How did this stupid waste of celluloid ever garner any critical praise?  I mean, I know the Oscars annually bestow 'Best Motion Picture' awards on undeserving titles, so I don't care that this movie won so many--but what were the nation's film critics thinking when this made so many 'Top 10' lists?",The Silence of the Lambs

Jodie Foster, in one of her greatest roles ever, plays rookie FBI Agent Clarice Starling.

953,prahlad_writes,A thriller that's got everything right...,9,12 October 2020,"So, i ended up watching the movie, i had been procrastinating for a very long time and it turned out to be one of my all time favourite thrillers. I got completely swept away by this beautiful craftsmanship. Be it the story, the writing, the screenplay, the direction or the performances, everything in this was dead-on for me. I was so engrossed in watching this movie that an elapse of 2hr and 18minutes just felt like an hour by the time i finished watching this masterpiece.Rarely do i get to see a low-concept movie where the execution is this good ! There are only one or two low concept movies in the history of cinema where the executions are top-notch. "" The shawshank redemption "" ,
"" One flew over the cuckoo's nest "" are some of those movies. If you look at these films, you will see that these are not high-concept movies at all,but what make these films so well thought of, are their executions. That's why these movies cater to the lowbrow audience as well as to the highbrow audience. And that's what a great movie does. It strikes a chord with the audiences and they end up loving it.When i finished watching ' the silence of the lambs ', i thought to myself, "" Why the hell didn't i watch this movie in the first place? "" It has got everything in it that a cinephile craves for. Besides all the pull factors, the most standout feature in this film was Anthony Hopkins' performance. A psychotic serial killer and former psychiatrist who's known for his killing methods is sought by an FBI agent ( played by Jodie Foster ) who tries to get some information out of him so that they can catch another slayer who's been killing women in an animalistic way. Hopkins' acting is so spot-on in this film ! Whenever he appears on the screen, i just can't help but marvel at his acting prowess. Jodie Foster is as brilliant as she is in any of her films, but for me Hopkin is the MVP of this film. He outperforms Jodie Foster in this movie.I haven't seen the entire Jonathan Demme's filmography, but i think this is probably my most favourite Jonathan Demme's movie.
' Philadelphia ' is his another work that i really like, but for me this one is his best work to date. This was a hell of a movie and i had a great time watching this. If you are a movie buff like me and you enjoy good cinema then you should definitely give this a watch. I assure you, it will repay your time.",The Silence of the Lambs

It didn't scare me because suddenly, some monster with a knife pops out of nowhere. It scared me because of the dark, creepy premise the film is based on - an insight into the minds of psychopaths - and faithfully follows from beginning to end.The images of the victims do make you shiver, and as you find out more and more about Buffalo Bill's behavior and killing methods, and Dr. Lecter's craving for human flesh, you shiver when you think that there very well could be people like that on the loose.The acting - incredible. Jodie Foster couldn't have played Clarice Starling better. Clarice, alone and vulnerable, yet so strong and smart. Anthony Hopkins as Hannibal Lecter - wow! When you hear Hannibal speak, you can't help but think what a smart man he is and how amazing he is, and yet remember the man could be the physical manifestation of evil itself. A very good mix.And when it's all over, you're left shaking and thinking about the serial killers of the world...This is one of my all-time favorite movies, and if you haven't seen it, pick it up - A thrilling, disturbing look into the mind of serial killers that will leave you stirred no matter how jaded you are, and will leave you in awe of the team's great job.",The Silence of the Lambs
957,jiver2,The psychopathology is all wrong.,1,13 April 2008,"I was not impressed with this film, and it's phoney psychiatry. I have some professional experience in working with the criminally insane, in the US and UK. While there are a few staff in the profession who would allow themselves to be manipulated in the way that Clarice Starling does, I cannot conceive any real life situation where so many of her colleagues would allow this situation, known as ""team splitting"", to continue. It is routine behaviour for psychopaths to attempt to team split, as Lekter does, but it is such a standard ploy that it would be recognised in any institution other than the toyland one in the film and quickly dealt with, and I resent the attitude of the storyline in glorifying this behaviour. Trust me people, if you are in this situation, don't allow patients to split you away from your colleagues, you may think they are interested in you but they will get bored with playing with you in the end. When patients are given this power, which they cannot handle, it makes them more scared, and less likely to learn. In his attempt to make Frederick Chilton, the character that should be the good guy, in to the bad guy, either the actor or the director has gone way over the top, to the point where where pathos becomes bathos, and as for Anthony Hopkins, he lost all credibility for me when he announced in a British tabloid that he was sorry for seeming to condone violence in the role he was playing, and then within a few months proceeded to repeat the role in the sequel, ""Hannibal"".

967,e-mail9050,Good but has some flaws,8,20 August 2010,"First of all, i couldn't feel the success at the end, The hero manages to win only because the villain made a mistake. And we don't know who the victim is you can't feel so sorry for a person you don't know. They did try to present her a bit that's true.And i think a person's natural reaction in that situation at the end is to try to remain as silent as possible and listen to every sound. Instead she was making lots of noise moving around and breathing heavy being scared out of her mind. Then we see her confident receiving her medal because she was lucky. Didn't really look like she deserved it.Also, i wasn't really be able to follow how the problem was solved by her, that might just be my fault, but again it stopped me from savoring the success at the end.Another thing is that the characters seemed too cold, The female hero was totally unaproachable, that doesn't make a very nice character to care about. Hannibal was pretty great but then he just started doing irrational things and totally ruined himself as a sympathetic character.And at the end he goes to kill his prison guard. What was that for ? He didn't seem like a bad character. Just to make an old cannibals joke ?And what the hell was all that sweat on her at the beginning ? it was cold outside, how much would a girl have to run to get like that ?

970,thefatgoaty,Scariest Movie Ever,10,20 February 2010,"For me Silence of the Lambs is the all time scariest movie, because its realistic. I'm more afraid of a sadistic serial killer than a monster that doesn't exist. The whole movie is eerie, especially the dialog. This movie is so well written and the scene when Clarice Starling first meets Hannibal there was no scary music or suspenseful build up to a fright, but i was still scared. The types of things Lecter talks about, eating people, murder, dismemberment, he doesn't even flinch at it. I think this movie has one of the greatest scripts ever, one of the greatest characters ever, one of the greatest plots ever and the all time greatest title ever, if you don't understand why its called ""The Silence of the Lambs"" I won't explain but if you watch the scene where Clarice talks with Hannibal in his new cell they explain it subtly.Through out the whole movie I was really confused about what to think about Hannibal, I wanted to hate him because he is a murderer that eats his victims, but I always wanted the best for him... strangely. I really wanted him to escape from captivity and on some weird level I felt like Lecter and Clarice were friends. At the same time though, I found him extremely frightening. I guess thats what makes him such a bad ass character. The other antagonist in the film was a serial killer called Buffalo Bill who is murdering girls and skinning them. I found this character unbelievably scary because of his mystery. Some directors try and make the villains scarier by giving them more screen time to see what horrible things they are capable. I think when a character is seen more through out a film, a sense of familiarity is formed with the character. Demme made it so you didn't see much of Buffalo Bill, thus more mysterious and scary. Any scenes with him in it are extremely disturbing, like the infamous ""Put the Lotion on the Skin"" scene. The whole plot is compelling and it's very rare for a film to make you feel like the main character was always in trouble. The way the whole mystery is unraveled is clever and well put together. If you are more into a cheap scare film with jumps and sh*t your pants moments I would suggest not watching this movie but if your into realistic horror and psychedelic thrillers The Silence of the Lambs is well worth watching. A nearly perfect film.",The Silence of the Lambs

If you have, there is no need for you to read this review",10,13 November 2004,"Once in a while a movie comes along that just blows you away, and this is one of them. The performances - ALL of them - are downright brilliant, from the unsure, yet aggressive Clarice Starling, her controlled superior Agent, the insane Buffalo Bill (by the way one of the more haunting movie villains...he'll come to you in your dreams ;) and, of course, Hannibal Lecter. What can I say about Hannibal - he is the reason why you watch the movie another time. I said Buffalo Bill is haunting. Well, if that is true, Lecter is the stuff that nightmares are made of, and yet, in a strange way, you want to have dinner with him (preferably one that you cooked yourself). A fascinating character that you wish to see more of, and actually have the feeling to see more than you actually do - He has a total on-screen time of about 15 minutes. Fun Fact, I believe that's the shortest on-screen time that ever brought an actor an Academy Award. To sum up the rest, the storyline is compelling, has enough creepy moments to be classified as a horror thriller, and was followed by a bunch of movies that desperately want to be ""the silence of the lambs"", but are not.

She is sent out to find Buffalo Bill, a killer who skins his victims for reasons unknown to anyone until the near end of the movie. Helping Clarice is the incarcerated cannibal genius, Dr. Hannibal Lecter AKA Hannabal the Cannibal, beautifully played by Anthony Hopkins. This psychotic mastermind knows who Buffalo Bill really is and only agent Starling knows this. The two have kind of a pact in a you help me, I help you, manner. This is one of my favorite movies because of the sheer terror that Anthony Hopkins makes you feel the first time you meet his character in an insane asylum, (what a great actor).

I think anyone that has ever experienced any kind of abandonment, helplessness, and just feeling terror in general,as she did, when she tried to save that one lamb; and couldn't, well, it just makes you cry, because you see the helplessness of her past, meeting her once again in her present!As she fought to help the victim, she had to overcome the victim within herself, as well.I loved Jodie Foster in this movie, and I can't pass up an opportunity to watch it again and again!I love her dialect, her acting, and; the way that she pulled the movie together!",The Silence of the Lambs

I find it amazing that I was getting chills up my spine just from watching him play Lecter. This is the best of his Lecter performances, as the other movies, Hannibal and Red Dragon lack storyline and he needed a strong character like Jodie Foster who is incredible. Clarice is a vulnerable character that pulls off a believable FBI trainee. You believe she has the strength to do the job but are constantly concerned for her safety. Jodie Foster is as always and incredible actor. The scenes with Foster and Hopkins are undeniably the strength of this movie. Hopkins picks away at Foster's inner demons, forcing her to open up her troubling past. In exchange, he reveals more and more information on the identity of a notorious serial killer.

There is a remarkable buildup of suspense, particularly at one point towards the end that made my heart race.Perhaps the most amazing accomplishment is that every technical aspect managed to not stick out in an overt way.

982,MGold99,Brilliant and hypnotic,10,21 June 2005,"Though my dedication to this film sometimes freaks people out (I've been known to quote it at somewhat inopportune moments), I don't think it's anything to be ashamed of. This film is a brilliant, tightly-plotted masterpiece, a tour de force of masterful acting, absorbing dialogue, and tempo and pacing that is at once highly tense and soothingly mesmerizing. The give-and-take between Starling and Lector has an almost heartbeat-like rhythm, quiet and subtle yet extraordinarily powerful. I don't think it's inappropriate to say that this film doesn't hit any truly false notes. The main reason that my friends often won't watch this film is simply because it scares them too much -- which, I believe, is one of the film's greatest triumphs.",The Silence of the Lambs

Silence Of The Lambs is one of the best film I have ever seen.The writing is excellent you can tell that mainly by noticing that some of the clichés that other serial killer (slasher) films often use are ignored of in here the direction is superb but there is no doubt that what makes this brilliant film what it is it's the acting without the talents of the main and supporting cast The Silence Of The Lambs would be nothing. Jodie Foster brings the right amount of courage and vulnerability to the character of Clarice Starling and of course there is Anthony Hopkins who basically steals the show as Dr. Hannibal ""The Cannibal"" Lecter the brilliant psychotic cannibalistic and highly manipulative serial killer although he was not the first to play Lecter (the first actor to portray the character of Lecter was Brian Cox in ""Manhunter""-1986) but never the less Hopking is and always will be Lecter.

An intelligent movie by all accounts. I would recommend watching the whole series of movies as I have just done...apart from the first movie Manhunter. I was informed that it was not worth watching as it was a poor movie in comparison. And besides it was remade as Red Dragon which is according to me the third movie in this series. The Silence Of The Lambs, Hannibal, Red Dragon, Hannibal Rising. That is the best order to watch them I think. The order in Wichita they were made.The two leads in this movie were outstanding, and really shined together with such great chemistry. I won't spoil any of the story for those that haven't stumbled upon this gem yet. I will just say that is an FBI vs Serial Killer gem. Well written, intelligently directed.

The movie goes through the solving of the death of a girl and the disappearance of a governor's daughter who the new detective figures is connected to the most recent killings of a man by the name of Buffalo Bill. The only person who could know anything of the man is murderer Hannible Lector who is also a canible. The detective and Hannible form an unique bond that no person has ever been able to have with him. Without giving direct information, the detective was able to to piece together the clues of where Bill could be located. In the end they're able to capture him as well as the Governor's daughter. What I appreciate most about the film is its ability to keep one on their feet. From the moment that she walks down the stairs of the jail to see Hannible to the moment she walks into Bill's house alone. The best scene was for sure when Hannible was able to be escape from the polices custody. It's ironic that for this one man they needed two helicopters, a squad team and practically the entire police department and he was still able to out smart them.

A great plot and setting which I am sure many thrillers movies copied. The dark tone of scenes was just right. Not too much not too little. The sky in the scenes is always gray and the atmosphere is cold and wet, which helps the audience to become absorbed into the gloominess of the movie. Moreover, I think a great movie livens up all the main characters within the given time and this one has achieved it. I think Ted Levine's acting was particularly supreme. I can't understand why he didn't win any big award for this role. And of course, Foster and Hopkins did an excellent job in playing those complicated characters.",The Silence of the Lambs
988,zacvolteas,Classic that will never die,10,20 March 2017,"A classic and for good reasons. I'm a horror genre veteran and don't ""spooky easily"", much like our lead, Clarice Starling. However, I feel that both she and I felt somehow disturbed and almost violated by Anthony Hopkins' portrayal of Hannibal Lecter. Most certainly any casual moviegoer would feel the same. Though some moments are nearly laughable, such as the face scene near the climax of the film, his portrayal is consistently meticulous and blood curdling. The movie is fast paced and utterly engrossing, but knows when to slow down to give the audience a bit of a mental break. However, it never drags and a two hour flick seemed to go by in the same length of time it would take to watch a 30 minute sitcom.This movie has aged well and is a must-see for any crime drama fans out there, both old and young (but not too young).",The Silence of the Lambs

I loved Jodie Foster as the young FBI cadet Clarice Starling and found Anthony Hopkins to be the perfect match for the mysterious, intelligent and frightening character of Hannibal ''The Cannibal'' Lecter. Their chemistry is undeniable. I continuously found myself captivated by the never ending chase between Hannibal and Clarice. Through the horror one finds the beauty that has always been of an interest and in my opinion will continue to be, to us poor souls. Yet I wouldn't suggest this movie for someone who although likes a bit of romance, is scared to death and tries to avoid horror films like the plague, as it contains quite scary parts. Hannibal Lecter is a very peculiar character which requires equally brilliant watchers so as to fully appreciate his riveting and compelling beauty, motives and way of thinking.Quid pro quo fans.",The Silence of the Lambs

Because the movie is a great mixture of a perfectly adapted screenplay, a great directing and a mysterious, thrilling score. But what really makes the movie that great, is the unbelievably perfect acting. Jodie Foster, Ted Levine etc. do a perfect Job, although the star is Anthony Hopkins. He definitely is the movie. Everyone who hears the title of the movie, instantly thinks of Anthony Hopkins portray of Hannibal Lecter. A curious fact is, that he only has about 16 minutes if screen time. So much the better is his performance. Furthermore i think it was one of the three best performances by actors of all time, if not the best!!!

I was thrilled by the book and I read the entire thing in about a week. I then hungered to see the award winning movie that I'd heard so much about. I wasn't disappointed at all. The cinematography is awesome, Foster and Hopkins turn in A+++ performances and the story contains the book's intricacies while moving at a pace fast enough to satisfy. The only detail left out of the movie that was in the book was that of Crawford's wife's death and ongoing sickness. I think this really made Crawford seem rather one dimensional in Silence of the Lambs and takes a lot away from his character in the book. My girlfriend had only seen the movie and she described him as a bit of a sleaze which shocked me because he is such a genuine and honestly good man in the book that is simply in the middle of a massive internal conflict. However, this does not really detract from the movie at all, I simply felt that Crawford was an underdone character but understand the need to simplify him. I suggest reading the book before seeing the movie. Bon appetite.",The Silence of the Lambs
994,jenniferparkes,good!,7,7 June 2017,"With Silence of the Lambs comes some much needed recognition for the horror genre. It is a first- rate production all around. It boasts a witty and suspenseful script based on the Thomas Harris novel, full of great lines. It has marvelous direction from Demme. Demme creates suspense very well throughout and uses some great directorial shots such as the twin frames of Clarice ringing a doorbell and the FBI men breaking into a home. The two lead actors won Oscars for their performances...each deserved. Foster is very good in her role, but it is Anthony Hopkins that literally lights up the screen with his complex portrayal of a complex serial killer. Hopkins does the seemingly impossible. He frightens you with his outrageousness and yet illicts some pity/compassion(albeit not a lot) for his situation. He says his lines with reservedness when needed and brashness when needed. The rest of the cast is also quite good with Anthony Heald a standout as a unethical, petty doctor in charge of Hopkins. Of course the story of the other killer is very very chilling as well.

This film inspired me to write my own short called The Line which I am currently getting funded as well as it inspired some others that are still in the writing phases.

1004,Rich-91,Psychological Horror,10,22 October 1998,"""Silence of the Lambs"" is horror at its best.  While it lacks the stupidity of traditional slasher films, it possesses the intelligence to use the most adaptable medium for horror--the human mind. Hannibal Lector is brought to life powerfully by Anthony Hopkins  in the role that has defined his career.  Hannibal is scary because he is destructive, manipulative, sadistic and, above all, a cannibal.  The horror that comes from his character is, despite all his ""evil"", he is likeable. Charming in an eerie way, all his evils are projected graphically onto the screen.  Unlike other horror villains, Dr. Lector is distinctly human.  We are all the more scared because he is real and believable.  Many people truly think Hannibal Lector is a real person, a credit to Thomas Harris (for creating the character) and Anthony Hopkins (for bringing Dr. Lector to life).  Dr. Lector again breaks the stereotype for modern horror villains because he actually helps our hero (Clarisse Starling) find the real killer. It is his words that lead Clarisse to the house of Buffalo Bill.  ""How do we first start to covet?  We covet that which we see everyday."" ""Silence of the Lambs"" isn't a pleasant film, but it is an unforgettable movie experience.",The Silence of the Lambs

I do not understand why they made the Dr. Chilton character such a broad, asinine media-hound; a psychologist of that high a level would be that stupid?  If he were smarter, it would make the characters who out-think him smarter.

1007,Vindicti,Positive and rather brief,9,24 February 1999,"Silence of the Lambs is one of the best American films I have seen in ages. It settles comfortably into the genre of ""psychological horror"" along with such modern classics as Seven and...The Game I suppose. It is true that the afformentioned genre has not been overly exploited, and in view of a collection of films described as having ""a questionable degree of merit"" that is probably a good thing.Jodie Foster is excellent as a trainee FBI agent, but her performance is a little overshadowed by that of Sir Anthony Hopkins in the role of Dr Hannibal ""the Cannibal"" Lector. A lot has been said about Hopkins' portrayal of the cannibalistic serial killer, and as I'm limited for space all that I can say is that after seeing the movie, Lector seems a more believable character than Hopkins himself (that's a compliment by the way).In short, an extremely effective movie, and one that has for many embodied the cinema of the '90s.",The Silence of the Lambs

1013,diamond-31,Too pedestrian,2,19 December 1999,"I saw this movie when new, and liked it plenty.  That was years ago, and I've grown considerably.  My interest in Thomas Harris' ""Red Dragon"", and the screenplay I'm working on based on it, prodded me into renting SOTL for repeat viewing. I've always held the Oscars in low regard, but have dropped that regard all together after viewing this nonsense.  The 1,000 word maximum on these posts prevents me from mentioning all the folly I found in the film.  But I'll try....Acting:  In most instances, overwrought.  Hopkins was a good psycho, but a bad Lecter.  The Lecter of the novels was far more sedate in his demeanor, prefering to ""charm"" his opposition, allowing himself access to their psyche.  Sniffing the air for skin cream is highly dubious.  Foster did a good job as a young recruit.  The problem I have with her is has more to do with the story.  Seems a bit too unrealistic.  Will Graham convinced me.  Clarice Starling didn't.  Dr. Chilton was played as a complete idiot.  Typical Hollywood bad good-guy.  Made the viewer biased for Lecter.  WRITER SHORTCUT!  I recognize this as a substitute for compelling writing and acting.  Simply bias the audience toward the main character by surrounding him with easy-to-dis-like characters.  No childish brat like the Chilton portrayed would ever hold a job of such responsibility.   Ted Levine was terrific throughout.  Voice, appearance, contortions, crotch, :  all wonderful.  Most of the supporting players were of TV movie quality. Canned dialog, playing dumb for an assumed dumb audience.  Posh on that, Director. As for direction, too many flubs and gimmicks to mention here.  I'll mention one:  The cat in the window growling as Buffalo Bill drives away with Fat Girl # Whatever. Like any cat is going to react in that fashion.  A cat would not bat a whisker if in the presence of such drama.  Would only move if the master was going to land on it.  Otherwise, no fur ruffled.  What a gimmick that was.The music was typical of Hollywood reality.  Never in my life, when confronted with drama of any intensity, have I heard violins out of nowhere. DIRECTOR SHORTCUT!:  Adding sappy ""music"" to enhance mood.  In most cases, this is to bolster or cover any weaknesses in writing, acting, direction, or all three.  (NOTE: This is certainly not exclusive to this film.  Most Hollywood productions employ this tactic.) The ending of the film was almost good about this.  No music, just Foster in the dark.  ***NO SPOILER***  But the ending could've been better.  Easily.MANHUNTER should have won 15 Oscars, if SOTL could win 5. Sure, it was a bit too 80's in appearance, but far more accurate and convincing.  Better book, too.In summation, too dumbed down.  Booooooo.",The Silence of the Lambs

1023,Kirollos_Noah,My Favorite Psychological Thriller!,10,27 July 2020,"The Silence of the Lambs was directed by Jonathan Demme and written by Ted Tally. Starring Jodie Foster, Anthony Hopkins, and Ted Levine.Based on the famous novel by Thomas Harris, and it's about a young FBI cadet who receives the help of Hannibal Lecter, an incarcerated and manipulative cannibal killer to help catch another serial killer, a madman who skins his victims.There won't be any kind of spoilers in this review, but I'll discuss some of its scenes deeply, without going into spoilers, just wanted to warn y'all. All set? Let's go then!The Silence of the Lambs starts with our protagonist, Clarice Starling (played by Jodie Foster) training with the opening credits. It's a very effective scene, some viewers won't pay much attention to it, but it's really important, it shows us that our protagonist, Clarice, is nothing but a trainee! Of course, that was mentioned later on in the movie, but seeing her training with your own eyes without the characters telling you at first, is such a powerful scene. We get to see that at the climax of the movie too, not just there, we get to see that in almost every scene that genuinely requires her to do a hard decision. And of course, that goes to the stellar performance by Jodie Foster!What makes this character so good to watch, is that she is not a professional FBI agent or whatever, she's a trainee, and she's trying to prove herself, sometimes in doing some really hard stuff, and later on, in the movie that was kinda hinted that she's doing it not to impress the others, but to impress herself and do to face the thing that she's most afraid of. And that does make her character very easy to relate to and to sympathize with her character even more!The movie doesn't take time showing us her backstory at the beginning or giving us all the information about all the characters at first, it takes time, and it gives us the information we need about most of the characters, not in the form of a flashback, but mostly in the form of a dialogue, which is even better because if it was in the form of flashbacks we wouldn't have gotten this amazing scene between Lecter and Starling in the prison, where Starling is telling Lecter about the lambs, which is not just my favorite scene in the movie, but one of my favorite scenes of all-time!We get quickly to meet Lecter, we get to brief info about him, and how he used to kill and eat his victims, and then we get to meet and see him, and he's not the cannibal we thought he would be, he's very settled, calm, civilized and kinda respectful. And that's another thing this movie nailed, we thought he would be loud and wild, like how he was described, or at least how you imagined he would be, but he's different, even when we get to see him killing and eating a man's lips, he listened to music afterward, which makes him unique and very intriguing.Anthony Hopkins' performance as Lecter is one of my favorite performances in a horror movie, he nailed this character, every scene he was in it, the tension was there, even though he might be just speaking with someone, or being normal, the way he just talks is very scary!Ted Levine doesn't get many praises for his role in this movie, maybe because he wasn't in this movie a lot, but still, whenever he was on screen he was pretty good. Everyone in this movie is great, everyone did a great job!The plot was very intense, the movie doesn't take time, every scene matters, every line builds something, every character is there for a reason, even if it's very minor, but still, it matters, and that's how perfect this movie is, you can watch it and just be mesmerized of how careful the crew was while making this movie.I didn't read the novel, so I don't know how faithful it was to the source material, but I heard that it was, based on other people's opinions, people who have read the novel and watched the movie.Demme did a great job with the tension and the thriller, it never got out of its psychological thriller to a supernatural movie, it was always real, and that what makes it scary, with no modern jump scares, it's just pure horror. He did a great job with the psychological study aspects too, he was simply able to build tension and make you on the edge of your seat, even if it's a normal conversation between two characters! His job behind the camera was great, and this movie benefits a lot from his work.In the end, The Silence of the Lambs is such a perfect movie, with an amazing guy behind the camera who knows how to make real horror, and two stellar main performances in front of the camera, who simply knew how to deliver this horror. I'm gonna give The Silence of the Lambs an A+!Thank you, guys, for reading my review, more are coming on your way!",The Silence of the Lambs

I first watched this film eight years ago with my sister and we both couldn't keep our eyes off the screen. There is always something special about a film that impulses you to keep watching even when you realise you are watching some of the scariest, most unbelievable imagery of film history. The film, for me, ticks every box a film could. The acting is superb and completely well deserved of the praise the leading roles received. The mystery and enigma of the directing, especially when we are pelted with suspense knowing that she is in the notorious Buffalo Bill's house and the vulnerable Clarice has no idea. The wonderful use of the subjective shot making you quiver with fear in the eyes of Clarice and then feel somewhat disturbed in the eyes of the killer. The story unravels wonderfully and the relationship expressed between Lecter and Starling is breathtaking. I just wish I was a couple of years older went the film came out to watch it on the big screen. If I had however, I may have never been able to sleep again. My only disappointment is that the great Jodie Foster refused to reprise her role, if she had, Hannible would have been a good tribute rather than a struggling sequel. My only small gripe is when Clarice keeps calling Lecter's name over the phone over and over again right at the end. How long does it take to realise someone has left the phone? Maybe she was reading him a poem? A great, well deserved of it's awards, thriller/horror masterpiece.",The Silence of the Lambs

Silence of the lambs is definitely one of the best thrillers of movie history. Anthony Hopkins does a superb job playing Hannibal Lector and Jodi foster playing Clarice Starling as well. What I enjoy most about this movie is that we are actually dealing with 2 pshycotic killers but using the intelligence of one to catch the other. As much as I would love to give away parts I just can't. Buffalo Bill was simply a freak but I was fascinated on how Lector was able to lead Clarice to him by the small clues he gave her throughout the movie. If you have never seen the silence of the lambs, I don't know here you have been but you better get to your video store if you want to see a thriller that will have you on the egde of your seat.

Jonathon Demme directed this movie with precision decision making.  Jodi Foster's ability to draw the viewer into the parameters of her mission to find Buffalo Bill is exceptional.  Anthony Hopkins's aptitude for selecting one his many of acting styles to play Hannibal Lector was flawless.  However I feel the most credit should be handed to Thomas Harris.  After reading ""Silence of the Lambs"" prior to the film, I was more than thrilled to learn of the making of the film.This film deserves all the accolades the industry has to distribute. Rightfully so this film swept the Academy Awards ceremony.  Very seldom does a film come along where it is so good, it damages the legacy of it's actors, actresses, and director.  Unfortunately, Demme (with the exception of Philadelphia), Foster, and Hopkins have yet to reach the level of success since 1991.If you have yet to see this film, then your idea of a cinematic masterpiece is disillusioned.",The Silence of the Lambs

There's graphic discussions about the murders taking place and how the victim was killed. Another psychopathic serial killer is revealed, whom is known for skinning his victims and shown performing disturbing acts. There's gruesome images of the victims including autopsies, whom implied was either cannibalized or skinned.. One scene shows a man fully naked with his genitals tucked in, acting as a woman.

Literally. Or hiding under a blanket and a bowl of popcorn. The characters instead of making an eye line between each other often talk straight into the camera where you automatically are put in an uneasy seat. The intensity is directed right at you. And the story becomes more immersive. A perfect once in a lifetime combination happened when you get spectacular acting, writing, and directing all in one 2 hour time block...it still gets my heart racing. If you haven't seen this movie, I recommend it to anyone seeking a mental thriller. Perhaps once deemed gory in the early 90's, but by today's standard the film sits pretty tame but again mentally thrilling. There's no ""boo"" in this film.

One almost feels sorry(or maybe angry) for the FBI guys for being so incompetent. How can the screenplay for such a movie get 5 Oscars? The acting is not that great either, Anthony Hopkins is overplaying his lines while Jodie Foster is barely acting at all. She doesn't seem to change mimic during the whole movie and the whole story with the lambs is just lame.

1039,soylentmoss,"Beautifully acted, intriguing and gripping...",9,18 December 2008,"Rarely ever do i praise a movie, the last movie that i saw which i said i enjoyed was a long time ago , it May of been the 1966 movie Batman, now that comment may seem out of place in a review for a movie such as The Silence of The Lambs, but I'll explain the link, both Batman and The Silence Of the Lambs both do exactly what they should do, they entertain, they grip you, they are well created, and they are molded perfectly.The Silence Of The Lamb's strongest points do not lie in the direction, which is fantastic, they also don't lie in the deceptively obvious yet clever storyline, they don't even lie in the interesting score or special effects, no, the strongest aspects of this movie are Hannibal Lecter, played by Anthony Hopkins, and Clarice Starling , played by Jodie Foster. In this movie, these two amazing actors grip you, they pull you in, and they put you in the movie. Jodie Foster's confident yet fragile character ""Clarice"" is easily believable and very convincing, to the point were you feel as if she is a real person living through this torment, and she certainly deserves the Oscar she gets in return. And Anthony Hopkins once again stuns and amazes audiences in his role, and deserves every little part of his Oscar as well.Now I've always been a great fan of Anthony Hopkins, from his performance in The Elephant Man to his performance in red Dragon which uplifted an otherwise fairly weak movie. And this is surely his finest hour, every single word and action in this movie is sinister, frightening and chilling, everything a perfect villain should be. His famous pronunciation of ""Clarice"" will go down in media history, and his first appearance in the jail cell will be engraved into the mind of every person who see's it for ever. His stance, his glare and his delightfully charming manner all add to this character, and Anthony's performance. He is so convincing in this role that by the end of the movie you actually question his existence yourself, and this is also helped by the brilliantly wrote and presented storyline, which relates this psychotic character to a real life background and real life events. Even though Hannibal isn't the main character in this film, or even the main villain, he certainly steals the show, and the Oscar he earnt was for the shortest ever award-winning performance in film history, spending only about 20 minutes on screen in total, but even this is enough for Anthony Hopkins to portray every aspect of his character.And as previously mentioned, Jodie Foster's Clarice is also a fascinating performance. Getting such a small actress to take on such a big confident role, and to do it convincingly , was a big risk, but it pays off. Jodie Foster's performance is truly amazing, throughout she promotes a feeling on un-ease and difficulty, however she also gets you rooting behind her, as she ventures ever deeper into the mystery. As i previously said, there are spoilers in the review, and this is one of them, in one of the final scenes were Clarice is chasing down the Maniac and has entered his house and is now trapped in the dark is one of the most 'Edge-of-my-seat' scenes I've ever scene. The brilliant first person views and wonderful change in mood make this scene memorable and one of the movie's real strongest moments, almost creating the traumatized and lost women theme which would go on to back up other movies. And this movie just kept going, which was a good thing, because i generally tend to rate a movie not only on film aspects, but also on how interested it kept me, and this one kept me going till the end.But as i mentioned, especially in the final scene, the direction of the movie is classic. The shots are often basic yet stimulating, yet occasionally the director uses his creativity and goes all out like a blockbuster should, the camera angles are near perfect and well taken care of throughout, promoting a sense of being in the film, yet not actually experiencing the danger's the characters are facing, such as many of Spielberg's movies.I have to cut this review short due to the word limit, but i can finally say, go see this movie, it's not Entirely perfect, and that's why it misses out on a 10, it would earn 5 Stars but it can take a while to get going and can often confuse even the most intelligent viewer, which is what stops it from achieving a perfect score, but other that those, it's just too difficult to criticize this film. It deserved all of it's awards and should be seen by everyone, now.",The Silence of the Lambs
1040,aysar_s,marginal,7,20 September 2010,"I think that the writer of the movie wants to say how sick it is when weak people have the power and low to control the superior people and to imprison them. So he exaggerated and drew enlargement picture for his major character. Dr. Lecter – the revolutionary man on this society has such system- hates rude people, he said to Claris (Now you're being rude, and I hate rude people)that means that he hates ordinary weak people who are being rude when somebody show them how weak and shallow are they.

Director Johnathan Demme uses Clarice Starling played by Jodie Foster to play on Hannibal Lector's manipulating intelligence. Clarice is originally selected by the head of FBI's behavioral Science unit Jack Crawford to track down a notorious serial killer nicknamed Buffalo Bill. Crawford asks Clarice to meet with Dr. Hannibal Lector in order to find the whereabouts of buffalo bill. This constant interaction between Clarice and Dr. Lector makes for an exciting mind game played on both sides. Director Johnathan Demme's use of dark emphasis on reality combined with Anthony Hopkins assertive and sadistic abilities as an actor makes for great chemistry. Jodie Foster's ""matter a fact"" persona is presented as a challenge to Dr. Lector. This relationship is established at the beginning and continuously unraveled as the story progresses. On one occasion Clarice meets with Dr. Lector who is sitting behind bullet proof glass inside his windowless cell. Dr. Lector finds is release through the analysis of Clarice's life. Clarice uses her disturbing past to compensate for links to Buffalo Bill. Dr. Lector eventually falls for Clarice's pursuit and gives her a clue that leads to one of Dr. Lector's past patients. From this point Clarice takes her findings back to Dr. Lector in hopes of finding Buffalo Bill who has now abducted Catherine Martin, the daughter of Senator Ruth Martin. With the severity of the situation on Clarice's back she is forced to come up with an answer. Knowing this she makes a deal with Dr. Lector's request of transferring to a different facility in return for finding buffalo bill.Johnathan Demme brings a new definition to the word climax. Demme's use of scenery and dictation of characters like buffalo bill and Hannibal Lector seeks out an eerie pocket that most viewers are not used to experiencing. Camera angles and screen shots help to put you in the shoes of Clarice and buffalo bills hopeless victims. Although Clarice attempts to portray herself as a mentally tough FBI official we see Dr. Lector's tactics of recalling her childhood past begin to eat away at her. This struggle brings Clarice's true personality out which ties into a remarkable conclusion. Demme is attempting to bring you into the mind of mad genius. Through the harshness of reality seen in Clarice's past, Dr. Lector's actions and buffalo bills intentions we begin to think there is no hope. Demme brings you so far down into the plot that you begin to transcend your thoughts and emotions as those of the young lady trapped by Buffalo Bill. You have that real sense that you cannot expect a successful conclusion to the multi-dimensional plot as portrayed through multi-dimensional characters.",The Silence of the Lambs
1043,edwardpeterharryrowan,Quid Pro Quo,8,2 February 2020,"The Silence of the Lambs is based on the 1988 book by Thomas Harris. The film is directed by Jonathan Demme (Philadelphia, 1993 and Rachel Getting Married 2008), and stars Jodie Foster (Panic Room), Scott Glenn (Buffalo Soldiers, 2001) and Anthony Hopkins (The Silence of the Lambs, 1991).Anthony Hopkins, by the way, has done some other fantastic work. But this, undoubtedly, is the role of which he is best known.There is something uniquely fascinating about 'psychopaths' - lack of empathy and indifference to the suffering of others. Dehumanised minds, inhabiting human bodies discreetly, blending in with the rest of the human population, there is something profoundly, beyond words, unnerving about this aspect of human nature.There's a statistic that says that around 1% of the general population are psychopaths. Go along to prison and supposedly that rises to 25% of the community. And 5% of CEOs have the traits too, supposedly.I find the 1% stat more terrifying. One in every 100 people that I walk past in the street would feel no emotional impulse to help me, should I lay down in a state of serious ill-health. But, they would trample over me, literally and figuratively, in pursuit of their own wants and needs.Hannibal Lecter is of no garden variety psychopath, however. And the movie does an outstanding job of exploring this very real and disturbing side to human nature, embodied in the character played by Hopkins. The FBI trainee Clarice Starling (played by Foster) is the film's protagonist, called to work on catching 'Buffalo Bill', serial killer at large. The two characters are very different, and there relationship and interactions are the main force of the movie.Jodie Foster's character stands in a mostly male-dominated FBI environment and the way the men react around her. Also, Foster is 5,3"", which is also played upon. The movie leverages this to significant effect, both in creating some short, effective scenes; Starling standing in a lift surrounded by taller men, for example. Then also, using it to develop the characters quickly and believably. For example, the relationship between Starling and the FBI's behavioural science lead Jack Crawford (Scott Glenn) becomes meaningful in its own right, as both characters interact with each other in this law enforcement world.Starling's family history is also tied effectively to the whole. Clocking in at about the two-hour mark, this movie packs a lot in terms of character work and staying close to Harris's original approximation in the novel.While this movie is entertaining, one might have guessed it's not always fun to watch, and I don't feel my review would be complete without mentioning that some of the scenes are truly disturbing and disgusting! This is not one to let the kids watch.The only complaints are about small pieces, details of the whole. One is how did Lecter get his hands on the pen of Dr Chilton? All we ever see is him staring at it, and then later Chilton missing it. We only ever see him here incarcerated in the most visceral way, with the trademark face mask and his entire body locked vertical and straight into a sack truck. A detail probably brushed over in production, but one that I felt was a missed opportunity to elaborate the cunning of Dr H.Lecter.The second is that I felt some of the actions of the law enforcement characters were slightly hokey compared to others.I rewatched this movie last night, in 2020. Times may have changed, but the realities of human nature this movie explores in fiction remain as darkly alluring as ever.",The Silence of the Lambs

This is not a bad thing at all, this is one of the best cinematic adaptations of a novel I have ever seen. So, there.*******POSSIBLE SPOILER BELOW!!!*******The plot starts out when young FBI agent trainee Clarice Starling (Foster) is assigned to interview the definitely terrifying Dr Hannibal Lecter (Hopkins). Dr Lecter is a serial killer, now imprisoned in a mental institution. He is believed to have information concerning a murderer on the loose. But he is unwilling to help, unless he receives something in return...For anyone who has read Thomas Harrises novel, you will know that in his stories, everything is psychological. What is so wonderful about this cinematic adaptation is that it has really captured the spirit of Harrises writing. With the ""Hannibal the Cannibal"" reference, the filmmakers could easily have been driven to turn this into a gorefest. Instead, the interaction between the charachters is central. This is most prominent in the scenes where Foster and Hopkins are face-to-face. It is wonderful to see two such actors of quality really create something more, a connection that reaches from the screen right to the viewer. It only goes to show that you don't need excessive force or blood spurting in every scene to convey horror or fright to an audience. Sometimes, two people's eyes meeting is all it takes. Also, there are plenty of classical one-liners delivered by Hopkins along the way, guaranteed to send chills down your spine.
Finally: though this IS a psychological thriller more than a violent horror flick, it has its share of more violent scenes. Hence, if you dislike explicit violence, I sincerely recommend Hitchcock's ""Psycho"" instead. What this however is, is excellence in suspense- one of the greatest thrillers I have ever seen, and a magnificent display of acting skills.

It is very difficult to write a story which satisfactorily completes its promise."". In Silence of the Lambs we watch the development of Jodie Foster as a clearly intelligent, determined investigator. She gets involved with the character of Anthony Hopkins who can only be described as a Monster. Sex and sadism are his middle names. The audience is drawn into the horrible web that he has sewn. And then what happens? Jodie Foster is in an endless chase scene, alone with a man with whom NO MAN would ever find himself. Her professionalism is completely lost.This ending is so disappointing as to make the entire picture a waste.",The Silence of the Lambs

Another good thing to do was to mainly do some backround on the trial of lectar which was the one that got him in the prison in the first place.. the movie on the other hand was a very good one considering it invovled a cereal killer unlike scream [ the worst thing that i would call a horror film] it had a unique touch to it that made it so popular,The Silence of the Lambs

1053,alan-stone,Unbelievable!,9,28 March 2012,"""The Silence of the Lambs"" is one of the greatest cinematic achievements of cinema's history. Every single element contributes to create a disturbing and unique atmosphere, and I use very carefully the word 'unique'. I highly doubt anyone was reminded of a villain with the same caliber as Dr. Hannibal -with the chilling rhyming nickname- Lecter, masterfully personified by Anthony Hopkins. I doubt anyone remembers a similar movie where a young, vulnerable and non-Ellen-Ripley looking girl doesn't play the victim, nor the hero's love interest, but the actual heroine. Clarice Starling, as a FBI trainee is played by Jodie Foster, in a performance subtly combining feminine vulnerability and heroic tenacity. And no one would have expected the film to have a binary structure with a classic serial-killer's investigation in one hand, and a subplot involving one of the greatest movie villains of all-time and his interaction with the heroine, on the other.The script is tightly constructed, patiently leading us to assemble each piece of the puzzle until the series of interactions between Clarice and Hannibal approaches a disturbing truth. The relationship between the two leads is even more fascinating because it deepens their personalities and allows us to get more and more in their background : the wounds in Clarice's past, the mystery around Hannibal Lecter, and the roots of evil that inspired the serial killers' acts. And this is where the freshness of the film relies on : its capability to put everything into perspective and invite our perceptions to go beyond the simple 'good vs. evil' dichotomy. The villain are no sharks, no monsters, no possessing demons, they are everyday men, like some Norman Bates with an extra level of savagery and pervert creativity and we try to understand to better fight them.",The Silence of the Lambs

1061,oni013,"Watch this BEFORE reading the book, or watching Red Dragon",5,13 December 2006,"Having read both Red Dragon and Silence of the Lambs, and having seen the movie adaptations of each (in that order), this movie was somewhat disappointing to me. My two major complaints are with the pace and with some of the acting.To start, the pace of the movie as compared to the book is cut all to hell. Of course things would need to be shortened or refitted from novel to feature length movie, but much of the insight into several characters and their relationships is either rushed or utterly lost. Jack Crawford's personal back story, for instance, is completely left out; this leaves Scott Glen nothing to work with, though we know from past roles that he is at least an able actor Jodie Foster is contemptible as Clarice Starling. In T. Harris's well-written book, she is portrayed as frustrated and sometimes disturbed, but able, rebellious and determined. In this movie she is almost constantly falling apart and is barely able to keep herself together. Further, the reason for involving her so heavily in the case, while addressed in the book, is never properly explained here.To the movie's credit, and ironically, the characters we are supposed to like least are the most believable, and provoke the most reaction: Ted Levine as Buffalo Bill, Anthony Heald as Dr. Chilton and of course Anthony Hopkins as Hannibal Lecter.With a change of director, and screenwriter Ted Tally's growth over 11 years, Red Dragon is much more reflective of its source material, much more insightful, has a much better lead actor and is simply better all around. One will enjoy this movie as a thriller IF one does not first read the book, or see the much more ably-handled Red Dragon.",The Silence of the Lambs

The parts that had Hannibal and Clarice were the best parts of the movie I loved the whole movie, but the cat and mouse game was the best. I love the way they make Hannibal Lecter, this ""monster"" but at the same time he doesn't like rudeness and when your ""disrespectful"" sorta speak.I just love the Hannibal Lecter character in general and how they have Anthony Hopkins playing the character, honestly if it were anyone else I don't think I'd watch it. Anthony Hopkins just plays a very good psychopath.Jodie Foster is amazing at playing Clarice starling. I thought her character was amazing as well. usually when you have a women as a detective or any other role they're very annoying and whiny, but Clarice is kind of a tough character, she doesn't let a lot of things get to her. This movie is just the definition of excellent movie. I find this movie to be the best movie of 1991.",The Silence of the Lambs
1063,PeterZZ,The Lambs Can Never be Silenced,10,9 July 2005,"If you want a movie to watch in the dark, look no further than The Silence of the Lambs. Jonathan Demme's tense thriller combines excellent actors and a wonderfully adapted screenplay to make, what seems to be one of the best, if not the best, thrillers of all time.The film follows three main stories, those being that of rookie FBI agent, Clarice Starling, the psychopath murderer Buffalo Bill and imprisoned psychiatrist Dr. Hannibal Lecter, imprisoned for murder and cannibalism. Clarice is sent to Dr. Lecter to attempt to gain information on Buffalo Bill, because he was a former patient of Hannibal, however all Hannibal is interested in is getting inside Clarice's head. As the film goes on Clarice becomes more deeply involved in the case, right up to the dramatic and excellent climax, as well as Hannibal becoming more deeply involved in Clarice's mind. Meanwhile Buffalo Bill continues his murderous spree, killing and skinning women.This movie is like no other. It combines tenses scenes with a cast like no other. Anthony Hopkins was born to be Hannibal, and why Michelle Pfeiffer was originally suggested for the role of Clarice over Jodie Foster is bizarre, but because Jodie Foster got the role, it doesn't really matter. When it comes to violence this film is very intense. There are some graphically violent scenes, however the worst violence in the film is the mental violence. Hannibal's ability to destroy someone mentally, is incredibly disturbing, and the films motives are pretty full on. However this contributes to the films overall feel of horror, which is why The Silence of the Lambs is one of the most mentally frightening films of all time.Stars: 10/10",The Silence of the Lambs

In some ways, the suspense and the build-up to scenes is quite ""old school"" and proves that this approach still works. There are has been a lot of analysis why this film is so powerful. One talks about how Hannibal Lecter only appears for a very brief time in the movie, yet others talk about him and build him up, how some of the set pieces refer to our deep psychological fears...in the end, it works well, and I would highly recommend it. I have read critics who say that the killer Clarice is pursuing is too stereotypical, or simplistic. I would beg to differ: I find that that character too is quite scary, though doesn't have the three-dimensional nature of Hannibal Lecter. And what of Clarice? she is brave, and even though it was made in the 90s, I think this film is still one of the first I saw with a woman as lead detective. Full marks to the script, and the book of course, because Clarice is quite fallible, not perfect, and this makes the story more real and unsettling. We're fighting in her corner, as it were, but we're not sure if she will win, unlike other male-dominated movies. And one personal quirk: watch out for Tom Petty's song, ""American Girl"", I found the usage interesting, fun and ironic, and the song has stuck in my head post the movie.",The Silence of the Lambs

Buffalo Bill is the perfect mix of Ed Gein, Ted Bundy, Gary Heidnik, Edmund Kemper, etc. Even though it is mainly a serious movie, it does have some funny parts to it which gives a genuine but interesting outlook to what all of these serial killers actually did.

The film has a gripping narrative throughout, with good and exceptional performances and a beautiful score.The storyline follows an FBI agent in training (Jodie Foster), who has been sent to interview the renowned cannibalistic psychiatrist (Anthony Hopkins) in an insane asylum. I'm pretty sure almost everyone knows the basic plot, but what I found deeply gripping in this film is the way that both Jodie Foster and Anthony Hopkins give such believable, raw, emotional performances, which really drew me into the narrative.

1078,harryw-22205,A Sophisticated Thriller,10,25 October 2016,"Silence of the Lambs is a crime thriller brought from page to the big screen by director Jonathan Demme and Is, in my opinion, his greatest film. It is by far the best film of the Hannibal Lectre series and picked itself up a total of five Oscars including best picture. Jodie Foster's portrayal of Clarice Starling is definitely for me one of the greatest female performances of all time. Clarice Starling had very intriguing character development from a sensitive police student to a proud detective who solved the case of the murderous Buffalo Bill, however we are still left to wonder whether the lambs are still screaming. Anthony Hopkins also knocked the ball out of the park with a very disturbing portrayal of one of the most infamous movie characters of all time: Hannibal Lectre. His soft cunning voice in contrast to his cruel vindictive words sent chills down my spine and injected a dose of anxiety into my veins. This film, for me, defines the careers of Jodie Foster and Anthony Hopkins with both of them picking up Oscars for best actor and best actress. One thing for me that stood out about this film was the fact that it did not rely on gore to progress the narrative which in hands of some directors would have been the case. The Silence of the Lambs contains great dialogue, specifically between Clarice and Hannibal to which really drove the narrative without it been boring. Not knowing whether Hammbial is speaking the truth or in anagrams was extremely gripping and seeing Clarice trying to maintain her professionalism was at times painful to watch ( in a good way! ). Antagonist Buffalo Bill, portrayed by the great Ted Levine, really stroke fear into my system and was an intriguing character to learn about. The pinnacle scene in which he follows Clarice in the the dark almost caused me to have a stroke, literally! I genuinely was unsure Clarice was going to survive and also the experience of seeing this play out in the POV of Bill was quite hard to maintain however a very effective decision from Demme. There are hardly any negative criticism I can give towards this film except from the fact that I wish that it explained Hannibals motives in a bit more detail. Although he allowed the plot to excel and fulfilled his purpose of leaving chills in the spines of the characters and the audience, I wish that we could of had a little bit more context on him. Sure this is nit picking but I've got to find some sort of criticism.

""Bill"" and his kidnapped young woman are sick and profane people, respectively, and their scenes are very unpleasant. This movie is not for the squeamish with those and other scenes involving the infamous Dr. Hannibal Lecter (Hopkins). There also is some extreme crudeness in the jail/dungeon where Lecter and other inmates are held.Jodie Foster is excellent as the FBI agent ""Clarice Starling"" and Scott Glenn is low-key and effective as ""Jack Crawford."" A major part of the film is psychological more than violent as Lecter constantly taunts ""Clarice,"" while she tries her best to manipulate him to help with a case. The by- play between the two is a game in itself.Hopkins, however, is the actor people remember best from this movie. His portrayal of the refined- yet-cannibalistic serial killer-doctor is one viewers will never forget. I've enjoyed watching him in the sequels, too. The looks on his face, his fascinating vocabulary with intelligent sarcasm and frankness, never ceases to entertain.""Silence Of The Lambs"" has turned into a modern-day ""classic.""

The movie was shot using an old Hitchcock technique using close ups to capture detailed emotions in the character's faces. Some films you subconsciously think about where the camera is sitting or envision a film set or actors on the other side. Not this. Its as if you dive into a trance of another fictional world and forget that you're watching a film. To top it off the score is highly underrated composed by none other than Howard Shore. Who would go on later to compose The Lord of the Rings. My favorite scene from the film is the very end with Clarice and Lecter's phone call and seeing him walk off into the distance only to disappear into the crowd. Genius ending.

The scene in which the movie tricks you into thinking Jodie Foster, also known as Clarice Starling, is in one house or approaching one house (I can't remember) when she's really in another is well done and has tricked me more than once, which means even once I had already seen the movie it had the ability to draw me in so that I forgot to remember that the movie was going to try and trick me.

The performances of Hopkins and Foster were so real you forgot it was a movie you were watching and not real events and they truly deserved the Oscars they picked up for their roles. I suggest you also watch Manhunter which is based on the prequel to the novel Silence of the Lambs, Red Dragon, which has a Dr. Lecktor in it.

To name them here wouldn't help, I guess. Anyway, the movie was very boring and I didn't get nightmares like a classmate of my son.

1114,sergiogold,The Silence of the Lambs captures the attention like no other and doesn't let go,9,3 June 2019,"It isn't easy humanizing a cannibalistic serial killer into an engaging and charming person, but Jonathan Demme's The Silence of the Lambs accomplishes this and more. This is a thrilling edge-of-your-seat classic that is a must-watch for all film fanatics.The film follows Clarice Starling (Jodie Foster), an intelligent and driven young woman studying at the FBI Academy for behavioral sciences. She is given the task by FBI director Jack Crawford (Scott Glenn) of interviewing convicted cannibalistic serial killer Dr. Hannibal Lecter, a cunning and brilliant psychiatrist nicknamed ""Hannibal the cannibal"". The FBI is tasked with apprehending serial killer Buffalo Bill (Ted Levine), who has murdered and skinned five women before dumping their bodies into rivers. The FBI hopes that Dr. Lecter's perceptive mind can assist them in finding Buffalo Bill's true identity.The Silence of the Lambs is a great film even for those who are not fond of traditional horror movies. Director Jonathan Demme has a way of captivating the viewer's interest in the story through intelligent writing and an interesting plot. This is not a film with simple jump scares or supernatural creatures but instead other aspects are what make the film feel immensely suspenseful and thrilling.What makes the film so captivating and gripping throughout is the brilliant cinematography work. The most effective shot that is used is the close-up shot which makes the scene feel chillingly still. Also, during the tensest action scenes, particularly the final climax, the camera work keeps the viewer on edge and guessing.Anthony Hopkins performed terrifically and made the iconic Hannibal Lecter we know today. His composed manner added layers of personality and intrigue to the character. From the famous introduction scene in his cell, to his skillful escape scene, Hopkins is completely outstanding and leaves the viewer craving his appearance more. Jodie Foster delivered superbly and made Clarice Starling into a character the audience wanted to root for. Her character was strong, determined, and capable, but still showed she had flaws and vulnerabilities and Foster displayed this in a great manner. The acting across the board was a success making this film, at the very least, a watchable spectacle.The score by Howard Shore is ominous and enhances the suspense of many key parts. He sets the tone throughout the film and provides a truly unnerving experience for the audience.The way the film slowly reveals more and more information keeps the audience engaged. The way information is revealed leaves the audience to derive things out for themselves which feels rewarding. The film is also packed with deep symbolism and foreshadowing which makes the film watchable even after viewing it several times.The film may not have been perfect: there were some parts of the film that unnecessarily slowed the plot of the movie, however, the overall story was quite easy to follow. The rare parts where the acting was somewhat lacking was during the scuffles in the action scenes. This shortfall, though, is largely mitigated by the outstanding camera work that the film provides.This is a unique film that has created various iconic scenes and is deserving of high praise. One modern-day film with similar characteristics is M. Night Shyamalan's ""Split"", however, The Silence of the Lambs still feels like a unique experience in its entirety. From the exceptional actors to the excellent staff behind the camera, this film has all the makings of a terrific thriller.",The Silence of the Lambs

I find his skills phenomenal and I am hoping that he will make many more films! His gifts to the world through his talent is beyond compare and I hope he lives forever!

Well what can i say about Anthony Hopkins he just was superb he played the part so well in the sense of keeping you intrigued of what he was going to ask or say to Clarice next.

1130,t-14162,The Silence of the Lambs,10,22 January 2020,"Director, Jonathan Demme has created a pure masterpiece with The Silence of the Lambs. The suspenseful mystery has an exciting plot along with Oscar winning acting performances. I found The Silence of the Lambs to be a perfect balance between horror and crime. The thoughtful and witty way the movie is put together leaves viewers at the edge of their seats for the whole hour and fifty eight minutes.
The Silence of the Lambs is about the FBI working with a convicted serial killer to catch an active serial killer. The convict, Dr. Hannibal Lector, is a killer who is known for eating parts of his victims after killing them. Although he is a psychopath, Dr. Lector is extremely intelligent so the FBI wants to study him. The young FBI student, Clarice Starling is sent in to try and talk to Dr. Lector. While meeting him for the first time Clarice discovers that Dr. Lector has information on the known serial killer, Buffalo Bill. Following this discovery, agent Starling makes it her mission to find out what Dr. Lecter knows about Buffalo Bill. Through this process Clarice learns a lot about Dr. Lecter and about herself.
The biggest part to this movie's success is its uniqueness. No other movie can directly compare to the genius of the plotline and the pure skill in the acting. The Silence of the Lambs is about the psychology of serial killers to try and help people to understand why they do what they do. The truth is that there is no way for most normal people to understand this because it is insane. Most of all I found that The Silence of the Lambs is a film about personal redemption. I first saw this when Clarice talks to Dr. Lecter about her childhood. She talks about why she wanted to be in the FBI and how as a child she tried to save a lamb from being slaughtered. She heard the lambs screaming and she thought that if she just saved one of the lambs she would feel better. Clarice feels the same way about the girl that was kidnapped as she did about the lambs. Clarice thinks that if she saves the missing girl she won't hear the screams of the lambs waiting to be slaughtered anymore. This is where the title of the movie comes in and the profoundness of the plot becomes apparent.
My only complaint for this movie is that the supporting acting was a bit weak at times. The police scenes and a few miscellaneous other scenes seemed a bit cheesy. Nevertheless, the main actors save the day with fantastic performances all around. Jodie Foster does an amazing job as Clarice Starling with the emotion and the pure confidence shown. Yet Anthony Hopkins as Hannibal Lector steals the show. His dead stares in the close ups and the way he can sound insane but intellectual at the same time is amazing. Hopkins acts flawlessly in one of the toughest roles someone can be in. In my eyes, Hopkins as Dr. Lector rivals Jack Nicholson's role in The Shining.
The Silence of the Lambs was a success because of its creative storyline and its remarkable acting. I believe any fans of the horror genre or anyone looking for a good thriller with a tremendous plot would love this movie. However I will warn that if you aren't a fan of parts of people's faces being eaten off this may not be the movie for you.",The Silence of the Lambs
1131,b-51696,Are the lambs actually silent?,9,22 January 2020,"Are the Lambs Actually Silent?
Silence of the Lambs is a classic psychological thriller film that everybody hears about. The film was based on a psychological horror novel written by Thomas Harris in 1988. The film was directed by Jonathan Demme, he won an Academy Award for Best Director for Silence of The Lambs. The film made $273 million worldwide after it was released on February 14, 1991, making $14 million its opening weekend.
The film takes place in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania in 1991. A young FBI agent in training named Clarice Starling (Jodie Foster) is asked by Jack Crawford (Scott Glenn), to interview Dr. Hannibal Lecter (Anthony Hopkins), who is known for being a forensic psychiatrist, also as a cannibalistic serial killer. Jack is in charge of her and giving her a chance to help with the case. While Dr. Lecter is locked up in a state hospital for the criminally insane, Starling and her superiors think that he can help them find another serial killer named Buffalo Bill (Ted Levine).
Starling keeps going back to talk to Dr. Lecter and he helps her break down the case of the other serial killer. While they talk he made her talk about her childhood in exchange for information about Buffalo Bill. He then goes and gets transferred to Baltimore to talk to the senator and he tells them who Buffalo Bill is. Clarice then goes back to talk about what he said before when they were talking about her childhood, she reveals what haunts her the most.
Since this film is a psychological thriller, it uses low angle lighting to show how scary and sinister Dr. Lecter is when talking to Clarice. A good majority of the scenes with Dr. Lecter are shots with low lighting. The actress that played Clarice Starling (Jodie Foster) was remarkable with her acting and how she portrayed the character. She won awards for her great contributions to the film. Along with her co-star who played the character Dr. Hannibal Lecter (Anthony Hopkins), won awards for his role and acting. The film uses many close up shots of the characters to show their emotions and maybe get some from the audience. Most of the close up shots are when the two Starling and Lecter are talking. They had good makeup and costumes to show who the characters are and the blood made it more thrilling.
The characters showed a lot of emotions in this film. It felt like I was there with them and I couldn't look away. Some of the characters I did not like because of what dialogue they had. I thought that one particular character didn't need to say what she said because it made me not like her as a character, but she did have some good lines that made sense in the situation that she was in.
This film is thrilling, haunting, and suspenseful. It takes the audience through the mind the cannibalistic serial killer, Dr. Hannibal Lecter and what his thoughts are. This film sucks you in and wants you to keep watching because the characters are so fascinating and have many dynamics to their characteristics. Silence of the Lambs is a film that I highly recommend seeing if you like thrillers with some gore.",The Silence of the Lambs

It stands as my favorite film not only in the thriller/suspense genre, but of all films in existence. The story is original and never goes stale, all of the characters are interesting, the dialogue between the bright, young Clarice Starling and the maniacal, manipulative Hannibal Lecter is phenomenal. Hannibal Lecter is one of the most terrifying characters in film due to his extreme intelligence and disturbing habits. The camera work in this movie is also outstanding, especially toward the climax of the film, when the florist is ringing the doorbell; that's all I will say as to not give it away, but it throws you for a loop. Who can forget the eery ""Goodbye Horses"" tune with the infamous dance? The climax will have you on the edge of your seat, just waiting to jump.

Foster on the other hand...is just annoying with her accent and general demeanor. She truly was like a lamb when speaking to Lecter which might be intentional but is just annoying. I also get that the shots were filmed in a way to make the space look smaller and more close up to amp up the anxiety but there were so many cuts, close ups etc. that again were annoying.

1147,yarikkrivbas,This is one of the best movies I have ever seen.,10,3 August 2020,"""The Silence of the Lambs"" is a one of the best Thriller, that I can seen. Its a great movie with interesting story of rookie FBI agent Clarice Starling (Jodie Foster) is assigned to get into the mind of notorious incarcerated serial killer Dr Hannibal 'the Cannibal' Lecter (Anthony Hopkins) to get his evaluation on the elusive 'Buffalo Bill', a serial killer. It's the third film in history to win Academy Awards in all the top five categories: Best Picture, Best Actor, Best Actress, Best Director, and Adapted Screenplay and that imply something about its technical quality as a film.
This movie takes the vision of one of the most imaginative directors on Earth (Jonathan Demme) with a brilliant cast including Thomas Harris novel that was adapted from it.Final Score: 9/10",The Silence of the Lambs

1152,bevsoccer,Horrifying and Beautiful,10,6 December 2020,After watching this movie my expectations for future films are more demanding. I'll only be satisfied by complex characters like the ones that appear in this movie.From the moment Dr. Lecter makes his first appearance you are automatically captivated. How can such an intelligent and well mannered person commit such atrocious crimes? You root for the guy! Clarice Starling is also an amazing character. I love how she doesn't quit. Don't even get me started about Buffalo Bill. That monster gave me the creeps!It's scary knowing people are capable of doing such things!,The Silence of the Lambs
1153,waheedeverx,An awesome,10,14 April 2011,"I think its so hard for a such stars like Anthony Hopkins and Jodie to produce Crime,Thriller movie at this time..Silence of the Lambs is a heart-racing thriller that has arguably one of the most interesting characters in cinema history, Hannibal Lector, a famous psychologist who also has Antisocial Personality Disorder. Hannibal Lector is played by Anthony Hopkins and at the beginning of the movie, he is approached by a young, rising FBI agent, named Clarice Starling, played by Jodie Foster. Clarice has come to interview Hannibal, because she is currently on the hunt for a serial killer, nicknamed Buffalo Bill, who kidnaps young women and skins them in order to make a ""suit"" made out of human skin. Since he is both a psychiatrist and a ruthless killer himself, Hannibal is the perfect person to ask for help to catch Buffalo Bill, and the rest of the movie is devoted to Hannibal's relationship with Clarice as he helps her catch Buffalo Bill and as he toys with her psychologically.Hannibal Lector only appears on screen for 16 minutes and yet, he has such a commanding presence over the entire movie. Before the viewer even meets Hannibal, we hear that he is manipulative, dangerous, a monster, and a cannibal, and yet, when the viewer finally has the opportunity of meeting him, he appears genuine and even caring. However, it soon become evident that this charming persona is only a disguise used to get what he wants, whether that is his freedom or traumatic memories from Clarice's childhood. He has no trouble tricking people into trusting him, and seems to enjoy that he is able to cleverly manipulate people to get what he wants from them. On top of that, he is rude and makes very offensive remarks towards others without any regard to how offensive his comments are. Again, he seems to enjoy being able to offend people so much with the words. Finally, perhaps the most telling of all is his murderous nature. Hannibal enjoys eating people (cleverly nicknamed Hannibal the Cannibal), and had been arrested for serving his dinner guests the liver from a man who he had killed. In one scene, he is seen brutally attacking two guards, biting off one person's cheek and then savagely beating the other to death, and then after the killing of both guards, he begins to sway peacefully to the classical music that had been playing in the background. It was the exact same persona as he saw him standing in his cell when we first meet him, cool, calm, and collected, thus indicating his complete lack of guilt for the serious crime that he had just committed.As I said above, the movie does an excellent job of creating Hannibal Lector, and his behaviors are consistent and similar to the behaviors of people who have Antisocial Personality Disorder. Like most other people with this psychological disorder, Hannibal shows no remorse for hurting others, especially the people who gets in his way, and he is certainly fine with committing murder. He manipulates people to get what he wants and amuses himself by offending and toying around with others, displaying a common symptom of people with Antisocial Personality Disorder, a disregard for other people's rights.Silence of the Lambs would have been an excellent movie if it only had Anthony Hopkins' performance as Hannibal Lector, but it also has a great performance from Jodie Foster and an unbelievably well shot movie. It is definitely worth watching, and it does a good job with showing how creepy and scary a person with Antisocial Personality Disorder can be.",The Silence of the Lambs

Though, at the end, I felt Hannibal's character was being, not changed, just removed. Anthony Hopkins seemed to give Hannibal parts of his own personality. Jodie Foster did an A+ job, both acting and making himself seem like the country, Virginia girl that Clarice was. I was enthralled by her accent, sometimes slipping, but usually crisp and precise.The directing, though a tad overrated, was superb, as an understatement. The acting of Ted Levine was the most interesting of them all. His voice and character played along almost seamlessly with the progression of the film. Never before have I been so convinced that an actor had, himself, lost his sanity, along with the character he was playing. The lotion scene made me laugh, while making me want to claw my eyes out. How he could be so calm, talking ""Baby-talk"" to his dog, and at the same time have to listen to a woman screaming for him to let her go, is beyond my sense of understanding. I commend them all on a job well, well done.Though, I'm not sure how old you should be when you first watch this, I was 13 and enjoyed it immensely.

That was the day I picked to quit smoking and I knew this movie would take my mind off that matter. I was expecting an intense movie and I got it. Little did I realize how well-received this film would be and how it propelled Anthony Hopkins to super-stardom.Jodie Foster is excellent as the FBI agent ""Clarice Starling"" A major part of the film is psychological more than violent as Lecter constantly taunts ""Clarice,"" while she tries her best to manipulate him to help with a case. The by-play between the two is a game in itself.Hopkins, however, is the actor people remember best from this movie. His portrayal of the refined-yet-cannibalistic serial killer-doctor is one viewers will never forget. I've enjoyed watching him in the sequels, too. The looks on his face, his fascinating vocabulary with intelligent sarcasm and frankness, never ceases to entertain.

1163,cdhuff9,Basically garbage,3,13 September 2001,"Well, I had only seen this film once, back in high school, and was quite drunk the first time, so I didn't remember it very well.....so, I thought I'd check it out with its new ""special edition"" release and see what all the hoopla is about.  I mean, it was named Best Picture, it has two excellent lead actors (Foster and Hopkins), and it's gotten nothing but praise and good ratings on the IMDb site, so why not take a look?Here's why:  it was very poorly shot.  The script was a pretty good idea, but very, very predictable and formulaic.  Foster's performance was overstated, and, while the Hopkins role was very well-done, every single other character in the film was VERY poorly played.  The dialogue was ridiculous.Half of the movie was shot without any actual ""acting"" going on; people were just talking to the camera in close-up, and their editing was supposed to make us feel like these people were actually having an exchange of some kind (does anyone think that Foster and Hopkins were ever on the set together, simultaneously, at any point?).The actual villain of the film, ""Buffalo Bill,"" is given no background at all except for a few very unrealistic newspaper clippings, from which we are expected to gather something.  This is the equivalent of countless crappy Lifetime movies establishing past relationships between people by panning past photographs of people standing together, while piano plays in the background.  This guy isn't frightening, menacing, or even suspenseful in the slightest.The largest amount of actual entertainment in the film consists of how all the cops act.  If the rest of the movie weren't so poorly made, I'd like to think that the director was making them so comical and silly on purpose; maybe trying to make a point of some kind.  But, judging from the rest of the film, Demme probably thought he was portraying these people accurately.""Silence of the Lambs"" isn't one of the worst movies ever made, but it is certainly much farther from being one of the best.  All the little details thrown in, the ones that actually let us see just what the director is actually doing with the film, are stupid (like the cat waiting in the window when the girl gets kidnapped----it growls as the van drives off.......ridiculous).  What little action there is in the film is purely by-the-book, industry-standard, average garbage (save for the scene where Hopkins grabs the guard and sucks his face---that was far below average).If you've never seen this movie, but you've seen some other detective/killer/suspense film sometime in the past 20 years, don't bother. It's certainly not up to the level it's touted at.  If you saw the movie once, while in junior high or high school, and you think maybe your film tastes have matured since then, watch it again.  I think you'll see what I mean.I just can't imagine what the people (those that consider themselves to be knowledgeable film critics) were thinking in 1991.  Best Picture.  Doesn't speak well for the other movies released that year.  I wonder.........",The Silence of the Lambs

Anthony Hopkins, a long-time workaday actor, suddenly found himself 'discovered' and was rocketed to near superstar status when he walked away with an Oscar for his work as Hannibal Lector. And deservedly so. His Lector is one of the most skin-crawling, unnervingly chilling villains in screen history. It's not a far stretch to suggest that the plethora of roles he nabbed following his work in SotL would never have happened were it not for this film. Director Jonathan Demme, who has a long career of music videos, TV work, mainstream films and a surprising number of documentaries, truly made a name for himself with this piece. It takes a certain flair to turn such grisly stuff into acceptable product for the masses, and not lose the jagged edge in the process. Jodie Foster, in an excellent turn as emotionally damaged FBI agent Clarice Starling, had a brief re-ignition of her acting career thanks to this picture. Everything about the film clicks. It's amazingly well done, and even though the subject matter is understandably off-putting, it's hard not to be drawn in to the grim proceedings.",The Silence of the Lambs

Each time you revise a masterpiece, you are afraid of the dark, hypnotized by Hopkins, terrified by Bill, worried about Starling, but you just cannot comprehend where the content dog is buried.

1187,gundamangus,Summary,10,24 January 2008,"(To Readers: I am forced to write this article for an English writing assessment, I personally liked the FilM VERY MUCH!!!)In recent years, Hong Kong became flooded by countless numbers of horror movies involving bloody and violent scene. If you are a fan of this, you might be in favor of this film directed by Jonathan Demme.I personally liked horror (or more precisely , thriller movies, such as Stanely Kubrick's THE SHINING) films, which aim at producing a thrilling atmosphere, but not actually showing one. THE SILENCE OF THE LAMBS is an excellent example of the kind of thrillers showing shocking scenes. The plot was fine and suspending. However, it was screwed up by the over-emphasis Hannibal Lecter's violence (the scene of the guard being disemboweled and hung on the wall was notorious for causing discomfort).Another aspect we can take a look at is about the preproduction of the movie Maybe due to the over-emphasis of violence in the script written by Ted Tally, Gene Hackman an actor who was originally invited to become the director of the film, turned downed the invitation in the end. Even in looking for actors playing the roles of CLARICE STARLING and HANNIBAL LECTER has been a great difficulty for the production. Four actresses (including Michelle Pfeiffer, Kim Basinger, Emma Thompson and Meg Ryan) rejected the invitation due to 'the subject matter', as Michelle Pfeiffer said. Sean Connery was originally offered the role of Hannible, but in the end, he refused. Thus we can see from the responses of the actors and actresses that have refused to play a role in the movie, that it is focusing too much on violence.In addition, some main features such as Hannibal's 'maroon eyes' and his 'six-fingered left hand', were missing in the movie. With such advanced technology nowadays, these special features can be made real without any difficulties.Although I really did not enjoy the movie (probably the unforgettable bloody scene have created a bad image for me), I would recommend this movie to those who enjoy bloody thrillers, as the violent scenes will leave you nightmares lasting at least a month.",The Silence of the Lambs

It didn't even come close to being real and the last part of the film (where she (an Fbi trainee, a 5 foot something woman) single handedly takes down the serial killer) was sooo unreal! I could not even make myself laugh! (Watch out for the way she shakes her hand in fear its one of the most, distant from reality acting caught on film). In my opinion she was a big miscast.

1191,yog2302,Best Novel to Movie Adaption,9,16 June 2013,"A tight-wound thriller, and sequel to Thomas Harris' 1981 novel Red Dragon (though the movie Red Dragon came almost a decade later on this movie's shoulders), this is quite simply one of the best novel to movie adaptations till date. It can be easily compared with great adaptations like To Kill a Mocking Bird, One Flew Over Cuckoo's Nest, Lord of the Rings Trilogy among others. Coming to the characters, 'Hannibal' played so dexterously and chillingly by Anthony Hopkins still gives me the creeps, with good all round performances by others. Jodie Foster as an FBI trainee plays her role to perfection in finding a serial killer with Hannibal's help. 'Buffalo Bill' played by Ted Levine has also done great job in his portrayal as a psychopath killer whom the FBI is searching for.The plot is simple yet the viewer simply can not escape the tension throughout the movie. There are enough twists and turns to keep the viewer glued to the movie. You wait for Hannibal to come on screen in the same way you wait for dinosaurs to come in the Jurassic Park. The direction is impeccable and editing is spot on. The suspense is brilliantly maintained and the sound track adds to the atmosphere.No wonders this movie won all the major academy awards for the year including best actor to Anthony Hopkins.If you have not watched this movie and even if you are not a fan of horror or suspense movies, you are certainly missing one of the best creations in the history of cinema.

1193,willib07,great film.,9,31 October 2009,"Braden Williamson Assignment 5-5 HUMN 246The Silence of the Lambs has gradually become one the highest acclaimed thriller/horror films ever made. The film goes beyond the typical blood and gore of most horror movies, using dialogue and subjective camera angles to draw the viewer closer to the suspense. When Clarice Starling (Jodie Foster) is interviewing Hannibal Lector (Anthony Hopkins), the subjective camera angle makes the viewer feel as if they are in Starling's place and staring into the face of a psychopath. This cinematography makes the film feel like it has a first person perspective. The angles and subjective viewpoints also illustrate what it is like for Starling in a male-dominated profession.The theme of The Silence of the Lambs is facing your fear. It faces the fear that Clarice has of the lambs that she hears in her head, the fear she has that she won't be able to save Buffalo Bill's captive, Catherine. There is also the fear that is felt when Lector or Buffalo Bill merely appears on the screen. The theme ultimately climaxes when everything is seen through Bill's night vision lenses and the audience is on the edge of their seats as Clarice may or may not meet her demise. Although Hopkins and Foster are both A-list Hollywood actors, they both have an organic, real world demeanor about them which make the story much more believable because it feels like a real FBI agent is talking to an actual criminal instead of a starlet talking with a playboy. The on location scenes that were used for a majority of the film, according to the documentary that accompanied the film, made the FBI headquarters, the psychiatric facility and even Bill's home feel like actual landmarks in a serial killer's rampage. Nothing makes a movie feel more authentic and real than rough-grain film stock. The color of the film was not too bright, and with the shadows and lighting to keep the mood drab, dull, and depressing the film was able to really develop effectively.The subjective camera angles, dark mood, and lighting set a tone that has made The Silence of the Lambs the great film that it is. Before this film was released horror films used physical suspense to scare the audience but Lambs takes the physical suspense and raises it to new heights by reinforcing it with suspense built simply through the dialogue between Lector and Starling. Many films since this one have tried to add multiple layers of depth in order to make the movie better but more times than not, it just isn't applicable to the film. Fear is something that is always around us but we try our best to avoid it, The Silence of the Lambs takes fear and forces us to examine the worst types of people through an empathetic view. This is what makes it such a great fil",The Silence of the Lambs
1194,catt4443,Film Review,10,1 November 2009,"In the movie, Silence of the Lambs, the FBI is trying to catch serial killers and learn how his mind works. The FBI sends a trainee, Agent Clarice Starling, who is played by Jodi Foster, to interview the infamous, Dr. Hannibal Lecter, who is played by Anthony Hopkins. Lecter is a cannibalistic psychiatrist. The FBI's beliefs are it takes one to know one, speaking of Lecter, knowing how the serial killer mind works, in order to catch Buffalo Bill. Buffalo Bill is murdering women across the country. The theme develops as Lecter agrees to help only if Starling will feed his morbid curiosity about her own personal life. The director uses memory flashbacks to illustrate Starling's demons. As Lecter forces her to face her own demons in life, she begins to realize how diabolical Lecter is and how bad evil can be. Lecter gets in her mind, in her thoughts, and the evil is so strong she does not think she can stop it. Along with Lecter getting into Starling's thoughts, she gets into his mind as well. Lecter has a chance to kill her and doesn't and he even calls her in the end to congratulate her on graduating from school to become an FBI agent. Being one of the scariest movies ever put into film Silence of the Lambs, keeps you on the edge of your seat for the duration of the film. Unlike many scary movies there is little gore and shock value instances, there is more of the thought of real evil, things that really go bump in the night. The director, Jonathan Demee, uses several things to keep the viewer interested in the movie, to keep you wandering when something is going to occur. The movie keeps its intensiveness because of the lighting, off camera sound effects, and the design of the sets. Some specific examples start right from the beginning such as the music as Sterling walks to the cell of Lecter is intense making the viewer feel like something is going to happen as she walks. The laughing and yelling of the prisons as she walks away put off a nervous feeling making the viewer feel like they are there. The lighting in the prison is dark and dreary; the brick walls make it seem lonely and cold. There is rust on the heater making it seem unattended to. Lecter's dialogue is very well developed with his eyes so intense, so cold, evil, again keeping your full attention to the movie, making references to the way he ate his victims. The camera angels in close when there are conversations with Hannibal, The lighting is above him to put shadows on his face making him appear more evil. These types of preludes to the way the movie is going to unfold continue throughout the movie, making sure the viewer is on edge, scared, and nervous throughout the duration of the movie like the intense music during the abduction of the women. This movie reminds me a lot of the movie ""Kiss the Girls"" with Morgan Freeman and Ashley Judd, in it. The theme is similar as to serial killers abducting woman and a psychologist helping the police find the man who did it. In Kiss the Girls, Ashley Judd is the psychologist and she gets abducted, once she escapes she helps the police with the search, in turn finding another series of abductions further away with a similar signature. Both movies are suspenseful thrillers, although the director in Silence of the Lambs is much more successful in making the movie horrifying than the director of Kiss the Girls. He makes you scared, clenching to your seat, and makes you feel as though you are their.",The Silence of the Lambs

They were all confirmed.Hopkins is awe inspiring as Lecter, Levine is disturbing as Gumb, the lighting is dark and creates a chilling atmosphere, and the score is as powerful as Lecter himself.However, I have several gripes with this film. The biggest is the fact that after Lecter escapes, the film grinds to a halt. It takes a good while for the film to pick up again, but thankfully it does. Also, the reason why Lecter is taken from his original cell to the one he escapes from is not really clear.But, this is a masterpiece of a film, disturbing, chilling and thrilling all at the same time, with a majesty that rivals and maybe even surpasses the master of the genre, Alfred Hitchcock.",The Silence of the Lambs

It's a great film to break down and understand the basic tenets of movie-making and storytelling. One of the best parts of the film, in my opinion, stems from the adept chose of shots. We are brought into the intimate world of Agent Sterling. We not only learn about her past through the perceptions of Lector, but Jonathan Demme, pulls into a world dominated by the sexual nature of men, and it's viewpoint from the eyes of Sterling. Rather than opt for simple wide, medium, and close coverage the director chooses to give us the vantage point of the main character, especially through the copious amounts of POV shots taken throughout the film. This is only heightened when you realize Demme wanted the audience to appreciate the perspective of a woman in an environment where men are prominent and dominant.

1201,honeyandmango,Crisp and brilliant,10,24 April 2011,"The Silence of the Lambs (1991) reigns supreme as one of the greatest thriller movies of all time. Jonathan Demme reaches cinematic perfection by combining writing, direction and acting of the highest calibre together to form a classic that blows the usual mediocre thriller out of the water. The film tells the story of young FBI Agent Clarice Starling (Jodie Foster) and her quest to help find the serial killer Buffalo Bill. To find Buffalo Bill, Starling requires the help of Dr Hannibal Lecter (Anthony Hopkins), a brilliant psychiatrist who is imprisoned for his cannibalistic behaviour.The Silence of the Lambs is excellent in all aspects of production and form. The dialogue is crisp, poignant and always essential, resulting in a film that is pulse-racing and highly absorbing. The presence of pretentious or stilted dialogue is negated early on in the movie, Clarice referring to a contrived reference as ""too hokey for Lecter"". Never a dull moment, the Silence of the Lambs is masterfully suspenseful as Hannibal Lecter is always one step ahead; his omnipotence, humour and theatrics providing the audience with a villain that is as charming and likable as he is perturbing. The performances are incredible; Hopkins unforgettable as the cannibalistic Lecter, while Foster is compelling as Clarice Starling, playing the young FBI Agent with understated confidence and assertion. Clarice is created as a feminist character with incredible subtlety; she remains unfazed by the advances and gazes of on looking men throughout the film, focused solely on prevailing in her male dominated field of work and uncovering justice. The chemistry between both of the actors is undeniable, Clarice's freshness and subtlety boding well with Hannibal's abrasive and supercilious behaviour.Twenty years on, time does not appear to have worn upon the Silence of the Lambs, Demme's masterpiece still considered as one of the greatest psychological thrillers of all time. With strong performances, an intense score and a no-nonsense script, The Silence of the Lambs elucidates the seemingly forgotten art of story telling to create a film that is captivating from start to finish, and chillingly lingers in the mind long after it has been viewed.This superb film rates a 10/10 from me. I do wish I could review longer, but I'm having an old friend for dinner...",The Silence of the Lambs
1202,dhawkinberry,"""Silence of the Lambs"" is a movie based on finding a serial killer.",10,6 February 2011,"""Silence of the Lambs"" is a movie based on finding a serial killer. During the search for the killer, the FBI (Federal Bureau of Investigation) (The Silence of the Lambs, 1990-2011) enlists a student from the FBI's academy Clarice Starling (played by Jodie Foster) by Jack Crawford (played by Scott Glenn). Clarice is one of the top students at the academy, and Jack feels that she is the key to getting an incarcerated murderer to help find the killer. Sen. Ruth Martin's (played by Diane Baker) daughter Catherine (played by Brooke Smith) kidnapped by the serial killer and everyone is doing everything they can following leads to save her. This serial killer finds girls who are a certain body size in order to use their skin, which does not become known until later in the movie. Clarice gains some trust with the Dr. Hannibal Lector a very intelligent, yet deranged individual who kills and eats his victims' body parts. Clarice plays Dr. Lectors game of ""Quick pro quo"" and answers his question to each of his questions. Playing the game she is gaining his trust and following all of the leads he gives her, she finds that there is a deal between Sen. Martin's office and the government which is then signed by Dr. Lector with the doctor at the prison ward responsible for Dr. Lector's (Demme, 1991). Dr. Chilton (played by Anthony Heald) is an arrogant person who needs to make himself more important than he is. Therefore, in doing so he allows Dr. Lector to escape shortly after he is transfer to a holding cell built in the middle of a gymnasium. Meanwhile, Clarice and the FBI are following leads as to where the senator's daughter is. Clarice ends up in one location while the FBI ends up in another. This is the awesome scene in the movie where Clarice is at the door of Jame' Buffalo Bill' Gumb (played by Ted Levine) the house appears to be a normal house from the outside view, however, once she is inside the use of the lighting is spectacular. Clarice starts to question Buffalo Bill whom then starts to get nervous then tries to shoot Clarice. During the chase of Buffalo Bill, she is lead to the basement, which is more of a dungeon with and old well present. That is where he keeps the girls he takes until he makes sure their skin is perfect for his use. In the dark, Clarice feeling her way around while Buffalo Bill is where night vision goggles. The filming of this scene must have been very difficult because if any lighting were incorrectly used there would have been shadowing cast thus, losing the appearance of total darkness. The ending of this scene is a justified shooting of the killer Jame ""Buffalo Bill"" Gumb. The ending of the movie moreover you realize the true impact that Clarice had on Dr. Lector who is still loose, when he calls her to congratulate her on her graduation from the FBI Academy (Demme, 1991). This movie is similar to the movie ""Green River Killer"" (2005), in the aspect of the determination to apprehend the killers (Lommel, 2005). Agent Jack Crawford and Clarice Starling (Silence of the Lambs) and Detectives Dawson and Cole (Green River Killer) show the same type of fortitude in the cases portrayed in these two movies.",The Silence of the Lambs

One thing however, which I find is great about this movie, but which is hardly mentioned is that it keeps you at a 100% suspense level without going into a ""shocking"" scene. I mean there are no kiekaboe scenes (you expect someone to jump from behind a tree in the opening scene, etc), no special stunning effects, no bloody scenes (the camera is on Lectors face when he kills the policeman), etc, etc. Nothing really scary is directly shown, all is in the suggestion that something is going to happen.

1207,johnsh03,Silence of the Lambs is an excellent in the thriller genre.,10,18 June 2011,"Silence of Lambs is a crime thriller produced in 1991 by director Jonathan Demme. The screenplay was written by Ted Tally, taken from the novel written by Thomas Harris. Jodie Foster as Clarice Starling, is an FBI cadet who is assigned to interview the psychopathic serial killer Dr. Hannibal Lecter played by Anthony Hopkins. Starling gains the confidence of Lecter, a former psychiatrist turned killer/cannibal, in order to obtain information which may lead them to a serial killer tagged by authorities as ""Buffalo Bill,"" who is killing and skinning women. During the interviews Lecter psychoanalyzes Starling and in turn, he states as ""quid pro quo,"" offers clues which lead her to Buffalo Bill.The theme of this film focuses on plot; good guy trying to catch bad guy. Within this basic theme is an underlying theme of change. This theme is characterized by motifs, or patterns that are repeated. Symbols of metamorphosis are present throughout the story. The killer is trying to turn himself into a woman by sewing together pieces of the women's skins. He places a cocoon, the embodiment of change, in their mouths when disposing of the bodies. When Starling kills ""Bill,"" played by Ted Levine, a twirling picture displays a butterfly that appears to fly as it twirls. Silence of the Lambs has a similar theme to the crime thriller film Se7en, produced in 1995 by director David Fincher. The theme of Se7en also focuses on plot: good guys after bad with an emphasis on human depravity which is symbolized by each murder. Victims are chosen by the sins they commit. Both films delve into the psychological profiles of both the killers and the detectives. The use of color, particularly red, in the film foreshadows dramatic scenes that are relevant to the theme. The first time Starling goes in to see Lecter the lighting at the basement entrance is red and directed from the side giving a sense of foreboding. The room in which Bill performs his sewing contains lots of red objects. When Lecter is on the ambulance gurney (everyone believes it is the police chief), the strap across him is red. When Mr. Crawford, Starling's boss (played by Scott Glenn) is on the plane to Chicago, the lighting in the plane is red; as well as the van when the police stage a delivery. Sound is also used in this film to help in building suspense and highlight theme. The most dramatic use of sound in this film was the doorbell scene. The police are raiding the house in Illinois and ring the doorbell. The buzzer goes off in the basement at Bill's house. At the same time Starling is ringing the doorbell at Bill's door. At first, you are not sure which house Bill is in. The relationship between Starling and Lector is a driving force for the story. The use of color, sound, and motifs emphasizes and builds on the theme, which in turn creates the dramatic and suspenseful effects used in developing the plot of Silence of the Lambs.",The Silence of the Lambs
1208,carlo_zanotti,Masterpiece,10,6 April 2019,This is definitely a masterpiece. Hopkins and Foster performances don't need of many words: they deserved a lot of awards! This film should go down in history as one of the greatest drama films in cinema.,The Silence of the Lambs
1209,kingpace1,Great film worthy of its hype but a lot of hidden meaning,9,15 February 2005,"This is a great film that has a lot of hidden meaning. Especially that for women's rights. In the way that Clarice Starling is treated unfairly. This is really a film about overcoming adversity. Their is plenty of scenes which detail this perfectly. One is when she is running with her friend at the FBI compound when a group of males go running by and give them looks of ""What the hell are they doing here."" The way Hannibal Lector will only talk to Clarice a woman mainly I feel because it is a different approach the FBI used. This main fact is covered up by the fact that Lector likes her or has a crush on her. Another is when she is doing training at the FBI compound when they run into the place to secure it Clarice messes up and is told that she is dead and he looks at the guy and says you did great, but to Clarice he says you messed up. The scene of the film which details my point is the scene in which they are at the funeral home in which all the police are meeting and Scott Glenn's character tells the other police officer to come with him into the other room to talk details, this way Clarice can't hear them and then Clarice looks around to see herself surrounded by men. All in which are giving looks of ""What the hell is she doing here."" If you pay attention closely this is repetitive throughout the film. One scene in which Clarice overcomes her ""disadvantage"" which don't get me wrong is not one but detailed in the film this way is when doing an autopsy of the body, Clarice yells at everyone to leave. They listen to her and leave. She actually cracks a smirk in this scene, to almost say to herself ""I did it."" Of course we all know the ending of the film, where the women was right and all the men at the other place were wrong. She overcame her adversity and succeeded over the men and is also shown at the award ceremony at the end where award ceremony says her name first as opposed to the male name next. Scott Glenn's character is a closet sexist. This is a great film once again and deserves all its credit but watch close for these details throughout the whole film. 9/10",The Silence of the Lambs

The reason why this movie is only a 8 instead of 10 is because it not the best movie I ever seen in my whole entire life but it still pretty good. I like how it has a guy from the psych house , i like that sorta thing . This movie should not be seen to kids though . It an teenager movie (sixteen and up) . I like it also because there not any movies really like this , it is different then other horrors.",The Silence of the Lambs

From the start I was gripped by it's amazing camera shots, acting and music. Jodie Foster is amazing in her roll as FBI rookie Clarice Starling. Anthony Hopkins is just incredible, his roll as the monsorous Hannibal Lecter just blew me away. The best part is definitely the part when Straling is interviewing Lecter, this partis not only scary but very interesting. Buffalo Bill on this film is also scary.

1220,lionbrian10,Silence of the Lambs review,8,26 November 2012,"This film is by no means a typical low budget slasher. This film is a unique brand of crime and investigation where FBI trainee Clarice Starling (Jodie Foster) is assigned the deadly task of hunting down the notorious killer Buffalo Bill. However, to do this she'll need the help of another psychotic mastermind, Dr. Hannibal Lector. Lector is a clever but mad criminal, and this is made evident as soon as the trainee and criminal meet. The acting is fantastic and Anthony Hopkins makes the movie addicting. Buffalo Bill is also disturbingly creepy, and his scenes are very difficult to watch.The Silence of the Lambs is a brilliant gem from start to finish, sweeping four of the Oscars for 1991. Best picture, actor and actress, and major Academy Awards are just some of the awards collected over the year from this film. The film is definitely worth viewing not just once, but multiple times as many people already have. The Silence of the Lambs is a stellar, suspenseful, and altogether thrilling horror film. To this day it is looked upon as one of the most disturbing and horrifying films ever created. Everyone should see this movie, it's well worth your time.",The Silence of the Lambs

The performances, the script, the direction, photography, the score, all were a perfect storm of excellence. This movie set the tone for f.b.i., police, and murder procedurals for the next two decades, and we still see the effects today. At no point does the film get bogged down in clichés or fluff, and every moment compounds the character development, drives the plot, and mounts tension; nothing is wasted. The pace from start to finish rises and swells like waves crashing on a beach in an approaching storm, and as the climax arrives we are drenched in the power of its pinnacle, only to be softly released as the story teases its epilogue. Every actor brought their 'A' game, and created a memorable image and sound that would be imitated and admired ever since. One of the best.",The Silence of the Lambs

Jack Crawford (Scott Glenn) wants Clarice to interview Dr. Hannibal Lecter (Anthony Hopkins), a brilliant psychiatrist who is also a violent psychopath, serving life behind bars for various acts of murder and cannibalism. Crawford believes that Lecter may have insight into this case and that Starling, as an attractive young woman, may be just the bait to draw him out. Lecter does indeed know something of Buffalo Bill, but his information comes with a price: in exchange for telling what he knows, he wants to be housed in a more comfortable facility. More important, he wants to speak with Clarice about her past. He skillfully digs into her psyche, forcing her to reveal her innermost traumas and putting her in a position of vulnerability when she can least afford to be weak.

1224,GeorgeHarrington,"Fear and Pity in ""Silence of the Lambs""",10,23 July 2013,"This movie has special meaning for me. It was the first scary movie that I ever saw -- and I wasn't supposed to see it. I was ten years old and performing the role of Patrick Dennis with Shani Wallis in ""Mame"" at The Candlewood Playhouse, when one night in the dorm where all the actors were staying, I convinced some of the older actors to let me watch it with them. I've never been so scared in my life (a close second would be when, at the end of Sarah Connor's quiet and somber monologue that opens Terminator 2: Judgment Day, a cyborg's foot is seen and heard crushing a human skull). Anthony Hopkins' acting throughout the movie is a master class in how to choose one, specific action to punctuate your lines. He does not do much standing there in his cell -- and in fact, at Jodie Foster's best moments, she is as still and specific as he is. It's almost that crisp commitment from both actors more than anything else (the plot in general) that induces both the fear and the pity we experience watching the movie. At the beginning, we fear Dr. Lecter, and we pity Clarice on her task to track down the current criminal Buffalo Bill from interviewing the evasive and experienced psychopath in his cell...but because of the specific and simple acting and a great script, that dynamic certainly shifts, and by the end, our original assumptions are perhaps tossed aside.",The Silence of the Lambs

I absolutely loved it, even when I first saw it at age ten I loved it. Anthony Hopkins is so incredibly intriguing, and without him, Hannibal Lecter wouldn't be anywhere as capturing as I find him to be in the Hannibal Lecter trilogy. Hannibal and Red Dragon are also great. Manhunter I didn't like nearly as much as any of the others because of the not having Anthony Hopkins as Dr. Lecter. Hannibal is my favourite out of any Hannibal Lecter movie or book because it shows him free. That is my main reason. You get to see what the doctor is like without bars in front of him. I recommend The Silence of the Lambs as well as any other Hannibal Lecter movie to anyone that enjoys horror movies, but then again I have been told over and over that I have an obsession with the Hannibal Lecter movies and books.

1228,GrahamJohnFarmer,"""I have to Go...I am having Someone Over for Dinner...""",10,19 July 2013,"""The Silence of the Lambs"" was the Best Picture in 1991. Its basic plot deals with a young ambitious female FBI cadet, Special Agent Starling, (Oscar-winner Jodie Foster) who is sent to interview a former psychiatrist, Dr Lecter (Anthony Hopkins), who has been imprisoned for being a convicted serial killer and cannibal.Oscar-winner Anthony Hopkins stars as Dr Lecter, A.K.A. 'Hannibal the Cannibal', in his greatest acting performance of his career. The novice FBI cadet, Special Agent Starling(Jodie Foster), is instructed by her Superior, to find out about one of Dr Lecter's former patients, a serial killer, named 'Buffalo Bill' (Ted Levine).'Buffalo Bill' has been removing large diamond shaped strips of skin from his female victims after they die in order to sew together a suit of women's (victim's) skin. 'Buffalo Bill' thinks that he is a transsexual...and desires to be a woman.The most engaging scenes of ""The Silence of the Lambs"" are the scenes between Dr Lecter(Hopkins) and Special Agent Starling (Foster). Hopkins steals every scene he is in, despite the fact he has only about 17 minutes of film time on screen.

It's honestly legendary. It's the best part of the trilogy, really. The others are kind of wanna bes, of course, Hannibal is amazing but it's not the same.I love all of the actors and actresses.

As with all psychological films, it takes multiple views to absorb the full plot and ingest the actual meaning behind the film. The dynamic between Clarice and Hannibal is possibly one of the best acting duos in history, and if you pay attention you can pick up things between the two of them that you miss during the first viewing. Each character has layers and layers to them, they are complex and difficult to understand, which is what makes this movie so incredible.

Until now, I saw it for the fifth time and now I get less afraid than fascinated by this movie... Hopkins acts in such a great way, that you feel disgust at Hannibal Lecter on the one hand and an overwhelming fascination on the other hand... In this movie you can find a great tension, cruel stories but also there is this relation between Lecter an Clarice...

1235,agosh444,A movie i would refuse to miss,10,20 October 2013,"As I was on the search for the scariest movies of all time , I found this movie beneath various horror movies; I was curious to notice that this was the only psychological thriller . I started watching just for getting a rough idea of how it will be and surprisingly I watched it in full without forwarding; it left me chilled. As for a first time watch it was just awesome movie ; and every time i watched it again; i could feel the class and its thrill which will never drain off. For the movie lovers if you're not an Anthony Hopkins fan; definitely you will become one after you finish this movie .With such a brilliance he conveys us the terror and macabre of Dr. Hannibal Lecter ; renowned psychiatrist behind the bars . Hannibal the Cannibal as he is known best!Each second the fear builds up and the simplicity with which he evokes the feeling is quite wonderful an actor. With meagre 16 minutes of screen time ; Hopkins steals the show and most of the credit goes to him .Jodie Foster appears as the young ; attractive detective Clarice Starling . She is such a wonderful actress who is really flexible and I'm sure she did succeed enough doing any role . Ted Levine excels as Jane Gumb a.k.a Buffallo Bill ; Enormous amount of effort he has put in makes the movie go into some dark backgrounds where it finds brilliance and villainous nature of the character is so easily conveyed with his voice modulations and the actions . Scott Glen as Jack Crawford and Anthony Heald as the crooked minded Dr.Chilton has played his part and have made this movie a must watch spine chilling thriller experience . Music by Howard shore makes it gripping ; and the exceptional cinematography by Tak Fugimoto is worth notice. Ted Tally created the scenes with visual brilliance and the pulp of Thomas Harris' Novel is not lost being created in big screen. My favorite scene will be Agent starling's first encounter with Dr.Lecter ; the window scene which creates an aura of fear . So friends ; It will be such a loss to your movie madness if you miss this Jonathan Demme master piece . So Watch the classic as soon as you can . All the good for the one who waits ! :)",The Silence of the Lambs
1236,kbeck9575,Silence of the Lambs review,9,20 May 2008,Before I saw this movie Star Wars was my favorite film. I don't know if my tastes suddenly matured or what but when I walked out of the theater after seeing this movie for the first time I knew that Luke Skywalker and the gang had been trumped.Anthony Hopkins was superb as Hannibal Lecter. I have never seen anyone in all the years I have been watching movies seen an actor portray intelligent insanity any better. I couldn't keep my eyes off the screen. Many times when I go to movies I sometimes think of other things that are related to the movie or not. In this film that did not happen and it was due mostly to the performance of Hopkins. I was thrilled that the film won the Academy Award for that year. I thought the rest of the cast was great to. Jodie Foster is good in anything that she chooses to take on and the casting was perfect for Buffalo Bill. Ted Levine really fit that freaky hick part so well.I thought the pacing of the movie was great to along with the cinematography which added to the suspense a great deal. Awesome direction and execution throughout the whole movie. I would consider this movie to be a must see for everyone interested in the thriller or psychological genres.,The Silence of the Lambs

Hopkins is at his peak here and really plays a bad guy that you'd like to hang out with, but maybe take a rain check on the dinner. The combination of the music, acting and atmosphere makes for a movie that I myself have watched at least 10 times. The scene where he is locking the straight jacket almost made me believe he was trapped for good.

1243,toblessed2001,"Silence of the Lambs, an emotional ride of disbelief and terror",9,3 May 2014,"The 1991 suspense thriller, Silence of the Lambs, finds Clarice Starling, actress Jodi Foster, as a student at the FBI academy in Virginia. She's been chosen by her instructor, actor Lawrence Bonney, due to her noticeable keen senses, to visit with Dr. Hannibal Lecter, actor Anthony Hopkins, an incarcerated murderer. The intention is that Starling can use Lecter's insight into the mind of a murderer to find Buffalo Bill, actor Ted Levine, a serial killer whose victims are young girls.The theme of this film is control or power. In the film Clarice Starling is controlled by her drive to succeed as an FBI agent. She also has not found the power to control her memories of her childhood and the screaming of the lambs, which through her dealings with Dr. Lector she realizes. Ironically Dr. Lector himself, through his ability to manipulate minds, is perfectly able to control any and all situations; even through his incarceration has the power to affect others. Buffalo Bill on the other hand believes himself to be a transsexual and had been turned down for sex change surgeries from all major hospitals in the area. Therefore, his only way to express his control was by abducting young girls and murdering them and using their skin to create a woman's body. Ironically enough there is a pattern here. The majority of the power and control struggles are between Clarice and the men throughout her life and the story line, and with Buffalo Bill and his sexuality, and the young girls that he kills. The lighting and the angles used in the basement scene where Agent Starling was in the home of Buffalo Bill attempting to arrest him also aided to the theme of control. Buffalo Bill had shut off the lighting to the basement, leaving Starling unable to see a thing. Consequently, Buffalo Bill had on night goggles and was able to see every move Starling made. A terrified Starling scrambled around the basement, although blinded, searching for Bill. Finally, the simple sound of the trigger of Bill's gun being pulled back was all it took for Starling to locate bill and shoot the deadly shots that ended his terror (Bloch 1960). The overall lighting of the scenes throughout the film also aided to the theme of control. Early on the scenes tend to be more dark and dismal, but it seemed as though as Clarice gained more control, by having increased confidence, more insight, more acknowledgment from Crawford, and more trust from Lector, and got closer to solving the crime, the lighting itself became brighter throughout. The plot of the movie is to find a missing girl in West Virginia and to end serial killer Buffalo Bill's rampage. Special agent Jack Crawford, actor Scott Glenn, chose Cadet Clarice Starling for the task of interviewing a psychotic murderer Dr. Hannibal Lector in hopes that he could aid in the arrest of Buffalo Bill. Throughout the film Starling runs into obstacles and snares that seem to stand in her way, however her drive in solving the crime is stronger than those things standing in her way. One such obstacle is Dr. Frederick Chilton, actor Anthony Heald. Dr. Chilton is, to me, a little squeaky, weasel type character. He is out for self gain only and is trying to use Lector and his knowledge for his own benefit. Ultimately, Dr. Chilton met his doom in the end of the film by none other than Dr. Lector himself. After a botched attempt, at the direction of Jack Crawford, to find the most recent missing girl, Crawford and Starling were not permitted to speak to Lecter further. However that did not stop her from attempting to find and speak to him in attempt to find the killer. Although the male FBI agents had their leads, Starling had her own, and she was the one that ultimately solved the case.I can compare the theme of control and power of this film to that of Alfred Hitchcock's film Psycho. This film also has heavy displays of gender and power. The circumstances that stand out to me most are that of mental illness displayed in both films, the way that Norman Bates and Buffalo Bill have similar conflicts and are somewhat trapped in their roles and act out in a sinister way. There is one particular scene that I recall that immediately brought to mind the comparison of the two films. The scene where they were reviewing pictures of some of Buffalo Bill's victims showed a young girl lying face down, naked. Her eyes were wide open (Bloch 1960), and as they showed a close up of that picture I instantly saw the shower scene where Janet Lee lay on the bathroom floor, eyes wide open, and the shower water running (Bloch, 1960).Overall, I rate this movie very high. The suspense thriller allows the viewer to enter into the minds of Agent Starling, Hannibal Lecter and Buffalo Bill. It exhibits the affects of control and power, be it strong and weak, psychologically stable or unstable, educated or uneducated, male or female. Silence of the Lambs, takes us on an emotional ride of disbelief and terror as we see the story unfold.",The Silence of the Lambs

1246,ajayiitian123,"Play on your fears, meet the psychopaths !",9,19 August 2014,"Directed by Jonathan Demme, based upon the novel by the same name by Thomas Harris (1988), the movie takes us through a journey of psychopath minds: the way they think, the way they justify their crimes (even to themselves), the methods they use, and how the FBI works to catch them. The movie has the seriousness and intensity that has been entirely lacking in horror movies lately. It features two serial killers, one who is an imprisoned criminal, Dr. Hannibal Lecter (Anthony Hopkins), the other one nicknamed as Buffalo Bill by the FBI. Clarice Starling(Jodie Foster), a top student at the FBI's training academy is set upon the assignment of investigating Buffalo Bill, who kills young women and removes the skin from their bodies for purposes not revealed(Spoiler alert!).He is an amateur, has his weaknesses and can be caught, although only someone who has begun to think like him can defeat him. Clarice is advised by her boss Jack Crawford (Scott Glenn) to interview ""Hannibal the Cannibal"" Dr.Lecter, to find out any leads to track down Buffalo. Lecter being an interesting character throughout the movie, is a prize-winning psychiatrist turned a killer and cannibal who gently manipulates her mind and plays on her fears. The intimidating intellect of Hopkins' character is also reflected in his abundant wit, which he uses to provoke and torment his jailers and later confuse the forces to get away. He remains an unrepentant killer, almost as dangerous in his cell as he is on the loose. With his cunning facial expressions and amazing telepathic performances, he's the monster as genius, and Hopkins plays him with disturbing authority. Cinematography and screenplay have very well put the seriousness intended by Harris in his novel. A tale of bloody scenes, suspense, deception, manipulation and a masterpiece for those longing to watch horror movies.",The Silence of the Lambs
1247,KHALIL1995,Marvellous storyline.,10,9 February 2019,"It's impossible to comment on SILENCE OF THE LAMBS as being a mere film . Its release was a watershed in popular culture and has influenced a myriad of imitations that are far too numerous to mention . Much of this success is down to director Jonathan Demme who has made the film so effective by coming up with the strikingly simple idea of filming everything in dim lighting which gives SILENCE a moody and brooding atmosphere that was absent from movies in the previous decade . Ironically enough this is as typical of 90s film making as MANHUNTER was of 80s movies . Howard Shore's score also helps the proceedings and Jodie Foster gives a sublime nuanced performance as vulnerable heroine Clarice Starling . Watch the scenes closely when Clarice is in the company of men , don't you get the feeling she has a phobia about the male of the species . Is she a victim of sexual abuse in her childhood ? A lesbian ? We never find out but Foster's performance is multi layered and it's a pity this aspect is never explored in HANNIBAL which sadly deletes this aspect to ClariceFoster deserved the Oscar as did the film and possibly Demme too but did Ted Tally for his adapted screenplay ? All he seems to have done is to copy the best bits of Harris's novel wholesale into the screenplay without making an effort to improve anything . and i'll probably be accused of sacrilege but the more times I see this film the more times I ask myself how did Hopkins win the Oscar for Best Actor ? I don't even think Hopkins should have qualified for the Best Actor category since the role isn't on screen long enough and his performance is slightly hammy . Hannibal as played by Hopkins resembles something along the lines of a paedophile rather than a serial killer who has maimed , murdered and munched on adults . Despite having some reservations of Brian Cox as Hannibal in MANHUNTER you do believe his burly presence does have the physical strength to overpower his victims , not so HopkinsI know it's very difficult , perhaps even impossible , but the best way to enjoy this movie is to erase from your mind the fact that it's one of only three movies to have picked up the Oscar in all five main categories , the fact that it made headlines about being the most terrifying film committed to celluloid , and the fact that it stands as the 28th best movie ever on this website . It is a very good thriller but one that is ultimately disappointing after hearing of the hype surrounding it",The Silence of the Lambs
1248,prineridanus,Of it's time,6,15 December 2014,"This is a movie that really doesn't live up to today's hype of how classic and wonderful it should be. The cinematography is messy, the plot points are stitched together the same way somebody would sew a rip in a shirt if they forgot their glasses that day. The climax of the movie was predictable, full of jump scares, it didn't make me think it didn't intrigue me. The introduction of Dr. Lecter was very well done but from then on, what happened? Not ""what happened"" like i'm leading you somewhere with this so i mean it rhetorically. Now ""what happened"" in the way that would give the term literally meaning i.e. 'what happened next?' so i mean it in an investigative sense. ""What happened"" as in the bad joke people like to tell when they see baby pictures ""you were such a cute kid- what happened?"". I mean it in the way that your mom meant it when, as a kid, she told your to clean your room and she'll check in 20 minutes and she walks in to what she thinks will be your room being clean or you cleaning but what turns out to be you sitting on the floor distracted by a toy. Hannibal's character started out strong (inconsistent, a little. why would they let you have a pencil in jail? they would not) and when you needed the very core and basis of his character's backstory to come forward and grab you he was on the floor playing with toy trucks. That is not to say Anthony Hopkins performance was the same as his character's writing- not at all. Hopkins is a rare breed when it comes to acting. Everything he does is spectacular- even if he has a disappointing character he will deliver a great performance. I can't say the same about his female counterpart. After this movie, it's been so hard for me to like Jodie Foster. The whole concept of Hannibal falls so flat with this movie but you gotta give credit to the starter of the trends",The Silence of the Lambs

We discussed the recurring image of American flags; I think the director place the flags in there to create a constant reminder of the fight for freedom and justice in the United States. Because Buffalo Bill had been rejected so many times for a sex-change operation, he had desperately turned to kidnapping and skinning his victims. The fight for equality and justice is present throughout the entire movie, with Buffalo Bill wanting a new identity, Jack Crawford wanting take down Buffalo Bill, Clarice wanting to be treated like one of the guys and catch the culprit, and Hannibal wanting to get out of prison.",The Silence of the Lambs

The purpose or reasoning behind the director's inclusion of it may be showing the failing of the American dream that America is not what people from different countries, who want to prosper here, think it is. That America is actually hiding more horrible things than you think. For example, the American flag is found over the top of a car that contains the missing head of a man who is a trans-gender male.

It made me want to write better, and gave me a better appreciation of the genre, as well as introducing me to Anthony Hopkins. I would recommend this film to anyone. Beyond its creepiness, it is a wonderfully character driven piece, as it brings us into the world and mind of Jodie Foster's young FBI agent Clarice.

1257,joyous-sunshine,FBI agent-in-training Clarice Starling on assignment enlists the help of confined psychopath and psychiatrist Hannibal Lecter to capture a serial killer he is familiar with.,9,8 July 2015,"""The Silence of the Lambs"" deserves its recognition as a classic and one of only three movies in history to win the ""big 5"" Oscars. The protagonists were brilliantly portrayed. Hopkins very much adds to the story through his creepy performance. His articulate speech and refined southern English accent were jarring as he rarely blinked and calmly expressed his cannibalism. The way Lecter masterfully picked at Starling's insecurities while she tried to get his assistance in finding Buffalo Bill made the character all the more terrifying. Foster, unsurprisingly, is extremely believable as a young woman who wants to prove her worth for her future occupation by tackling the ambitious case. The directing flows smoothly. Great use of extreme close-ups are used to see the actors' emotions and connect with them. The flashbacks were introduced before they seamlessly illustrated the effects Lecter's prodding conversations has on Clarice, making these scenes easy to follow and making Foster's character more of a protagonist. On a side note, I appreciated the conscientious effort made to include a diverse cast in the film, with African- Americans featured prominently in important secondary roles. With that being said, I did feel that the movie was not perfect. The way Clarice finds a lead as to where Buffalo Bill is hiding seemed far- fetched to me. I felt the case could have been further developed before Starling reached the conclusion she arrived to. Moreover, I felt that Buffalo Bill could have used more of a back-story than what is given in order to increase the depth of his character. While some insight is given by Lecter, it is not enough to understand what caused the gender/identity issues that drive Bill to kill. This made his character seem a bit two- dimensional as the antagonist of the film. In contrast, I found Lecter's character rich in depth, as he would be considered a bad guy unless he was helping to find another mentally ill murderer. His character does not hold back his psychopathic ways or complete, self-centered disregard for the well- being of others if it doesn't suit his needs. All in all, this was an incredibly well done film that could probably only be improved if not for time restraints.",The Silence of the Lambs

It's easy to cover up your head and pretend nothing is there but when you're faced with the reality of what's truly out there, the human monsters that can do the most depraved things to other human beings, that's when you truly understand what 'fear' really is.I have long been a fan of Sir Anthony Hopkins and Jodie Foster. This movie was by far one of their mutual best.

1263,mpkoks,Classic and worth it,9,28 October 2017,"The Silence of the Lambs. The movie which Anthony Hopkins took for a children movie when first hearing it's name. It's a bit difficult to talk about the film considering how highly it's awarded and loved especially if you have to say something bad which thankfully is not the case with me except few small episodes. This is the first actual movie I have seen based on Thomas Harris novels featuring Hannibal Lecter and I know many remember it as a horrifying childhood classic but for me this was a first time seeing it.So the work is based on the novel of the same name – The Silence of the Lambs by Thomas Harris. The plot figures around young FBI trainee Clarice Starling struggling to catch serial killer called ""Buffalo Bill"" by media – a sickly individual who skins his victims. However for this she needs to seek help from another serial killer institutionalized in a mental hospital – psychiatrist Dr. Hannibal Lecter and captivate his sympathy so he would be willing to help. Of course this includes a lot of mind games, riddles and uneasy psychoanalysis from Dr. Lecter's part including revelation of Clarice's most terrifying childhood memories about screaming lambs at the ranch waiting in line for the slaughter.The movie has a very grim and unsettling mood which I feel is quite common in 90s cinema. I believe this is mainly because of masterfully crafted Howard Shore's soundtrack for the picture. I also enjoyed the post-punk tracks. Movie features some passionate violence scenes to Bach's Goldberg Variations - the kind of music which always fits movies like this.I absolutely loved Jodie Foster portraying Clarice – her performance was very passionate, deep and emotionally enthralling. Anthony Hopkins' genius as Hannibal goes without saying – so intimidating, agile and elegant. No wonder they both won Oscars as ""best actor/actress in a leading role"" for their work in this movie. Though I was disappointed with Scott Glenn as Jack Crawford recalling in my mind Laurence Fishburne (Morpheus!) portraying the same character in Hannibal TV series. I can't say Scott acted bad but it surely did lack something. Continuing on not-so-good-things, if you will, I felt like Hannibal's character was a bit too overdone in some scenes and felt artificial (I don't think characters like this would always feel artificial) but I think it's more of a screenplay issue than Hopkins' fault.The Silence of the Lambs leaves mysterious and morbid aftertaste. There are lots of psychological concepts and ideas to occupy your mind in sleepless nights. Not forgetting deep symbolism like moth, lambs, forest etc. Hearing lambs screaming early in a morning is a very imaginative and horrifying image which is searching for a place in your mind to root in. The movie makes me think about how lives of other people can be so dependent upon one person and how big role human personality and personal sympathies can play in such matter. The movie is scored 8.6 in IMDb which I find disappointing and I would say it's stable 9 and perhaps a bit more. Somehow the film reminds me of David Lynch's Blue Velvet – it's quite different but I feel like they share some notion and feeling in common.",The Silence of the Lambs

1271,rockinghorsestudios,A brave but brilliant masterclass,9,7 January 2016,"I thought it was about time I actually took the time to review, The Silence of the Lambs. What was already a very interesting and exciting picture was made even more so once I took the time to do some research into the story behind it. But first, from viewing the film itself, it is entirely dependent on the acting abilities of the main roles. Jodie Foster's great performance is only bettered by that of Anthony Hopkins in the role that cemented his place in Hollywood soon after he had all but given up on one. To give the performance that he does, in doing so creating one of the most memorable characters in cinema history, despite only sharing the screen with his co-star for no more than four scenes is without question a remarkable feat. I didn't think much of the opening titles design, taking up most of the screen and defeating the object of having visuals behind them. And the film does have a relatively slow start until the two principal characters meet each other. This is a brave choice for a thriller but one that works. However, I go back to it - if it wasn't for the acting and chemistry of Hopkins and Foster then that slow start would have continued for a very long time. It is some time before any conventional ""action"" is to be found. I felt the scene when Lecter disposes of the two policemen/security guards seemed ridiculous, cheap, macabre, poetic and brilliant all at once. The low angle victim's POV shot as Lecter bashes him with his own baton somehow looked majestic but also rather faked at the same time. But it works. I have never been familiar with the work of Jonathan Demme before this picture but he makes some incredibly brave choices. The amount of close up POV shots took a lot of bottle with cast members even doubting him as he did it. But then when you analyse the psychology behind why he made those choices and he is immediately forgiven for the impact it has. Also, the way he chose to cut together the reveal that Clarice Starling is actually at a different location to Jack Crawford's men in the culmination of the third act was an editing masterclass. This is made even more fantastic when in the knowledge that Ted Tally did not write that to be a twist but they chose to make it so when in post. Budgets being cut halfway through the screenplay being written, starring roles being turned down and casting nobody's favourite picks in the end, doubt over the director, the studio facing bankruptcy - there was so much leading towards this film never happening or flopping miserably; culminating in the film being made to wait behind Dances With Wolves for a release which spelled next to no hope at any Academy Awards recognition. But then the film scoops every major prize at the Oscars. You just couldn't write it. The only reason this film doesn't have a 10/10 is that for all its bravery, there are one or two occasions when the shots don't quite have the desired effect and the opening is a little slow but, given its based on a novel, there wasn't much that could be done with that. A genre defining masterpiece.",The Silence of the Lambs
1272,Asylum-Thirteen,A good psychological thriller/horror.,8,10 October 2015,"A decently acted movie, Anthony Hopkins plays a good psychopath.

I've always said a good horror is about the story and not the effects. This movie delivers just that. That's if you can stomach some bad accents and slightly weak acting from some of the cast.

1276,jtkrings,Silence of the Lambs,9,22 February 2016,"Silence of the Lambs (1991) follows the story of the young and ambitious Clarice Starling in her attempt to apprehend the serial killer named ""Buffalo Bill"" (Ted Levine). Starling goes to the infamous Hannibal Lecter (nicknamed Hannibal the Cannibal for his exotic tastes). Clarice relies on Lecter for his expertise and knowledge about the mind of a serial killer. Whereas Hannibal toys with Clarice in order to amuse himself. Clarice and her fellow agents are forced to rely on the help of a killer in order to catch another.Jodie Foster does an excellent job playing the young and eager Clarice. She portrays her Southern accent as often painfully obvious, which Lecter pounces upon as an insecurity. Foster speaks with a wavering voice at times, showing Clarice's inexperience and disgust with the crimes committed by Buffalo Bill. Hopkins is completely absorbed into the role of Hannibal Lecter. To create his creepy and psychotic persona he stares unblinkingly, forcing both the audience and Clarice to return his cold gaze. Hopkins keeps as still as possible while acting, looking like a snake poised to pounce upon less intelligent prey, and in comparison to Lecter everyone is less intelligent, and is therefore potential prey. Hopkins keeps a soft smirk on his lips throughout the film as if to say he knows something no one else does. The film's soundtrack is absolutely haunting and mysterious. It works well with the film to create tension and anxiety in the audience. However, the director (Jonathan Demme) knows when silence is just as powerful. In a tense scene in complete darkness we are left with no sound save for the heavy breathing of Buffalo Bill. The cinematography is excellent for this film. The colors of the film are gray and lifeless, which complement the film's dark subject matter. At pivotal moments the camera angle switches to first person. This view works perfectly when Clarice rounds the corner and sees Lecter for the first time. We are able to truly appreciate Lecter's piercing gaze, because we see it first hand through Clarice's eyes. The performances of Hopkins and Foster would have been flat if it were not for the well written script. The small anecdotal stories about Lecter help to build his character even before we meet him. Lecter's lines are meant to sound sophisticated and cultured in order to create his paradoxical character as a gentleman-psychopath. Buffalo Bill refers to his victims as ""it"" in an attempt to destroy their humanity in another example of brilliant writing. A key strength in this film is its character development. Not just Lecter or Clarice's development, but their relationship itself. The audience watches as Lecter and Clarice grow closer and closer in a bizarre exchange not unlike two friends sharing secrets. As Clarice learns more from Lecter, so too does Lecter learn more about Clarice. The audience can see that Lecter values this relationship because he does not hunt her down for as Clarice puts it, ""He would consider that rude"". Silence of the Lambs is a gripping and disturbing film, filled with fascinating characters. It remains a timeless horror film that draws from the darkest and foulest corner of humanity's existence. It is a terrifying movie because it reminds us that the monsters in our world are not imaginary, but could pass us on the street any day.",The Silence of the Lambs

The way he looks, talks and even positions himself all combine to a outstanding performance. However, I would have liked to see a bit more of Hannibal and see his character develop.Jodie foster stars as Clarice and her relationship with Hannibal is a huge driving force behind the film and its intrigue. Clarice refuses to be a victim and her attitude shows equality at its finest.Another Character that is unforgettable is buffalo Bill, played Ted Levine. He is a crazy killer and although not anywhere as near scary and cold blooded as Hannibal his methods still keep you up at night.My only criticism of the film is it comes to an abrupt end with Buffalo Bill, However With Hannibal it can still play on your mind weeks after.

There's something in Hannibal that just intrigues and scares you just the right way - one of the best villains in movie history. Other characters are there just to support this marvelous beast and they do just fine. Plot of the movie isn't that special but it's solid and entertaining. The ending of the movie is intense and the very end is just perfect and suits this film amazingly.There's really no reason not to watch this!

1280,huwdearn,doing this for collage work. like the film though,10,12 May 2016,"This review will finally cover one of my favourite films of all time, Silence of the Lambs. In this film you follow the story of Clarice Starling (Jodie Forster) on her journey to join the FBI. She will do this by doing the tests required; however she is also trying to catch the evil transgender psychopath Buffalo Bill (Ted Levine). To do this job she has to call in the help of the FBI's most dangerous captive, Dr Hannibal Lecter played by Anthony Hopkins. To find him she allows Dr Lecter to get into her head to allow him to look at the files. The slow pacing mixed with tense scenes allow for a quality which was not scene before and has not really seen since. I love this film so I can be considered bias towards the film, however that bias does have some serious points, the acting is top class from everyone, especially Hopkins, and he adopted the role of a pure psychopath toying with his pray while keeping a civil look about him. Jodie Foster allows for the audience to get behind her and bond with her as a character, allowing for the audience to gain a sense of fear towards the end. The cinematography used throughout the film adds lots of things to the suspense, giving lots of close ups and allowing for the audience to get used to the lighting, music and gives a sense of fear. The lack of music ads to this as well as the music that is used is twisted and makes the listener feel unnerved. Ted Levine as Buffalo Bill works perfectly, he acts weak and fearful however when he is in a scene where he is in control, he is calm and collected, but most of all, cruel. The story is well written coming mostly from the book of the same name by Thomas Harris, winning the Bran Stoker award for best novel. The main point of the film is great, trying to entertain through an air of suspense and with a satisfying payoff. The loyalty to the original source material allows for a built up story with the correct pacing which allows the story to flow. The only flaw I could find is that they changed the ending from the original book; however even that point is asinine as the ending of the film is just as good as the book. My overall opinion? Love the film and the book from cover to cover I rate it a fantastic 5 stars. An all-time classic, definitely worth watching more than once",The Silence of the Lambs
1281,eldante-33692,Great Movie,10,28 June 2016,This movie is the greatest psychological thriller. It has all the makes of a great serial killer movie as well as twists and turns on plots. The story was written perfectly and the actors performed their best in their roles. I wouldn't change a thing about it except that I would of like to see a newer rendition to this movie. I love the series and which more would be done with it. In my opinion it's a must watch movie along with the prequels and sequels to this movie. Anthony Hopkins was the best lead role in this movie and his performance was beyond astonishing. I would recommend everyone to watch all of his movies especially this one.,The Silence of the Lambs

1286,leepip,10/10 ... one of the best films ever!!,10,21 September 2021,Not many words needed ... A masterpiece. Jodie Foster & Anthony Hopkins are both superb.,The Silence of the Lambs
1287,hallpink,A play on the Mind,10,22 October 2016,"I have loved this movie for almost a decade that acting by Jodie Foster is superb, as she plays Clarice you get the feeling she is smart but has no clue of the pile she has stepped in. Sir Anthony Hopkins name goes without saying has breached past the form of acting and dove into characters on many occasions. While you are watching the movie you almost forget it isn't real. Hannibal Lector a character that even with the book didn't have enough character until played by Sir Hopkins. There will always be imitations but there is only one original.The combination of Foster and Hopkins is a masterpiece, so much when the red haired decent actor Julianne Moore was to reprise the role of Clarice I was utterly disappointed in someone trying to ruin what was already grand. I was proved true my disappointment was confirmed, although Moore is a great actor the part of Clarice has been sealed as Foster as well as Sir Hopkins as Lector.",The Silence of the Lambs
1288,b-68161,"A great film that still holds up, encapsulates the time period",8,2 January 2017,"I just watched this film an hour ago and I'm surprised that this film has not aged at all. I watched a 1080p Bluray version of this film and although it was a little grainy (it is film stock, after all), everything looks sharp, clear, in focus and detailed, which is not something that could be said of many films of the era and even some films today. The story is very interesting and even though I had seen the film before (and forgotten the plot) the unraveling of the mystery was quite intriguing.One thing I found very interesting is how this film captures the time period on film, not just in clothing, language or technology, but in thinking. For example, when Starling and Lecter discuss a serial killer, Lecter says ""What does he do, this man you seek?"" Starling answers ""He kills women"" to which Lecter retorts ""No! That is incidental."" It is incidental, but in this day and age, it wouldn't be. It would be seen as misogyny and that would be the profile they build on him. The fact or the conclusion that the killer is completely deranged and is sewing a vest out of the skin of his victims would never be reached. Hell, in this day and age this film wouldn't be made at all, since Lecter's glimpse-into-the-mind-of-a-psycho would be branded as ""mansplaining."" This film, made in 1991, is the highest rated police/detective drama of all time, currently rated 23rd best film on IMDb's top 250. The fact that it hasn't been bested speaks a lot about how good it is (not just for its time) and how far we've fallen. Instead of getting more genre-defying films like this, we're getting more by- the-numbers police dramas and by-the-numbers slasher/cannibal films.Before blaming Hollywood for the decline in the quality of its films, we gotta take a long, hard look in the mirror first and remember - we are what we eat.",The Silence of the Lambs

1291,saerenskarolien,great movie,5,19 October 2005,"I had to look at a movie for school and I had to pick one out of the top 100 list on a site or in our workbook. I picked out this movie because I once saw it but didn't finish it and now I wanted to look at it again and completely. at first when I had only heard about the movie, I thought it was going to be a horrible movie with lots of killing and that it wasn't really my kind of movie. but after I looked at it once I saw that it was not horrible at all, there was some kind of psychological aspect in the film and that was something I liked. So now that I looked at it for the second time, my meaning is that it was very good, i looked at it without stopping. it was not boring me at all. the great lines of the film were fascinating, that is why i think this movie belongs to the best and also to the top 100. the actors did a great job, especially the kind of relation between Clarisse Starling and Hannibal Lecter. it was very special. their conversations in prison were interesting and Lecter was always so mysterious. I will say to other people that they will have to look at the movie, because I can not say a bad thing about it at all. it wasn't a horrible thriller like most of the time and that is something I really liked.",The Silence of the Lambs

1296,doriandrost,A Masterpiece - but not in all facets,9,12 November 2017,"Without doubt it is the first half hour, that displays the full thrilling beauty and astonishing furtiveness that makes the story of Hannibal Lecter one of the greatest serial killer stories of all time. Just from the complete beginning the audience is held in a mode of everlasting tension; in fact the first scene is one of the best in the whole movie. With its depressing atmosphere and tricky used camera movements, the thrill rises in just seconds to an extraordinary level and will not lower until the end of the movie. Of course the very best scene is the first meeting with Haniball Lecter himself. Here Jonathan Demme creates on of the greatest, most well-known and most impressive moments of movie theater - accomplished through Anthony Hoppkins astonishing play of the charming serial killer, as it is unique in modern role playing. Unfortunately after this scene the movie loses a part of its quality for quite a while. Putting the most remarkable scene quite in the beginning leads to a permanent comparison of it with the rest of the movie. The middle part for sure has its heights, but tends to lose itself in disinterest. However, due to the impressive character of Hannibal Lecter, the tension never falls and the movie leads to an remarkable height in the second half. It is Lecters breakout, that makes the climax of the movie with its impressive aesthetics and cruelty. Even the audience feels betrayed by the charming and cultivated psychiatrist. The excellent interpretation of Hannibal Lecter even compensates for some cinematic foolishness: While trying to trick the audience, Demme shoots himself at some point. Both the fact that the injured Guard is Lecter himself and that the police breaks into the wrong house are quite obvious - to obvious to fool the audience -, additionally the second scene mentioned is a cliché as big as the ending scene. In the end the ""Silence of the Lambs"" is on of the most remarkable and exciting pieces of movie theater at all. Only the fact that it often stands in it's own light, and that many parts of the movie can not measure up to Lecter himself (think of the horribly uninteresting Buffalo Bill for example) causes it to stand one step below untouchable masterpieces like ""The Godfather"" or ""Psycho"".",The Silence of the Lambs
1297,moynaaks,A movie which silenced all critics,10,28 August 2019,The Silence of the Lambs is one such movie where the characters created by the screenplay and the way the characters were brought to life by the actors is a great example of complete perfection in terms of pre-production strategy.You can not deduct a single decimal point for the movie.

But ""Silence of the Lambs"" is not merely a thrill show.

1304,qzyzafs,Definitely a Classic,9,1 March 2018,"I definitely understand why this movie has received many awards as well as its actors. The movie does a really good job at drawing you in more and more when you watch it. I really like the way Hannibal Lecter (Anthony Hopkins) is portrayed as the good guy in trying to help the FBI, and wanting you to like him even though he is a serial killer; it brought a sense of benevolence to him. I thought it was interesting how the movie started off with watching Clarice Starling (Jodie Foster) running through the forest; the way it was filmed made it seem like something was going to happen to her as she was running and then the guy coming up behind her, it starts off the movie with making you watch carefully and letting you know there will be surprises. Also, another interesting point in the beginning was how they used Clarice an agent in training as the person to help find Buffalo Bill (Ted Levine) and trying to get information out of Hannibal. I really like the relationship between Hannibal and Clarice, it started out as Clarice being very afraid of Hannibal and as the movie went on they got closer and there was a sense of respect for each other. The way Hannibal was asking Clarice about her childhood was a really intriguing way of trying to help her solve the case. It made the timeline of the movie even more interesting; because, there was kind of two stories one inside the other the main story being the FBI trying to find Buffalo Bill and the small story being the relationship between Hannibal and Clarice. Overall I thought the movie was really good, I am not a big fan of horror movies but I liked the story this one had and the way it was all put together. It is definitely worthy of the awards it got and the actors.",The Silence of the Lambs

1312,sarwig,A gripping and emotional thriller that will be remembered for many years to come.,10,10 December 2006,"Sience of the Lambs is a gripping and emotional thriller that will be remembered for many years still to come. It is unforgettable and well written without any of the customary clichés of horror movies.A serial killer that goes by the name of Buffalo Bill has been killing women and taking pieces of their skin. Clarice Starling (Jodie Foster) a rising FBI agent has to capture this man. She consults with Dr. Hannibal Lector (Anthony Hopkins) (a former serial killer and psychiatrist currently in jail) to find out who Buffalo Bill is and to try understand the psychology of his mind.The most memorable moments in this movie are the few scenes between Clarice and Hannibal. Even though they are separated by a glass wall, Foster and Hopkins are both mesmerizing in their roles and their relationship is one of the most interesting aspects of this movie. As Clarice divulges her deepest secrets about her life to Hannibal he gives her information on Buffalo Bill.Although their performances are equally good. Hannibal will probably be the most remembered for the depth in his character and the way he abruptly changes with ease from a sophisticated, well-spoken psychiatrist to a deadly man-eater.This is one of only three films that has won the five most coveted Oscars (best movie, best director, best actor, best actress, best screenplay) and it is well deserving of them.Silence of the Lambs is a movie that is over 15 years old and still well remembered by many. It can definitely be considered a classic and it is one of the most well written horror/thriller films to be found.
