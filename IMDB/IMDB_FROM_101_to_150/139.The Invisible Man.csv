0,Leofwine_draca,Pretty good effort,7,27 September 2020,"THE INVISIBLE MAN is another pretty good sci-fi/horror movie combo from Leigh Whannell, whose previous effort, UPGRADE, was similarly enjoyable. This turns out not to be a remake of the Universal classic at all but rather a look at abusive relationships and gaslighting. A lot of the goodwill comes from Whannell's understated directorial style and Elizabeth Moss's performance, which is very strong and very physical. It's a slightly overlong production with one twist too many for my liking, but there's plenty of suspense punctuated by the occasional set-piece (including a TERMINATOR 2-inspired bit in a mental hospital which is really good) that makes this work a treat.",The Invisible Man
1,SnoopyStyle,intriguing premise,5,2 April 2020,"Cecilia Kass (Elisabeth Moss) escapes from her controlling partner Adrian Griffin to her friend James Lanier and his daughter Sydney. Two weeks later, she is surprised when her sister Emily comes with the news of Adrian's death. Adrian's brother Tom is handling his estate which leaves Cecilia $5 million. Mysterious things start happening and she suspects Adrian's hand in the matter.I was intrigued with taking the invisible man to the horrors realm. The start needs to give Adrian more time so that the movie has a firmer grasp on its villain. When the situation starts to turn, I get the feeling that the tension is not quite high enough. Looking at an empty room for the invisible man is intriguing for about two minutes. Then I realized that I already know the cause and therefore there is no mystery to the movie. Also, it's unlikely that the dead man is the automatic suspect. I'd go with Tom first and she should be investigating Adrian's death. James is possibly the worst cop ever. A lot of it could be set up with more of Cecilia and Adrian's relationship before the escape. The ending is also problematic. Being over two hours, the last bit should be cut for various reasons. The premise remains intriguing but I would change a few things.",The Invisible Man
2,Prismark10,The Invisible Man,4,3 July 2020,After the failure of Universal's Dark Universe franchise. Director Leigh Whannell has rebooted it with a reinterpretation of The Invisible Man story.This is not a movie of a man driven mad with his experiments regarding invisibility gone wrong.Optics scientist and tycoon Adrian Griffin (Oliver Jackson-Cohen) is an abusive boyfriend of Cecilia Kass (Elisabeth Moss) who has made elaborate plans to escape from him.A few weeks after leaving. Cecilia finds out that Adrian has committed suicide from his attorney who is also his brother. She has been left a hefty amount of money with some conditions.However Cecilia is uneasy and thinks that Adrian might not be dead and is stalking her somehow. Her sister and cop friend James disbelieve her.Of course Adrian has created an invisibility suit and plans to take revenge on Cecilia for daring to leave him. After all it is called The Invisible Man.Whannel has created a stalker thriller. The abusive power play could be a reference to #Me Too as well. Rich moguls ruining the careers of women who refuse to stay silent.Ironically The Invisible Man's box officer was curtailed by the Coronavirus pandemic. An invisible airborne virus which proved to be deadlier.The film is very flawed and so many times it comes across as stupid.. There is so much Cecilia could had done to reveal her see through stalker. A taser gun would had disabled him.By the end it becomes a slasher film with a twist that enables Cecilia to finally turn the tables.,The Invisible Man
3,claudio_carvalho,Absolutely Overrated,5,4 April 2020,"Cecilia Kass (Elisabeth Moss) flees from the isolated mansion of her husband, the awarded physician Adrian Griffin (Oliver Jackson-Cohen), with the support of her sister Emily Kass (Harriet Dyer) during the night. Cecilia claims that Adrian is an abusive husband and Emily´s friend Police Detective James Lanier (Aldis Hodge) lodges her at home in the room of his daughter Sydney Lanier (Storm Reid). When Adrian surprisingly dies, Cecilia inherits his fortune. But when weird things happen with Cecilia, her sister and friends, Cecilia believes Adrian is invisible but not dead and is sent to a psychiatric clinic. Is Cecilia insane?""The Invisible Man"" is an absolutely overrated film. The screenplay is not good, with many plot holes and with poor development of Adrian Griffin and Cecilia Kass, performed by Elisabeth Moss, looks like a crazy and unbalanced woman most of the time. The viewer never sees the claimed abuses of Adrian and how Cecilia finds that he is invisible in the beginning is a great mystery. My vote is five.Title (Brazil): ""O Homem Invisível"" (""The Invisible Man"")",The Invisible Man
4,kosmasp,Expecting someone?,8,13 April 2021,"With a title like that ... the movie knows what the audience and viewers expect. So while it doesn't go full wink wink and fourth wall breaking, there are scenes that really give us what we want (even if we didn't know we want it). Lurking, showing us ""empty"" spaces and just plain give us moments where we try to inspect every corner and every movement or not, we see or think we see.Of course this isn't just a movie full of nothing - quite the opposite. It is filled with excitement and a lot of tension that gets relieved. Now the relationships in the movie work really good - but I can see some having issues with some turning points and the suspension of disbelief has to be big in certain scenes too.Having said all that: great special effects and really well made, especially considering the relatively low budget this was made on. It's obviously not a B-movie, but it also is nowhere near what some Blockbusters cost. The actors help a lot, relieving the director of certain special effects cost, by playing with themselves ... that may sound weirder than it is meant to be. Powerhouse performances all around, especially from our leading lady. This is not Hollow Man or something flashy, but rather a drama horror movie with quite the impact!",The Invisible Man
5,classicsoncall,"""I just can't see him.""",8,19 June 2020,"I thought this was a fairly good movie but it appears that a host of negative reviewers are intent on talking me out of it. Updated for a modern day audience, Adrian Griffin (Oliver Jackson-Cohen) is an expert in the field of optics research, having developed a suit that makes the wearer invisible. In the original 1933 film, Claude Rains' character is Dr. Jack Griffin, a scientist who accidentally conducts an experiment that renders him invisible, while at the same time affecting his mind, making him aggressive and dangerous. It appears that our modern day Griffin was already aggressive and dangerous to begin with before coming up with his invention, and it becomes Cecilia Kass's (Elisabeth Moss) goal to prove to those around her that she's not going insane when people around her become the victim of Griffin's acts of retribution and revenge.Now I do admit that there were some clumsy scenes that were used to demonstrate irrational behavior on Cecilia's part. The attack on Sydney (Storm Reid) was a huge question mark for me when it occurred because it didn't look like she was anywhere within arm's length distance of the young girl, and who can move that fast without being seen? Even the slashing of Emily's (Harriet Dyer) throat in the restaurant scene didn't present an aura of credibility about it, but in a crowded restaurant, how could Cecilia deny her involvement? However I was impressed throughout with actress Moss's descent into near madness regarding the events surrounding her.Probably more than anything, the film encourages me to go back to the original movie, because even though I remember it fairly well, when I pull it up here on IMDb, I find I rated it without having reviewed it, and for me that's a no-no. So just as soon as this corona induced isolation becomes history, I'll be looking it up at my local library.",The Invisible Man
6,jboothmillard,The Invisible Man,8,8 March 2020,"You may remember The Mummy, with Tom Cruise, it was meant to be the first in a series of Universal Monsters remakes, the ""Dark Universe"" series. But following the negative reviews and underwhelming box office, this project was dropped; any further Universal Monsters remakes will be made as individual stories. The Invisible Man is one of the famous classic movies that would have been part of the franchise, most people will recognise the Claude Rains original. This contemporary reimagining of the scary movie, based on the book by H.G. Wells (although not credited), is one I was most excited about, written and directed by Leigh Whannell (Saw, Insidious, Upgrade). Basically, Cecilia ""Cee"" Kass (The Handmaid's Tale's Elisabeth Moss) is trapped in a violent, controlling relationship with wealthy optics scientist Adrian Griffin (Oliver Jackson-Cohen). One night, she drugs him with Diazepam and attempts to escape. While trying to take off the dog's shock collar, Cecilia sets off Adrian's car alarm. She rushes to jump over the high fence and to the road where she meets up with her sister Emily (Harriet Dyer) to pick her up. Adrian nearly catches her, but Cecilia manages to escape. Adrian finds the dropped Diazepam bottle on the road. Cecilia hides at the home of her childhood friend James Lanier (Straight Outta Compton's Aldis Hodge), a police detective, and his teenage daughter Sydney (Storm Reid). Two weeks later, Cecilia is informed that Adrian has commits suicide and left her $5 million in his will, handled and organized by his brother, Tom (Michael Dorman). As Cecilia tries to move forward, she becomes plagued by various misfortunes and strange occurrences. During a job interview for an architect's position, Cecilia faints and is taken to hospital. The doctor tells her that high levels of Diazepam were found in her system. Shortly thereafter, in her own bathroom, she finds the same bottle she drugged Adrian with. She arranges a meeting with Tom, bringing James with her. She insists that Adrian is still alive, having faked his death, and has used his scientific expertise of optics to become invisible and is tormenting her. Tom disregarding her concerns insists she is letting the memory of Adrian ger to her and explains that his brother abused him also. Cecilia turns to her sister, only to discover she received a hateful email from her account, alienating the siblings. Cecilia goes home to read the email and breaks down. She is comforted by Sydney, until she is hit by an unseen force, she assumes Cecilia did it. A furious James rushes his daughter out of the house. Cecilia tries several tactics to catch the figure, including pouring coffee grounds on the floor to see its footprints. She calls Adrian's old mobile phone number, and hears the ringing coming from the attic. She finds the phone, and finally reveals the invisible figure pouring paint over him. A violent struggle ensues, and she flees the house. Cecilia visits Adrian's home to investigate, finding a scientific laboratory with a number activated keypad in the basement. There she discovers a suit that renders the wearer invisible. She takes it and hides from the figure when it returns, escaping another attack, who is wearing another suit. Cecilia meets with Emily in a restaurant, they reconcile, and Cecilia tries to tell her sister about the situation. Suddenly, the figure grabs a large knife, slits Emily's throat, places it in Cecilia's hand, and frames her for murder, with many witnesses. Cecilia is taken to a secure treatment centre awaiting trial. Whilst there, Cecilia is told that she is pregnant. Tom visits her to inform her that her inheritance has been cut off as it appears that she has committed a crime. Tom tells her that she will lose her fortune and be admitted permanently to the institution unless she agrees to return to Adrian and raise his child. He implies that he helped Adrian stage his suicide, and that he knew she was taking birth control during their time together, which he tampered with. Cecilia refuses but manages to steal a pen from his briefcase, which she uses later to slit her wrist to lure Adrian out. When he tries to stop her, she stabs him repeatedly, causing his suit to malfunction and flicker in and out of visibility, drawing the attention of security. Adrian incapacitates and murders them as he flees, but Cecilia follows him with a security guard's gun. Adrian subdues her and admits that he will not harm her while she is pregnant, so he will kill Sydney instead. Cecilia races to James's house, where she finds the invisible man attacking him and Sydney. She manages to kill him, but unmasking him, she discovers it is Tom. The police arrive at Adrian's house, and find him tied up in a cupboard, he claims he was his brother's prisoners. Cecilia claims that Adrian is playing mind games and sent Tom in his place knowing this would happen. In an attempt to get Adrian to confess, she meets him at his house for dinner to discuss her pregnancy, while James listens in on a wire. Through some difficulty, she does get the information she required, before heading to the bathroom. Moments later, the security camera captures Adrian seemingly committing suicide with a knife, followed by Cecilia emerging from the bathroom, discovering his body, and calling the police. Out of the camera's view, she taunts him one last time. When James arrives and asks what happened, she confirms what the camera saw. James spots the invisibility suit in her bag, possibly realising what she has done, but accepts her story and allows Cecilia to leave. Also starring Benedict Hardie as Marc (Architect), Renee Lim as Doctor Lee, Nicholas Hope as Head Doctor, Sam Smith as Detective Reckley and Nash Edgerton as Security Guard. Moss gives a superb performance as the frightened and tortured but heroic woman stalked and terrorised by the unseen monster. This different perspective of the well-known story is very clever, from the point-of-view of the ex-girlfriend, with great use of optic trickery and camerawork to make you question whether something is there or not, with jumpy moments and plenty of eeriness, a most satisfactory and creepy horror thriller. Very good!",The Invisible Man
7,BA_Harrison,The original is still the best.,6,1 March 2020,"The Invisible Man (1933) is one of my favourite classic Universal horrors, so any reimagining/remake/revision/regurgitation already had its work cut out trying to convince me of its worthiness. But hey, director Leigh Whannell impressed me greatly with action/sci-fi Upgrade (2018), so I was willing to give him a fair crack of the whip.What helped to make the original film so compelling was seeing how meddling with science and absolute power corrupted the mind, resulting in madness and violence. In Whannell's version of the story, scientist Adrian Griffin (Oliver Jackson-Cohen) is already a controlling sociopath way before becoming invisible, physically and mentally abusing his partner Cecilia Kass (Elisabeth Moss). No longer a study of insanity brought on by an iffy serum and freedom from moral constraints (something that even Verhoeven's Hollow Man adhered to), this updated tale is little more than a slick thriller with lots of atmosphere and a few effective special effects sequences, but marred by quite a lot of glaring plot-holes.Whannell's film sees Cecilia convinced that she is still being stalked and abused by Adrian, even after his supposed suicide (apparently the only person to see his body was his brother - no coroner, no police, no other concerned relatives), and yet she does little to protect herself or gather proof to corroborate her theory (tazer, mace, video footage). She eventually confirms her suspicions by splashing her invisible assailant with watery paint from a tin stored 'sans lid' in her attic, and yet the paint somehow disappears, allowing him to escape.When Cecilia finds the high-tech invisibility suit (with added super-strength powers) in Adrian's laboratory, she stashes it in a hidey-hole, instead of immediately calling the police so that she can prove her sanity ('cos doing the sensible thing would bring the film to an end way too soon). The twist where Adrian is found bound and sealed up in a hidden room is never adequately explained: are we supposed to believe that his brother did this at his behest, no questions asked? Or did he somehow do it himself? Either way, it's highly unlikely.The very ending, in which Cecilia retrieves the suit that she should have shown to the police earlier and uses it to get rid of Adrian once and for all, is too far-fetched, with her cop friend James Lanier (Aldis Hodge) happy to ignore the fact that she has just cut a man's throat with a carving knife.Whannell's direction is assured, with a few standout sequences (the invisible man attacking Cecilia in the kitchen, the death of Cecila's sister, Cecilia's escape from the secure facility), and the performances are all fine, but it is the film's numerous dubious plot points that are it's major shortcomings.5.5/10, rounded up to 6 for the juicy throat slashings.",The Invisible Man
8,paul_haakonsen,Such a laughable storyline...,3,24 March 2020,"Well, talked about an over-hyped movie. With words of its greatness and how good it was, I must admit that I was somewhat having expectations to this movie. Granted, I wasn't familiar with the plot of the movie when I sat down to watch it, I must admit that I was expecting quite something else than what this movie turned out to be.While I must say that the movie definitely was nicely acted, I must also say that I found this movie to be a pile of stinking... Well, you get my drift here. The storyline was just the most atrocious thing I have seen in a long, long time. It was such a laughable plot and storyline that it was just hard to enjoy the movie. Sure, I managed to get through it, but I wasn't entertained, nor were I enjoying what transpired on the screen.""The Invisible Man"" was just a massive swing and a miss from writer and director Leigh Whannell in terms of it being an entertaining or enjoyable movie for me to watch.The special effects in the movie were good, and the acting was good. But the movie as a whole just was rubbish.I am rating ""The Invisible Man"" a generous three out of ten stars, solely based on the acting and the effects. The script and storyline was such a massive hindrance holding back the movie for me. This is by no means a movie I will watch a second time.",The Invisible Man
9,Quinoa1984,one of the rare remakes that bests the original,9,3 March 2020,"This is a vigorous, rigorous and actually fresh take on a concept that goes back to the beginning of sound in film. I'm sure there are certain things to pick apart logically or a convenience or two to note in where things like surveillance cameras are (or aren't) at points, but these are things that would only get my goad if the main story and purpose wasn't strong.Right out the gate and to that last impactful shot, Leigh Whannel follows up the promise of his surprisingly fun Upgrade in writing and directing this such with an intricate, efficient and exacting eye for the negative space - whether Cecilia sees Adrian or not - but this also ratchets up the tension and suspense. It's long, methodical takes, yet they are always in service of the psychology of the scenes.He takes his time as a writer to set up beat by beat how much this monster is screwing with her, and while 'Gaslighting' is never uttered we know what the score is. Moss sells every second of this, but the writing needed to be there for it to work as far as making clear what kind of constricting world of psychopathy is going on (both with Adrian and as we find out and this isn't a spoiler to say leaving out details but his brother too), and why it would be believable that no one believes what she's saying. But what makes The Invisible Man such a thrill is seeing the potential being realized in the premise - moreover, the filmmaking follows this villain in all of his violent degrees.For me, this bests the original 1933 Invisible Man by a mile (frankly the only thing I remember about that standing out wad Claude Rains's performance, though it's been a while), not to mention something like Hollow Man. More to the point, this is the kind of remarkable genre cinema that attempts to stand head to head with one kind of sequence - a gruesome, murderous spree in a mental hospital - that we all think/thought topped out with the escape sequence in Terminator 2, and for moment-to-moment intensity, by the tracking of the camera and the brutality that unfolds, it is that good.Throw in some impressive visual effects, twists that actually make an impact and a central character who aside from investing in out of pure empathy is a proverbial Good character because she doesn't do the dumb horror movie things, and you got a crackling, hard edged, sincere blast of modern cinema. Thanks, Blum! I can start forgiving you for Fantasy Island (am I all the way there yet? Lets see how The Hunt pans out...",The Invisible Man

12,CinemaSerf,Cracking edge-of-your-seat stuff....,7,2 March 2020,"A completely different and enthralling take on H.G.

Afraid to even venture to the mail box; she is relieved to hear of her husband's death and to find he has left her $5 million. Soon afterwards, however, spooky things start to happen and she begins to believe that her husband's death was faked... Now we embark on a cleverly told psychological thriller. Moss does all the heavy lifting in this, and she does it really well.

13,zardoz-13,"Unsightly, Half-Baked Horror Chiller",7,22 March 2020,"""Upgrade"" writer & director Leigh Whannell, who wrote the first two ""Saw"" chillers and all three ""Insidious"" epics, has tweaked the classic H.G. Wells' novel ""The Invisible Man"" and delivered something different. Initially, Universal Pictures sought to reboot not only ""The Invisible Man"" back when Tom Cruise revived ""The Mummy"" (2017), but also launch a franchise comparable to the Disney/Marvel superhero franchise designated as the Dark Universe. The Dark Universe franchise would have featured ""The Mummy"" and ""The Invisible Man"" as well as ""The Wolf Man,"" ""Dr Jekyll and Mr. Hyde,"" and ""Dracula."" Presumably, these monsters would have interacted in each other's movies, like ""Marvel's Avengers."" Audiences balked at this reboot. After ""The Mummy"" flopped, Universal abandoned the Dark Universe. Now, the studio has released a standalone, contemporary take on ""The Invisible Man"" which mashes up the unforgettable scary movie with a #MeToo stalker saga. Predictably, the protagonist is a woman. Moreover, an abusive boyfriend stages his own suicide, so he can stalk her without attracting attention. Not surprisingly, nobody believes her when she spouts this bizarre idea! Suspicious things begin to occur, and our heroine finds herself caught up in a murder & mystery which defies anything she has ever known.
""The Invisible Man"" remains the unstable madman he was in Wells' novel. Nevertheless, Whannell has altered both the conditions and the circumstances. The eponymous monster struggles to drive his girlfriend crazy because she refuses to live with him. Alas, Whannell never convinces us an individual in a unique suit could run amok in public without revealing himself. Mind you, the original ""Invisible Man"" relied on chemicals to remain incognito. This latest incarnation equips him with an optical suit, like a scuba outfit, that conceals him. Further, the ""Invisible Man"" is no longer the protagonist, merely the title character, while his girlfriend occupies the limelight as the heroine. A straightforward, low-budget, hide & seek melodrama, ""The Invisible Man"" will keep you guessing during its gripping first hour or so until you start spotting its plot holes. The premise is not without promise, but the filmmakers strain credibility. Essentially, Whannell makes everything is far too easy for this ""Invisible Man"" to escape detection.
""The Invisible Man"" opens at night as Cecilia Kass (Elizabeth Moss of ""The Kitchen"") slips out of bed on phantom feet and leaves her boyfriend, Adrian Griffin (Oliver Jackson-Cohen of ""Faster""), without awakening him. Gathering her personal belongs, she sneaks out into the garage. Those illusions end when she kicks their Dobermann's dog food bowl accidentally, and it screeches across the bare concrete floor of the garage. Seconds later, a car alarm erupts like Gabriel's trumpet. Desperately, Cecilia scales the wall surrounding Adrian's oceanfront estate. She reaches the road beyond their house, and a car halts to pick her up. Cecilia is relieved her sister, Emily Kass (Harriet Dyer of ""Killing Ground""), has come to rescue her. The two get the shock of their lives when a disgruntled Adrian materializes out of the gloom. He smashes his fist through the passenger's window, and Cecilia urges her sister to floor it!Cecilia lodges temporarily with a childhood friend, single-parent, San Francisco Police Detective James Lanier (Aldis Hodge of ""Hidden Figures""), and his college-age daughter, Sydney (Storm Reid of ""Sleight""), but our heroine is far from safe. Indeed, Cecilia only imagines she is safe, because she doesn't realize the enormity of Adrian's plans. First, he commits suicide by cutting his throat. Second, he uses his suicide as a cover to torment Cecilia. The first time Adrian's harassment occurs catches Cecilia off guard when Sydney and she are in the same room. Unbeknownst to Sydney, Adrian strikes her a glancing blow to the face, and Sydney accuses Cecilia of hitting her. Earlier, when Cecilia had been cooking a pan of eggs and bacon, she left the kitchen momentarily. The next thing she knows, the eggs and bacon have been burnt to cinders, and the fire alarm activated.By now, Cecilia is experiencing the first signs of Adrian's return. Meanwhile, Adrian's brother, a sleazy attorney named Michael (Michael Dorman of ""Killer Elite""), disputes her claim with photos of Adrian's body. Furthermore, he has Adrian's ashes in an urn. Of course, Detective Lanier has no idea how to treat Cecilia's preposterous allegations. Later, Cecilia and her sister Emily rendezvous at a public restaurant. One minute, Cecilia is conversing with her sister. The next minute, a huge carving knife levitates in the air and slashes open Emily's neck like cherry pie. Afterward, as if by magic, the knife flies into Cecilia's fist, and alarmed customers scream in terror.Arresting our heroine, the police transport her to a sanitarium. Cecilia reminds us of the old man who cried 'wolf,' because nobody believes her. Earlier, she learned about an optical suit Adrian had created to make himself invisible. Later, when our heroine is rummaging around up in Lanier's attic, she senses Adrian's presence and drenches him with paint. Now, even we can see Adrian as the paint reveals his outfit. Instead of the usual jump scares, Whannell uses the scenes when Cecilia exposes Adrian in his suit as jump scares. Eventually, our heroine makes believers out of the skeptics. The scene when Adrian enters the sanitarium sight unseen and tangles with several armed guards stands out for its agile choreography. These security guards watch in stunned disbelief as something they cannot see disarms and shoots them with their own hardware! Now, the cat is really out of the bag, and the authorities believe Cecilia.The improbable thing about ""The Invisible Man"" is how Adrian's invisible suit enables him to mingle in public without calling attention to himself. Sadly, despite its superior production values, ""The Invisible Man"" qualifies more as thriller than a chiller. Whether or not you see through ""The Invisible Man,"" the performance of ""Handmaid's Tale"" actress Elizabeth Moss and the sympathy she generates for her heroic plight makes the half-baked hokum worth-watching despite its outrageous plot holes.",The Invisible Man

Reasonably clever plot and writer-director Leigh Whannell does a good job of gradually building up the tension, slowly feeding the viewer information at first but then ratchetting things up as the film progresses.Looked like it was on course to be brilliant but, having set up this intriguing scenario with some tight direction and script-writing, Whannell lets things slip towards the end.

""The Invisible Man"" begins with Cecilia Kass (Elizabeth Moss) going through extreme lengths to escape from her sleeping boyfriend. It was readily apparent early on that she had a real fear of her boyfriend Adrian (Oliver Jackson-Cohen) and that escaping could only be done surreptitiously. Things only got worse instead of better for her two weeks later when her sister notified her that Adrian was dead.
Cecilia was dealing with a grade one psycho. He made her life a living hell and he did it slowly, calculatedly, and invisibly. If Cecilia was going to be able to shake her ex once and for all she would have to somehow prove he was still alive.
Moss was excellent as the haggard girlfriend. There was barely a scene except she looked distraught, disheveled, and defeated. It was apparent that Adrian was uniquely adept at making her miserable.

19,neil-476,Worth watching,8,6 March 2020,"Cecilia (known as ""C"") makes her escape from controlling husband Adrian, a wealthy scientist, world leader in optical research. She is terrified of Adrian finding her until he commits suicide, following which his lawyer brother executes the will, under which C inherits. But strange things happen afterwards. We, the audience, know the title of the film, but when C tells people that she believes Adrian is not dead but, instead, is invisible, people don't believe here.This film is dressed up in sci-fi/horror clothes, but it is actually a psychological thriller featuring a victimised woman set up to look as if she's crackers. To that extent, it is familiar territory. But, of its sort, it is quite well done.There is a lot to like here. Elizabeth Moss gives a good central performance of a woman who goes through a number of changes. The ending carries a pleasing element of uncertainty in the middle of a satisfactory resolution. The special effects are few, but effective. There are a couple of decent twists. And the first 10 minutes, dialogue-free, are an exemplary piece of cinematic story-telling - director and co-screenwriter Leigh Whannell (also responsible for the excellent first Saw film) can pat himself on the back.",The Invisible Man
20,ferguson-6,contemporary spin,7,27 February 2020,"Greetings again from the darkness. I got hooked on ""Monster"" movies as a kid, and even all these years later, I still get a kick out of them. Of course, with today's special effects, the look of these films is much different than in the early days. The big challenge for the genre now isn't how to frighten us or create an awe-inspiring effect, but rather can it capture the charm and appeal of those ground-breaking B-movies? Universal Studio's Dark Universe got off to a less-than-stellar start with Tom Cruise's 2017 THE MUMMY. Now, after re-grouping, the fabled Monster studio re-boots THE INVISIBLE MAN ... with roots in H.G. Well's 1897 sci-fi novel and the Claude Rains - James Whale film from 1933.Perhaps their best decision was choosing Leigh Whannell to write and direct. I'm hesitant to mention that Mr. Whannell was a creative writing force behind both the SAW and INSIDIOUS franchises, as some may jump to conclusions on what to expect with this latest. All I can say is that you'd be incorrect to assume THE INVISIBLE MAN falls in line with those previous films. Instead, this film is a psychological thriller in the form of #MeToo vengeance. Whereas the 1933 film featured a brilliant scientist whose invention turned him sour, this contemporary version is told from the viewpoint of a woman who has been abused and controlled by her boyfriend.When we first see Cecilia (Elisabeth Moss), she is sneaking out of her stunning cliffside home while her boyfriend Adrian (Oliver Jackson-Cohen) sleeps. Within just a few minutes, Ceclia's escape has taken us on a tour of the home (including a high-tech laboratory), disclosed that she has drugged Adrian, introduced us to her sister Alice (Harriet Dyer), and above all, given us a glimpse at just how terrorized Cecilia feels. The sequence is complemented by a nerve-jarring score from composer Benjamin Wallfisch (BLADE RUNNER 2049).We flash forward two weeks and find Cecilia taking refuge at a friend's home, and she remains so paranoid, she is barely able to step outside. As the old saying goes, 'is it paranoia if they are really after you?' Her friend is James (Aldis Hodge, CLEMENCY), a stout no-nonsense cop and single dad raising teenage daughter Sydney (Storm Reid, A WRINKLE IN TIME). When it's discovered that Adrian has committed suicide and, according to Adrian's creepy attorney brother Tom (Michael Dorman), left millions to Cecilia, she allows herself to celebrate the moment. However, what fun would it be watching her spend and give away money? Instead, the tone shifts and Cecilia's life becomes unbearable as she is convinced dead/invisible Adrian is torturing her. As you can imagine, this leads to questions about Cecilia's mental stability, which then leads to more misery and tragedy.Director Whannell's brilliant approach and Ms. Moss' superb performance combine to make this a thrill ride worth taking ... it's the kind where some folks in the audience shout warnings to the characters on screen! It's difficult to tell which is more frightening, having everyone you know think you have lost your mind, or actually being stalked by an invisible, presumed-dead former abuser who wants you to suffer. Floating knives and physical fights are unsettling, but can't compare to the tension created by cinematographer Stefan Duscio turning his camera to a blank wall or empty space. Our mind (and Ms. Moss's face) fill in the gaps with Adrian's evil presence. This is not a scientist-gone-bad, but rather a madman utilizing his most powerful tool. Having Adrian be an Optics innovator was a contemporary twist that takes us from the science fiction of the 1930's to the technological world of modern day.The film was originally going to star Johnny Depp, but it works so much better, and is so much more terrifying, having it told through the eyes of Ms. Moss' Cecilia. Strangely enough, the movie I kept flashing back to was not the 1933 Claude Rains and Gloria Stuart (64 years later, she played reminiscing Rose in TITANIC) movie directed by the great James Whale, but rather the schlocky 1991 Julia Roberts film SLEEPING WITH THE ENEMY. This is the most fun kind of movie suspense, and what's scarier than the things we can't see? It's nice to have Universal Studios' monsters back on track, and we have talented filmmaker Leigh Whannell to thank for this ""Surprise!""",The Invisible Man

Is it a horror, not reall therefor it doesn't have a creepy atmosphere. For me it's more of a thriller.It do take a while before it all starts to happen. But once it does it do offer some suspense. effects are in the beginning just done with some off-camera tricks but the further we go the effects become way over mediocre.Some twists here and there makes it more than worthy to have a look at this flick. Some scene's can be a bit too gory for those not used to watch horror but overall it's low based on the red stuff.

It's a role she can play like the best and in The Invisible Man she does it again. She's the lead character and she did a wonderful job. Whannell is a good director, he knows how to bring suspense. The Invisible Man is basically a couple hours of thrilling, not really horror, about an abusive relationship between a woman and an invisible man, that's the sci-fi part in this movie. The tension building is what keeps you focussed, the music adds to the ambiance, but I would have used that returning dark sound from The Handmaid's Tale though, that would only have added more suspense.

23,christopher-underwood,"The notion that, less is more, is naturally well suited to the tale of an invisible man",7,13 September 2020,"The notion that, less is more, is naturally well suited to the tale of an invisible man. Whether due to budgetary or technical restrains the concept can be effectively used to advantage. In the original 1933 film with Claude Rains full advantage is taken of the concept of invisibility to have a hat or a pipe move without visible support and thereby help create a creepiness. That sudden movement in the corner of the room, the confusion as to whether something has been moved are all unnerving elements that will unsettle. This is replicated to some extent in the new film but things soon become more blatant and the tone changes. Indeed for much of the first third we are presented with a physiological thriller and what appears to be a serious tale of domestic abuse as Elisabeth Moss escapes her domineering but very rich husband, who, as it happens and unbeknownst to her, dabbles in the art of optics, that's, becoming invisible, to you and me. In Paul Verhoeven's The Hollow Man (2000) the idea of invisibility was logically constructed and then carried to its logical conclusion as a wild and horrific ride into sex, violence and gore, following the notion that once that old beast in man is unleashed there is no stopping him. Whereas the new film takes us along the ride as victim and fair enough it is not a pleasant trip. We appreciate the full extent of the horror and degradation caused by the sadistic manipulations and violent acts of the abuser but then, just when perhaps we were beginning to imagine the invisible might remain invisible, the film changes gear and becomes fairly exciting. Not sure about the ending and not particularly happy with the structure and balance of the movie but Moss does well enough and at least a fresh approach has been tried.",The Invisible Man

Creepy moments are finely conjured up with discretion, no jump-scare or shrilling sound effect required, special effects are frugally applied to a dazzling chill (an abrupt throat-slitting, or the gravity-defying grappling against an invisible assailant), with a $7 million budget, Whannell is well cut out for economy, and after a faux-closure that goes against our aforementioned engraved notion, a final giving-him-the-taste-of-his-own-medicine coup de thêàtre accentuates the damage caused by traumatic bonding and a gaslit woman's vindication, it also, if too readily, can be read as a warning to give pause to anyone who are involved in a relation between an ingénue and a seemingly omnipotent control freak.""read the full review on my blog: cinema omnivore, thanks",The Invisible Man
25,thesar-2,Fifty Shades of Nothing,9,4 July 2020,"Let me make this perfectly clear: this is one of the best horror movies I've seen in a very long time.And why didn't Tom Cruise & Co use THIS for their failed Universal Monster's Universe launch? As a matter of fact, this WAS my favorite Universal Monster movie of the 1930/40s.I knew I would like this. But I had no idea HOW much I would. And I knew main star Elisabeth Moss, who reminded me of a grown-up version of Milly Shapiro from Hereditary, had to carry this entire movie on her back, but I doubted I would believe her. Well...Superman: The Movie's tagline was: ""You will believe a man can fly."" I believed in all of this.In the first few minutes, the rules, setting, temperature, mood, fear, suspense and story is set. This was so masterfully directed, I got 100% the feel of everything I needed to know in that basically first minute, without any dialogue, exposition or tricks. As much as I like Writer/Director Leigh Whannell's other works, this is his perfection.Cecilia's trying to escape her abusive and controlling Elon Musk of a husband and barely does. Later, she will learn of his suicide which normally would set her free and make her feel less afraid of him coming after her. But, did he really die? Or can he still try and control her from his grave?I only gave you 1/10th of the story. SEE for yourself the rest. Why not? The price has dropped on the VOD and the movie has great acting, special effects, INCREDIBLE and EFFECTIVE jump-scares (one had my heart pounding so much - no spoilers, but remember a ladder,) a killer score, twists upon twists and despite some minor plot holes, it's plausible enough with the outrageous premise.I believe only approximately one or two out of dozens of horror movies are near perfect each year. This 2020 year is unique, but luckily this was in the can and out before the blank hit the fan. Lucky for us all as this was released and is an absolute MUST-SEE.Okay. I know, I know. Enough with the puns on the title.***Final thoughts: My two regrets here: Not SEEING (sorry, I made no promises!) this in theatres when we still had theatres in America and not paying the large price when it first landed on VOD. I really wanted to see this after missing it on the big screen, but when this pandemic happened and they started to release new theatrical films to home streaming, this was $19.99. I couldn't believe it and vowed I would never pay that to see a movie.Later it would be explained that's a bargain for families/couples who would've gone to see it in theatres. I.E. People, I guess, generally would spend much more on parking, babysitters, gas, concessions, ticket prices, etc. Me being single, I would've spent $5 on a Saturday morning matinee.

26,cherold,Brilliantly made but hard to watch,8,19 January 2021,"I feel most of the people knocking this movie are taking it very differently than I do, and I don't know why. The general view seems to be that the story makes no sense, but I feel seen through the lens of #MeToo and all I've heard about domestic abuse, which is clearly the main thread of this film, this film is too real.That was, in fact, my fear going on. I tend to like horror that is supernatural, sci-fi, or even allegorical, because it keeps you distanced from the true horrors of life (I hate serial killer movies precisely because they are about genuine human evil and suffering). But from the start, Invisible Man is very clearly about real-world issues. It begins with protagonist Cecilia sneaking out on her husband. It's a beautifully designed scene that makes clear, almost wordlessly, both her terror and her resourcefulness.After escaping, she lives in terror until learning that her husband has died. But then, odd things start to happen. Cecilia (excellently played by Elisabeth Moss) and the audience can see what's happening, but to everyone else it looks like Cecilia is going insane. Her escape was a mirage, she is still trapped with no escape, she's been separated from everyone she loves, and there appears to be no way out. It is horrific.I've heard these stories. The women who can't escape. The women who do escape and then are hunted down. One reviewer here thought it was absurd that Cecelia would even be targeted, yet, this happens in the real world ALL THE TIME. I feel like the people reviewing this movie have never heard a single domestic abuse story or think they're all made up.Anyway, the special effects are restrained and effective and the movie has moments of real suspense and horror. And you never feel, for one moment, that Cecilia or the people around you are safe, and its terrifying and deeply disturbing.And that, for me, is the problem. Not that's its unconvincing, but that it's not escapist, but instead a movie that puts you in the shoe of a domestic abuse victim. So while I think this is very well made and effective, I find it hard to deal with.I would recommend this movie, but I'll say all my concerns about how depressing and upsetting it would be were justified.

A year later, she's living with her old friend James (Aldis Hodge), a cop, and his daughter Sydney (Storm Reid) when she hears from Adrian's brother Tom (Michael Dorman) that he has committed suicide. And yet, Cecilia still feels she is not free of his shackles, and as a series of dark events happen around her, and her relationship with her sister Emily (Harriet Dyer) falters, she comes to learn that he is still there.Just before cinema screens around the country (and, indeed, the world) went dark in March, writer/director Leigh Whannell's modern day update of the classic H.G. Wells science fiction tale was one of the last to make a big splash, opening to fairly glowing reviews. Despite a cast of largely unknowns, it looked set to do fairly good business nonetheless, but now critical acclaim is the best it can really hope for. It's that it's not as good as it could have been that is its biggest failing, the squandered potential painfully undeniable.In the #MeToo times, Whannell attempts to take the story beyond the standard realms of traditional sci-fi, and use it to serve as a metaphor for the lasting impact of domestic violence, giving it a social heart that will strike a chord with many. In the beginning, he certainly creates an effective sense of atmosphere and increasing claustrophobia, with some simple long, lingering silent shots, and panoramic use of the camera. But then in the second act, it just degenerates into a pretty standard, goofy slasher pic, with everyone acting in a manner that wouldn't be out of place in one of the later Halloween movies.If it hadn't been so overlong and overindulgent, it might have been a really clever, unique spin on a classic horror tale. To a large extent, it still is, but what you're left with is a long, messy production of what could have been perfect. ***",The Invisible Man

She gets away from her soon-pursuing husband by the skin of her teeth and we soon learn in the aftermath that said husband was a control-freak, obsessively watching her every move. And if you look carefully, also that he's seriously into optics and the like, remember that, it's important. Next thing, she's told by hubby's lawyer brother that he's been killed and she's been left his fortune. So she moves in with her cop pal and his college-age daughter and in relief, starts splashing the cash, but somehow she just can't shake the feeling that her old man is still around and actually isn't dead at all.From this set-up, the film could really have gone one of two or three ways, either as a realistically presented psychological thriller with her out-of-sight ex using his power and influence to disrupt her life while keeping well away from her, or even as a study in paranoia with the wife suffering some kind of breakdown and just imagining all the crazy things happening to her. Or, it could of course go the full H.G. Wells and set the psycho-spouse up as a mirror-suited (remember what I said about his interest in all things optical?) killing-machine, rendering him invisible, out to get her back under his control which plan he puts into motion by firstly framing her for the murder of her own sister just for starters, as you would. Guess which way it goes?So sure enough we get all the cliched, seen-'em-before silly-looking scenes of people fighting and getting beating up by an invisible enemy and lots of static, subjective camera-shots looking at inanimate objects and inviting the viewer to join the connecting dots.Elisabeth Moss as the persecuted wife, gets to bring out her scared, angry and mad faces as the body count increases and the situations become even more ridiculous and predictable. Not that she takes all the mayhem happening around her lying down, oh no, she sure enough overcomes her terror, finds her inner Sarah Connor and decides to fight back leading to a final reckoning back at their old house. For me, she does a good job of staying in character without once breaking out into fits of laughter at all that's going on, especially when her stalker turns out to resemble a now-you-see-him, now-you-don't super-villain running around in a costume that, when revealed, makes him look like a shiny Spider Man.I just found it all very predictable, weakly-characterised, mildly absurd film entertainment. For one thing, I thought the editing poor with jumps to scenes with little or no explanation. Once I sussed how the film was playing all the carefully arranged attempts at dramatic tension evaporated so that I couldn't even be bothered to shout ""He's behind, in front of, to the left or right of you or wherever he was!"" at the screen.Sorry, with its transparent characters and see-through narrative, I just couldn't see what all the fuss was about here.",The Invisible Man

Horror classics don't have to be fusty old period pieces with mist-shrouded castles and the occasional vampire bat though you might think from the credit titles that Leigh Whannell's ""The Invisible Man"" is going to be just that, (storm-tossed seas and what light from yonder window shines?). However, the light comes, not from a mist-shrouded castle, but an ultra-modern house that Elisabeth Moss' Cecilia is sharing with her abusive boyfriend. Yes, he's the invisible man of the title, quite literally as it turns out, and he's not prepared to let Moss get away from him.This is a 21st century horror film built around a very real scenario, (a woman in an abusive relationshiip is stalked by her abuser only in this case she can't see him), and it's creepily alarming throughout. Moss, one of the best actresses on the planet, is terrific as the victim forced to fight back against an unseen assailant. It's a familiar role that can be traced back to the dawn of cinema but Moss gives it shadings other actresses might only dream of.

31,Pjtaylor-96-138044,I see you.,8,3 March 2020,"A fantastic, almost silent opening sets the tone for a remarkably assured 'monster movie', one that's leagues above 'The Mummy (2017)' and proves that stand-alone filmmaking is still the best bet for Blum's reboots. Whannell last impressed with 'Upgrade (2018)', the sci-fi sleeper hit that saw a newly crippled man seek revenge with the help of an advanced spinal implant, and he continues to do so here. While 'The Invisible Man (2020)' isn't quite as entertaining as that previously mentioned title, it's certainly more confident. It has a distinct, compelling style and doesn't feel the need to conform to its genres. Its story is delightfully modern, being steeped in thematic relevance and undeniable subtext. It takes the unconventional horror of everyday gas-lighting, essentially, to its next logical step. Just like how 'Hereditary (2018)' sought to convey the terror of grief, this seeks to convey the terror of abuse. So rarely is this aspect considered and it fits hand-in-glove with the source material. Led by an astounding lead performance from Moss, the piece continuously wows with nuanced storytelling, slow-burn scares and all-out action. It's unconventional and, even, somewhat unpredictable. It's also just very well made. The thing doesn't slow down for a second, pushing forward at its own pace until it reaches an unexpected final confrontation. It's by turns suspenseful, frustrating, horrific, intriguing, pulse-pounding and heart-stopping. This is the sort of stuff Universal should put its backing behind. It's compelling, considered and incredibly entertaining. It doesn't treat its audience like idiots, either. 8/10",The Invisible Man

35,Cineanalyst,The Invisible Gaze,9,5 March 2020,"H.G. Wells's sci-fi novella ""The Invisible Man"" makes for rich cinematic potential; it's a much better unseen movie than it ever was a book. That's because it's based on sight, and so a visual medium such as cinema does the concept more justice than the literary form. I've seen a few film versions since reading it, including the five classic Universal ones from the 1930s and 1940s, plus a couple Invisible Man appearances in Abbott and Costello parodies, as well as Paul Verhoeven's lousy ""Hollow Man"" (2000) and unseen characters in everything from a B-picture such as ""The Amazing Transparent Man"" (1960) to a throwaway gag in Woody Allen's ""Alice"" (1990). Maybe three or four out of all these pictures realize the cinematic potential of the material, and this 2020 rebooting is one of them. Other reviewers have mentioned the allegory for not believing and gaslighting victims of an abuse they don't see, which is apt, but this picture, including the female empowerment, is much deeper than that visually.The original 1933 film was made when synchronized sound was still relatively new in Hollywood, and so it played with the notion of visual spectacle and the bodily presence of actors vanishing in favor of a focus on the voice and audio mediums, including the telephone and radio. The underrated sequel, ""The Invisible Man Returns"" (1940) elaborated upon the semiotics of cinema's indexicality by way of the traces that a concealed body continues to leave behind. The also underrated ""The Invisible Woman"" (1940), meanwhile, had fun with inverting the traditionally-male gaze with the female character's not-to-be-looked-at-ness.In hindsight, this 2020 version, unlike its predecessors, is from the perspective of the victim and woman instead of the crazy mad doctor or otherwise malevolent or mischief-making see-through figure. Partly, it's an abuse/rape revenge slasher flick. From the opening sequence, however, it becomes clear that there's an advanced notion of the role of the camera, as well as of technology and a motif of water as metaphor (which also plays into the importance of liquid in catching a transparent trespasser--traces again). (As a further digression, I would like to think the opening breaking of the waves references the shared themes of control of women and sex in Lars von Trier's 1996 drama.) Their home is a modern panopticon, covered in surveillance cameras and alarms. As for the cinematographic apparatus for the movie proper, there's the first of what turns out to be several pans and cuts throughout to empty spaces, as if a character were there and, perhaps, because they are. This set-up was the whole idea behind Jeremy Bentham's panopticon--down to the design to control one's thoughts by them internalizing being watched. Ironically, at least at first, however, it's the imprisoned, punny-named protagonist, ""Cee"" (an evermore impressive Elisabeth Moss), who is the architect.Recalling the 1933 film (besides the appreciated Easter eggs), technology figures highly into the control and surveillance here. Besides the invisibility outfit and the surveillance equipment, Cee covers the lens of her webcam out of privacy concerns--hiding herself electronically just as she does by physical location and choice of association. Her email is exploited to steal her identity. She benefits from tech, too, though, as a vibrating smartphone first alerts her to turning the tables on her stalker. There's even the Uber ride she calls for to escape (her fleeing, appropriately, also covered on and seen from the point of view of another surveillance camera).For the most part, the cinematic gaze follows Cee through different spaces, which plays into a familiar pattern of the visual pleasure derived from cinema, of women's supposed to-be-looked-at-ness and the association of the gaze with the male gender--as previously dealt with in one of the aforementioned 1940 films. Psychoanalytic feminist film theorist Laura Mulvey's famous essay, too, is all about this. In a sense, the camera is already an invisible man, and by association of our gaze with that of the camera, we, the spectator, too, are invisible. We see but are unseen by the characters. This puts the camera and the spectator in the position of the baddie here, the Invisible Man. In a lot of ways, this paradigm is similar to that of one of the first great slasher flicks, ""Halloween"" (1978), where we shared the gaze of the masked (and, thus, partly unseen) murderer, as it, along with the knives, was wielded to stalk horny teenagers turned victims. Jamie Lee Curtis's character challenged this at the level of the look, including by unmasking her assailant--and, by association, the spectator.This ""Invisible Man"" redoubles all of this. Instead of some serum, chemical cocktail, rays, atomic radiation or what have you, invisibility here is achieved by bunches of cameras and a system of projection, as it is with the role of the spectator to the filmed picture in front of us. Cee, then, attacks the gaze at its source through the cinematographic apparatus (not entirely unlike ""Spider-Man: Far From Home"" (2019), come to think of it). I even appreciate the pacing of this picture and the embrace of long moments of silence, although I see how some may find it slow or not scary, but this isn't a movie about jump scares, gore and base thrills. While the score is serviceable, there's no need to replicate, say, John Carpenter's iconic music. ""The Invisible Man"" is about seeing. The best part may be the last scene: her exploitation of the surveillance--audio and visual--and its perspective, her repurposing of the gaze by possession of the camera-ed suit, and, finally, she looks directly at the camera--right at the spectator, returning the gaze. As she shares in our seeing, we're no longer invisible. Then, she blinks, fade to black, and the looking disappears.",The Invisible Man

While its nearly impossible to discuss this movies plot without getting into spoilers, i will only say that i enjoyed its first three quarters more then the last one, but still it was a very good movie overall. This movies premise only confirmed the old truth - most scary things are ones we can't see, when then our imagination starts to filling the unseen parts, and its always works.Overall, ""The Invisible Man"" is a very skillful directed, written and acted movie. It is spooky, keeps you guessing and does this in a good way.",The Invisible Man

39,ironhorse_iv,What a pleasure surprise! This horror movie is clearly worth seeing!,7,7 May 2020,"This loose adaptation of author H. G. Wells 1897's book of the same name was initially going to be an installment in Universal Picture's share cinematic dark universe with Johnny Depp in the titular role. The movie handled by screenwriter David S Goyer would have the Invisible Man infiltrated Czarist Russia as a spy for the British Empire. However due to the underwhelming performance of both 2014 film 'Dracula Untold' & 2017 movie 'the Mummy' at the box office; the concept was then shelfed. Then the negative press about Depp's ugly divorce from wife Amber Heard began to surface as talks about domestic abuse hit the rounds. This cause Universal to drop the actor in favor of writer and director Leigh Whannel's progressive version in which the titular character now serves as an antagonist in a spousal abuse story to save face. For the most part, the plan kinda work. The film produced by Blumhouse didn't feel too misandry or over feminist propaganda. It really did find the balance when telling the tale of Cecilia Kass (Elisabeth Moss) being haunted by her abusive ex-lover Adrian Griffin (Oliver Jackson Cohen) after the inventor's apparent death. The thriller was mostly well shot. Stefan Duscio's cinematography was very effective. All the visuals ranging from establishing the coastal locations of the bay area to the spotless overlooking glass house give off a coldness feeling of being watched. The film never lets you forget the Invisible Man could be anywhere, with the camera often focusing on empty wide shots and the subtle clicking noise. I like that we never get a good look at villain's face until the very end of the movie. Even the opening 10 minutes of Cecilia trying to escape the house with little to no forced sound effects, dialogue and music was outstanding creepy. Show don't tell approach work so well during these moments. It's only after that, the film somewhat loose its edge when twist and turns are introduced such as Adrian wanted a baby from Cecilia. Then why does he put her in so much physical harm that might cause death or a miscarriage? It's jarring. Another thing, the whole inheritance subplot really doesn't go anywhere. If the idea is to make the woman go crazy to the point that everybody else would distance themselves and she will have no choice but to seek help from the Griffin family. Then why give her lots of money? I get that Adrian wanted to give her a false hope because he is sadistic, but that would only draw more people to help her overcome her problems. Theoretically it makes more sense to use the wealth to make Cecilia and himself disappear easier, seeing that everyone thinks he's dead & Cecilia just some insane woman. After all it did look like he made an invisible suit that is easy for Cecilia to control and wear. Plus, if anybody did find out the truth that he could just paid them off. Instead the ending really come off as very unrealistic. I really couldn't believe that the villain got away with the crimes nor he wouldn't see his demise coming. He had to knew that two of his suits were out there. Regardless Leigh has a very impressive eye for unusual action sequences. The hospital scene makes you wonder if Griffin had super strength and durability or was that coming from the suit. Even so it does beg the question why the villain didn't get a heat stroke in that suit as there seem to be no cooling setup. In real life he would be super weak and his smell would be very overpowering as he wouldn't be able to gain or save energy. At least in this version he wouldn't go immediately blind due to light not being able to hit his retinas as that would be protected. Regardless I doubt he would be able to see that good to fight off people. Regardless the first fight scene in the suit was intense and impressive even if it was bit odd that the Lanier family would leave Celica alone in their own house. Don't get me wrong the supporting cast was fine in their acting, but their characters really need to be expanded more. As for the main character. Moss's acting is solid. You really get the dread and anxiety. You can tell that Celica has it rough throughout the film. I just wish the movie play off the mystery more that it could all be in her head. The movie is way heavy handled when revealing the invisible man. Like the trailer, the film kinda spoils the mystery early on by illogically showing the killer using his cell phone when he really didn't need to. Despite that I really did like the foreshadowing involving the mosaic, jellyfishes, and mental health posters. I also found the symbolism with the names given to the character very interesting. After all Cecelia means blind, but everybody calls her C. Another thing I dig was all the shout outs and nods to the more well-known appearances of the Invisible Man including a scene where a fashion dummy wore similar clothes to the 1933 James Whale's film of the same name and much later a patient is shown in the mental hospital covered in bandages. Even the idea of Cecelia trying to clear her name is from the 1940 sequel 'The Invisible Man Returns'. It was also cool to see the mention of the tech company Cobolt from Whannel's 2018 Sci Fi flick 'Upgrade'. Along with that the dark ambience music from composer Benjamin Wallfisch was also nice to hear. Overall: Compare with Paul Verhoeven's 2000 film 'Hollow Man'. This movie certainly stood out for its better loosely modern fresh take of the novel. The movie is easy to find as it was made available on video on demand due to the COVID-19 pandemic. It's one flick that you shouldn't turn a blind eye too.",The Invisible Man
40,nairtejas,One-Line Review: The Invisible Man / Solid Thriller / 7 Stars,7,20 March 2020,The classic old story gets an upscale reinvention in The Invisible Man while also shedding light into the social menace of sadistic men who manipulate the women who love them through physical and mental abuse with the plot focusing more on the psychological effects of such a relationship where Elisabeth Moss acts like she's living the character and single-handedly shoulders the film into a solid entertainer with some great CGI-induced mind-blowing action sequences as well as a haunting score that overall enhances the appeal of the film as you self-quarantine yourself in these trying times. TN.,The Invisible Man
41,The-Sarkologist,Chilling,7,3 March 2020,"Well, I'm not quite sure if this is what HG Wells envisioned when he originally wrote the story, but the filmmakers have certainly taken this concept in a different direction. The thing is that this film is much more of a thriller than a science fiction style of movie, so it does take its time to build up the tension, but as you watch it you do come to realise that this is actually needed for the film to work.So, we have this woman who happens to live with a rather controlling and abusive husband. Anyway, she escapes and later learns that he has died and she has inherited his fortune. Yeah, this guy is basically a tech billionaire. However there seems to be more going on than meets the eye because it seems that maybe, just maybe, he isn't dead.The film does indicate that not only is he a tech billionaire, but that he made his fortunate in the field of optics, which raises the suggestion that maybe he has found a way of becoming invisible, but then again he could just be a poltergeist. However, I don't think the film leaves that much open for that interpretation, though the trailers, at least when I first saw them, had that as a possibility.
Yeah, there are quite a few twists and turns in the film, and while I don't necessarily believe that the end really does leave any ambiguity, the thing that I did notice is that we don't actually get to see this guy all that much, and we certainly don't know who is in the suit - we just assume that it is him. Well, there are a few other clues as well, but the thing is that the film does attempt to be somewhat ambiguous in this regards.There is also the thing about the sound mind and body. Obviously nobody believes the protagonist in the film, especially since there is evidence that he happens to be dead. Mind you, it does explore the concept of the absusive relationship, and even explores the nature that it is not necessarily physical but could be quite psychological as well. Not surprisingly the protagonist is female, while the antagonist is male, and it is really all about how these types of people really get into your head and can be quite controlling.At first I found the film to be somewhat difficult to watch, and it certainly does take quite a while to pick up, but when it does it really does get pretty good. Once again, it was one of those films that when it was beginning I was sort of wandering why I was wasting my time with it, but once you reach the end, well, at least in my mind, I definitely felt that it was worth it.",The Invisible Man
42,slightlymad22,Elizabeth Moss Shines In Really Good Thriller,8,28 February 2020,"I just got out of The Invisible Man With my eldest son.Despite an awful ad campaign which gave far too much away (I'll get to that later) this really worked for me and is the best horror I have seen for a long time. Elizabeth Moss is superb, (granted she always is) but the full movie rests on her shoulders, if she does not pull her performance off, the full movie fails. All the acting is really good to be honest and something I really liked was it does not rely on jump scares either. although there are a few, they are not lazily done!! It's not just the usual lame loud noises to the usual moment we have seen 100 times before etc.It's opening hour or so is a bit of a slower paced than you'd expect. This works for me though because I'm more interested in Psychological Horror than Supernatural or Slasher Horror movies, give me a Black Swan over Annabelle any day of the week, and this plays into that arena. Actually my favourite part of the movie was the slower first half, as Moss appears to be losing her mind.It has a few problems, it's a bit too long despite only being 2 hours, it's score is insanely over the top and there is one big glaring plot hole (which it makes a big deal of at times, but then ignores at others), there are a few plot holes actually and although it's script does have some smart dialogue in it, at other times it's really cliche. But that really is nit picking and none of them really stop my enjoyment of this movie, as it often surprise and is REALLY intense at times.I still think calling it The Invisible Man was a mistake. As we knew he wasn't dead and had found out how to be invisible. So the suspense or intrigue of the supernatural or psychological breakdown (was she doing it or herself) aspects was gone!! As for the trailers, some of the big moments are in the trailers, but there are also big moments in the trailers, that are not present in the movie, but one thing the trailers did really well, was edit things out of sequence.I'd recommend not watching another trailer and see this as soon as possible.",The Invisible Man

46,cruise01,"Sharp direction, script, performances makes this film worth watching.",9,28 February 2020,"The Invisible Man (4.5 out of 5 stars).The Invisible Man is a really good science fiction horror film that is a reboot from the original classic monster films. But with Leigh Whannell's direction and script which grounded the character and using serious themes about toxic relationships and abuse. And throwing the fear that someone may be watching you and no one believing you. That is where the film goes. Following Cecilia (Elisabeth Moss) who is escaping from an abusive relationship with scientist Adrian (Oliver Jackson-Cohen). The opening intense sequence with Cecilia escaping over night. And the idea of Adrian chasing her down. Weeks later, Cecilia is staying with her friend James (Aldis Hodge) and his daughter Sydney (Storm Reid). When she finds out Adrian committed suicide. Having difficulties believing it. She begins to feel like she is being watched by him still. When her life is turned upside down with no one believing her and having trouble trying to prove that he is still alive. When she begins to feel like he found a way to be invisible.The plot is good. Whannell uses the concept of an abusive relationship and how it can take a strong toll on someone. Like Cecilia, when she is afraid for weeks that he is still out there. She can barely walk outside the house without a jogger setting her off. That fear alone and adding her abusive ex stalking her and being invisible. Which takes the obsessiveness to a whole new level when someone can watch someone for a long time in a house. There is a couple of plot twists which is surprising and thrilling. Leigh Whannell tends to add a twist to all his movie scripts. The script and direction is sharp, smart, and has a lot of fun building intensity. The direction of having lots of cinematography being still as Cecilia is walking in a room. While watching for details if the invisible character is there or not. By watching items move or sound.The film does have a few intense scenes with Cecilia being attacked and thrown around. Which her friend James has trouble believing her or if it is all in Cecilia's head. The music score is good. The sound of Cecilia coming across someone is suspenseful. The cinematography shots are well placed. The plot is good. The film did have a little slow story building.Overall, The Invisible Man is a really good horror film. It has a few scares. I did feel like it did lack in jump scares. The film is suspenseful, thrilling, and performances by Elisabeth Moss is great.",The Invisible Man
47,zkonedog,Only Really Works If You Are Watching For The Metaphor/Catharsis,5,4 March 2020,"This new incarnation of the Invisible Man story is getting rave reviews thus far upon release. This is likely well-deserved praise, as Blumhouse Productions takes the concept and applies an interesting social dynamic (that of the controlling boyfriend/partner). The problem with some viewers (like myself), however, is that unless you can identify with that specific scenario, there isn't much else to this film.For a very basic overview, ""The Invisible Man"" begins with Cecilia (Elisabeth Moss) fleeing from her ultra-controlling boyfriend Adrian (Oliver Jackson-Cohen). Though physically escaping his presence, the ordeal has led to Cecilia becoming extremely agoraphobic-until receiving the news that Adrian has passed away (and left her a large sum of money in the process). That solves the problem, right? Not so fast. Just as Cecilia begins coming out of her shell, she's haunted by the seemingly invisible presence of Adrian, of which no one believes, of course.""The Invisible Man"" clearly uses that former horror property to create a metaphor film here for a scenario that many women face (controlling partner). Even when the woman has escaped the relationship, that ""invisible"" presence lingers, if you will. Absolutely nothing wrong with this and I can 100% see why it will strike a chord with many viewers. What it does mean, however, is that the climax/catharsis of the movie will only be reached if the viewer is fully invested in Cecilia extracting her revenge on Adrian. There is almost literally no other driving force to be found here, and that might be somewhat of a problem.What if the viewer can't relate to that scenario at all? Does the film offer anything else besides the metaphor? As a 34-year old, 6'8"" male, I cannot relate to the psychological or physical terror of being controlled by another human being. I can try to ""fake it"", but it simply isn't a scenario that gives me even a bit of pause. Beyond that, unfortunately, ""Invisible Man"" did little else to draw me in.In terms of plot, it is quite predictable. I wish there would have more ambiguity over Cecilia's invisible hauntings. Maybe play up the ""is she crazy, is she not?!"" angle a bit more. But that was never the plan here, as again the reason the film will work with so many viewers is because they'll need to see Cecilia triumph over Adrian in a very physical way.I also didn't find any of the proceedings particularly spooky or unsettling. This was probably due to the predictability of the plot. When I was 99% certain it was indeed Adrian in some sort of invisibility guise the whole time, it sort of took the punch out of things for me.Actually, I think the metaphor angle would have worked much better for me if more had been done with Adrian at the beginning of the movie. While perhaps the mere threat of a controlling partner is enough for some viewers to become invested, I think I could have benefitted from actually seeing Adrian's despicable behavior, which viewers (oddly) really only get at the very end when the outcome is all but decided already. He does come off as incredibly smarmy and villain-worthy, but it was just ""too little, too late"" for me by then.Overall, ""Invisible Man"" is a film that will really, really work if you can become invested in the central premise/metaphor on which it is built. If you can't, though, it will likely lack enough ""anything else"" to keep it from being a rather middling experience.",The Invisible Man
48,eddie_baggins,A tense and taut thriller that will have you double checking empty spaces in your room,7,3 March 2020,"After the epic failure that was The Mummy in 2017, it appeared as the though the high-profile Dark Universe series developed by Universal Studios was well and truly DOA.Low and behold though and 3 years on, Australian director/writer and all-round everyman Leigh Whannell has managed to breathe life into this shared universe, with help from master producer Jason Blum, by delivering a tension-riddled and character driven horror/thriller hybrid that showcases what can be done when story comes first ahead of spectacle and large-scale focus.At one time set to star Johnny Depp and likely too be a far more over the top affair, Whannell's version of The Invisible Man story, that has been seen in different incarnations for over 100 years, is a stripped back and relevant delivery of the tale that doesn't try to connect to any of the other possible ""Dark Universe"" properties, as it instead follows Elizabeth Moss's distressed Cecilia Kass trying to escape the clutches of an abusive relationship at the hands of Oliver Jackson-Cohen tech-genius Adrian Griffin.Including his lead actress in the script-writing process, Whannell and Moss have crafted a thought-out and layered journey for Kass to go through that adds depth to a film that could've otherwise been a mere gimmick as we are afraid of what at many times is the thing unseen.Learning tips and tricks off his fellow Australian and close friend James Wan, Whannell has through his efforts on Insidious Chapter 3 and the underrated action gem Upgrade honed his craft in an exciting fashion and his handling of The Invisible Man sees another step forward for the director being taken, with his use of empty space and calm is eerily unnerving, while the films choc-full of memorable scenes that will go down as some of the years most unforgettable (a paint can trick, a shocking restaurant date and a Hospital hallway showdown particular highlights).While his handling of the technical and editing is laudable, Whannell is also able to draw out another great turn from Moss, who continues to be one of the most exciting actresses working today, showcasing his ability as a director able to get his performers to bring their best to the table and become one with the material he is asking them to bring to life.There's a lot to love about The Invisible Man, providing a cinema experience not unlike the quiet audience viewings that A Quiet Place provided a few years back, unfortunately a few odd character decisions, plot devices and motivations at times don't always sit well within the films movements towards its end goals, elements that seal the fate of Whannell's film being well-above average for its genre but not quite the classic it could've been.Final Say -Another impressive effort from Australia's very own Whannell, The Invisible Man is a relevant and memorable reimagining of a classic tale that will have audiences on the edge of their seats more often than not.3 ½ pairs of Nike shoes out of 5",The Invisible Man

53,southdavid,Covert Actions,7,11 March 2020,"The demise of the Dark Universe has opened up opportunities for filmmakers to do something with those classic Universal horror characters. As ""The Invisible Man"" has proved - they can be a goldmine in the hands of the right producers, as this relatively low budget, smartly made, feature has been a big hit.Having escaped from her abusive partner, Cecila Kass (Elisabeth Moss) slowly begins her recovery at a friend's house. Her anxiety only alleviates a little when she discovers that Adrian (Oliver Jackson-Cohen) has taken his own life. Her unease returns though, when she starts to feel like she's being watched, though nobody is there, emails are sent that she didn't write and things go missing around the house. She believes that Adrian has faked his death and is somehow in the room with her, but is this the case, or is this the effect of the years of physical and psychological abuse that she has received?Whilst I can't imagine that ""The Invisible Man"" is going to be anyone's favourite film of all time, it's much better than it could have been in the wrong hands. To be clear, Leigh Whannell and the Blumhouse team are exactly the right hands. With no inherent desire to make a film servicing any bigger idea than this one movie - ""The Invisible Man"" manages to contemporise the story, whilst still remaining emotionally true to the original and to say something about the lasting effects of domestic abuse without compromising on entertainment. It is, in effect two movies. The first half is like a poltergeist movie, with Cecila slowly tortured by the invisible Adrian, whilst suggesting that it might all be in her mind. It's very tense and makes you scan the screen constantly looking for any clue as to where ""Adrian"" might be. The second half (I'll keep the review spoiler free, so I'll not explain what's happening) is more of thriller - the tension dissipates a bit, but there's some excellent visual effects.Elisabeth Moss is great, as always. Carrying the movie from start to finish she's in literally every scene. Her character transition points are marvellous. Nobody else in the cast really stands out, both in a positive or a negative way. Moss's ability allows the film to save time (and money) in other ways. You don't need a flashback to see the abuse she's received - as her face can tell the whole story.I doubt I'll revisit it very often, but it was a decent experience.",The Invisible Man

55,paul-allaer,The (unexpected) best movie of 2020 (so far),8,29 February 2020,"""The Invisible Man"" (2020 release; 124 min.) brings the story of Cecilia. As the movie opens, Cecilia is in bed, next to her boyfriend, eyes wide open, with the alarm clock reading 3:41. She gently gets up and it is clear that she is trying to make her escape, having drugged her boyfriend. She barely manages to get away and is picked up by her sister Emily. We then go to ""Two Weeks Later"", as Cecilia is in a safe house with a friend. Emily stops by again, and has big news: Adrian (the ex-boyfriend) has killed himself! At this point we are 10 min. into the movie but to tell you more would spoil your viewing experience, you;ll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.Couple of comments: this movie has been in development hell for years (at one point Johnny Depp was attached to it), and then finally was made as a Blumhouse Production. Blumhouse has built a nice role in making clever ""scary"" movies on a limited budget. The film is a reimagining, if not reboot, of the classic 1930s movie of the same name , which in turn is based on the H.G. Wells 1890s book. Of course in the reboot the story is set in today's Bay Area. The film is written and directed by Leigh Wannell, himself no slouch in ""scary"" movies (Saw I, II and III, as well as Insidious 1,2 and 3). From the get-go, the movie is very tense/intense, starting with Cecilia's escape from Adrian's house. It's not long before things get worse. Of course with the ""bed guy"" being invisible, less is more, and it's incredibly effective. I would call the first half of the movie more of a psychological thriller than it is a ""Scary"" movie. Check out the very first scene where Cecilia realizes that there is an invisible man in her room. The movie benefits enormously from the outstanding lead performance by Elisabeth Moss, who is in practically every frame of the film. The second hour of the movie is still very good, even if not as captivating as the first half, as eventually all hell breaks loose and bodies start flying left and right. As we approached the movie's climax, I kept thinking to my self ""I cannot believe how good this movie is!"".""The Invisible Man"" opened wide this weekend, and is projected to do quite well at the box office, although I certainly couldn't tell that, as the Friday early evening screening where I saw this at in a large theater was attended poorly (about 15 people). But there is a reason why this film is currently rated 90% fresh on Rotten Tomatoes: the movie is frighteningly good, just rock solid from start to finish, and for me the very unexpected best movie of 2020 (so far). I'd readily suggest you check it out, be it in the theater, on VOD, or eventually on DVD/Blu-ray, and draw your own conclusion.",The Invisible Man
56,subxerogravity,That was good...very good!,8,28 February 2020,"If I'm not mistaken, every version of the invisible man has always had that plot of the man using his miracle of science to do something creepy to a woman. The only difference in this version is that it takes up the whole movie cause it's done from the women's perspective instead of the man.
Elisabeth Moss is making an interesting career telling the struggles of women in the most extreme matter. Sure, Mad Men was kinda tamed but the Handmaid's tale isn't and neither is this.
The invisible man is genuinely one of the most scariest movies I've ever seen and that's because it took the worse situation a women could possibly be in and used advance technology to make it worse. Genius
I will admit that there were elements of the movie I did not fully understand. I can't tell if it's because the filmmakers were being too subtle on the approach or is it just because I'm a man (most likely the latter) but either way it was all great. A great thriller and a great horror movie.",The Invisible Man
57,jtindahouse,Whannell proves he is the real deal with a masterful horror film,8,2 March 2020,"I just have to start by saying I can not hear the title of this movie without having the Queen song stuck in my head for the next few hours. I just had to get that off my chest. I really wasn't sure what to expect with 'The Invisible Man'. Horror movies lately have been particularity terrible and so it is hard to get excited about any of them. Leigh Whannell though has proven himself to be a very competent filmmaker, originally just in terms of writing, but lately in the director's chair as well. 'Upgrade' was a terrific film, so that gave me hope. Somehow he has managed to take a very uninspired idea for a story (as we found out with the likes of 'Hollow Man') and make it into something great. This film was a blast.The opening scene sets the tone incredibly for this movie. I've always said your opening scene is the second most important in your film (after the last scene of course) and 'The Invisible Man' nails it. It was immensely intense. The horror side of things later in the film is handled extremely well too. The film never uses false jump-scares. If it's making you jump then something has genuinely happened. And there are some very good scares in this movie. In a world where a lot of people think they can predict exactly what a horror movie is going to do, and when it is going to make you jump, a lot of people will be taken off-guard by this one.I love that Elizabeth Moss was cast as the lead for this movie. They don't even try to doll her up all that much. They are simply happy to rely on her acting skills and have that drive the movie. Too many horror directors would've thrown a supermodel into this role and ruined everything. The only negative I would mention about this movie is that it can be quite tough to watch through the middle. Seeing a woman get unfairly treated and having her treated as crazy when she tells people what is happening to her is not a fun thing to watch. Otherwise though this is a hard film to fault and one I would highly recommend seeing.",The Invisible Man
58,jadavix,"Half inert slow-burn, half sci-fi action thriller, with a ""serious theme"" as an afterthought",6,6 December 2020,"I had my reservations about watching ""The Invisible Man"", because it was made by Leigh Whannell, who is at least partially responsible for those stupid, endless Saw movies, and the equally stupid but less original ""Insidious"".Those movies were technically sound, but artistically bereft, and unfortunately, ""The Invisible Man"" isn't that much of a departure. It seems to be going for the unbearable slow-burn that Ari Aster has perfected, but doesn't get there.The movie really comes alive in the second half, with some genuinely surprising moments, showing it would have worked better with more action.The movie also tries to make a serious statement, or at least have a serious real-world theme, with its intimations of domestic violence, and the struggle of a woman trying to escape this situation. I guess Jordan Peele, who showed that serious contemporary issues can have a place in supernatural fiction, was the movie's other inspiration. However this is handled clumsily here, and it seems like the movie only remembers its social conscience right at the end, after intimating it an hour or so previously, when the movie comes to an underwhelming conclusion that I suppose would have made Andrea Dworkin proud. The fact that this theme culminates in a lame conclusion tells us it was an uneasy fit for the movie's story.",The Invisible Man
59,Stevieboy666,Interesting and well made re-imagining of the classic story,7,9 August 2020,"After Universal's dismal remake of The Mummy and having recently watched several weak Blum House productions it was only word of mouth recommendations that made me look forward to watching this latest version. I admire the writers for totally re-imagining the story, here the main player by far is Mr Invisisible's ex-girlfriend very well played by Elisabeth Moss. There are no mad scientist experiments into achieving invisibility but instead the crux of the story is that of an abusive relationship, with the woman being very much the victim. Only her ex is able to fake his own death, then terrorise her without being seen which provides the horror element. The film clocks in at just over 2 hours, some horror fans may get bored at times but I was gripped. The film has a couple of very memorable scenes, the restaurant being one in particular (wow!). The movie was cut in the UK by 3 seconds to gain a 15 certificate, thankfully the disc release is 18 uncut.I hope any further Universal/Blum collaborations will be as good.",The Invisible Man
60,stevendbeard,Engaging & Surprising,8,29 February 2020,"I saw ""The Invisible Man"", starring Elisabeth Moss-The Handmaid's Tale_tv, The West Wing_tv; Oliver Jackson_Cohen-The haunting of Hill House_tv, Faster; Aldis Hodge-Jack Reacher:Never Go Back, A Good Day to Die Hard and Michael Dorman-Patriot_tv, Killer Elite_2011.
This is an attempt to reboot Universal Studios' 'Monster Universe' after the poor showing of 2017's The Mummy. I think that they did a pretty good job. Elisabeth plays a woman in a relationship with an abusive man, Oliver-both physically and mentally. He is a wealthy researcher in the field of experimental optics and controls everything Elisabeth does. Two weeks after she finally gets up enough courage to leave him, Oliver is found dead, of an apparent suicide. His brother Michael is the executor of the will, and Oliver leaves Elisabeth $5 million dollars, with a few stipulations. She can not commit a crime. And most importantly, she can not be found to be mentally insane. Elisabeth moved in with a friend, Aldis, when she left Oliver and strange things start to happen that causes Elisabeth to think that Oliver is not dead. And of course, no one else ever sees these strange things happening like Elisabeth does. Is Oliver back or is she going insane? There are several twists in the story that are engaging and surprising and a few nods to the original Invisible Man series.
It's rated ""R"" for bloody violence, drug use and language and has a running time of 2 hours & 4 minutes.
I really enjoyed it and would buy it on Blu-Ray.",The Invisible Man

63,st-shot,Up the lazy slash fest.,3,27 October 2020,"With the latest state of the art tools and toys to produce nightmarish representative reality on screen filmmakers have become lazy and unimaginative. Capable of all sorts of magic tricks they give scant attention fleshing out character or filling obvious plot holes in favor of getting you to dive under your seat with the blood and gore money shots that CGI is superb at creating. Enter The Invisible Man, a generic high gloss slasher, twice as long as an episode of Thriller and a lot less of it in it.Director Leigh Whannel seems more than content to bore (not to be confused with build suspense) in between his butchery that has Elizabeth Moss trying to avoid a dead ex with a brilliant imagination. Larding up scenes with Moss trying to convince folks she is being stalked by a dead invisible guy leads you to worrying more about her hygiene than her predicament.The abracadabra moments of horror do jolt with authority but overall merely act as smelling salts to Whannel's sluggish pacing in-between. The Invisible Man is not worth looking at.",The Invisible Man
64,parry_na,Not what you might be expecting.,8,6 February 2021,"This refreshing reimagining of 'The Invisible Man' takes some time to get going, but draws you in without you knowing it, employing the 'Paranormal Activity' trick of slowly panning across scenes to a point where nothing appears to be happening, getting the audience to believe something is *about* to happen. Even then, when you're hooked, it is clear Leigh Whannell's story isn't quite what fans of previous Invisible Man adventures might be expecting.For example, the focus throughout is on Cecilia Kass. Actress Elisabeth Moss isn't the usual heroine in films such as this. She's not an angsty teen, seen accidently spilling out of tight jeans and a crop-top for the benefit of the camera. Kass's former partner was manipulative, and has died, leaving her his fortune, and Moss's performance carries the burden of that with gravitas: great acting, and interesting that the invisible man isn't the central point for the drama. We 'see' things from her point of view - very slowly to begin with. But stick with it - things pay off as time goes on - and there's a belter of an ending.All the characters are well played, with the possible exception of James Lanier (Aldis Hodge). He looks great, but his wholesomeness is difficult to engage with; he's too good to be true - until the very final reel, that is.It's interesting that this film succeeded critically and financially, whereas other, higher budgeted Universal horror wannabes did not. It seems intelligence and character has triumphed over big names and CGI to at last kick-start the company's 'Dark Universe' idea. I wish it well. My score for 'The Invisible Man' is 8 out of 10.",The Invisible Man
65,XweAponX,The Invisible Stalker,10,20 March 2020,"This is the most disturbing version of the invisible man I have ever seen.A wholly unique story, at first it has nothing to do with science fiction. It appears to be a simple domestic issue. Until some creepy things start happening.Creepy things that are made to appear as if you are the person responsible...The mechanism that renders a person invisible here, is totally unlike anything used in any film relating to the invisible man.In the past it has always been some kind of potion or electrochemical process.Actually this method is somewhat like something James Bond would use, something from M, when John Cleese was still playing that character. That's all I will say about it.There's one thing that kind of bothered me about the character of Cecilia though, she did very good detective work, but then when she has the dripping red meat in her hands, she kind of drops it. There was one point in this film when she discovers something that could have turned everything around right at that moment, but instead she just walks away and gives her tormentor more opportunity. And because of that shortsightedness, she suffers a huge loss.But without that, the ending of the film would not really be as good as it is, and it just gave the film much more of the human error element. I imagine the ending of this film could have taken on a totally different tone had she become more proactive, because generally when you find out a secret, the best thing to do is to make it work for you.An excellent revisioning of the film that Claude Rains originally starred in.",The Invisible Man
66,alindsay-al,A Great Horror/Thriller,8,6 March 2020,"This film has been gaining plenty of traction in this last week so I decided to go watch The Invisible Man and this is my review of the film. The premise of the film sees a woman recieve a huge amount of money from an abusive ex, but she believes he might not be as dead as believed.
Main Character
Elisabeth Moss plays the lead character in this film and she is excellent in this role, you really are rooting for her in the film and you want to see her succeed. However, there is some depth to her character and some moral shades of grey that make her fascinating to watch and a great lead character. Also she delivers a great acting performance as plenty of her scenes are on her own and she does a great job in selling the premise of the film.
Supporting Characters
Aldis Hodge plays her friend in this film and I really liked his character in the film, he is very likeable to watch and I thought he had really good chemistry with Moss to truly build that friendship. Also his character goes through some interesting things in the film and it makes him a more memorable supporting Character. Michael Dorman plays her ex's brother and I thought he was very good in his role, he is very slimy in the role and every time he is on the screen he just makes you feel uncomfortable. Oliver Jackson-Cohen plays her Ex in the film and I just didn't really feel captivated by his character, she seems to think he is back alive but you don't really get enough to care about his character or his motivation against her in the film. Harriet Dyer plays her sister in the film and she really has nothing to her, you don't really learn enough about her to be interested in their relationship and how it affects Moss's character in the film.
Story
The story is really interesting, you see how Moss's character's life is affected by the death of her ex and this supposed Invisible Man. It is much more interesting then just your average slasher flick as you see this woman's whole life get put through hell by something that might not even be there. Also the ending of this film is really good, it feels appropriate for the film and gives the characters the ending that they all deserve, plus it also leaves some questions to ask and ways to interpret that ending.
Script
The script is great in this film, there isn't much humour in the film which is to be expected but the great dramatic dialogue makes up for it and really brings you into the characters and the plot, it makes you really interested in what is going on and care about the characters.
Style
The style of the film is incredibly suspenseful and thrillling, the film sucks you into the atmosphere and makes you feel the same way as Elizabeth Moss's character in the film and feeling scared as her. But like that this film is pretty slow and can drag a little bit at times and I kind of wish the plot moved a little bit faster so we could get to the more exciting bits a little bit quicker.
Overall
Overall this may be the sleeper hit of 2020, I was not expecting much going into this film but I had a great time with The Invisible Man, if you are a fan of thrillers and horror films then this is a film you should be seeing as soon as you can.",The Invisible Man

When she escapes at the beginning of this story, her violent, vindictive partner apparently commits suicide. Still in hiding, troubling things start happening to Moss.Hard to overstate how tight and tense from frame first to last this is. Littered with eerie and a few genuinely shocking moments, this is a pretty masterful classic horror story, hitched neatly on the back of a real story of appalling abuse. Moss is good in the lead, with a strong supporting cast, particularly Aldis Hodge who does well as the single level headed persona.

70,jimbo-53-186511,Psychological terror - done right,9,12 January 2021,"In order to escape her abusive and controlling husband Cecilia (Elisabeth Moss) makes the bold decision to leave her husband in the middle of the night with the help of her sister Emily. Once Cecilia is out of harm's way she sets a new life up for herself, but is initially afraid to leave the house. Upon hearing the news that her ex-husband has committed suicide Cecilia starts to feel free again and begins to try to start leading a normal life again, but a series of bizarre events lead Cecilia to believe that her ex-husband may not be dead and worse still that he may be stalking her....Clearly horror and terror are subjective and what is frightening to one person may not necessarily be frightening to another person. For the most part, The Invisible Man is the sort of film that messes with your head as for a good chunk of the film Whannell toys the audience with the notion of a perceived threat rather than an actual threat and it's this type of horror that I like best. If you have a lunatic running round killing people with a knife then you always feel that there is some hope that the victim(s) will escape or outsmart the killer, but in a film like Invisible Man the threat and mental strain inflicted on the victim is beyond calculation.I think the thing that really sold the film to me was that I genuinely felt fear for Cecilia; the idea that she is constantly in a state of peril and genuinely helpless to put a stop to what is happening to her is what is most terrifying. Through his narrative, Whannell had crept inside my head and effectively put me in Cecilia's shoes and I think that is the main reason that the film had such a profound effect on me.As you would expect with a Leigh Whannell the direction is confident and assured; despite running for 2 hours the film is well-paced and the development of the story is nicely balanced. Elisabeth Moss is superb in the leading role and the supporting cast all do their bit as well.From what I can gather this is a remake of a 1930's film of the same name and having not seen the original film I have to be objective and judge this film on its own merits. My verdict on this film is pretty much covered in the above paragraphs, but one thing I will say is that having enjoyed the remake I'll be sure to check the original film out at some point. If like me, you have not seen the original film I would still recommend watching this film particularly if you are a fan of Leigh Whannell and his style of film making.",The Invisible Man
71,sauravjoshi85,Nicely acted and beautifully made,8,19 August 2021,"The Invisible Man is a 2020 American science fiction horror film written and directed by Leigh Whannell.

Is this is the ghost of her boyfriend or something more terrifying.Brilliant is the word after watching the film and the film should be commended to keep the mystery of the intact throughout the end, although the regular mystery film viewers might be able to guess the climax but for a regular viewers the film should prove a good thriller film with pinch of some scary scenes.The plot of the film is interesting and the screenplay is gripping, the movie is woven beautifully and the mystery is kept intact.

72,yusufpiskin,Congrats Leigh Whannell,7,8 April 2020,"I was skeptical at first and first looked at reviews from who first saw it because I thought its bad but then I discovered that Leigh Whannell directed this movie (which directed Saw, Dead Silence, Insidious & Insidious 2) and with Jason Blum (Blumhouse Productions) producing this movie and I was wrong! This movie is different from the 1933 one and the book by H.G Wells and instead focuses on modern technology (which I think some bookreaders hate this movie) but that's a brilliant idea, on how they change it since we are on the modern age now. It also stars Elizabeth Moss which is the standout for this film, his acting and emotions is superb and Leigh Whannell's directing, which is one of my favorite horror movie directors also rocked this movie with how he shot the movie making the audience feel like someone is watching them (making them feeling like Elizabeth Moss' character) at where the camera faces. Overall, don't wait for Blu-ray or DVD but watch this psychological thriller in theatres/cinemas, you'll love this and the plot twist (which I'd rather not say because it'll ruin the experience) will also make you shook. 7-stars for this movie and looking forward to Leigh Whannell's movies that he'll direct!",The Invisible Man

Aside Elisabeth Moss, weak acting by the cast, especially the detective and the daughterLacks solid logic and development as a backbone, be it the story or behaviorsWeak portrayal of the Doberman, as an unoriginal dog (which they are not), doing nothing useful, not recognizing a person (dogs never bark when they know the person by smell and specific sound pattern to the person, even if he's invisible) and going past the lead actress when they were walking toward the end of the movie. Trained dog, especially Dobermans, always keep the pace of the person alongside whom they are walking and never continue walking past if the person stops for whatever reason)Unoriginal, impersonal and dull male lead together with the behavior of the invisible man (could have been much stronger, more serious and more vengeful with sophisticated notes)Bad use of the runtime (124 minutes could have been put to a better use - impartially speaking)You watch this entertaining movie, enjoy the two hours spent and move past.

74,kirbylee70-599-526179,UNSEEN TERROR,8,6 June 2020,"A few years ago Universal studios put in motion a plan to revisit and reinvent their classic horror icons, creating a shared universe of monsters much like the Marvel superhero universe. With the release of their first film, THE MUMMY starring Tom Cruise, that collapsed like a house of cards. Criticized by critics and fans alike and a financial failure, the whole think crumbled. In response with several items in the works they decided to make the films separate and not tied together at all. The first of those to come out was THE INVISIBLE MAN.Released just before the coronavirus pandemic began the film was doing well at the box office before theaters shut down. In response Universal released the film to digital services and sold it as those theaters closed. Now it comes out on disc for those who chose to wait.Elizabeth Moss is Cecilia ""Cee"" Kass, a woman virtually held captive by the person she though was the man of her dreams, Adrian Griffin (Oliver Jackson-Cohen). Instead Adrian controls every aspect of her life. As the film opens Cecilia is in the midst of escaping having set the wheels in motion to do so before hand. Things don't quite go as expected and Adrian nearly catches her as she drives away with her sister Emily (Harriet Dyer).In hiding Cecilia is staying with her friends James (Aldis Hodge) and his daughter Sydney (Storm Reid). Still shaken by her ordeal and fearful that Adrian will use his money and power to find her, she finds herself afraid to even walk to the end of the driveway to pick up the mail. Two weeks later her sister shows up with the news that Adrian committed suicide.Meeting with his lawyer brother Tom (Michael Dorman) he informs her that Adrian has included her in his will. He's left behind $5 million dollars to her, as long as she shows she is mentally competent and not convicted of any crimes. She accepts the money, sharing a part of it with Sydney for college and attempts to move on with her life. Until strange things begin happening.The sheets are pulled from her bed while she sleeps. She hears footsteps. Drawings from her portfolio are missing when she goes to a job interview. She collapses during the interview and they discover Diazepam in her system, the same drug she gave Adrian to make him sleep when she escaped. She finds the bottle she used and lost when she escaped on her bathroom sink counter, a bloody fingerprint on it. Is she going mad or is there some way Adrian is still alive and bothering her?Cecilia insists that Adrian is alive but no one believes her. She goes to talk to her sister to find Emily less than receptive since she received an email from her earlier in the day telling her how much she hated and resented her. But Cecilia insists that she never sent the email. She talks to Sydney and they decide on a girl's night but then something strikes Sydney and she leaves in fear of Cecilia.Still in the house alone, Cecilia discovers Adrian's cell phone in the attic. In the middle of trying to find out what's going on she dumps a can of paint on an unseen force on the ladder to the attic, coating Adrian in some sort of suit. Before she can catch him, he makes it to the kitchen where he cleans himself off. As she searches for him the two fight back and forth until he leaves. Will Cecilia be able to make anyone believe her story? Or has this all been something in her mind?The move does a wonderful job with the special effects, a must for a film like this. Both the fighting sequences and popping in and out of view are handled incredibly well. The direction by Leigh Whannell (who along with James Wan created the SAW and INSIDIOUS franchises) is well done and his handling of the actors helps create much of the tension seen here. The actors all turn in some great performances as well, making their characters and their actions believable.Perhaps the only drawback for the film is its length. At just over two hours the film feels like a full 20-30 minutes could have been shaved off the film and it would have moved along at a much better clip. Too many panning shots of empty rooms and travel time feel like padding. Because of these the first half of the film drags. It is the second half that redeems the film.Not necessarily a frightening film the movie does offer a nice dose of tension to keep you watching. I doubt a sequel will be in order but who knows these days. For now if you're looking for a solid mystery with a science fiction twist, you might enjoy a night with the invisible man.",The Invisible Man

This film is expertly crafted for suspenseful thrills & exciting bursts of action & violence that is shocking.Elizabeth Moss is fantastic, i mean a magnificent performance!!! Moss delivers everything perfectly for her damaged role as tormented & mentally tortured CECILIA, she's a victim of real abuse that many suffer from in real life & here she hammers the part greatly with a sense of lost soul in her sad & weary eyes but she's still one tough lady when she's had enough.
This is a suspenseful Thriller with a little mix of science fiction, it's a great ride & one i will watch many more times. Cecilia escapes one night from her horrible relationship with her psycho control freak boyfriend & hides out in a nice suburban neighbourhood with a friend & her sister but of course there's some twists & turns & He finds her under stealth Invisibility (It's nothing Corny or Cheesy believe me) & he torments her new life & everyone around her. There's so many incredible moments & scenes it just has to be seen.
An incredibly well made Suspense Thriller with an excellent standout performance from Elizabeth Moss & some stunning special effects moments & a story that is actually drenched in reality (except for the invisible stuff) but all in all this is one of the best & most entertaining movies in along time that is actually unpredictable & exciting.

77,kluseba,Social drama meets psychological thriller with a strong message,7,12 June 2020,"The Invisible Man is a psycho thriller that imagines a new version of the famous horror film character. Written and directed by Australian genre specialist Leigh Whannell who has brought us genre masterpieces such as Saw and Insidious as well as the science-fiction highlight Upgrade, this movie tells us the story of a young architect named Cecilia who finally has the courage to run away from an abusive relationship with a wealthy optics engineer named Adrian. She drugs him, escapes his isolated mansion and is saved by her resilient sister Emily. Cecilia still feels highly unstable and expects her abusive ex-partner to track her down and hurt her. She moves in with a family friend called James who is a cop and his daughter Sydney. Things seem to get better when Cecilia learns that her former partner has committed suicide. His brother and lawyer Tom even announces her that she will receive a generous sum of money on a monthly basis as long as she remains mentally sane and doesn't commit a crime. Despite the good news, Cecilia is unable to turn the page. Items like her keys mysteriously disappear from her new home. She collapses during a job interview. Someone sends Emily a hateful message in her name. Cecilia starts to wonder whether her former partner isn't dead at all and has come back to destroy her life or whether she is just imagining these things and slowly going crazy.This movie convinces on numerous levels. The acting performances are truly credible and especially lead actress Elisabeth Moss convinces as an unstable woman who desperately tries to get her life back on track. The idea to combine a historic horror film character with a contemporary setting of domestic abuse is courageous, fresh and inspiring. The movie builds up anticipation, atmosphere and tension that lead to a spectacular final quarter.There are some elements that could be improved however. The film certainly overstays its welcome with a length cracking the two-hour mark. It also features some tired genre tropes such as extremely clumsy behaviour by the lead character in the opening sequence and the fact that nobody believes her incredible story. There are also very few scares for a horror movie as this film rather qualifies as a mixture of domestic violence drama and psychological thriller.If you are willing to see a legendary horror film character in a completely new setting involving domestic abuse, you are certainly going to appreciate The Invisible Man. This movie has the very positive message to fight domestic abuse by any means necessary, get every help available and bring the perpetrator to justice. In a certain way, this movie combines social drama and psychological thriller. If you simply want to watch a great horror movie however, then this movie can be described as tense at best but is very rarely truly scary.",The Invisible Man

But then she gets the news that the guy committed suicide. She's approached buy the guy's brother who is also a lawyer and in charge of the estate. The guy left Cecilia millions.But sure enough the guy, now invisible, goes after Cecilia, making her life miserable. He writes an ugly letter to Cecilia's sister pretending to be Cecilia. Then he kills someone and makes it appear like Cecilia did it. She of course claim it's an invisible guy. That gets her thrown in a mental institution. There she is informed that she's pregnant. She's visited by the lawyer again who lets her know that she's losing all the money unless she has the baby and returns to the guy.At the mental institution she executes her plan. She attacks the guy with a pen causing his suit to malfunction, making parts of it visible. Now he has to kill the entire security staff to get away and that gives Cecilia a chance to escape. That leads to a confrontation at the cop's house. But she does want to face the guy one more time to discuss the terms of her surrender so to speak, but there she will take her revenge.The Invisible Man is one awful ridiculously long movie. The intro is about 30 minutes long. It takes another 30 minutes for some action to start. Frankly, I had a hard time caring for any of this. The lousy 3rd rate cast didn't help a bit. Finally at 1 hour 11 minutes there was a death scene that caught my attention, but things didn't quite pick up after that either. The thing just drags along. Any time you hope it will come to an end, there's another 30 or 15 or 10 minutes to go. There's not much worthwhile here. We learn nothing of the science behind the invisibility suit, nothing about the abusive guy. The camera is on the ugly Cecilia the whole time and she has nothing interesting to offer. In good 2000s fashion, this movie attempts to make up for it's lack of ideas, dialogue, visuals with constant insufferably loud noise effects.The Invisible Man is an utter failure of a script and movie. Don't waste your time.",The Invisible Man
84,masonfisk,APPEARANCES CAN BE DECEIVING...!,7,12 March 2020,"A re-imaging of the classic H.G. Wells novel from director Leigh Whannell (Saw/Upgrade). Morphing elements of Hollow Man & Sleeping w/the Enemy, we have our heroine, played by A Handmaid's Tale's Elisabeth Moss, who plays a tortured & abused wife of a tech maven who has had it & one night escapes into the night w/the help of her sister. Staying w/an old friend & his daughter (played by Aldis Hodge & Storm Reid respectively) Moss tries to recuperate from her trauma which she feels she's on the road on when her ex's brother, his lawyer, announces his death leaving her a small fortune w/the caveat that as long as she's found mentally competent & commits no crimes she'll get the do re mi. No sooner than those words are uttered, the plot kicks into high gear as Moss is haunted (hunted?) by an invisible presence (her husband had constructed a optics laded jumpsuit which renders the wearer invisible) which of course no one sees but whose antics seem to point to Moss (until the last act). Miles away from where Whannell's previous outings were (I always found his earlier works a little sloppy), there is a certain elegance & restraint here but some shot set-ups are particularly clunky when a simple rethink would've gotten his idea across. Co-starring Oliver Jackson-Cohen (he was in Netflix's The House on Haunted Hill's first season) as Moss' husband.",The Invisible Man

The commentary it makes on abusive relationships is poignant and moving.The problem is, it doesn't commit hard enough to that. It tops its hand a little too early, not helped by the trailer that really gives it away. I also would have really appreciated a bit more backstory and character building because there are a few characters here that are all over the place with no explanation as to why.I love the metaphor, the reality doesn't match up though. Moss is pretty solid, as is Hodge. Unfortunately, Jackson-Cohen is absolutely awful to me. He's built up as this controlling, dominating force but when we met him...

87,aidanratesmovies,"Unique and Often Stunning,with some great work from Whannell as a director and Moss as the lead",9,29 February 2020,"Darkly crafted, and often stunning, The Invisible Man more than deserves its fresh take on its source material, and makes for quite a unique film experience. The cinematography is one of the most unique things about the film, truly creating a grippingly tight atmosphere that allows for the feel of tension it is going for. At times the film can prove to be somewhat predictable and it does take a bit of a push to start going, but by the end you are more than entertained by the ride of thrills it packs in, and it does them almost masterfully. Elisabeth Moss is the obvious standout in the film, providing some truly excellent acting, and some greatly performed dialogue that is truly some of the best I have seen from her and from a horror film in a little while. Leigh Whannell truly directs the film with such a unique sense of vision, I can't help but feel more appreciate for his earlier work, and for what he decides to do in the future. In the end, The Invisible Man does have some issues with pacing in the first act and is at times predictable, but when it needs to be, The Invisible Man is a thrill ride like no other, with some truly excellent acting from Moss, and a quite unique sense of vision on a classic tale.

88,truemythmedia,Well Crafted Horror/Thriller with a Few Plot Holes,7,28 February 2020,"Remember when Universal Studios planned to remake all the Universal Monsters movies and turn them into a Marvel-esque franchise (the planned saga was called: The Dark Universe)? Man, I am so happy that didn't work out. Thank God Tom Cruise's ""The Mummy"" flopped as hard as it did, because we might have had another boring, artless PG-13 schlockfest instead of receiving Leigh Whannell's ""The Invisible Man."" As a side note, when I sat down to review this movie, I released I'd unintentionally seen all three of Whannell's films: ""Insidious: Chapter III"" (very blah), ""Upgrade"" (decent, but familiar), and now this (the best thing I've seen from him yet).Don't get me wrong: this movie is not perfect, there are plenty of issues with it. There were dozens of times when I thought to myself, ""No one would really do something like this unless it were to further the plot,"" or ""Do people really talk to each other like that?"" Still, if I had to choose between an actiony remake of a Universal Monster flick, or a more horror-based remake like this one, I'd choose this horror remake every time. While there may be dozens (and I mean dozens) of tiny problems with this movie, there are some truly great and shocking scenes, and the way this movie handles some of the crazier, more violent stuff in this movie is pretty darn awesome.If you compare it to movies like ""Hereditary"" or ""The Witch"", this movie is laughable. I've given this a 3.5/5 Star rating, because I think this is one of the better MAINSTREAM horror movies I've seen in recent memory. It might not be as artistically intriguing as ""Gretel & Hansel"" or ""The Lodge"" (the only other horror movies I've seen from 2020 thus far), but it is a hell of a lot more fun than both of them. ""The Invisible Man"" won't reinvent the horror genre, but it is good escapist entertainment.",The Invisible Man
89,valleyjohn,Entertaining as a thriller but could do without the invisibility thing.,7,1 March 2020,"Elisabeth Moss is not your stereotypical Hollywood actress . She's not the glamorous leading lady that would have starred in a film like this in previous decades and ""Amen"" to that because there are very few actresses around that play the victim quite as well as her as we've seen with her TV work in The Handmaid's tale and Mad Men and especially in The Invisible Man.She plays Cecilia, an abused girlfriend who finds out her partner leaves her his fortune after committing suicide , but she suspects his death is a hoax. As a series of coincidences turn lethal, She works to prove that she is being hunted by someone nobody can see.The first half hour of this movie is great . The tension is ramped right up as we follow Cecilia after she has escaped her abuser . We know things aren't going to go well but not when and how . The anxiety levels are high which is great but , and there is a big ""But"".
In the first party of the movie there is no mention of invisibly or an invisible man and it's only when that premise gets introduced do things start to get silly.
I like the idea of an invisible man that stalks his victim but I wasn't buying this story at all and I wished it had just remained a stalker / revenge flick .There is no denying that this is entertaining and I was definitely never bored but the longer it went on the more ridiculous it got which is a bit of shame.It's worth seeing for Moss's performance alone but don't expect a masterpiece.",The Invisible Man
90,AudioFileZ,Not A B-Movie Or Cash Grab Remake...Excellent.,8,7 March 2020,"To say The Invisible Man starts out slow would be generous. Slow and tension building is crucial though. The characters who will play this out however are shortly in place. By this rather slow building the story of a woman escaping a manipulative partner comes into view. Not that unconventional. This will change of course.Elisabeth Moss turns in another nuanced performance as Cecilia Kass, a woman who must be free of her heavy handed boyfriend the brilliant, and rich, genius technologist Adrian Griffin. Griffin isn't giving up on having Cecilia however as he will use any means. And, due to his secret development in human cloaking he can pretty much resort to extreme measures. These measures will include a big ""red herring"" of his own suicide as well as the use of his own brother. This will further help Adrian as he resorts to some depraved revenge in addition to his wicked manipulation. The viewer is on a ride and it's not exactly clear at times who is pulling the dark strings. A good thing for the viewer as you must keep your concentration on what comes next.This is at times excellent drama, but it's a horror movie for sure. Not Sci-Fi or paranormal, pure horror. As such it really rises up to good level in a genre that is all over the place. Elisabeth Moss is by far the on screen reason it succeeds after what I'd say is an excellent screenplay. It could have went toward camp and never does and she is a constant keeping the fear and uncertainty of it all right where is needs to be. Her character even pulls off the ultimate ending that is in no way a let-down. If you've been hoping for some good horror that you only question in the right ways then this is your movie.",The Invisible Man

92,Reviews_of_the_Dead,Remake That Takes a Different Take,9,15 March 2020,"This was a movie that when I first about it, I was intrigued with what they were going to do. I know there had been some attempts to remake some of the Universal classics and possible try to do a universe like we've seen in Marvel or DC. It is also interesting that the original movies had a bunch of sequels, which could work toward this idea if it hasn't been scrapped. The Invisible Man is one of my favorite from those original runs from then. I'm also giving it a second viewing as I needed a movie with an invisible person for an October Movie Challenge. The synopsis here is when Cecilia's (Elisabeth Moss) abusive ex takes his own life and leaves her his fortune. She suspects his death was a hoax. As a series of coincidences turn lethal, she works to prove she's being hunted by someone nobody can see.We start this with Cecilia waking up in the middle of the night. She's being extra careful as she's in bed with her boyfriend, Adrian Griffin (Oliver Jackson-Cohen). We do see that she drugged him, but still doesn't want to alert him as she collects her things. There is a plan that has a lot of pieces as she flees into the night. It gets messed up when she accidentally sets off his car alarm. She makes it to the road where she waits for her sister. The tension builds until Emily Kass (Harriet Dyer) appears. Adrian breaks the window as they speed off.She stays with a friend, James Lanier (Aldis Hodge) and his daughter Sydney (Storm Reid). This has been done in secret. Cecilia has not left the house since arriving which has been two weeks. She gets upset when her sister shows up. As she is scolding her stating that Adrian will use her to find Cecilia, Emily reveals that Adrian killed himself. It becomes even more of a shock when a letter arrives for her at James' place. As stated, no one really knows that she's staying there. It is from Tom Griffin (Michael Dorman). He's a lawyer and the brother of Adrian. He's tasked with managing the estate. He reveals that Adrian left her 5 million dollars to be paid out monthly for the next 4 years or so.Cecilia decides to do nice things for her hosts, including helping Sydney go to college. The problem is that weird things start to happen around Cecilia as well. She thinks someone is watching her. There's a moment where blankets seem to be moving and things happen during a job interview she cannot explain. She suspects that since Adrian was one of the foremost in optics in the world, that he faked his dead and has found a way to be invisible. Is she just breaking down thinking this or is something really happening to her?Since I laid out here my thoughts on how much I really liked the original, I thought that writer/director Leigh Whannell has some good things to play with here. What makes this scary is that the power to become invisible is really something that can corrupt. Heck, I'll be honest, I don't know if I trust myself if I had the ability to become invisible that I wouldn't do some pretty horrible things myself. This is legitimately terrifying, even more so when you have a guy like Adrian with this ability.Now I'm clearly a male so I've never been in a relationship like Cecilia. I've taken to talking to my girlfriend, Jaime, about her thoughts on this and she really liked the movie. I've also seen a horror writer online that I respect and how she said this movie brought up memories of being in a relationship similar to that. I personally found that to be the most terrifying part of this movie. I'm not saying this to spoil the movie, but I think that is the scariest thing is that no one believes her. This takes it to the extreme with things that happen in the movie, but it really is horrible that in society, we don't believe when women in relationship are not believed or a blind eye is taken to it. Seeing the fear on Cecilia was painful for me to watch as it felt real. I have to commend how strong of an actress she is. I hope it's not the case, but I would believe that she is drawing for at least some kind of a real experience.Something I want to add here after this second viewing is Adrian is gas-lighting Cecilia. I'll admit, I didn't necessarily know what that word meant until this viewing. This is an interesting way of doing it, because he is doing different things and then making her take the fall for it. He is pushing the idea that one will believe her.Going from there, to an extent cannot blame those for not believing her in the case of this movie. How can you in a rational world? I think this adds to the fear as well. It is really genius how this plays out as well. During the execution of the will, Tom tells Cecilia that she cannot be convicted of the crime or the will becomes void. What better way to control someone than to drive them insane to control them and frame them so she has to decide. Do you want the money or do you want your freedom? I think in the case with Cecilia and most, it would be peace of mind over the financial piece. This movie does play with that more though with the amount of money is life altering. Is it enough though for what is possible being done to her though?The dynamics around her are interesting as well. Emily is someone who is strong woman which I think Dyer does a great job at portraying. Something happens that upsets her toward Emily and it creates a divide between the two. It isn't done in truth and I really like how strong Cecilia and Emily both are. As a male, as I don't feel I have a fragile ego, I want to see more of that in my movies until it becomes normal. Some might feel that is pandering, but regardless that's how I feel. We also get an interesting character in James and his daughter Sydney. Something happens where they need space and I can't fault him as he has to protect her even over Cecilia. I think Hodge and Reid portray their characters very well.There are two more characters I want to talk about, but I won't for one until a brief spoiler section at the end. I do want to talk about Tom here. There's an interesting reveal with him during a scene with Cecilia when she's locked up. I love that he reveals that he feels similar to her in that Adrian had control over him and that he's glad that his brother is gone as well. The reason I like this is going back to where people know bad relationships are happening and are just complacent in doing anything. It is heartbreaking.It is also paced in a way where it never got boring. I saw that it had a runtime over 120 minutes, so I was curious how things would play out. The only time I might have issues would be the final sequence which I'll delve into a bit in the spoiler section. It really isn't how it plays out, but just how a character is played that for me didn't fit. Jaime disagreed, but I'll get into that. I think it effective built the story. Things get progressively worse until a satisfying conclusion. I like the ending overall as well.That takes me to the effects, which I was curious. I knew in this day and age we would have to go CGI. Surprisingly I thought that were solid. There's a scene in the rain that I was worried about and it was handled very well. The things that were done were good and there are just very minor complaints during the climax. Not enough to ruin anything, but just something that I noticed overall. Something was brought up and after this rewatch, I'm there as well. The suit seems to make the person wearing it have super strength. To an extent some of these things could be done, but not all of them. On top of that, the cameras used in this suit would make some kind of noise. That is an issue as well. The cinematography I thought was very well done as well and is strategic in my opinion.Now with that said, I really liked this movie. It is really a sad tale that is based in reality, but seeing it taken to the extreme. I thought the performances really help to build this realism, especially from Moss. The concept is really good as well. Despite its longer runtime, I think that it never got boring and aside from the final scene, it ends in a way that I like. The CGI has some minor issues. Nothing to ruin it and the soundtrack fit for what was ended. This is a really good movie, borderline on great and will be a contender for the year end if I'm going to be honest. Upon this rewatch during October, my rating has come down slightly. I still think this is really good though. It still should be seen and still a contender for my year end.My Rating: 8.5 out of 10",The Invisible Man

95,jadepietro,Hidden in Plain Sight,8,29 February 2020,"GRADE: BTHIS FILM IS RECOMMENDED.IN BRIEF: A suspenseful horror story about an abusive relationship, very well acted by Ms. Moss as the intended victim.JIM'S REVIEW: With all of the bad news in 2020 (e.g., the Trump presidency running rampant, the Coronavirus' devastating effect growing globally, and the stock market now in free-fall, it only seemed proper that my first film of the year should be a horror film. And it is.The Invisible Man has morphed at a movie theater near you. The movie is a highly entertaining reimagining of this boogeyman tale very loosely based on the H.G. Wells novel. This re-boot has some plot contrivances, but the tension and subtle touches work quite well.There is also no gauzed wrapped phantom as in James Whale's 1933 classic horror film starring Claude Rains as the crazed madman. This updated version makes its modern-day monster an abusive ex-lover out to get revenge from his victim. Caught in a violent relationship with wealthy scientist Adrian Griffin (Oliver Jackson-Cohen), Cecilia Krass (Elisabeth Moss) finally escapes his wrath...at least temporarily. Stalking his prey with his invisibility suit, he hides in full sight hoping to give the appearance of Cecilia's recurring madness to family and friends. He takes gaslighting to a whole new level of menace.In this version, writer / director Leigh Whannell cleverly spins his tale of suspense with just the right amount of dread, although the gore level seems slightly overdone. Just as our heroine never knows if her attacker is lurking nearby, the moviegoing audience immediately feel her fears and anxiety as well. He wisely capitalizes on the human drama showing the effects of an abusive ex and his obscene control over his former lover. The set-up is a stark reminder of the continuing traumas faced by so many victims and their battle to fight back in this MeToo Movement era.
The acting is consistently strong. Ms. Moss centers the film with a skillful performance as the damsel-in-distress. (Horror films of late have given us terrific performances by actresses such as Toni Collette (Hereditary), Florence Puhl (Midsommar), and Lupita Nyong'o (Us) to name some recent examples. Ms Moss' acting is of that same high calibre. Mr. Jackson-Cohen, when on screen, establishes his character's evil intentions most effectively. Providing fine support are Aldis Hodge, Storm Reid, Michael DForman, and Harriet Dyer as Cecilia's sister, Emily.The CGI works well. (Loved that cold breathe that suddenly appears behind Cecilia as she ventures outside and the measured use of some levitating objects as weapons.) The film is well paced as it builds to a very powerful climax. Yes, there are some illogical plot issues, but the movie takes its time to establish convincible characters caught in credible situations with some unexpected twists, turns, and bumps in the night. Still, one cannot help but wonder about Cecilia's poor decision-making and its repercussions, all of which seem as if they are more plot-driven devices than real life scenarios. (A few more working drafts could have clarified matters and given the film more impact.)Some say that love is the flip side of hate. Mr. Whannell takes that well-worn premise and makes a truly scary movie. Welcome to 2020!",The Invisible Man

SUMMARY:The movie is taking a monster movie concept and bending the tale to become a much more dramatic thriller. Like a great mini-series, Invisible Man manages to take the movie magic of the original tale and add a little more realism to it to help group more people in. And it is that realism that makes so much of the rest of my likes really pop out for this movie. A major selling point of the film is the suspense, and boy does it deliver on this aspect through the use of so many thing. Whannell and her crew create a very tense atmosphere from the start of the movie to the end, never letting up on trying to keep you at the edge of the seat. My friend and I agreed the pace was great, a constant moving ride of one woman contesting her sanity with the supposed reality, and never stopping in its quest to keep you engaged. Very good camerawork helps amplify the feelings of a stalker in the midst and fighting the feeling of being alone despite the safety of the light. Using other creative tactics such as varying environments, the illusion of safety, and other coy maneuvers to bring the manipulation of the invisible man to full light. Throw in the use of fantastic sound editing, or in this case absence of sound editing and you fully get caught up in the atmosphere of fighting the paranoia and chaos of the real world. Once the Climax hits, the movie only further amplifies all these maneuvers, yet moves the tale to several new acts that keeps the story entertaining and interesting, yet rounding the tale to completion. And through it all, the main character is surprisingly amazing to latch on to, the emotional investment granting you empathy and rooting for her to find a break in the case. Much of this has to do with the acting of the cast, Moss once again unleashing her amazing potential in this character. She has these roles down pat, from the borderline sanity and screaming, to the strong woman ready to take charge. The character design, alongside her performance succeeds in making a strong, central pillar to which much of the movie weighs on. The rest of the crew does their job right of course, but I need to move on to the dislikes.My friend and I both agreed that the movie's simplistic backstory is a little disappointing, especially in terms of the secondary characters. While it was certainly for time purposes, I believe some extra time to background build up only would have further strengthened the character and helped get the rest of the cast involved more thoroughly in the film. Past this point though, the movie's component that is a minor flaw is the fake looking effects that sometimes arise. Understanding, it is not the main theme, the movie does sometimes draw into the fake looking special effects, that still fit for the film, but not the smoothest at times. Past that minor flaw, the movie's next component that got me was the predictability of the film. Now for me, I've had plenty of experience to see foreshadowing and allusion to what is coming next, so using that and much of what the trailers have revealed I got most of the twists of this movie. My friend though stated not remembering most of the trailers and did not pick up on some of the predictable parts, and stated that if you have not been bombarded by the trailers you should have no problem dodging much of the predictability. As for me though, I had most of the suspenseful moments toned down because I had a good guess of what was coming next. Yet, the part that got me near the end though was a concept the movie takes to geniously start the next bout of thrills and get the excitement turned up. Yet, that concept should have been consistent and if you review the scenes and realize Cecelia's advantage should have remained said advantage, but then gets warped in a nonsensical way was a little irritating for me. Lost in the moment and seeing the next approach to threatening, it helps soften the blow, but the logic does not have to drop for the sake of keeping the thrills.The VERDICT:
In all honesty, the movie was awesome on so many levels. An engaging character leads this thrilling, fast paced adventure, where a realistic approach helps to give this monster flick a much deserved repaint. Using fantastic camera and sound editing, alongside creative approaches to keeping the thrills coming only further amplifies this film's successful goal of entertaining, with plenty of rewatchability for this reviewer. And throw in the amazing character and acting to bring her to life and you will find the movie succeed on many levels to bring life into this genre. However, the lack of backstory is something I really longed for to help give more layers to a few of the characters, and the computer graphics to help show the threat could have sued some touching up. Alongside the predictability and inconsistent advantage twist, these two components were the weakest aspect of the movie, and for once I would have loved some extra time to iron things out and make it perfect. Overall though, this movie is a fantastic flick with rewatchability and definitely worth a trip to the theater with a group or by yourself.My scores for the film are:Horror/Mystery/Sci-Fi/Thriller: 8.5
Movie Overall: 7.5",The Invisible Man
98,Kamurai25,"""My Boyfriend from Canada""",8,22 September 2020,"Great watch, will watch again, and do recommend.This really is a ""what if"" they extended the scenes from ""Hollow Man"" where Kevin Bacon gets into the public and starts messing with people.I am starting to worry about Elisabeth Moss though, she seems to be type-casting into all these heavy handed dramatic roles, or maybe that's just how she acts. She's certainly good enough to pull it off, so it's not a downside of the movie, it's just part of a note that this movie is very much a slow-burn suspense. On the premise alone, the first 2 acts are going to be that way as it is established that she is / isn't crazy and there is an invisible man stalking and sabotaging her.My biggest problem with the movie is that there has never been a more plausible and clearly reasoned explanation for the events, to include camera footage and dead bodies, than she has in this story. If someone finalized a version of a wearable inviso-suit, then this is exactly the type of nonsense they're going to get up to, especially if no one knows about it.It is a little irritating how they handle him once he's been exposed as well. Mostly it's because of the premise that no one believes her, but you'd think people had seen a ghost movie, or would have a clever idea.If the movie sounds good to you at all, then I really think you'll enjoy it.",The Invisible Man

It's also updated for the 21st century, complete with security cameras and smartphones and cloaking technology.

105,tomsview,Is anyone there?,8,4 November 2020,"This ""Invisible Man"" isn't the old H.G. Well's dude with the bandages, gloves and dark glasses. There's nothing yesterday about this story, it's right up to the minute. ""The Invisible Man"" has been around the block a few times over the years, but this outing gives him a whole new lease of life.Director, screenwriter, Leigh Whannell, has taken mundane, everyday locations like a suburban house, a restaurant and a hospital corridor and produced one of the scariest movies in a long time. He also gets the most out of a high-tech clifftop house, reminiscent of Vandamm's clifftop residence in Hitchcock's ""North By Northwest"".For a while, we aren't sure if Elizabeth Moss' Cecilia Kass is imagining that her supposedly dead, abusive, optics guru husband is stalking her as an invisible man, or if it's all just in her head? ""A Beautiful Mind"" and ""Woman in the Fifth"" plus a few other movies come to mind.Elizabeth Moss gives an incredible performance as someone who could be schizophrenic or at the least suffering from paranoid delusions. The scene where she gets hold of a fountain pen in her cell is hard to watch.Now for me, I think the first three quarters of the film was the best where we still don't know which way it's heading. When the invisible becomes more visible though, I think Leigh Whannell took his foot off the gas. He had the choice of keeping the whole thing pretty ambiguous or going for a more concrete resolution. I would have opted for keeping us guessing. However, ""The Invisible Man"" is definitely a classy effort.Like some of the most memorable scary movies, the best effect is sometimes the one we aren't shown, and the film relishes every dark corner and every empty room where our imaginations seem to create the action. The unsettling score by Benjamin Wallfisch that goes from serene to searing keeps us on edge even when nothing graphic is shown. The special effects are effective, but aren't the key ingredient.Most of the film was shot in Australia, some of it just down the road from where I live. Maybe the feeling that the locale is hard to place adds to the film's atmosphere. It looks like a sequel is planned, but it will be hard to beat the innovative touches in this one.",The Invisible Man

If you can overlook the « sleeping with the enemy » sub-plot, of course. And it's no coincidence I quoted this movie, when the same topic was handled in a lot more intriguing way, with less stereotypical characters. And that ending... It probably gave some activists, living vicariously through it, a « sawgasm », but I thought it was lazy writing at its worst. Actually the whole movie is, with characters so one dimensional you don't believe for a second the choices/things they do in the movie. Hopefully there won't be a sequel.",The Invisible Man
109,arungeorge13,Moss' performance complements Whannell's craft! [+58%],6,22 March 2020,"Driven by a solid lead performance from Elizabeth Moss, Leigh Whannell's modern take on the classic story by H.G Wells is refreshing in its own right. Whannell wastes no time in telling the audience how desperately Cecilia wants to run away from her abusive, 'optics genius' boyfriend Adrian. That almost-dialogue-free opening scene really sets the tone for what's to follow.Moss takes on the role of the Hitchcockian heroine here, with Psycho (the build-up to the shower scene) and Vertigo (the S.F setting) appearing to be great reference points. Even the musical score (Benjamin Wallfisch) seems to be inspired by Bernard Herrmann's work. Whannell, who had impressed me with Upgrade a couple of years ago, has now successfully tackled another sci-fi subject with horror undertones to it.With an efficient Moss in the lead, the scenes where Cecilia suffers one setback after another, are convincing - a good example of a performance elevating the writing. Cecilia, as we see her, is initially shown to be afraid to step out of the house after the escape incident. Initially, Whannell toys with the idea of Moss' PTSD troubling her a little too much; it takes a while for the audiences to believe what she's trying to tell everyone around: her dead boyfriend is now somehow invisible and trying to annihilate her (and others close to her).The 'oh damn!' moments of this thriller are neatly executed. The restaurant scene was particularly impressive, as was the climax. Moss', whose transition from helpless to scared to a woman seeking retribution (for everything she's gone through) is what makes The Invisible Man a moderately entertaining flick. The jumpscares, however, are some of the film's weakest elements. Some loopholes also need to be overlooked - CCTV footage is brought up as a piece of crucial evidence only when the film nears its completion. Watch it for Moss, over all else.",The Invisible Man
110,martimusross,Not A Horror But A Tense Psychological Thriller,8,1 March 2020,"The Invisible ManI loved it.A very different twist on the usual story, a tense gripping drama, not really a horror, that delivered in spades with twists and turns.Elizabeth Moss threw herself into the role of the hunted victim who fights back. The acting by Elizabeth Moss was first rate, we were up close and it really was an emotional journey with frustration, anger and resilience expressed at the same instant.I must mention Aldis Hodge who played the best friend, he really does a great job and this is yet another fine performance in movie after movie. If it's possible I think we may have found the new younger Denziel Washington here and I would like to see him in a gritty lead role.Overall this movie is a must see",The Invisible Man
111,MR_Heraclius,Great,9,20 March 2020,"I loved this movie so much. I loved Elisabeth Moss's performance if her acting didn't work then we wouldn't believe there is an invisible man but she sells it. I like the cinematography in the movie, I love it when they move the camera to a random spot in the room and we think the invisible man is there and them kinda showing he's somewhere in the room with her, which creates a lot of tension in the scenes. I love the tension in each scene and they do a very good job of capturing tension throughout the whole movie. They have an absolutely stacked cast and they all do an amazing job. I think they did a pretty job at the score it really worked in the tension of the scenes and it elevated each scene and the whole movie and it flowed with each scene it never felt off at all. I felt so bad for the character of Elisabeth Moss because the evidence is right there and the doctors aren't believing her, and everything that happens to her too. They do an amazing job at fleshing out the character of James who is played by Aldis Hodge he also does an amazing job and I cared about him so much throughout the whole story. The story kept me on the edge of my seat from start to finish, and it kept me wanting to learn more or see what was going to happen next. I only have two problems with the movie a bit of the dialogue is bad at times and there are times where the decisions that were made were not logical at all besides that I think it is pretty good. Overall I loved it and would recommend it to anyone.",The Invisible Man
112,rivertam26,A masterpiece of nail biting tension and real world horror,9,28 February 2020,"I have to admit my expectations were a bit on the high side walking into this one. Although normally I try to keep them in check because so many movies are utterly disappointing. Well I'm happy to sat this film completely blew me away. Leigh Whanell has created his masterpiece. A super update inspired by the invisible man but something completely new altogether. The brilliant Elizabeth Moss stars as Cecelia a damaged woman in an abusive, controlling marriage. As we begin the film she escapes and soon after finds that her ex has committed suicide. Following that she discovers that she will inherit five million dollars as long as she doesn't commit any crimes or is ruled mentally incompetent. All of that is a red herring for what's to come. Soon after she comes to realize that her new found freedom is an illusion and that her sociopathic ex is stalking her but is invisible. I don't want to get into the details because I refuse to spoil this for anyone but wow. From the opening moments Whannel concocts a mounting feeling of chest tightening dread and keeps it uncomfortably fluid throughout. The small moments of laughter and a feeling of freedom are only to distract you from what's coming. And trust me it's worth the wait. The film unfolds unexpectedly is utterly driven by Moss's vulnerable yet resilient performance. She's so smart and driven it's easy to root for her and to relate to her seemingly hopeless plight. The film succeeds in establishing Adrian as an utter monster. And the invisibility is a device that works so well because had he been given a steady face and performance, it would have humanized him. And it's all the more effective that it didn't. Despite being a reimagining this is a really new film. It feels fresh in every aspect and even though you might think you know what's going to happen the utter brilliance in which it's executed is utterly astounding.",The Invisible Man

Though the trailer of The Invisible Man could be just ordinary but after watching the movie, you will feel good about it.Probably his best work in Upgrade (2018), Leigh Whannell takes the old wine in a new bottle but gives a sparkling storyline with a solid twist. The Invisible Man begins with just an ordinary tale of a psychopathic husband who stalks his spouse until she decides to fight back but the captivating and eye-popping scenes is what makes this film stand apart from other Invisible Man films. I was blown by few scenes - Cecilia unknowingly killing her sister at the dinner table (probably one of the best scene I have seen in recent times), Cecilia throwing a bucket of paint to identify the Invisible Man as she peeps down from the loft , the chase scene at the hospital scene and finally the turned and twisted climax scene.I did not find much loose ends as I felt the film keeps on your toes throughout which proves that writing (also by Leigh Whannell) was strong. Technically, The Invisible Man boast of decent art direction and cinematography but it is a solid performance of the star cast, especially Elisabeth Moss who strikes the right balance between emotional and the fight scenes.Overall, The Invisible Man is definitely a very good watch which will keep you glued to screen for 2 hours 4 minutes.

122,blott2319-1,A solid thrill ride,8,2 September 2020,"Personally, I was quite underwhelmed by the original Invisible Man movie. It's kind of quaint for its time, but the story isn't all that interesting. So I was fascinated to see such a wonderful fresh take on the idea. This movie holds up as a great suspense thriller, with such a simple concept. It's clear that Leigh Whannell knows how to manipulate the audience to have us holding our breath and sitting on the edge of our seats. There are a number of great quiet and still moments in this movie where I found myself searching every inch of the frame waiting for something to move. Whannell truly puts us in the mind of the victim. I also appreciate what this film is doing with the allegory about the real-life abuse of women. It's such a smart way to address our culture's struggle with believing women without making a movie that is overtly about the Me-Too movement. I wouldn't say the way The Invisible Man addresses those themes is subtle, but it fits perfectly with the plot of the film, so I appreciated every minute of it. Elisabeth Moss does a marvelous job of playing that constant fear, and when she starts to turn a corner and begins to fight back it feels like a realistic character progression, rather than an unlikely personality shift.I like that the film doesn't take much time to address the mechanics of The Invisible Man, since the science is ridiculous. However, there were times when I couldn't stop myself from thinking about the logic problems this all creates. I start to wonder about how someone sees and breathes when invisible, and many more little nitpicky problems about the technology. Likewise, this movie uses one of my pet peeves, where we see a bad guy caught/killed and then every other legal issue for our hero magically goes away. Thankfully, the film doesn't slow down much to let me contemplate any of that nonsense. It's an intense thrill-ride from beginning to end. It's also worth mentioning how well they handled the effects in the film. I don't know if they had a guy in a green bodysuit, but when people were grappling with someone who was invisible, it felt real. The Invisible Man is a great example of what Universal should be doing with their classic monsters. Instead of desperately trying to manufacture some pointless cinematic universe (like they did with The Mummy,) you just make a solid updated version of the story as a standalone film. This is a great example of modern horror, and I'd love to watch more movies like it.",The Invisible Man
123,IonicBreezeMachine,A remake that gives a new experience while retaining the core of the original.,9,3 September 2020,"2020's The Invisible Man is an excellent attempt by Universal to revive its Universal Monsters after less than ideal attempts with Dracula Untold and the Tom Cruise The Mummy. The movie re-imagines the Invisible Man as a stalker thriller as Cecilia Kass(Elisabeth Moss) flees an abusive relationship from wealth optics engineer Adrian Griffin with the help of her sister and friends and is only able to move on with her life after his apparent suicide, but Cecilia soon finds her life under assault by strange and inexplicable happenings.Cecilia makes for a very sympathetic protagonist with her arc involving the lingering trauma of surviving an abusive relationship serving as a great source of audience empathy and fear. Where the 1930s film was a much grander film in scale where Griffin's ambitions were about proving his superiority to those in power, here Griffin has a much more reduced presence in the story often times as invisible to the audience as to our protagonist.The downplayed presence of the Invisible Man means the movie plays more with the psychological aspects of the story than the special effects(though those do still come into play). The movie lacks the macabre humor the the 1930s classic, but considering the type of story the movie wants to tell it makes up for this in ways involving character and unease. The Invisible Man is well worth the praise that has been heaped upon it and makes one optimistic about the possibilities that await other Universal Monsters in the modern era.",The Invisible Man
124,gedikreverdi,It was as fun as Hollow Man,8,26 January 2021,"It was way better than expected. I really liked Hollow Man starring Kevin Bacon and I assumed it'd be at most a worst version of it. I was wrong. He escaped from the magnificent house of his husband by the cliffs in San Francisco like a fugitive, he started staying at his friend James who's living with his daughter. Then his sister came over to say that his husband took his own life. The siblings went to the optics genius ex husband's brother to learn about the handsome amount of money he left to her. He made it clear that he's invisible when he took the blanket from his ex and James' daughter and moss made a scene there because she was sure about it. She went to his sister but his ex husband sent a mail to her calling her suffocating and wishing she'd be dead. She didn't believe it was her ex who sent it. And then when she's back home on the floor crying, he hit Sydney but she couldn't make James believe it wasn't her. James took her daughter out of the house and she called Adrian and heard his phone ringing in the attic. She used the ladder to get up into the attic and saw the phone and his drawings that she's supposed to take to the job interview. At the entrance she poured white dye down and he became visible. He attacked her in the kitchen and she managed to get out and took an Uber to her house with her ex. There she found the room to produce the suit to become invisible and hid it somewhere in her closet and got back to meet her sister at a restaurant. It was the most unexpected and shocking scene of the film when her sister seemed to get her throat slit by Cecilia but it was Adrian again but other guests and the police didn't buy her story. She was locked up in a cell in a psychiatric hospital. Adrian's brother visited her to keep the baby because she was pregnant (he made her took another pills instead of contraceptives). She confronted him and refused and stole a pen. With the pen she tried to take her own life and it appeared again. The police officers were beaten by the invisible man in the corridor and both got out and he was visible under heavy rain. She took a car behind his and followed her calling James to want he'd hurt Sydney. James fought the invisible man and Cecilia used the extinguisher to spot him and shot him several times. He became visible with the suit and when he took it off it was his ex husband's brother. Cecilia didn't buy it and went to have dinner with her ex at his house. Knowing where the camera is she used the suit and made it look like he slit his own throat after he didn't confess it was all him. She left with James after calling 911 like a revenge queen in black. The actors did a great job especially Elizabeth moss and Storm Reid and I didn't see any of the twists coming which made it a really enjoying watch.",The Invisible Man

126,hnt_dnl,Actually lives up to the hype,10,13 February 2021,"THE INVISIBLE MAN (2020) is an oddity. It's a hyped up horror-thriller film that fans expected to be good and it was actually MORE than good! Smart, sharp, clever, tense, and thrilling, this movie is one of the best of the genre in years. The opening scene reeled me in immediately. Knowing nothing about these characters or the story, within a minute, I was on the edge of my seat afraid that Cecelia wouldn't escape. Imagine starting a film off with an intense and stomach-turning escape sequence. Usually such a scene would be in a climactic moment near the end. Then the movie slows down a bit but in a good way, introducing the supporting characters and setting up the main plot.First and foremost, Elisabeth Moss was brilliant in the lead/central protagonist role of Cecelia/Cee. Like, seriously, I could have seen her getting award consideration for this part. Her acting was believable start to finish. I wish performances from films like this would get more recognition. Moss delivering the goods is really not that big of a surprise, as she is known to be a great, Emmy award caliber actress from the likes of Mad Men and The Handmaid's Tale, the latter project for which she actually won the Emmy.Second and more surprisingly to me, the supporting cast of actors were actually excellent! There wasn't a single performance from a minor character in this movie that I thought was weak or bad. Oliver Jackson-Cohen (as Cee's abusive boyfriend Adrian), Harriet Dyer (as Cee's sister Emily), Michael Dorman (as Adrian's brother), and last but not least Aldis Hodge (as Cee's cop friend James) performed exceptionally well and seemed like fleshed out characters with minimal dialogue and screen time. Even the very minor actors like the ones playing the security guards at the mental institution were convincing. Usually, even in the best of films, there is always suspect acting from minor parts, but not this one.But third and finally, for a film that was 2 hours long, I was stunned by how fast it moved and that at no point did I ever get bored or disinterested. At the 45 minute mark, I thought it had only been on for 20 minutes and couldn't believe how fast-paced a movie with virtually nothing but dialogue-driven and scenes of seemingly nothing happening was moving. I was glued to the screen for the entire runtime. Every scene was methodically crafted and engrossing. The script kept you guessing with it's incredible premise. Director Leigh Whannell has crafted a superb entry into the horror genre. Of course, this is the same guy who wrote and co-starred in the iconic and now-classic Saw film from over 15 years ago, so he obviously knows a few things about horror and how to engage the viewer with psychological thrills. A great film that is kind of a rarity for 21st century filmmaking.",The Invisible Man

Can she convince people that she is not mad... or has she lost the plot already?This is an interesting twist on a classic film, updating it by using technology to replace old fashioned science. Elizabeth Moss does abused, crazy and fragile woman on the edge of cracking up really well. Using domestic violence was an interesting twist and is all too relevant in modern times. As the vehicle for the film she has a really strong performance and delivers with authenticity.A few plot holes made me question the strength of the film at times, but they were only minor as I was able to cast them off throughout and just focus on the events of the film. There was lots of tension throughout which proves that you do not necessarily need to see the monster or bad guy to ramp up tension for the audience. Sure, there was CGI towards the end of the film where the 'monster' was shown, but thankfully it did not look that out of place.I enjoyed this film and would have no problem recommending it to others.

131,rockman182,The Invisible Man (2020),7,29 February 2020,"When I saw the trailer for this I was instantly intrigued. Even more so when I saw the name of the film. The Dark Universe was a disaster. Dracula: Untold was so average that they tried to restart the franchise with 2017's The Mummy, which was straight awful. Alas, the Dark Universe as a shared universe died but I guess they decided to do standalone films instead. So based on past experiences, we should have had every inkling that this would be terrible. However this was a really good re-imagining/reboot that remains entertaining for the full runtime.
The film is about a woman who runs away from her husband because he is abusive. She finds out he commits suicide and 5 million dollars in his name could legally be acquired by her provided she does not conduct criminal activity and has a normal mental state. She soon becomes haunted by an invisible force, that not only terrorizes her but becomes dangerously violent. No one will believe her and she must find a way to not only protect herself but find out how this is happening. The film stars someone who I feel is one of the best actresses today: Elisabeth Moss.
Leigh Whannell honestly blew me away with the very impressive sci-fi thriller, Upgrade. That alone should be reason to watch The Invisible Man. This is a real horror thriller that is set up incredibly well. The camerawork and atmosphere created really complement the plot of the film and your eyes are glued to the screen, really trying to find out where this invisible man is at any given moment. The thrills are great and while the film goes through predictable stages it honestly takes the concept of the invisible man and creates something so wonderfully modern and unique and it really works.
I want to close off by talking about how good Elisabeth Moss is. I followed her growth as Peggy Olsen in Mad Men and knew of her talent right away. Her portrayal of a woman having a mental breakdown in Queen of Earth was amazing and she channels a similar type of energy for this. She is fantastic in this film as she is in pretty much everything she does. This was a strong reboot or re-imagining of a Universal classic. It takes liberties but all of it is done well and I think its about time Leigh Whannell started to blow up.

Wells story.",9,1 April 2020,"Now you see him, now you don't. Is it a ghost? Perhaps so, but today's subject happens to be the Invisible Man. Though he got his start in the H.G. novel of the same name, a lot of people might remember him from the lineup of the classic Universal monsters. Unlike Dracula who has a sexual overtone or the Frankenstein monster who represents a science of unknown nature, the Invisible Man is an individual who has a dangerous power in his hands; an almost godlike power since no one can see him. He can pretty much strike without anyone knowing their being sought out for death.Now since the remake of The Mummy failed to kick start another cinematic universe of classic monsters, what does The Invisible Man need to do different? Since they are monsters first, it had to find a modern way to make him scary. In the direction it takes, it explores toxic relationships and the psychology behind the dominating force. While it can happen to anyone, it unfortunately happens to women more often. Does the movie try to say something against men? No, The Invisible Man keeps to a smart situation by making the victim relatable no matter what gender.It starts with a young woman Cecilia (played by Elisabeth Moss) making an escape from her abusive but intelligent boyfriend Adrian Griffin (played by Oliver Jackson-Cohen). She escapes his large compound and barley gets away in her sister Emily's car when he tries to pursue her. She is taken to Emily's ex husband James (played by Aldis Hodge) and daughter Sydney (played by Storm Reid) to hide out where she's convinced Adrian will find her. News comes when it's said that Adrian had committed suicide. To add on more, in his will he left Cecilia five million dollars assumed she's mentally competent.She tries to move on with her life, but even in death, she's not safe. At first little things start to happen like stoves being left on or her portfolio work turning up missing at a big interview. But when she senses his presence and even catches random things flying around, she's sure that Adrian has sound a way to become invisible just to torture her. Of course no one believes her, but it's made worse when emails are sent to make her look back and people get hurt. Will Cecilia be able to prove her case and find her invisible stalker?The Invisible Man has the advantage of being both large and claustrophobic; as if you have a ghost consistently following you. You are always on the brink of figuring out if the invisible man is close or far away from Elizabeth Moss. It all has to do with here it wants her mind to be. The Invisible Man brilliantly makes her personality the type that would not only have fallen into this guys trap, but would have made her to be debatable if she is of sound mind.All of it works thanks to Elizabeth Moss who is the kind of modern scream queen I want to see; someone who is half terrified by what could happen but a general curiosity to figure out how to stop it. I don't know if I can call her a feminist hero, but the movie shows what I call ""good feminism""; the kind of feminism of her trying to fight against a man hurting her without slamming all men in general. Of course no one would believe a dead boyfriend coming back from the dead and had turned himself invisible. The movie continues to stack cards against her and she pushes forward.The overall story doesn't put her ahead of him. The script does show him as much of a brilliant tactician as he is a sick individual who can't let go of anything. There's probably another story worth telling even before this started; one that shows her as a different woman before she fell into this relationship. Without saying what he does, he puts her into a position where you know this guy needs to die in order prevent a worse monster from being unleashed. I would love to see this a part of a larger universal monster cinematic universe.I'll give this nine invisible men out of ten. Though I wish the movie would have put her nerves front and center a little longer with more of a debate whether an invisible person could exist, it's a modern slasher that I hope aspiring storytellers can take notes from. It channels classic horror tropes with fear, then creates a sickening fear before ending the nightmare. I highly recommend this for any fan of horror and thrillers.",The Invisible Man
133,Anurag-Shetty,Psychological horror at its best!,10,2 March 2020,"The Invisible Man tells the story of Cecilia Kass(Elisabeth Moss). Cecilia's abusive ex-boyfriend Adrian Griffin(Oliver Jackson-Cohen), commits suicide. When extremely disturbing events happen more often, Cecilia believes that she is being stalked by someone she can't see.The Invisible Man is a mind-blowing film. Writer-director Leigh Whannell has given us a flawless & modern take, on H.G. Wells' iconic source material. This is is the first horror/thriller movie where you're on the edge of the seat, when there's absolutely no one on screen. This film has several creepy & terrifying moments that will keep you guessing, right till the end. The performances are the highlight of the movie. Elisabeth Moss is spectacular as Cecilia Kass. Moss portrays a wide range of emotions effortlessly, sometimes in a single scene. Oliver Jackson-Cohen is outstanding as Adrian Griffin. Harriet Dyer is awesome as Emily Kass. Aldis Hodge is fantastic as James Lanier. Storm Reid is excellent as Sydney Lanier. Michael Dorman is brilliant as Tom Griffin. The Invisible Man is a must watch for horror/thriller fans. Apart from the scares, this film gives us life lessons to learn, in a subtle way, throughout.

134,bankofmarquis,Pleasantly surprised - with a strong lead performance by Moss,7,6 March 2020,"I really had no desire to check out the Blumhouse re-imaging of the classic Universal horror classic THE INVISIBLE MAN, but I was hearing positive comments on it - especially about the lead performance - so I figured I'd better check it out.And I'm glad I did. For this INVISIBLE MAN is taught and tense with (of course) a strong leading performance. And...it has something else...Intelligence.Originally, THE INVISIBLE MAN was supposed to be part of the ongoing Universal Studios ""Dark Universe"" series of films - Universal's answer to the Marvel Cinematic Universe or the DCEU - but when the first film in this series THE MUMMY tanked at the box office, Universal made a ""first look deal"" with Blumhouse Studios (makers of such low budget horror films as PARANORMAL ACTIVITY and THE PURGE) to make stand alone films with the classic Universal Studios characters.First up...THE INVISIBLE MAN...replacing Johnny Depp in the titular role and changing the focus of the film from THE INVISIBLE MAN to a woman (Elizabeth Moss) being harassed (or is she?) by THE INVISIBLE MAN.And...an inspired choice it is. I was surpirsed by the restraint and intelligence that Blumhouse - and Director Leigh Whanell (UPGRADE) - show with this material. Whanell ratchets up the tension and let's the audience sit in the uncertainty that the main character has.And...when that main character is performed as well as Elisabeth Moss (THE HANDMAID'S TALE), then it is 2 hours well worth your time. Moss' performance is the glue that holds this film together. If she isn't as good as she is in her role, then this film doesn't work. She is...and it does. Some say that she should earn an Oscar nomination for this work. I wouldn't quite go there (if any actress in a Horror film deserves an Oscar nomination, it would have been Lupita Nyong'o in US last year) but it is a very, very good performance.As is the performances of Harriet Dyer (as Moss' sister) and Aldis Hodge (as a friend of Moss' character). These two brought watch-ability, and believe-ability, to their characters and situations. And this is good for, if I'm to be honest, this film does fall down in the believe-ability factor. I have a tendency to turn that part of my brain off in these types of films, but there are HUGE plot holes and gaps in logic that I just couldn't ignore, which brought this film down a peg or so.As does the performance of Oliver Jackson-Cohen in the title role. I just didn't like what he was doing in this role, but fortunately, we don't see much of him (rim-shot).Overall, a pleasant enough surprise with an intelligence I wasn't expecting and a lead performance that is worth the price of admission.Letter Grade: B7 (out of 10) stars and you can take that to the Bank(OfMarquis)",The Invisible Man
135,joebloggscity,"Update to the old trope, still good this one....",6,31 October 2020,"You can't complain really about this movie. At heart it's an updated revision of the much repeated ""Invisible Man"" story, but this has more going for it than others.Elizabeth Moss is ever watchable, and ably assisted by a good core of support actors. She plays a lady who has escaped an abusive relationship only to find that she is being stalked by him, but nobody believes her as she claims he is invisible (so understanable!).The direction & pace is good, and the film leads more to being really a thriller than a horror movie. The Dark Universe collapsed with The Mummy reboot, but films like this one can keep those old stories going with updated revisions like this film. The ending was very good but you can kind of see it coming way ahead.I kind of liked it, but the problem is that it still ends up hitting a brick wall. It's all been done to death. It's still a good movie, but I can't see how it can be taken further. Sequels will be a waste of time.As a Saturday night film, it's worth a viewing.",The Invisible Man

I have to admit I had preconceptions about what a 2020 film might entail considering how Hollywood has relied on CGI as a crutch to hide bad writing. Even the trailers didn't sway me much since the scenes in the trailers are of the few CGI scenes in the movie.But holy cow, has Elisabeth Moss and director Leigh Whannell Knock It Clear Out of The Park. The writing is actually outstanding, the camera work, atmosphere is too. Elisabeth Moss acting performance matches Whannell direction. The tension in this movie is so thick can feel it in my skin. If she doesn't earn an Oscar during her acting career, the Oscars are truly worth. This movie is a must see. It's unfortunate the last scene in the film undermines the story. It would have been better if Adrian had gotten away with it, it would have made the ending much more powerful. But having Cecilia walk away after that last scene undermines the story. But I am still giving the movie a 9 because Moss' performance was so amazing.",The Invisible Man

If you took that movie and cut off all related to the laboratory and experiments, you basically get 2020 INVISIBLE MAN and stretching of the same but less interesting part of the story. It has some good moments but others are almost boring and the characters and actors do not help too much. Elisabeth Moss does as much as she can but her characters looks more crazy than it should. The rest of the cast mostly unknown are not especially good and basically cliches.
There are some good scenes and some suspense but not enough to compensate for two hours of the main character afraid of her shadow.

141,bob-the-movie-man,"Have you seen ""The Invisible Man""?",8,9 January 2021,"Cecilia Kass (Elisabeth Moss) is trapped in a highly controlling and violent relationship with technology mogul Adrian Griffin (Oliver Jackson-Cohen). Escaping from his fortress-like home, she lives in fear of his retribution. So she is much relieved, if a little surprised, at the report of his suicide. Now living with old friend James Lanier (Aldis Hodge) and his teenage daughter Sydney (Storm Reid), Cecilia can finally start to relax. But as strange things start to happen, is the ghost of Griffin back to haunt her? Or is it really all in her rapidly disintegrating mind, as her sister Emily (Harriet Dyer) and James suspect?Australian writer/director Leigh Whannell is famous as the writer behind the ""Saw"" and ""Insidious"" franchises. So he knows a thing or two about crafting horror movies. And in this Blumhouse production, after a clever attention-grabbing opening, he really takes his time in building an understanding of Cecilia's mental state. When things start to happen, they happen so stealthily that I needed to hit the rewind button a couple of times (no cinema experience for this one I'm afraid). Cinematographer Stefan Duscio keeps slowly panning away from Cecilia across the room to show empty corridors before slowly panning back again. It's superbly effective and was comprehensively creeping me out!When the set action pieces do occur then they are satisfactorily exciting, albeit wildly implausible. I did not see some of the ""Surprises"" coming, making them jolt-worthy. And the denouement really delivered for me, reminiscent of Hitchcock's style.Now most famous for ""Mad Men"" and ""The Handmaids Tale"" on TV, Elisabeth Moss has delivered a range of impressive film performances including in ""High Rise"" and - as most closely related to this role - in ""Girl, Interrupted"" as mental patient Lisa. It's a star turn, no doubt about it.This movie was intended by Universal to be part of the ""Dark Universe"" series. But the Tom Cruise flop ""The Mummy"" unfortunately put paid to that. Which is a great shame. If they'd started with this one, then they might have had a hit on their hands. With a post-credits ""monkey"" (there isn't one in this movie by the way) they could have lined up into the follow-up movie and started the ball rolling.It's a rollicking action flick that had my attention throughout. This is all helped along by a very effective soundtrack by British composer Benjamin Wallfisch, using strange atonal electronica to heighten the suspense.However, the initial question it poses - haunting, 'all in the mind' or something else - gets clarified a little too early for me (and - note - is spoiled by the trailer), so the movie falls short of being a classic for that reason.There's one aspect of the movie that really irritated me. And that is that there was no credit whatsoever for the idea of H.G. Wells that originated this story. There's a discussion of that here: since Wells died in 1946, his copyright will have expired on his works 70 years later. This is definitely NOT a retelling of his story, but in reusing the novel's title it would seem at least 'polite' to include a ""Based on an idea by H.G. Wells"" in the credits somewhere.All in all, this is still a bit of a B-movie, but its a bloody good one! Utterly preposterous at times, and with decision-making that would feel at home within the Trump presidency, it's an entertaining rollercoaster of a movie. Definitely comes with a ""recommended"" from me and I'll look forward to a re-watch at some point.For the full graphical review, please check out ""bob the movie man"" on the web - thanks).",The Invisible Man

G. Wells story. I wouldn't be surprised if the incognitive minds behind this had never even bothered to read the novel considering how it has absoloutley nothing in common, and just marketed it for the established intellectual property. And even if they made these decisions but the finished product turned out to be of some quality, it could be overlooked. However, that's not the case either; even if you judge the movie based off the filmmaker's intentions it's terrible. I could list everything wrong with it, but why bother.

144,killercharm,what a difference a talented director makes,7,28 April 2020,The previous versions of this movie left me not expecting much but what a difference a talented director makes. In this story of the man who discovers a way to render himself invisible the tension is kept taut all the way. I was roped in immediately. The cast is spot on - both the casting and acting is great. While the special effects are beautifully fluid they are not overwhelming. A great ride.,The Invisible Man
145,kjproulx,Now That's How You Do A Remake,9,28 February 2020,"In a world where Hollywood likes to remake films that are only 20 or 30 years old or even foreign movies that were only released a year or two ago, it was inevitable that we would receive another rendition of The Invisible Man at some point. This story has been around for decades and even over a century now. The original novel of the same name was written and published by H. G. Wells in 1897. Since then, numerous television shows, movies, and similar concepts like the film Hollow Man have been flooding the screens. Even though the classic 1933 film still holds up as a great story, the concept has always felt a little cheesy to me. Well, this film does a great job of making this idea feel fresh because I was glued to the screen from start to finish. Here's why 2020's The Invisible Man worked so well for me.The Invisible Man follows Cecilia as she escapes an abusive relationship and takes shelter at a friend's house. After some time passes, she is given word that her significant other has died. Once at ease, she slowly begins to become victimized by him again, but she can't see him. Convinced that she is being terrorized by him and that he has found a way to make himself invisible, she is seen as an insane person by everyone in her life. Without ruining anything, the twist of this movie makes it feel very much like a film that would be released in 2020. The Invisible Man has been revamped for the modern era and I believe it was done in a very satisfying way.Movies like this, especially in the genre that it's in, relies heavily on the central character. Thankfully, Elisabeth Moss as Cecilia delivers an incredibly devoted performance, sucking you into her traumas and heartbreaks. Her character goes through more in the course of a few days than anyone should have to endure in an entire lifetime and Moss sells that from start to finish. Yes, the story and situations around her require a lot of acting, but there is a particular moment that happens in this film that had my jaw on the floor due to how surprising it was, and her performance took it to another level. The amount that she emotes throughout the course of this film blew me away.Stefan Duscio does some remarkable work as the Cinematographer here as well. His work on Upgrade was really solid and I even thought The Mule was shot really well, but this is truly his moment in the sun. The way the camera moves to show an empty area in a room, making it obvious that someone is probably standing there was impeccable here. On top of that, there are some great wide angles that really stood out and helped explain each situation, without saying a single word. The standouts here were truly the performance by Elisabeth Moss, as well as the camerawork, headed by Ruscio.In the end, The Invisible Man is great for many reasons, a couple of which would ruin the film if I got into them, so I'll just let you experience those. The score by Benjamin Wallfisch, who is definitely not a stranger to working on a great project, nicely blends the classic feel of old horror, with the loud build-ups that modern horror movies usually have. I found myself immersed in this film from start to finish. The main twist had me slightly underwhelmed at first, but it grew on me and won me over by the end. Overall, I have a few minor complaints, but I pretty much loved this movie otherwise. I highly recommend checking it out, unless violence and horror is not your thing.",The Invisible Man
146,kuarinofu,A slight suspension of disbelief is required to fully enjoy this great film,8,21 March 2020,"After the Upgrade (2018), I was hyped to see another interesting story from Whannell.I can say right away that I wasn't disappointed this time either.The Invisible Man (2020) was an effective and engaing yet very simple revenge film. The basic structure of the story is very simple and is very predictable, but only because they set everything up and provide the necessary motivation. They also never present this film as a mystery, because there is none, really. Even the ""twist"" was foreseeable.The film itself is a psychological thriller with elements of science fiction and horror, all of which work together nicely.Elisabeth Moss is great, as always, it was also nice to see Benedict Hardie from Upgrade. Aldis Hodge has a good supporting performance, but he isn't given enough screen time in my opinion, just as Oliver Jackson-Cohen, I really wish they would give us more insight into his character's absolutely vile psyche of a manipulative control freak.The film messes up its pace in the end a little, but the ending, while being obvious, still delivers and feels satisfying.It's a little too long, somewhat unrealistic, and you can see the writers coming back and doing re-writes to establish the ending, but overall, if you suspend your disbelief just a little you will enjoy it.A good watch, and far more superior than that Hollow Man (2000) film nobody remembers.",The Invisible Man

Wells premise of a man becoming invisible offers so much more story scenerios--both funny and dramatic--that I see this film as a frustrating exercise for this viewer.Leigh Whannell went the horror/thriller route, which reflects a dark side that shows how Hollywood elites thins of Americans today--corrupt, abusive and devious to the extreme. His plot celebrates women power, but lost in all the scary scenarios is a humanist approach to the positiveness of the human species. IM was all a ""Debby Downer,"" a cynical outlook on today's capitalistic society gorging the vulnerable.I'm generously giving this a five star on Elizabeth Moss' heart-tugging performance and Stefan Duscio's snappy cinematography.

My Rating 8/10. No Spoilers AlertI've never begun a review with an audience WARNING! but if you or your friends have experienced extreme Domestic Violence and are planning to see this very chilling and very suspenseful film it could disturb and upset you.Another ambassador of our great Australian local movie talented Director ,Writer and Producer Leigh Whannell from Melbourne who also directed Aquaman, Saw,and Insidious has made a very suspenseful, dramatic and violent interpretation of the 1897 H.G. Wells literary classic The Invisible Man.In this version though it's the very visible Elizabeth Moss as Cecilia Kass who is trying to escape an emotionally and physically violent relationship from her partner an Indie tech genius who appears to control every aspect of her life who makes this movie so good and suspenseful.
Elizabeth Moss is rarely off screen in The Invisible Man and her performances just get better and better. It's not easy in a movie of over 2 hours to command the screen and hold the audience enthralled as to what your character is going to present us with next.
Since her appearances in West Wing 1999 as Zoey Bartlett the Presidents daughter and then of course in ""Madmen "" (2007-2015) as Peggy Olsen in 92 episodes followed by her superb performance of June Osborne in the chilling 3 seasons of The Handmaid's Tale Elizabeth Moss is now one of the most Box Office bankable and sought after film and television actresses in the world.
I think the reason for her success is partly because Elizabeth Moss is attractive but just in an ordinary way her face and expressions are a blank canvass and she colours them in with her superb grasp of the characters she plays.
I mean it as a compliment that she is no Charlize Theron or Nicole Kidman,or Margo Robbie or even Saoirse Ronan in a classical beautiful way and that you could pass her in the street dressed as an office worker and perhaps not look twice but she has that rare talent and gift of reality in acting.The pace of this film right from the beginning never gets dull and of course there's other very good performances to mention Harriet Dyer as Cecilia's sister ,Aldis Hodge as the Cop James Lanier who hides Cecelia and Storm Reid as his daughter are a great dramatic trio in The Invisible Man.I came away very entertained wondering how some of the plot twists ,especially the thrilling conclusion were probable but if you can stretch reality to believe in an invisible man you can allow for some improbability.
I had my own theory of the conclusion but I was wrong mine would have possibly been more believable but perhaps not as bizarre and this film needed a bizarre ending.Special mention to composer of The Invisible Man Benjamin Wallfisch the English composer, conductor, and pianistSince the mid-2000s, he has composed and contributed to music for over 60 feature films .His compositions include original scores for A Cure For Wellness, Hidden Figures, Lights Out, Desert Dancer, It, Blade Runner 2049, and Shazam!. In 2017, he was jointly nominated with Pharrell Williams and Hans Zimmer for Best Original Score at the 74th Golden Globe Awards for his work on Hidden Figures, and a BAFTA Award and Grammy Award for Blade Runner 2049

152,Darkside-Reviewer,An Invisible Opinion,6,5 April 2020,"This movie has gotten a lot of hate from people most reviews either complain that it doesn't follow the original novel or the 1993 movie it's supposed to be a remake of the other complaint is that it has several plot holes and I can see why so many people would have these opinions of this movie and honestly I half agree and half disagree with them.I completely agree that this shouldn't have been marketed or named as a remake of The Invisible Man as the movie doesn't follow the source material very well at best it's a loose adaptation of it and it should have been marketed as a psychological thriller not a horror thriller the story would have actually worked better as it's own universe instead of being part of an existing one.The movie does have some plot holes and continuity errors mainly to do with the technology involved in making the suit that allows a person to be completely invisible and how such technology could be invented without heavy surveillance from the government and the army who wouldn't let a scientist create something so groundbreaking and important without constant knowledge of what they doing how they are doing it and heavy involvement in the project not to mention the the constant monitoring and observation that would be put in place just to protect it it's highly unlikely that they would allow a scientist to build this suit at home with no outside interferences and it's even more unlikely that they would allow someone who abuses his wife his family and everyone around him and is very psychologically unstable build such a device.All that being said I actually enjoyed the movie for two reasons number one I didn't expect this movie to be made as an actual reboot mainly because of interview's that came out before the movie was released that talked about the plot and the ideas behind it and if your a movie buff you will surely expect Hollywood to mess up anything that's meant to be a reboot by making it nothing like the original and just slap an old profitable name on something new to get people to watch it.The second reason I enjoyed this movie is because while it's not the movie I wanted (An actual Invisible Man reboot) it still tried to be a serious movie and tried it's best to be inventive and rediscover something old with some new ideas thrown into it while nothing ground breaking the movie is still enjoyable and interesting which is more than most modern movies can manage.I personally enjoyed the first half of the movie the most as it really seemed like it was going in the right direction and had the potential for it to be a serious psychological thriller that focused on what wasn't being seen or heard rather than what is much like older movies that used suspenceful music and background camera shots that made you look for something that the characters are missing.Unfortunately the second part of the movie is where most of the problems lie as the movie jumps from a suspenceful, quiet and atmospheric psychological thriller to a dramatic action thriller along the same lines as the movie Hollowman (2000) and focuses on action and violence that completely shifts the tone and feel of the movie and takes away the suspence build up in the first half of the movie into a series of unnecessary action scenes that involve running around and shooting guns shouting and screaming a disappointing end to a movie with a very promising start.The acting from lead actress Elizabeth Moss is truly amazing especially considering she had to pretend to talk and have physical altercations with a pretend invisible person and convey fear of something she cannot see hear or even experience in real life that's something difficult to do and even if your opinion on this movie is negative she should be appreciated for her talent and perseverance.The camerawork and cinematography is amazing throughout the movie especially in the first half you can see that the director tried to create suspence with atmospheric scenes and a clever use of quietness in key moments.Overall while this movie does have it's flaws and doesn't deliver on it's promise as a remake of a classic movie character it is still worth watching and it is very enjoyable even if it's not the movie you were expecting try and put the reviews aside and enjoy it for what it is two hours of entertainment that is more entertaining than most of the stuff available on streaming services and TV.",The Invisible Man

155,msbreviews,Elisabeth Moss shines in a clever adaptation based on a real-life traumatic theme!,8,3 March 2020,"If you enjoy reading my Spoiler-Free reviews, please follow my blog :)As you should know by now, I avoid trailers at all costs, especially for highly anticipated movies. I'm careful enough already, but once I heard the massive complaints about the trailer for The Invisible Man, I made sure to not even listen to it, let alone see something from it. My expectations got higher as the release date approached, and the overwhelmingly positive reactions reached my attention, so obviously, I couldn't help but get excited. I love The Handmaid's Tale, and I always thought it was a matter of time until Elisabeth Moss brought her phenomenal acting skills to the big screen. She just needed a big film to do it...And this is the one. Elisabeth's performance is yet another horror display for The Academy to ignore when the year comes to a close. In comparison to Hereditary's Toni Colette or Us' Lupita Nyong' o, I admit that I would give an Oscar to one of these two over Moss. However, this is one of the main issues I have when people compare things from different years: it's extremely unfair and a bit irrational. Something ""great"" in a specific year can be just ""okay"" in the next one. It depends on each year's quality regarding movies and their cast's performances.If Moss truly ends up delivering the best interpretation of the year, she should receive recognition independently of other year's injustices. With that said, based on my experience, I firmly believe Elisabeth Moss should be one of the contenders for the respective category during the awards season. I'm not saying she should be nominated or not, I'm saying that she should be one to think of when it's time to fill the ballot with the nominees. She is relentlessly exceptional during the whole runtime. There isn't a single moment where she drops her level. Impressive!Regarding the story, it's probably the best adaptation of The Invisible Man to the actual world that they could have done. Of all the meaningful and sensitive real-world themes, Leigh Whannell chose the very best to insert in his film. Domestic violence and abuse is a tremendously serious topic, and Whannell addresses it perfectly. It's a remarkably clever screenplay, with tons of tiny little details that relate in some shape or form to the real-life situations a lot of people (women AND men, let's not pretend this is an exclusively female problem) go through.It's one of the best horror movies I've seen lately when it comes to creating a suspenseful, scary environment, mostly based on something that feels incredibly realistic. Taking the sci-fi aspect of, well, dealing with an invisible person, the menacing silence and haunting score work as well as they do because I'm able to feel the protagonist's fear. Stefan Duscio's cinematography is one of the main reasons why this film is filled with so much efficient suspense. The camera constantly pauses on one side of the room the character's in, lingering on for some seconds, creating a certain doubt if something's moving or if someone's there.This point-of-view (POV) shot works exceptionally well for the whole movie. Being able to see what the main character is seeing, it's also possible to think what she's thinking and feel what she's feeling. That awkward, frustrating, unnerving, uneasy feeling that something's not right. Then, Whannell proves he knows his film's own weaknesses. When it starts to lose a bit of its entertainment value, and when the audience begins to get used to the long, suspenseful sequences (of which probably half, nothing happens), he hits the narrative with an unexpected, shocking turn of events in the most jaw-dropping way possible.This particular decision got the blood heavily pumping again, and it delivered the energy I needed to be at the edge of my seat until the very end. However, the ending is a tad underwhelming, and maybe a bit over-the-top concerning some character's decisions. I can't really get into spoiler territory, so I'll just write I don't really think that the last scene is very coherent with everything the movie showed until that point. Even though I understand and respect this narrative decision, I don't believe its message is the one the film wanted to transmit. Good performances from the rest of the cast, a few character's decisions are a bit hard to believe, but I don't want to be nitpicky.In the end, The Invisible Man deserves all the hype it's been getting. Leigh Whannell crafted a genuinely scary and extremely suspenseful horror movie, based on a traumatic real-life situation that a lot of people, unfortunately, go through. Elisabeth Moss delivers an emotionally powerful performance, demonstrating all of her impressive acting abilities which are probably going to be ignored when the awards season comes around (the usual horror genre bias). Incredibly well-written, intelligent screenplay, supported by some terrific camera work by Stefan Duscio. The haunting score from Benjamin Wallfisch is also a standout, especially when it chooses to be completely silent. I'm not a fan of the slightly incoherent ending since some character/narrative decisions seem hard to believe, and the final message didn't really have the meaning it should. Nevertheless, it's one of the best films of the year so far, so don't miss it!Rating: A-",The Invisible Man

160,0w0,"Very good, but unrealistic decisions by the characters",7,24 March 2020,"At least twice in this movie, one of the characters has the opportunity to pick up a gun and use it to kill the killer, yet for some mysterious reason, they choose not to... that's extremely unrealistic and also a plot hole as far as I'm concerned. It's honestly the only real reason that stops me from rating this an 8.5/10.The other issue is jump-scares... there's one part in the movie in particular where a VERY loud and obvious 'violin screech' horror sound is played in order to make the viewer jump... it's an extremely cheap tactic and any horror movie worth its salt can do without cheap jump scares like that, so I'm deducting more points for that.Overall, the movie could have been better and even with the above issues, it still is a commendable 7/10. Elisabeth Moss delivers a very believable performance and she pretty much carries this entire movie from start to finish all on her own (the poor woman's back must be hurting something fierce!).",The Invisible Man
161,MrDHWong,"A slick, well-made adaptation that modernises a classic story for today's audiences without losing too much of its original appeal",8,2 April 2020,"""The Invisible Man"" is a sci-fi horror film loosely based on the novel of the same name by H.G. Wells. Written and directed by Leigh Whannell (Insidious Chapter 3, Upgrade) and starring Elisabeth Moss in the lead role, it is a slick, well-made adaptation that modernises a classic story for today's audiences without losing too much of its original appeal.In San Francisco, Cecilia Kass (Elisabeth Moss) lives with her abusive and manipulative boyfriend Adrian Griffin (Oliver Jackson-Cohen), who just so happens to be a renowned wealthy technological engineer. One night, Cecilia escapes from this relationship by drugging Adrian and fleeing into the woods where her sister Emily (Harriet Dyer) is waiting to pick her up. A couple of weeks later, Cecilia hears the news that Adrian has apparently committed suicide and left her a large sum of money in his will. Cecilia soon starts experiencing strange occurrences around her new living quarters from some kind of unseen force, leading her to believe that Adrian has faked his death and found an innovative way to continue tormenting her.Rather than present us with the typical horror/slasher genre, ""The Invisible Man"" instead treats its audience to scares relying on paranoia and the haunting feeling of personal trauma. Anyone who has escaped a relationship with a manipulative significant other should find plenty to identify with in what Cecilia experiences from time to time. Seeing the way she senses Adrian's presence when he is not physically visible gives us the feeling that he is always there watching over her, allowing us to properly understand her mental anguish and the psychological pain she has endured. This is where I feel it stands out a great deal over many of today's horror films thanks to its clever underlying commentary on abusive relationships. In spite of this, there are one or two jumpscares at certain points but for the most part they felt earned and not merely shoehorned in for the sake of a cheap fright. It pleases me that the filmmakers have taken this approach in adapting a classic story in such a manner instead of taking the easy route of making its invisible man go crazy and try to kill everyone just so we can have an overblown action climax, which is what happened in 2000's ""Hollow Man"".After writing and directing the underrated 2018 action thriller ""Upgrade"", Leigh Whannell returns with another film featuring the advancement of technology in ways we may not approve of. In addition to being about the aforementioned domestic abuse, the film also showcases how technological innovations can play a prominent part in our daily lives. We see how we must be careful to ensure that such electronics do not fall into the wrong hands as even devices with the best intentions can always be twisted and perverted into something evil. Whannell uses this stylistic approach wherever he can, heavily featuring scenes with hidden security cameras, mobile phones, and even something as simple as emailing to show how all of these things we take for granted have taken its toll on poor Cecilia throughout the story. Since the original novel was published in 1897, there obviously would not have been references to any of these electrical marvels in that era but thanks to inventive creativity of Whannell's writing, he manages to implement them into this film surprisingly well.Elisabeth Moss gives one of her most intense dramatic performances to date, which truly shows her range as an actress. There isn't a single moment where I wasn't convinced she was wrought with trauma over the abuse she has tolerated for so long from her boyfriend. Oliver Jackson-Cohen was also great in the title role, despite spending most of the film not visible to the naked eye and saying very little. Interestingly, most of his character's backstory is shown either through implied events or brief expository dialogue, yet remarkably all of it works. Again, this may be due to Leigh Whannell's clever writing and direction that gets everything important across to the audience without dragging down the story's overall entertainment value.In conclusion, even though I have not read the original novel in full, I can't help but feel that if he were alive today, H. G. Wells would likely be pleased with this adaptation. Wells was always fascinated yet cautionary with what technological achievements mankind will accomplish in the future, reflecting strongly in the novels he wrote. Because of this, I believe that if he were to see how a filmmaker who shares a similar mindset handles one of his stories for the big screen, he would be content that his warnings have been heeded in some way. However, what a modern audience will choose to make of these warnings, only time will tell.I rate it 8/10",The Invisible Man
162,meydiana-65242,Best movie of 2020 so far,10,18 October 2020,With the pandemic I think studios released the movies they were not in love with and are still holding on to their best movies for later this year or the beginning of next year. There was an abundance to stream but The Invisible Man was one of the few movies I thought was actually good.Elisabeth Moss had an excellent performance. Really making me feel the horror of the situations she was in. The concept was nice. It was executed well with some terrifying scenes. Not just seeing the horror but making you imagine the horror. There were some by the book scenes but the creators also did create some memorable unique scenes. Worth the watch,The Invisible Man
163,Alexander_Blanchett,Effective remake of an old horror story,8,18 May 2020,"Good Remake and new Approach to the famous Story. The film starts very slow and does not exaggerate with ignoring scientific Facts like the Kevin Bacon Version did for example. This feels like an intiminate and intimidating Stalking Thriller more than a SciFi Horror film.
Elisabeth Moss is absolutely dareing in the leading role as a Woman who more and more loses faith in her own mental conditions. This was a great way to tell the Story. It also has many Scenes that bring you to the Edge of your seat, and I am Talking About very subtle scares resulting from atmosphere and camera ankles rather than for the genre typical jump scares. It Kind of has the same mood as ""The Haunting of Hill House"" had mixed with some really well constructed Action Scenes that often come in as a surprise. Also the Twists were good, Always when you think you figured it out, it turns around.
Really a good modern Horror Thriller that makes you wish for more of this Kind. Elizabeth Moss is really having a good year Career wise, showing off some really great Performances, and this is no exception.",The Invisible Man

165,cardsrock,"Effective thrills, but with some logic issues",7,28 February 2020,"I really enjoyed the first 2/3 of this film. They are filled with palpable tension and a general unease at not being able to see the ""monster."" This is another example of how what you cannot see is often scarier than what you can see. The direction is great and perfectly places the viewer in Elizabeth Moss' shoes, which is what generates most of the tension as you the viewer are also unsure where this invisible person is at all times. The spin of domestic violence also lends a new, modern twist on the classic premise.Where the film falters is in its third act with some significant plot holes regarding cameras and visibility of certain actions. There were also several times where the film felt like it was at its conclusion, but kept going. The ending will likely be divisive, however I didn't hate it. The Invisible Man is technically a very well-made thriller, but loses a few marks due to some issues with the plot.",The Invisible Man
166,CANpatbuck3664,Vibrant and Impressive in Parts and a Pleasant Viewing Overall,8,13 March 2020,"People talk about how modern horror is populated with jump scares and cheap thrills, they'll be pleased with The Invisible Man. Whannell is gaining real traction as a director between this and the underrated Upgrade and this movie represents another step forward with the cinematography and camera work in this. Credit to Stefan Duscio for helping ramp up the tension by showing us enough to see Adrian is there but not enough to wreck the plausibility of Cecilia just seeing shadows of her past. The action also have its moments, when The Invisible Man is attacking Cecilia, the action could have been goofy but the stunt work and the CGI doesn't ruin the vibe and actually adds to it.If you put the excellent cinematography aside, there is another big reason to see this movie. The Invisible Man got me on board the Elizabeth Moss bandwagon. I have never seen The Handmaid's Tale so I was left a little puzzled by all the hype around her as an actress but she's excellent in this. She sells Cecilia's pain and confusion, her frustration and her nagging paranoia. Her character has been through hell and Moss brings to life her turmoil and struggle to get her loved ones to see what she sees when no one else did. We get so little time with Adrian that its hard to say much about Oliver Jackson-Cohen, he's fine in his limited time. I also really enjoyed Aldis Hodge and Storm Reid as James and Sydney Lanier. Storm's a lot better in this as opposed to A Wrinkle in Time and Aldis is great as a protective but an immensely likeable father and friend. Michael Dorman is also appropriately slimy as Tom Griffin, he's channelling Theon Greyjoy's nervous behaviour and secretly devious mindset.I went in to The Invisible Man expecting something fantastic. With almost universal acclaim from the critical community, you know what you're getting largely (unless its an art house picture, then you're rolling the dice no matter what). I have plenty of things to praise in The Invisible Man but there were a couple of missteps. While Whannell and his team expertly shot this movie that's so full of tension, its also a little too slow for its own good sometimes. There's a lot of groundwork laid but I couldn't always buy how little escalation there was in Adrian's plan. The climax does pay off but there was a lot of waiting in stretches and very little reward for the audience's patience. While I did really like what they chose to do with the ending, the overall arc of the plot was very predictable. There are bunch of twists and turns and the movie tries to act like each reveal is shocking, I saw most of it coming from awhile away. It didn't ruin the movie for me but its never a good sign when the audience can guess where the movie is going after the first 30 minutes.If you can choose which part of the movie to get right, save it for the end. An excellent ending can forgive more than a few faults and The Invisible Man mostly sticks the landing. The last couple of scenes leading up to it aren't the strongest, there's a few plot holes that I won't spoil but when Cecilia gets to face what's been tormenting her, she rises to the occasion. They draw the audience's attention to certain buzzwords throughout the run time and then they're weaved into the crescendo impressively. It was close to being a little too precious but I think it was appropriate and it suited the tone the movie was aiming for.The Invisible Man is a beautifully filmed, wonderfully acted, tension filled thriller that hits more often than it doesn't. I still found the word of mouth surrounding it a little overblown, its got some big strengths but it isn't the entire package. I'd still recommend it to anyone looking for a tastefully shot horror/thriller, with enough gore to raise eyebrows and an ending that wraps things up just right. But you can catch it on your preferred streaming service if there's no time to get to the theatre.",The Invisible Man
167,Beejerman,CHEER! - (8 stars out of 10),8,24 August 2020,"The stage curtains open ...This version of ""The Invisible Man"" is not glamorized, is not over-the-top, and doesn't have some wild, convoluted plot to support it. It is a remarkable approach to an old idea, with a modern flair and characters of substance. I have to admit, this movie took me by surprise ... in a good way.Cecilia (Elisabeth Moss) takes control of her life back one night, by leaving her abusive boyfriend behind, barely escaping his clutches. She hides out with a police detective friend and his daughter until the news comes around that her boyfriend had committed suicide. However, she is still wary and suspects that he may still be alive, when things begin to happen around her that has no logical explanation or resolution. The suspense builds, and clues are found that leads her to an inevitable final confrontation with her invisible stalker with deadly results.The last ""invisible man"" movie I watched prior to this one, was ""Hollow Man"" with Kevin Bacon, and by its own right, was a fun piece of film-making as well. However, this newest entry, was the opposite of that one. We don't know who is really stalking her until the end, though we have our suspicions. The chills we experience are subtle and genuine. The movie doesn't rely on extravagant special effects to elicit its scares. It builds slowly and lets the paranoia settle into you as well as her. It is very clever and engaging. And Elisabeth Moss completely sells herself as the tormented victim.I highly recommend this movie. I was completely pulled in from the opening scene and it never let me go. This is a fine movie with solid performances, and a very good ending. I certainly hope there are more of these on the horizon, and if there are, I will be among the first in line to watch it.

She finds out he has killed himself but slowly suspects he's alive after she gets hunted by someone nobody can see.From how it starts, The Invisible Man seemed promising. It's nice to see a mainstream horror film take a more mature route in its subject matter and not subjecting itself to all the regular clichés. The opening was interesting and left me wanting to know what these characters better and their relationship with each other. What could have been a psychological thriller, ends up being a regular horror film that's riddled with plot holes and stupid character decisions.For a film that has a $7 million budget, it does look great. There is some terrific camerawork and long takes that impressed me and I appreciated the overall dark tone that surrounded the film. Elisabeth Moss has been grabbing my attention recently and she does a great job here. The fear and troubled nature of her character was portrayed brilliantly by her and I hope to see her in more films in the future.The real issues lie in the story and I wish Leigh Whannell worked on it more. As mentioned before, I was interested to learn more about Cecilia and her abusive relationship with Adrian but the film barely explores it making the character of Adrian so weak and underdeveloped. The ending could have really packed a punch but the lack of character development made it so unsatisfying. Also, there were moments that I questioned because either they didn't make sense or were dumb. I don't understand why Cecilia never thought of using her phone to capture evidence of the invisible man or why CCTV is never checked in the film. There are more plot holes like this in the film which did frustrate me and stop me from caring about what was going on.As a whole, The Invisible Man is a lost opportunity.

175,statuskuo,An Abusive Relationship's Worst Nightmare,7,28 February 2020,"Part ghost story, part psychological thriller...if you've lived in the time of late 80's to early 90's thrillers such as ""Final Analysis"" or ""Basic Instinct"" you will appreciate this movie a lot more. Resident pasty victim Elizabeth Moss plays Cecilia, fresh off escaping a bat-nuts husband now has to contend with his suicide. She is traumatized to the 1000th power and now lives in constant fear regardless of his supposed death. In her escape, she has been ""gifted"" a lot of money, IF she can keep out of trouble. What a strange addition to a will, you say. Yeah, BIG dumb thing. However, she takes his gift but is now haunted by some apparition that creaks floorboards, pulls sheets off beds and so...well, typical for a movie like ""Paranormal Activity"" Unfortunately, the trailer gave away a lot. In fact, wish it wasn't named the way it was, because we know science is involved. How much science? No one seems to care. Only that the master of optics has created something that gives him powers to take his abuse to another level. Do they ever explain why the somewhat less than modelesque Moss gets the stalker treatment even though smart, handsome science guy can have ANY girl he wants? Nope. Only that that is pretty honest to what an abusive relationship can look like. Power and picking on the abused.
Look, there are a TON of questions left unanswered, but for a late February movie and with unrecognizable actors, it's a homerun...I'd say. Let your expectations be what they are, but I like Moss. She's like Jodie Foster's little sister. And hard to believe she is the same person from ""Mad Men"" or the earlier reviewed ""Her Smell."" I would say, in terms of having REAL women play these roles, it's great to see her in a lot of these flicks. Empowering as it may seem or ""woke"" as it may try, it's still a solid thriller in the above mentioned films. A LOT isn't just special FX heavy, it's actually simple tricks to give you the creeps.

176,trinaboice,Super suspenseful with a great performance by Elisabeth Moss,8,29 February 2020,"IN A NUTSHELL:
Universal Studios is attempting to reboot their Monster Universe with this movie. Based on positive audience and critic reviews, this nail-biting thriller must might do the job. Based on the popular H. G. Wells science fiction novel The Invisible Man, Director Leigh Wahnnell has proven himself quite talented in the horror genre. He wrote the screenplay and directed the film. Don't let the Blumhouse name on the film scare you away. This ain't no Blumhouse's Fantasy Island disappointment.TIPS FOR PARENTS:
Extreme domestic violence, abuse
Some profanity, including 1 F-bomb. A man starts to swear but then stops because a child is in the room.
A teenage girl gets slapped really hard.
Several deaths with blood, gore, and splattersTHINGS I LIKED:
Elisabeth Moss consistently offers a strong performance in everything she does. I first noticed her in Mad Men and was impressed. She IS the film and does an excellent job carrying it. Every time she tip-toes around a room and breathes heavily, it made me want to be extra quiet for her while sitting in my theater chair.
I've always preferred subtly to in-your-face action in movies. This movie has it in spades because what you CAN'T see is so much scarier.
While I never saw the Insidious horror serious because I really don't like creepy movies, director Leigh Whannell has a solid reputation behind him and knows how to properly build tension with chilling scenes that start from the very first minute. I hear he's working on a new film: Escape from New York Fingers crossed that he does an equally good job on that reboot.
Cool ocean wave intro.
Suspenseful sound effects The Invisible Man
Each scene takes it time. That might sound slow, but it's perfectly tasty.
The suggested camera angles that peek into a room around the corners and only show you parts of the room are extremely effective and affect you psychologically. You find yourself squinting to be sure if you saw something or to look for something that the camera suggests is there.
Have you ever felt someone looking at you? People have a Spidey sense about things like that.
I loved the scene where you see Elisabeth Moss' cold breath fog when she steps outside and then you see another one behind her. Creepy!
I love twists!
Lesson learned: Keep a fire extinguisher and knives in your kitchen. Oh yeah, learn how to shoot a gun.THINGS I DIDN'T LIKE:
Don't watch the trailer before you watch the movie. Too much information about scenes will ruin the fun.
The movie could have been WAY more fun if it had been given a different name! Because of it's current title, you KNOW there is going to be an invisible man. Imagine how much more intense it could be if you didn't know that when the movie starts! What do you think of the movie title ""Breath""? That's the one I thought of. Good, right?
Too bad he couldn't think of a better way to use his cool power of invisibility. I mean...do something for good.
There are several plot points and details that make no logical sense at all. I could point them all out to you, but that would probably ruin the movie for you and I want you to enjoy it. Try not to focus on them and you'll enjoy the ride.
The movie poster is way too dark.
There have been several movies made about the Invisible Man story. Fans of the story might be disappointed that this new addition to the concept doesn't really add anything new, although it's told well.
It always frustrates me when characters on the screen don't do what I think they should. For example, if there's a bad guy trying to kill you and he knocks someone else's gun onto the floor near you, pick up that gun! Quickly!

177,andrewroy-04316,"The Invisible Man is extremely tense, well shot, intelligent, and anchored by a phenomenal performance by Elisabeth Moss",9,4 March 2020,"The Invisible Man works on many levels: as an atmospheric edge-of-your-seat thriller, as a subversive horror film, as a character study, as a mystery, and as an Upgrade-style action movie with big ideas. The opening scene is excellent in setting the atmosphere for the film and providing clear information through details. The tension is obvious through Moss' body language and nervousness, and Adrian's controlling nature is clear through Moss and the many house security protocols. After the explosive opening, we get to know Cecilia, and the emotional trauma from her abusive relationship is obvious. In the middle section, Whannell does an excellent job of using slow pans and empty shots to foster uncertainty in the audience's mind as Cecilia gets more anxious. He also refuses to use traditional horror tropes in jump scares, instead masterfully building the tension as we wonder who the invisible man is and if he's really there. My biggest concern by far for the movie was that it would turn into the easy, traditional trope of a mentally unstable female unreliable narrator explaining everything away. Not only is it a tired theme, it would also reinforce the women being crazy and needing medication angle that's problematic in society. Instead, Whannell makes the timely and important point that women should be listened to and generally know more about their situation than men who don't know them assume to. The action towards the end (especially the hallway in the hospital and in the house) were great, as anyone who watched Upgrade would expect. The ending is shocking but completely sensible - anyone complaining about plot holes is either nitpicking like crazy or trying to find what isn't there. Moss' performance is what elevates this movie to the stratosphere. Her discomfort and trauma from her relationship with Adrian early on is nailed, and we see her fear only increase as she sees the gaslighting, isolationist patterns recurring. The bags under her eyes and jumpiness show how it takes a toll on her. What's really clever is how, once she hits the invisible man and sees she was right, she is more self-assured and aggressive. I empathized deeply with her, and it's so easy to - she's being traumatized and accused of terrible crimes and nobody will listen to her. The ending is powerful, as she intelligently reclaims control of the situation and confirms she was right about everything that happened. It would be a strong film for the building tension and great cinematography as an anxious horror-thriller alone, but the clever themes which are punctuated by Moss' dynamite performance make it an early candidate for a top 10 or even top 5 movie of the year, even being the first movie I've seen in 2020. Between this and Upgrade, I will watch every movie Whannell comes out with in the future, and I couldn't be more all in on Elisabeth Moss.",The Invisible Man

This film did this, I understand people prefer this method but I do not. I felt the final 30 mins as well felt a little dragged out. You think it's about to end and boom! Another 10 mins and so on. I felt the reveal of the ""invisible man"" was also far too soon and it eliminated a good part of the thriller aspect of the film.Overall though, good acting, likeable characters and the plot in itself was good.

First, as an horror fan, I can say that the script is quite interesting till the end. Also, the pace is adequate to keep you amazed around two hours and the music is quite effective.
Second, Elizabeth Moss does a great job. I think her interpretation is surprisingly realistic and intense.
Last, CGI using is correct. I do not like movies like IT2 that looks like a horror video-game.
So, overall an amazing modern version of The Invisible Man far from perfect but enjoyable during our lockdown time we live.",The Invisible Man

188,PyroSikTh,How Do You Film Something That Isn't There?,8,28 February 2020,"I have to be honest and admit I wasn't entirely bothered by this movie. Oh yay, another adaptation of a horror classic, and possibly the worst one to boot. Sure, Leigh Whannell is behind the camera and Upgrade was a welcome surprise in quality, and as much as I dislike Elisabeth Moss, there is no denying how downright talented she is. But I mean, the invisible man? Really? Oh boy was I surprised!We follow Cecilia, a victim of an abusive relationship with a wealthy and respected technology invigorator. The film opens with her escaping him, and I use that word carefully. She didn't leave him, she escaped. She has to rig the cameras and drug the guy in order to jump the eight foot wall that surrounds their property. Even the dog has a stun collar on to prevent him from leaving the immediate area. Crucially though, we never get flashbacks to the abuse, only a half-hearted retelling from Cecilia herself. Unfortunately for Cecilia, Adrian's field of work is optics, and he's just created a way to turn invisible. He fakes his own death and uses his newfound technological marvel to haunt and gaslight her at every opportunity.It starts small at first, like turning up the hob when she leaves the kitchen, but it quickly escalates to footsteps on a bedsheet, and even further to hitting a child in her vicinity. Tormenting turns into framing and separating her from her support network, and pushing her to the point where she comes across as insane to anyone who will listen. This last point in particular made the film a real talking point for survivors of domestic abuse, because many victims face that very same wall when they seek help. Of course for Cecilia it's amped up to eleven, but nonetheless the feeling of being a victim ignored and disbelieved every time is sure to hit home to those who have actually been there.While the movie does a really good job with the story in many regards, like focussing on Cecilia and her struggles rather than the titular invisible man, and offering a number of unexpected moments that turn the film completely on its head, there are still some problems to be addressed. I guess this is going to get nitpicky, because honestly these points didn't really matter a whole lot, but they're worth considering. At one point Cecilia goes to her sister for help, but she's met with aggressiveness and a door slammed in her face thanks to an email sent from her account. In the email she tells her sister things like ""I never want to see you again"" and ""I wish you died instead"" Besides being quite clearly out of character, why would someone say those things and then immediately knock on their door looking for help. If I was the sister, I wouldn't have been grumpy and slammed the door in her face, I'd have been utterly confused and urge to know more; try and work out where the email came from and why.There's also the small matter of shadows, in which I mean the invisible man doesn't cast one. He doesn't bend light itself, so he would still block light from its source and cause a shadow, but not here. He is completely and utterly invisible until something happens to reveal him, from rain to paint to extinguisher foam. This is a really small nitpick though because it opens the way for the film's strongest and most enthralling aspect; negative space. Stefan Duscio's cinematography is absolutely fantastic, constantly lingering on empty spaces in a room. The way the camera will pan away from a character in order to look at an empty hallway, or just linger on a wide shot when the character walks out of it, or follow nothingness around corners, or literally just have shots of empty corners or doorways, or peak through doors and windows as if being watched, or even when there is a character on screen and the shot is framed in such a way that it feels like there should be a second character filling space but there isn't. This not only adds huge amounts of tension and anxiety to the movie, but it's also an ingenious way to actually film an invisible character. There's nothing in these shots, but thanks to the context of the movie, you know there is something there. You spend the whole time watching for small movements, scanning the area for hints of what's lurking in plain sight. I can tell you, it makes you very hyper aware of the empty spaces in your own home. And this isn't even mentioning the fantastic longshot action sequence in a hospital ward.Usually I'm a little hesitant to see horror movies in the cinema, and the main reason for that is jump-scares. On a big screen in a dark room with surround sound, jump-scares are dialled up to eleven. Even the mention of a ghost in Parasite last week sent me into an irrational panic. But here I figured it's just a dude. An invisible dude, sure, but a dude nonetheless. And it's true, there's nothing supernatural about this movie at all. In fact it's alarmingly grounded and realistic. Not only that, but the guy's invisible right? That means the trope of turning on the light to reveal something terrifying cannot physically fit in this movie. I'll be totally fine! I wasn't. Oh man I really wasn't. This movie is jumpy as hell. It made me jump harder than I've jumped watching a movie in a long time, with sudden rushes of adrenaline and my back going up like a cat. The biggest offender for me is a pretty obvious one; he gets doused in paint, suddenly revealing him. I went in expecting this, because honestly it's the most obvious way to reveal something invisible. But the way it's done, building the tension and putting in multiple camera angles of the situation, and then making everything suddenly happen so blisteringly quick that you don't have time to process the situation. She grabs the paint and chucks it, revealing him super close, and she lurches back to the corner of the room, all in the space of a single second. I didn't even register there was a can of paint there until she was huddled in the corner, so it took me completely by surprise. There are other moments as well, like an unpredictable event at a restaurant, random glitching causing him to reappear and disappear, and unforeseen hits and punches that literally come out of nowhere, but none of them made me jump more than the most obvious one in the whole movie.Crucially though, none of those jump-scares felt cheap or relentless. They're well-placed and serve the film really well in service of the tension and general feeling of unease, rather than the other way round. The film's horror lies in the unseen, in the empty spaces, in the not-knowing, in being slowly driven insane by an abusive ex given the ultimate power over you. The invisible man is a stalker through and through, constantly making you feel like you're being watched, that someone's there with you. That's not a supernatural fear. It's not even an unlikely fear. It's something we've all experienced from time-to-time, and this film captures that feeling perfectly.Once again, Elisabeth Moss sells everything about her performance, from the desperate pleas to be believed, to the outright terror she endures, to the self-confidence of getting her pound of flesh. There is nothing this woman cannot do, and as much as I'm not really a fan of her, there is no denying how insanely talented she is. The rest of the cast do really well, particularly Oliver Jackson-Cohen as Adrian and Aldis Hodge as James.The Invisible Man was definitely a surprise, in more ways than one. The trailer doesn't instill an awful lot of confidence, but Whannell has successfully delivered another smart movie brimming with creativity. There's twists and turns, ingenious use of camera work, a tightly-written story despite a number of plot holes (how did he always know where she was, all the time?), and a fantastic lead performance. I give The Invisible Man a flawed 8/10.",The Invisible Man
189,crumpytv,Extraordinary performance by Elizabeth Moss,9,20 October 2020,"Watching a film for a change rather than the rubbish dramas airing in the UK, I have to say that despite the negative reviews I enjoyed this intense psychological Sci-Fi thriller.
Elizabeth Moss was in practically every scene and we shared in her anxiety throughout.
Ok, there were plenty of plot holes and logic anomalies, but it is science fiction.
I think the film is weighed down by the title and the expectation of the reworking of the H G Well original novel of the same name.",The Invisible Man
190,sweidman-28016,Better Than Expected!,8,10 March 2020,"The Invisible Man Review:When Cecilia's abusive ex takes his own life and leaves her his fortune, she suspects his death was a hoax. As a series of coincidences turn lethal, Cecilia works to prove that she is being hunted by someone nobody can see. The Invisible Man is written and directed by Leigh Whannell, the man behind movies such as Upgrade, the Saw franchise, and the Insidious franchise. To be honest, this movie looked really bad to me with the release of its trailer. I assumed it would be another cash grab from Universal attempting to revive their ""Dark Universe"". With that universe they made movies that were both bad and flopped at the box office. If you haven't seen 2017's The Mummy, that basically sums up how bad these movies have been. Flashback to a couple weeks ago and the reviews for The Invisible Man ranged from 85%-92%. There were only a few reviews so I didn't think much of it until it maintained a consistent score from critics and audiences. Rather than waiting to see this for free I saw it opening weekend and was pleasantly surprised to see a horror movie that kept my attention throughout its duration. The screenplay didn't have stereotypical dialogue, like the trailer presented, and had a consistent story. This is a really thought out story. Whannell knows how to write a good screenplay, which he displayed very well in Upgrade. There's a good amount of suspense. Right off the bat, you could tell something was off and the suspense kept building. One of the coolest techniques used throughout is the camera panning to different areas of a room or a hallway with nothing there. Also the camera follows Elizabeth Moss so there's always the sense of someone being there. This happens within the first five minutes already. Also there was some cool imagery I noticed with the original Invisible Man designs hidden throughout. Speaking of Elizabeth Moss, I don't understand how she gets better and better with each role. She takes her character to a new level. The people around her think she's crazy for her beliefs and as an audience member having seen some of the stuff she saw, I still questioned her sanity. She's shown that she's very good with horror roles and I can't wait to see her in her next role, which I believe is Shirley. Benjamin Wallfisch, of course, composed the score and he's good at creating suspenseful music to keep the audience on edge. Overall the suspense was on point. With almost every horror movie, though, there are some plot holes. For a movie that mentions security cameras pretty frequently, there are a few scenes had they just looked at the security cameras everything would've been solved. Halfway through the movie there's a scene in a restaurant, I will say it took me by surprise, that had they just looked back at the tapes the movie probably could've just ended there. It's hard sometimes to find a solution and Whannell tried to move the plot along. The movie can also be predictable at times. There's jump scares throughout, which I guess makes sense however I do not like them much, and you can tell when something bad is happening. I didn't expect much more though. The Invisible Man is a movie that is much better than expected and I would recommend it to horror and sci fi lovers, since it's also a good sci fi movie.My Grade: B+",The Invisible Man
191,Draysan-Jennings,INTENSE,8,24 March 2020,"One of those films that forces you to stay off of your phone. If you take an eye off the screen, you might miss something. This movie had me on the edge of my seat from the first scene until the very end. I just wish they would of expanded on how her husband was so abusive. Also, what was Cecilia's connection to the father and daughter? Maybe I missed something. There was definitely some plot holes, but that doesn't justify a rating under 5 stars. The only scene I didn't like was when Adrian (the invisible Man) hits the little girl. Cecilia was clearly 3 to 4 feet away and still gets blammed, lol that was ridiculous. The next few minutes make up for it, gets pretty intense right after that. For the most part this was a fun watch. I don't get all the terrible reviews. It's definitely an entertaining thriller I'd recommend watching. 8 stars.",The Invisible Man

193,acedj,A tense thriller with quite a few scares,8,2 March 2020,"Cecilia Kass is living with her boyfriend Adrian Griffen, an optics genius. We are not given any backstory but introduced to the couple as Cecelia flees in the middle of the night. A few weeks later she is contacted by a lawyer, who happens to be Adrian's brother, to find out that Adrian has taken his own life and she is inheriting a substantial amount of money. Before too long Cecilia's new peace of mind is shattered as strange events start to happen and she becomes convinced that Adrian is still alive and has devised a way to become invisible and is now tormenting her.From the onset, this film delivers a great amount of tension, and it does not relent until the end. I found this to be one of the better entries into the modern horror/thriller genre and actually found myself jumping a few times. That last part is significant because I have watched my fair share of horror movies and thought myself immune to this reaction. This speaks volumes to the director and editor's skills. Elizabeth Moss delivers what is perhaps her finest work here as well as she captures with expertise her character's slow descent into despair as her life is forever changed by the events of this movie. Her performance even lends a doubt as to whether the events we see are real or simply in her head. This is the best film for this year, so far.",The Invisible Man
194,ethanbresnett,"Fun, suspenseful, but never amazing",7,6 November 2020,"The Invisible Man has a pretty interesting concept, although at times this concept seems like a one trick pony placing a little too much importance on jump scares (although not too much I must say). I thought for the most part though the plot was pretty well executed and full of suspense. It was very enjoyable and never got boring, but it was fairly predictable in parts and never reached a booming crescendo. Saying that though there were some shocking surprises thrown in too for good measure. So overall a decent and thrilling ride.As I mentioned there was a little reliance on jump scares, but the fact that the plot revolved around an 'invisible man' meant that this was inevitable to some extent. What I thought the film did really was to create a constant sense of suspense and unpredictability. This lead to some truly remarkable set pieces, with some fantastic effects, which felt very original.I thought Elizabeth Moss was great, conveying the emotional breakdown and transformation of her character very well. She's very watchable in these sorts of full on roles, and she was easily the best part of the film for me. The supporting cast weren't amazing, but weren't bad either.I think overall The Invisible Man is a perfectly decent film, a pretty good horror film, and definitely worth watching. Full of atmosphere, full of suspense, and despite never being truly scary, is very entertaining at least!",The Invisible Man

196,stevenrotherforth,It's not what you see but what you don't that's terrifying,7,3 April 2020,"The Invisible ManThere's lots to like about this latest take on 'The Invisible Man'.
The story does become a little far- fetched towards the end but hey if you've made it that far watching a movie about an invisible man then your probably not going to care.When Cecilia's abusive ex-boyfriend takes his own life and leaves her his fortune, she begins to suspect his death was a hoax. As a series of creepy coincidences turn lethal, Cecilia works to prove that she is being hunted by someone nobody can see.Elisabeth Moss does a fine job as Cecilia, her performance teeters on the insane as those onscreen do not believe her claims.
We the audience know she's not crazy as the jump scares and tension are handled wonderfully by director Leigh Whannell.
This movies starts out like the horror movies from the good old days. Whannell takes his time building his story. There's some terrifying set pieces in this movie. The blanket scene being one immediately springing to mind.
The director utilises the tried and tested method of its not what you see but what you don't see that's frightening.
This is handy really considering this film is about an invisible man.
Sound is also used effectively with the use of heavy bass to make the audience jump.
As a Blumhouse production there's a similar feel running through their movies. The cinematic look reminded me of 'Upgrade',
another one of their offerings that I recommend you check out.
The colour palette and onscreen vibrancy is dull and muted. This helps convey a sense of desperation. There's no sunshine and rainbows here as Cecilia is made to look like a lunatic.This movie was on course for a solid 8/10 until like many modern horror movies, the final act becomes a disappointing anti-climax.
The whole invisible suit idea for me was a step in the wrong direction.
Cecilia's boyfriend turns out to be a deranged version of Tony Stark who's made a suit that allows the wearer to vanish.
Whilst this was entertaining I would of preferred a more supernatural approach.
That said 'The Invisible Man' is one of the better modern day horror offerings.

Yes, technically speaking there are a lot of things in the movie that aren't really feasible but it's sort of like a Sci-Fi movie, isn't it? I thought the cast was good and so was the general story. My issues were more with the little things that could have been done better like if you're dosing your husband maybe make sure he drinks it all and the part were she threw the can of paint on him, no way he could have cleaned it all (judging by the way the suit was built) and at the end when she tried to convince her cop friend that it was her husband not his brother. I mean, come on, you have the suit in your possession now so it's not that crazy to believe he has another one. Also, I thought the name of the movie kinda ruined the mystery. It was obvious from the start that she wasn't crazy or that it's not a ghost. The ending was cool although, again, once the authorities have the suit, suicide seems less likely. Still, even with all that, I thought the movie was quite entertaining. Obviously it's not a masterpiece but if you don't take it too seriously, I think you can enjoy it.",The Invisible Man
199,TwistedContent,An Effective Modern Rendition of the Source Material,8,20 March 2020,"Leigh Whannell successfully continues cementing his status as one of the best mainstream horror filmmakers with adding his effective modern rendition of ""The Invisible Man"" to his filmography. It's most certainly the best Invisible man since 1933, putting a new meaning on the words reboot, re-imagining, modernization, call it what You will. A powerhouse performance, the horror of abuse, good atmosphere building and technical aficionados behind the cameras and computers are what truly make this film. Of course, there are also some flaws.""The Invisible Man's"" only and biggest problem is its story, and I don't mean the effectively served themes of abuse, being controlled and utter helplessness. I mean the mystery behind the invisible man, the surface plot, twists and such. Predictability is the only thing that bummed me out a little, there are two major twists and I saw them coming much sooner than I'd wish to. Apart from that, the character and dialogue writing is great, it's just the eventually ""The Invisible Man"" is more of a by-the-numbers horror, just expertly executed, except for one or two simple logic issues in some action scenes. For its 2 hours runtime, the pacing is pleasantly consistent all throughout. Elisabeth Moss, the absolute star of ""The Invisible Man"", puts on a tough performance, portraying a scarred character on a sanity challenging road in search of freedom, effectively keeping the movie grounded in reality. The rest of this movie's horror magic is in the cinematography, editing and special FX, all of which seem to be nailed near to perfection, setting mood with empty spaces, impending danger and flawless, impressive special effects. The original score fills in whatever room for more sauce there's left. At this point, Whannell's name in a project always means a visually and atmospherically striking movie.Coincidentally I watched 1933's ""The Invisible Man"" for the first time last year, shortly before finding out there's a remake coming out & I'm happy to say that for me both of them are on par - same, yet vastly different and amazing in their own ways. One thing's exactly the same though - both impress with special effects. My rating: 8/10.",The Invisible Man

201,david-meldrum,"An Excellent Genre Thriller, Raising Significant Issues",9,4 December 2020,"Silence is film's blank canvass, the space on which much can be drawn with only the most delicate of strokes. Elisabeth Moss is - as I've said repeatedly, probably to the boredom of many - one of those rare performers who can exploit silence with great power; she thrives on suggestion and allusion - what's sometimes referred to as show, don't tell, film-making. In an episode of The Handmaid's Tale, she gets to do this for the episode's full running-time - alone in a deserted and isolated house, on the cusp of going into labour, trying to formulate an escape. It's a hypnotic, frightening, unbearably tense and ultimately deeply moving hour of television which it's hard to imagine any other actress pulling off.It's precisely this episode of television that sits at the forefront of my mind whilst watching The Invisible Man - an updating and reimagining of H.G. Wells' seminal 1897 novel which looms in the popular imagination of so many who have never read it or seen a previous adaptation. The novel is recontextualised into 2020, with Elisabeth Moss as the victim of concerted domestic violence, who seemingly continues to be haunted by her invisible, supposedly deceased, abuser. It remains a science-fiction/horror thriller, but like the original text it deals with the big issues of the moment - in the shadow of the Trump Presidency that becomes the #Metoo experience, gaslighting and victim-blaming.There are many silences and apparently empty spaces to fill with fear, the threat of violence and self-doubt here. Moss - and director Leigh Whannell - exploit them fully. Moss briefly exits the kitchen, leaving a pan of bacon frying - a pan which sits on the edge of the frame allowing us to watch the mundane scene; is it just our imagination, or does the heat on the pan go up (a question that nods to the gaslighting abuse victims experience)? Either way, Moss is scared out of her mind when she returns to the room. Many scenes involve Moss silently stalking or being stalked by her invisible abuser - or is she hysterical? - and the emphasis on her breathless anxiety is visceral and startling. All of us have at some point been alone in a house at night and been startled or shaken by creaks and groans; all of us will find it easy to think ourselves into Moss's shoes in her moments of isolation, dread and violence.The first hour is all about establishing the premise and the relationships; the second is the pay-off. Some may find the film's second-half a step-down, maybe too generic; for me, that would be to misunderstand the purpose of good genre film-making and to deny the audience and film-makers what they all earn by way of catharsis. Good genre film-making exploits (and occasionally subverts) the rules and expectations of the genre in order to both satisfy the audience to a greater or lesser degree and also to smuggle in some bigger issues which demand attention, slipping under the skin of the viewer's consciousness to bubble to the surface later. It's a trick as old as art of all kinds, and this film stands healthily and proudly in that tradition.Some will object to a film that aims as much for visceral thrills as it does the big issues it addresses; that is understandable. A victim of intimate partner abuse - especially one for whom the abuse is ongoing or recent - may well find it too triggering and real; or they may just find it a source of some kind of hope. As a victim of such abuse myself, many years ago now, it felt real, appropriate and thrillingly entertaining as well as a stark reminder of latent fears that never quite leave someone who's experienced this type of abuse alone. Those of us gaslit, exploited, bullied, physically and sexually abused by intimate partners (or anyone in a position of power over us) will see ourselves in Moss's character; it's not a film that some of us will watch lightly. But for many there is entertainment, and much more besides, to engage with here - which makes this the very best sort of genre thriller.",The Invisible Man

This idea had been done and done and done...right? Wrong! Director Leigh Whannell breathes new life into the concept. Now it's a vehicle for Elisabeth Moss, as Cecilia, who is in every scene and steals them all.Sound and vision are used to keep you on edge. Is Cecilia suffering a mental breakdown because of her abuse...or is there an invisible man following her? Moss and Whannell squeeze every ounce out of this scenario and it all works. This movie even sidesteps the science missteps of earlier versions with an updated version of the character. Though very different from the book by H.G. Wells, I feel like he would approve.",The Invisible Man
203,DLochner,"Psycho for Beginners, with a little lenght",7,3 November 2020,"The first half of the film is gripping and engaging. The opening alone is a small masterpiece. Not for a classic popcorn evening, but deep enough to be thought provoking and entertaining. The second half of the film is then unfortunately lost in far too many side stories and thus loses its flow. All in all a solid, good movie, but it's gotten way too long.",The Invisible Man
204,Stay_away_from_the_Metropol,The first great movie I have seen in 2020,9,2 March 2020,"Leigh Whannell has come a long way since his debut breakthrough SAW, a movie which I was very hyped for and then very disappointed upon viewing. A year or two ago, when MoviePass was a thing, I took the opportunity to go see movies that I wouldn't typically hit the theaters to see, and out of all those I saw, the one that stood out the most was UPGRADE. Though Upgrade had its share of flaws, the movie was very ambitious and quite refreshing in contrast to the rest of what was being produced in cinema at the time - many things about it were very accomplished and thus impressive. This brought me from viewing Leigh Whannell as someone to avoid to a filmmaker to be excited about. When I saw that he was back with Elisabeth Moss fronting a classic feeling psychological thriller, I got even more hyped, and it delivered as hard as the trailer made me believe it would!This is the best movie I have seen in 2020 so far. In my opinion, it is nearly flawless. If you're the type of person who can't do suspension of disbelief, you might not be able to get into it. But, as someone enjoys art that stretches things a step or two or 500 beyond contemporary belief, I fully enjoyed where this movie went. The tension never eases and only builds and builds and twists tastefully and effectively throughout the entire film. At just over 2 hours, it does not feel long in any sense - in fact I had no idea it was any longer than an hour and forty minutes until i came on here and read so.Elisabeth Moss is one of our current queens of chaos. Not many can pull off crazed quite as well as her. You put her on the forefront of any film right now and you've likely got yourself something gold. This role was perfect for her, I've got to say. The whole cast was rather brilliant though in my opinion. Effective sound design and noisy scoring for tension as well.This reminds me of the type of dark psych-thrillers that were mostly only being made in the 90's. Heavy themes & brutal twists. This is ideal popcorn entertainment for adults. Thoroughly thrilling. This movie has brought Leigh Whannell to a higher level as a filmmaker. I'm excited to see where things go from here for him.",The Invisible Man
205,Mike_Devine,A modern-day upgrade to a classic tale of terror,7,26 September 2020,"It was released in the calm before the storm, and for that reason, 'The Invisible Man' will be remembered as one of the last successful major pictures of the pre-pandemic period. But aside from that footnote, director Leigh Whannell's adaptation of an age-old tale stands on its own as a modern-day psychological thriller.Thanks in large part to the dramatic street cred that Elisabeth Moss has amassed over these past few years, 'Invisible' benefits from a built-in audience that follows her wherever she goes. It also helps that the plot is familiar enough, as H.G. Wells's classic tale has been revered for over a century. But the 21st century upgrade is done well, especially given the surveillance state that we appear to live in - where Big Brother is always watching. Moss is incredibly believable as the paranoid, difficult-to-trust, scorned woman, and her performance is perhaps one of the best she's ever delivered. The supporting cast does a very good job adding to the paranoia, particularly Aldis Hodge and Harriet Dyer, and the brief screen time from Oliver Jackson-Cohen is not wasted.But it's the cinematography that really delivers and makes 'Invisible' what it is. From the eerie camera pans to the ""cold open"" scene that sets us up for a chilling ride, the filming techniques play as important a part as the cast does. Sure, some of the events that unfold aren't all that surprising, but these ""twists"" are not overdone or insulting.Due to extenuating circumstances, 'The Invisible Man' will have the distinction of being one of the best films released in 2020. But even so, the film deserves credit for finding an audience during this difficult time.",The Invisible Man

In this horror film, when her abusive husband takes his own life, a woman discovers bizarre occurrences and begins to wonder if he's really dead. Based on the novel by H.G. Wells.
.
Not only is ""The Invisible Man"" a great film, but it uses its source material to adapt to our times and makes for a solid revenge flick. Elisabeth Moss is really impressive in this role that will become a career best for the actress. Writer/director Leigh Whannell carefully crafts his film and takes his time to make you feel the most uncomfortable in every way possible, especially in empty spaces. ""The Invisible Man"" could be the start of a new era of modern monsters films.

209,eagandersongil,Recreating the old,6,3 March 2020,"""The invisible man"" has an interesting, though not new, argument, a good direction and good performances, but Leigh Whannell's feature still owes.The script of the feature is of constant ups and downs, we have a lot of development that ends up going around in itself, a rhythm that weighs and a monotonous first act, a lack of objectivity in the cinematographic style permeates the whole work, the positive side of the script is the creation of the device created and the argument for its use, are at least creative.The direction of the film is good, it mixes several elements of direction and uses his camera very well, making him a character, since we do not see the villain, the camera manages to give a weight and dimension to his threatening presence. Elisabeth Moss is really the highlight of the film, the actress manages to give a great dramatic depth to her character and express her terror very well, it is almost at odds with the rest of the work.When we watch ""The invisible man"", which is a remake, we see hints of other films, such as ""The dark man"" or ""The accountant"", nothing very surprising, a first act that is hard to pass, and a third more animator.

210,akshatmahajan,Wasted opportunity,6,10 November 2020,"Movie's starting one hour was unnecessarily stretched and boring. It is only in last 45 minutes when movie becomes some interesting. This is a horror movie just difference is that they are trying to scare you by moving camera here and there. Well, the idea was nice but execution needed to be better. The pace of the movie was also a problem, first of all this movie didn't need to be 2hour movie. 1hr30 min (max) was enough for this type of story.I was really excited for this after seeing all the reviews but after watching it, I don't think it deserved so much rating.

211,Danny_G13,Complete absurd entertainment,8,28 December 2020,"So we all know the Invisible Man lore, the sci fi disaster that sees a guy made invisible - there's been drama, sci fi and even comedy based on it, but this is the first time yours truly can recall the Invisible Man himself being a bad guy.Anyway, the story here sees Moss' Cecilia escape an abusive (we guess) husband and flee to her sister's boyfriend's house. And it's there where she starts getting paranoid she's being stalked - she can't see him, but she can sense him, and the Invisible Man is there to make her life hell.The premise is actually good - an invisible assailant, with the advantages that brings. Unfortunately, the story loses its way quickly and while my score is high for the sheer entertainment factor, there's no escaping the Invisible Man is a beautiful exercise in the 'dumb things scriptwriters make characters do' blight that afflicts so many Hollywood shows and movies.It's fun to watch - there's no escaping that. It's entertaining, and its use of the Invisible Man as a force of malevolence is quite tense and it does work. It's just the ridiculousness of so many plot holes, character actions and utterly absurd scenarios undermines literally everything.And yet somehow doesn't ruin the movie.You'll laugh, you'll point at the screen and say 'dude, really? Seriously?!'.But you will enjoy the story even if the payoff at the end is a bit patchy and illogical in endeavour.Direction is good, it's quick, even if the look of the film is far too much in the dark - it's a sort of horror movie but not really, and it could have benefited from more day scenes.But those 'wtf' bits will just have you scratching your head wondering how the logic of that passed quality control.End of the day, it's fun.

212,Cinema_Fan,Less Is More:,6,6 March 2020,"H.G. Wells' science-fiction story of the man who becomes all invisible was first published in 1897 and has had many facelifts and adaptations to this enthralling conception. Many have imitated Mr. Wells' legacy in all manner of saga and concept that have run along this timeline of science-fiction endeavour.Writer and director of this contemporary adaptation of invisibility is brought to the big-screen by Mr. Leigh Whannell and it is more to the point of, throughout the years, how one justifies its uses and wants. Mr. Whannell has, here, seen to have gone for the psychological abuse and violent domestic perspective, and particularly toward female-dominance through the act of bullying and oppression of self-worth and ego. Could this simply be a case of a metaphorical viewpoint of mental torment seen through the eyes of this wretched soul due to a vain, malevolent man or a more sinister case of jealous lover cum exploitive, mad scientist?We lay bare the facts that whatever the premise for the torture and madness this is most definitely a tale of both.Ms. Elisabeth Moss' exemplary and unmitigated portrayal of the abused and Mr. Whannell's rendering of the old classic science-fiction fable here comes Vis-à-vis with the exposé of a chilling and somewhat disturbing insight into the world of paranoia and exploitation. The experience witnessed is wild and tense throughout and with each passing moment the intensity of doubt and reasoning becomes a visual nightmare for both recipient and viewer. Each tell-tale sign playing on the mind of the protagonist; looking but never seeing; present but never being. A downward and inward spiral sets the tone of an antagonist that drives this bitter battle to its central core; control, or simply addressing the element of losing control. A fine paradox of vision with the insight of Director to envisage a cruel world that is more often heard but never seen.The Invisible Man is a scolding parable of two worlds that collide and intertwine with love & hate. This shrouded rendition shows the scathing contempt of personal space, dignity and respect. It is a train wreck of nerves and bitter sweet retaliation that holds its breath until its final gasp; we are eyewitness to a high-octane and sensational amalgamation of a modern disease via the workings of Mr. Wells' original concept with a stellar performance of its leading lady. This is quite the optical illusion of less-is-more.",The Invisible Man
213,DeBBss,Liked It More Than I Thought I Would,7,26 July 2020,"I honestly thought that The Invisible Man was going to be a flop on all levels except for the box office, but The Invisible was a pleasant surprise. The Invisible Man gets so much right, the camerawork, the acting, the cinematography, and the really good CGI with a small budget. And after The Mummy (2017) failing to reboot the Dark Universe, The Invisible Man gives the best opportunity where The Mummy fails.What I like about this remake is that the plot is completely different. Adrian Griffin uses a suit in this outing, which is a more realistic take than the novel. The plot also had a really good execution. The pacing was constantly intense and intriguing. The Invisible Man also has a lack of jumpscares, which is the cancer of the horror genre. Jumpscares ruin the intensity of a scene and movie; and after watching The Invisible Man, Leigh Whannell proves that he knows how to make a horror intense.The camerawork is really good too, the best part in my opinion. It's hard to film nothing and have a direction, but The Invisible Man makes it look easy. Leigh Whannell does a great job at making it seem like there's a presence in the room, and it creates such an intense and creepy atmosphere.Overall, The Invisible Man has a lot of potential to restart the Dark Universe. Almost everyone loves the classic movies, and them being rebooted to modern times would be great. Almost everything in The Invisible Man is perfect, the creepy atmosphere, and camerawork are top notch. And since The Invisible Man was released in 2020, The Invisible Man has a goo chance to be the best movie of the year.",The Invisible Man
214,jayjaycee,Didn't see it coming (pun intended),7,31 July 2020,"""The Invisible Man"" is a 2020 mystery horror film directed by Leigh Whannell starring Elizabeth Moss and Oliver Jackson-Cohen.
⚪
All in all, this modern adaptation of the classic H.G. Wells story is a pleasant entry to the genre of the modern horror film and an important film for the franchise in general that delivers some impenetrable, twisted fun. Blumhouse dusted off an old tale that has been forgotten by most and effectively transferred it to the twenty-first century, thus becoming a surprise hit that no one really saw coming. Undoubtedly, the movie wouldn't be as half as terrific without the phenomenal, by paranoia and panic characterized performance of ""The Handmaid's Tale"" superstar Elizabeth Moss whose amazing acting dominates the mainly taciturn scenes that are primarily characterized by the cinematography instead of dialogue, and thus makes the fear become real in the first place. It successfully breathed new air into the franchise and moved away from the renowned, Claude Rains lead feature from the thirties and created something on its own: Bandages, gown and shades made way for a trypophobia causing high-tech suit, and this is only a small detail of the delighting new adaptation that displays an unsettling and distressing atmosphere and poses as a phenomenal start for the relaunch of the Universal Classic Monster franchise that has been attempted many times before.",The Invisible Man

Director: Leigh Wannel
Starring: Elisabeth Moss, Oliver Jackson cohen, Harriet Dyer, Aldis Hodge, Storm Reid etcOverall rating 88/100The invisible man is based on a character called Cecilia Kass (Elisabeth Moss) who escapes her abusive relationship with her partner. But after he kills himself and gives her all his money everything seems to be fine. But mysterious events are happening to Cecilia that leads her to believe he has found a way to stalk her but will anyone believe her? Wow what a fantastically crafted movie, easily the best horror of the year, so many fantastic components to talk about but let down slightly by one big thing, lets talk about this more.First of all the films cinematography and sound design was excellent. Wow this films cinematography was beyond excellently crafted. Whether it was the fantastic title sequence at the beginning. Or its excellent use normal day to day places and items becoming horrifying. It was simple things like blankets or chairs that were just so effective due to the invisible element to the movie fear of the unknown played a key element in the cinematography working so well. Also, the films sound design was phenomenal. The film had a great equal reliance on the visual elements, but more so the sound. Due to the obvious inviable element the films use of diegetic sound was fantastic. It really made you pay attention to each little sound trying to find where Adrian (Oliver Jackson Cohen) was. The films score was also fantastic in adding to the impact of a lot of scenes, but also the lack of sound or score also intensified the uncomfortable fear that this film managed to create.Adding on from my previous point the film managed to have an excellent tense tone and very well executed Jumpscares. Wow this film was perhaps the most tense I have ever been for a horror movie. They really played well into the fear of the unknown, and once again the use of invisibility really helped with the tenseness because you couldn't tell where he was so the film actively placed you into the shoes of the characters and their fear turned into your fear. And because of this fear of the unknown there was some excellently executed Jumpscares. Wow no predictable Jumpscares at all, they weren't overused, but used well enough to startle you on many occasions. There was often long pauses when you thought something was going to happen but it didn't and the minute you calmed down it made you jump, so the Invisible man really had excellently timed and crafted scares that genuinely took you by surprise.Next the film had effective uses of gore and a very entertaining final act. The films use of violence was also very effective. Due to the limited use of it, when it was used it genuinely took me by surprise and left a lot of the audience gasping, showing the film managed to achieve its desired reaction. Also the long mid close ups of the aftermath also added to the impact and allowed what just happened to sink in more. This all led to a very entertaining final act. When Elisabeth Mosses lured Adrian to the hospital she was staying it, despite the smaller budget they managed to achieve a very good final act action scene that was used effectively and was different to anything I have seen due to the added element of invisibility. The twists and plot twist were shocking and used effectively but not all were executed well as I am about to discuss.My only negative that ruined the film slightly was its ending and overcomplicated ending. They decided to add some mystery into the film that for me didn't quite stick with the ending. They added that it was not Adrian but her brother doing the tormenting. But us as the audience knew that Adrian was guilty, Elisabeth Mosses character then decided to kill Adrian, which for me made me dislike her character more, and the scene were this was revealed felt to quick and underdeveloped so the logic was slightly off, so this effected my overall opinion on the film slightly.My final positives that made the film really good was the likeable characters, great themes and messages about domestic abuse, and finally the phenomenal performance from Elisabeth Moss. This film wouldn't of worked if the performances were bad and you didn't connect with any of the characters, but luckily in this case the complete opposite was achieved. All the characters were liekable, and you genuinely wanted Cecilia to be happy and free from Adrian. Aldis Hodge and Storm Reid were also fantastic, and the dynamic between them both and Elisabeth Moss was believable and organic. The messages about domestic abuse despite uncomfortable needed to be told. The fact that the abuse was told and not shown for me was more effective, Adrian controlled everything that Cecilia did, so you understood her pain and her fear making it a compelling story arc. Finally my biggest positive would be the fantastic performance Elisabeth Moss. Every emotion she expressed was incredibly believable up to the point of me actually believing she was the character. As her mental state got slowly and slowly worse her performance got better and better, so hats off to Elisabeth for this excellent showing of her acting abilities.Overall, despite the logic and script falling apart slightly in the final reveal, the invisible man was still the best horror of the year, excellently crafted fantastic themes, and some of the best directing and lead performance that I have seen.",The Invisible Man
218,shanayneigh,Another Blumhouse cash grab,4,28 March 2020,"I know it's silly to expect any kind of realism in a movie about an invisible man. But every movie at least has to make sense within its own universe. This movie has so many plot holes and logical inconsistencies which are horribly distracting.So the boyfriend pretends to have committed suicide, something which his brother (and executor of his will) proves to Elizabeth Moss with a photograph where the boyfriend is clearly recognizable. His face isn't mangled or anything, he has just cut his wrists. So who pronounced him dead and how? Did the brother show up to the police and the coroner with a photo of his brother and go ""Hey, here's my dead brother, let's get started with the execution of his will. What do you mean 'evidence'? Just trust me, bro!""Apparently the boyfriend was some optics wiz working with refractive projection and multiple cameras. Something which is explained in a six second insert of an article about his suicide. Nice backstory, bro. Actually, there is zero backstory in this movie. We have no idea what the relationship between Moss and her boyfriend was like, I guess we just have to take her word for it. There is zero character development, the boyfriend is just crazy apparently. I can't really call him a character at all, he's just a plot function. Why did the boyfriend build this suit at all? Was it only to stalk Moss in case she ever broke up with him? And why is his brother in on his scheme?And I thought for quite a while that her sister and the black cop were dating, but apparently not. What is his relationship to Moss that he allows her to move in with him and his teenage daughter? Just friends?The way the suit works is inconsistent. When the invisible man holds a gun the entire gun is visible, but the cell phone he used to take photos of Moss sleeping is nowhere to be seen. I guess he waddled out of the room like a duck after stuffing it someplace safe where the sun don't shine. And if the suit is built with cameras and projection, why isn't the ground or carpet under his feet completely dark? What about the insides of his thighs and his armpits where the cameras are just filming one another? Would it be visible or a video feedback loop? And how is the suit fooling more than one spectator at a time, viewing it from different angles? I'm getting ""Die Another Day"" flashbacks... If the movie was engaging, these are probably not questions I even would have though of. But here we are.But say we buy all this. The main problem is that as a horror movie it isn't particularly scary. There is no real sense of dread. I'm not talking about jump scares, those are startling (and cheap), not scary. And I'm certainly not talking about gore either. And it's far too long. This movie has no business being longer than 100 minutes.The Kevin Bacon version has two things working in its favor. First of all, there is a motivation for the invisibility and why he goes insane. Secondly, it's set in a limited and secluded location where the characters were trapped for the most part. In the 2020 version, Moss is roaming all over the place, all she needs is an Uber.",The Invisible Man
219,gavinp9,"Enjoyable, suspenseful thriller reimagining",8,3 March 2020,"'The Invisible Man' is probably about the 10th remake of one of the original sci-fi/monster concepts, coming 87 years after the original film. Thankfully, it's a very modern take, with no supernatural elements - just a well put together thriller. Cecilia (Moss) basically carries the film, and it starts with her escaping her controlling husband, Adrian (Jackson-Cohen), with the help of her sister, Emily (Dyer). She stays with their friend James (Hodge) and his daughter, Sydney (Reid), when she finds out that Adrian is dead.With all apparently fine, things start to unravel, as Cecilia starts to believe Adrian is somehow stalking her from beyond the grave. Adrian's brother, Tom (Dorman) assures Cecilia that Adrian's dead. We're left guessing, as we don't get much insight into Adrian & Cecilia's relationship or his motives, other than the fact he's a Tony Stark-type rich inventor. This is where the idea of the invisibility coming from a high-tech suit is more plausible than supernatural powers.After the great, almost-silent and very dark, start, the film establishes a good rhythm, until it kicks into overdrive for the final 30min or so. The tension, suspense and guessing ""where is he?"" throughout is handled really well, with it never getting too boring or predictable. There's certainly a few really good jump scares! Better than 'Hollow Man', which I also liked, at least when it came out.",The Invisible Man
220,thebricks,Definitely hitting the spoilers button for this review,7,1 March 2020,"Pretty dumb movie with a lot of plot holes, but it was entertaining. My local theater chain is going down and I only went to see this to use up my rewards points before it got padlocked or another chain buys it out. They definitely didn't clean up the script on this movie and fill in the plot holes. Elizabeth Moss is also a pretty terrible actress that drags down everything she's in.But anyways, there are a lot of plot holes in the film, starting off. Number one, even if the boyfriend killed himself, cops have to examine the scene, examine the body, the coroner has to sign the death certificate, body has to be given to the funeral home, etc. So people would have to have been paid off to let all this happen, which is just ridiculously unlikely.The whole Invisible Man thing is just so stupid and even more unlikely to work in 2020. The whole plot has to be massaged and contrived to make it all believable. For instance, Moss appears normal and likable to everyone she knows, but they all write her off the minute the Invisible Man does things to hurt her life. Cecilia is across the room from James's daughter before she gets hit out of thin air. Instead of assessing what happened, she immediately wrongly blames Cecilia and the father leaves with her. Had Sydney immediately pointed out what happened rationally, they should have immediately figured out what was going on and believed Cecilia, but the writer couldn't allow that to happen. It's nonsense. Cecilia's sister also gets a vile, nasty email purportedly written by her and totally believes her sister did it when she clearly has no idea what happened, has no history of doing anything like this, has no reason to do it, shuts the door and holds it against her instead of hearing her out or considering that she could plausibly have been hacked at least. The Invisible Man also is superhuman and capable of smashing multiple guards like the Hulk with his bare hands. Punching and smashing people apparently does not damage the capabilities of the suit. During Moss's first encounter with the Invisible Man, he is slashed but the suit isn't compromised until later, when one stab finally damages the suit and makes it visible. What? Way to be consistent!Some issues I had with the suit, which is inspired by the same tech that people hated in the Bond movie ""Die Another Day"", were that it's a bit archaic if you keep up with today's tech. There shouldn't be cameras jutting out, with gaps. The suits material should be something that's all made out of OLED material, which is plausible. This looks like something that would have been made in the eighties, lol. The suit also leaves no shadows. I mean, more power to Oliver if he figured out how to stop that but it seems unlikely. Flashlights, motion detectors, rain, even dust and foreign objects should be visible on The Invisible Man but his suit is always whistle clean everytime, which is remarkably unbelievable. The SWAT team at the end of the movie knows about the Invisible Man but don't even bother to wear thermals in the mansion, which is nuts.There are so many other plot holes, like why Cecilia doesn't ask to investigate where Oliver and Tom's cars are when these attacks happen. Why not walk around the neighborhood and see what you find? Floors have to creak, stuff has to be moved, an big, invisible man would still make a presence.So yes, it is a terrible script, but it's still a fun movie that will cause a lot of discussion amongst your friends. I preferred Hollow Man to this. Hollow Man had an issue with shadows, I think, but for the most part, it was more believable. It could have been a lot better, it's a shame.",The Invisible Man
221,bryangary65,You will not see the ending coming...,7,19 December 2020,"Anything with Elizabeth Moss in always gets my attention and she is good in this filmThe plot is hardly believable but putting that aside and it's not a bad thriller ,though the ending slightly controversial",The Invisible Man
222,flicklover,Surprisingly tense and efective!,8,9 March 2020,"When I first watched the trailer for The Invisible Man a couple of months ago I had no real desire to see it. I've never been into the story and the last iteration was Hollow Man and that was terrible. The trailer looked at best average but the fact that it was being released in the film graveyard that is the first 3 or months of the year I wasn't going to see it.Well, it came out and the reviews and audience reaction were much better than I expected so I decided to see it. It is much better than I thought. In fact, it is a really effect suspense thriller. There are some really quietly intense scenes. It is not really a remake but a reimagining of the invisible man character. It stars Elizabeth Moss as an emotionally abused wife that leaves her rich, controlling husband. The scene that she leaves him is done very well and has some real tension. He suddenly notices she's gone and nearly keeps her from escaping. She escapes to stay with a friend that is a cop.played by Aldis Hodge. Cecilia is obviously very disturbed by the abuse she suffered. She is so afraid of her boyfriend Adrian find her that she doesn't even want to see her sister because Cecilia thinks Adrian would follow her. Soon, Cecilia starts feeling Adrian's presence in her friends house. She goes to Adrian's brother to tell him that he is stalking her. He assures her that he is dead and says that she was left $5 million dollars by Adrian payable in 4 years as long as she was arrested for a crime. Then the film gets very intense. Cecilia is convinced that Adrian is invisible and is after her. Obviously, everyone around her thinks she is crazy. Even her friend that is a cop will not believe her. Obviously as an audience we know he's there but the great thing that director Leigh Whannell does is that he doesn't show Adrian for a while. He suggests he's there subtly. There are long shots that had me scoping to seif Adrian was there. It was really tense for a while. The best thing about this film was Elizabeth Moss as Cecilia. The story is told from her perspective. She carries the film. It is told from a point of view of an abused woman that is haunted by the memory of her supposedly dead husband. The film is more of a psychological thriller than a horror film. Once Adrian appears the film goes into full slasher mode. The reveal is really good. He is determined to ruin Cecilia's life. And he pretty much does. I don't like spoilers but the film has some twists that are not all that surprising but the film does lose steam in the last 20 minutes. All in all it is very well done, probably as good as an invisible man film can be. It's nice to be pleasantly surprised by a film that I originally had no desire to see.Grade: B",The Invisible Man
223,ragingbull_2005,Supremely well crafted horror/ thriller classic,7,27 March 2020,"Very effective, with nary a stray or wasted moment. It starts building the tension from the very first scene and keeps its foot on the pedal for almost every minute of its 115 minutes' runtime.The background score, consisting of sequenced bass effects, is very effective. Elizabeth Moss is supremely well casted as she increases the sense of impending dread with her generally gloomy countenance.Leigh Whannell, the director, mines the classic story for fresh scares. His visualization is evident from the titling itself, with its use of water against rock.This was made on a budget of 5 million and had earned 70 million plus when the coronavirus hit and it found its way to the streaming portals.Very highly recommended. It is sure to impress you and to stay with you for long.",The Invisible Man
224,mgd_m,Disappointing,5,3 April 2020,"Starts good, slowly builds up an atmosphere, takes care of the details, tells about the psychological side of an invisible menace: great! Well filmed, great sound, great colors. It's all Whannell.Then, halfway through, it turns into a B-movie you probabily watched 30 years ago. Boring, predictable, full of holes. Whannell seems bored by the second part of his own movie, like he doesn't care for it anymore.",The Invisible Man
225,themadmovieman,Intense and powerfully distressing,8,28 February 2020,"Taking a classic horror premise and delivering it with effortless style and striking intensity, The Invisible Man is a gripping and powerfully distressing watch throughout.It features a stellar lead turn from Elisabeth Moss, pitch-perfect direction from Leigh Whannel and clever writing throughout, all of which makes it more than just a horror-thriller, but a genuinely impressive piece of cinema as a whole.There's a lot that's great about this film, but the best place to start has to be with the outstanding central performance by Elisabeth Moss. Having proved her talents on countless occasions in the past, Moss brings a staggering level of depth and intensity to her role, lifting what could have been a run-of-the-mill horror-thriller to being so much more.From the very first frame, Moss brings a palpable sense of unease and distress to the film, as her character desperately escapes from an abusive and controlling husband, only to be just as tormented even away from him.Her performance isn't your average horror turn, shying away from melodramatic screams and shrieks in favour of dark and intense emotional depth throughout. And with that, her character and the film's assessment of her mental state becomes so much more gripping.Because, while there certainly is tension and horror excitement throughout, The Invisible Man stands out because of its emotional intensity and intelligent, modern perspectives on abusive relationships and mental health.With Moss as the centrepiece for its exploration of the extents to which emotional distress can take a person, The Invisible Man strikes up hard-hitting and intensely affecting themes, which in turn lend real gravitas and dramatic depth to its horror thrills.So, even if you're not a horror fan, this film has so much to offer you, from its brilliant lead performance to its intelligent, striking and powerfully intense dramatic themes - a real triumph for what you might at first see as little more than a generic horror.But, if you are a fan of the genre, don't despair, because there is still a lot to enjoy from the thrillseeker's perspective. With sleek and tension-filled directing by Leigh Whannel, The Invisible Man doesn't pull its punches when it comes to intense thrills.Although it does jump the gun a little early when it comes to bringing big, action-packed horror into the fray, the film's dramatic intensity works in tandem with Whannel's eye-catching direction, developing a powerful, almost ruthless brand of horror that's brilliantly tinged with hard-hitting dramatic depth.The film changes and develops brilliantly over the course of its two-hour runtime, but the horror always stays at the centre. Even in its quieter moments, you find yourself looking around the screen to see if the Invisible Man is hiding somewhere in plain sight - evidence of how effective Whannel's directing is.All in all, I absolutely loved The Invisible Man. More than just your average horror, the film takes a brilliant and simple concept and gives it stunning depth, gravitas and intrigue throughout. Bolstered by an amazing lead performance by Elisabeth Moss, it's an entirely gripping watch throughout.And with good action and horror fare to bring pace, intensity and ruthless excitement to the table, the film is just as thrilling as it is enthralling, all brought together by director Leigh Whannel's eye-catching and brilliantly effective style.",The Invisible Man
226,WalkdenEntertainment,A welcoming return but very Predictable,7,26 February 2020,"Cecilia (Elizabeth Moss) escapes from her abusive boyfriend. Two weeks later she is still living in fear, but she's soon informed that her ex-boyfriend has committed suicide. Cecilia inherits a large fortune from his will. Now feeling free of her dark past, she tries to move on and start a fresh life. All is going well until she begins to have suspicions that her dead ex-boyfriend might not be dead after all. Now a mysterious ""Invisible Man"" figure is destroying her life and the ones around her. Walking into my preview screening I was extremely excited to see a film bringing ""The Invisible Man"" back into the horror and thriller genre. While the title feels like a remake, I welcomed it because it feels so long since movie lovers had An Invisible Man film (Hollow Man - 2000 comes to mind). Elizabeth Moss does a fantastic job playing the lead. A character who is dealing with an abusive past and questioning a new ""invisible presence"" would be a challenge to play on screen, but I'm proud to confess that she's quite enjoyable in this role. As for suspense there is lots of it here. For the most part these moments were creative and it's obvious the director is avoiding the typical jump scares. However, as a plot I found ""The Invisible Man"" predictable to the point where it even annoyed me. Perhaps some viewers won't be bothered with element like myself. When questions are raised earlier in the film and viewers instantly know the answer before the reveal at the end that's a movie sin. I feel a couple of better edits for these predictable twists would have made them more ""invisible"" to figure out. This also takes away moments of enjoyment and shock when a film is consistently obvious. As for effects they were also great. There is lots of creativity as to how this invisible presence starts to ruin Cecilia's life and haunt her. I can't speak negatively about the visual effects. The film's audio was also a nice compliment to the visuals as it felt futuristic and gave a sci-fi vibe, similar to films such as ""Upgrade"" 2018 (same director). Overall, The Invisible Man gave me expectations of something new with a fresh type of story. While the film's CGI effects, suspense & performances are generally solid, the film's plot and key moments were incredibly predictable throughout. As you can understand, this takes away all the pleasure I was truly wanting to have from this film. Overall it's still enjoyable to be sure, but I confess, I wish it was better.

227,movieman6-413-929510,The director portrays the film in such a way that it really feels like there is an extra presence in the film.,7,2 March 2020,"The Invisible Man is a new horror thriller, partly written and produced by Leigh Whannell, the director of Upgrade and Insidious: Chapter 3.In the film, Cecilia Kass (Elisabeth Moss) manages to escape from her violent friend Adrian Griffin (Oliver Jackson-Cohen). In addition to being violent, Adrian is also a control freak who determined how Cecilia should live her life.
After being freed from her ex for two weeks, she learns that he has committed suicide and given her a lot of money as an inheritance. Despite all the evidence, Cecilia does not want to believe that Adrian has committed suicide. During her research to prove that he is still alive, she notices that she is experiencing many bizarre coincidences. It feels like Adrain is still present in her life, but she cannot see him. As she tries to prove this to her family and friends, they increasingly start to see her as disturbed. Cecilia must now prove that Adrain is still stalking her invisibly before she ends up in a psychiatric institution.Leigh Whannell has once again managed to make an exciting film with this film, even without you actually seeing the danger. He has portrayed the film in such a way that the viewer also feels like there is an extra presence in the film. This movie is a bit like a better Paranormal Activity movie where the characters are also harassed by an invisible demon. Unfortunately, the film loses its horror tension during the film and changes more into a Sci-Fi thriller.If you look at the film too critically, it can sometimes look like a lesser film, because if the main characters had acted a little smarter, she could prove faster that she is being stalked by an invisible person. In some places where she is stalked, you would expect that there would be cameras somewhere that could film that an invisible person is still doing things around her.Elisabeth Moss also performs good and credible acting as someone who is stalked by an invisible person and has to prove this to the rest. The rest of the cast also does good acting as her family and group of friends trying to support her, but gradually believing less and less in her invisible stalker stories.",The Invisible Man

I see a lot of mixed reviews for this movie on IMDb and many people are saying there were lots of plot holes, but I don't think there was. Horror wise this is probably not the best movie as there were barely any moments that make you jump, but that didn't concern me that much; I think it should be considered more as a thriller movie.",The Invisible Man

233,zac-04879,Would Be Perfect if Some Details Weren't Covered Too Deeply,7,20 September 2021,"Leigh Whannell's storytelling may not generally be expeditious, but his working execution of the science fiction-themed design is simply effective and shocking. It's smart, psychological, breath-taking and especially assigns you to the edge of your seat, forming solid confirmation to the chilling line: ""what you can't see can hurt you"".Elisabeth Moss absolutely nails delivering a cautious character who is being stalked by their believed-to-be-dead ex-partner. With the personalities and the implicit themes, The Invisible Man is able to blend you into the setting pretty effectively. There's also the anticipated tension, surprises and scares as the plot unfolds. The ominous music and amazing sound effects certainly contribute to the impact of these scenes.Unfortunately, The Invisible Man doesn't lack a handful of unnecessary events and areas that are noticeably weaknesses to the film. The character development, psychological aspect and other specific points are all of essence to a well-constructed mystery.

The way that the movie at some points used the camera angles in a way that suggested that, from the chosen angle and movement, it could be Adrian's point of view being depicted rather than just camera work, added a captivating dimension to the movie, and illustrated some quality directing from Whannell.Elisabeth Moss also did a great job in her role, and the story though very simple, was excellently handled. My biggest issue with the movie was when Cecelia ran out of Adrian's house after finding the suit; the movie just cut to her being back in the cab after fighting Adrian. That scene didn't quite add up for me, however, it did little in taking away from the movie's intense grip.The Invisible Man may not be perfect, with visible issues at certain parts, but it was solidly and very entertainingly put together making it a must see, and the suit itself was quite remarkable, which made you wonder just how insanely amazing it could be with a bigger budget.8/10.",The Invisible Man

Known only as a horror director and screenwriter before he returned to his more habitual genre in The Invisible Man, a somewhat remake/reboot version of a classic by H.G. Wells. I never fancied horrors thinking of them as shallow, superficial, nothing to think about kind of stories that are only meant to scare you. Sadly this one is no exception but Mr. Whannell brings his own style into this modern take on the classic story of a narcissistic maniac with obsessiveness issues and God syndrome. Visually the movie is amazing and keeps you on the edge of your seat until the ending. Stylistically it's almost the perfect example of a fine thriller with a lot of broader score options than just scary sounds and screamers. The actors are doing their best as well but only Elisabeth Moss keeps the bar high. In short, after Upgrade it just feels like a step back for the director, although a solid one.",The Invisible Man

A simple setup, strong lead, a few surprises here and there.Times are a bit difficult for a movie lilke this as world has evolved technically and surveillance wise, a lot of the plot holes would've passed a few decades ago, but not today. I'm not too picky maybe and didn't think of every detail covered in here, but there are a few points that bug me like how nothing was recorded at the restaurant to prove her innocent and how would they ""make everything be normal"" if she accepted the agreement, there were people dead anyway.Nice popcorn movie, technically very well made, only the script was a bit too old school, but maybe that was what made it so enjoyable, not being so obsessed in filling out every single plot detail or trying to be too smart.",The Invisible Man

248,TheVictoriousV,Nifty and relevant; Moss' new career-best,7,23 April 2020,"In accordance with you-know-what and resulting theatre closures around the globe, Blumhouse brings their take on H.G. Wells' Invisible Man straight to streaming; albeit after a brief, Universal-distributed theatre run. Ostensibly, this is Universal's latest attempt at introducing a Shared Universe for their classic movie monsters (who all but invented the Cinematic Universe model in the 1930s), but The Invisible Man does something different, making me hope it definitely ain't of the same cloth as 2017's Mummy.Directed by Leigh Whannell (co-creator of Saw and director of Upgrade), this one stars Elisabeth Moss as a deeply traumatized woman whose ""invisible man"" is an allegory for a force of torment others refuse to see, writing the victim off as hysterical (whether or not there exists a literal Invisible Man in the text, I will leave a secret). Moss, it seems, is set to be one of the modern scream queens.In the movie, she gives another superb performance, portraying a character whose descension is believable. Considering what she does later, I wonder if those who outright admire the character are also among the critics who read the allegedly harmful message of DC's Joker as ""Marginalized Group X are monsters waiting to happen"". I don't think either film is subtextually saying this; I just wonder if there might be parallels between the fanbases of Cecilia Kass and Arthur Fleck, and if one nonetheless finds that the other glamorizes violence.All the same, I was solidly involved in the mystery and horror of the text itself, each new development bringing protagonist Cecilia (Moss) closer to madness. The filmmaking complements the unease with its lighting, camera work, scoring, and so forth - judging plainly from his limited directorial catalog, Whannell is quite good with atmosphere.Reimagining this classic as an allegory for modern-day women's concerns is a welcome choice, and I'm trying to put my finger on why it works here. That is, if we set aside the fact that it is better-acted, better-lit, better-shot, more mature, more visually inventive, and all-around better as a movie than the likes of Ocean's 8 (and Watchmen, for the most part).To be precise, I usually don't see the point of trying to reinvent an old franchise, either through sequel or reboot, as a hiply progressive rouse, not only because this may unnecessarily irritate neckbeard fanboys (good for PR, but sometimes bad for ticket sales). I usually argue that women deserve to star in original movies, crafting new female characters - as opposed to female ""versions"" - for us to admire, which will gradually erode sexism, or so the filmmakers may hope.Hell, the sort of bloggers and critics who will defend recently woke-ified franchises like Ghostbusters and Star Wars even dislike the idea of being beholden to what came before, as proven by a recently popular article decrying the very idea of ""canon"". A film like Star Wars: The Last Jedi, which is widely thought to go against ideas and rules presented in preceding films, supposedly shouldn't have to care about that in the first place. Thus I once again ask: why don't you just make a brand new movie? The answer is naturally that Disney and Lucasfilm enjoy money and publicity; let's not pretend all these woke toy commercials come from an auteur's mind.This may be the main reason The Invisible Man, another reimagining with aspirations of serving The Cause, actually works. It does, in fact, play like a person's vision - on top of being well-crafted in the ways I've listed (I also wouldn't say the revamping offends Wells, if that sort of thing does matter). Disagree with its thesis all you want; at least it's not pretending for the sake of getting Tumblr moms to purchase Rey figurines and annoy other fans.This doesn't mean the film is perfect (it has its plot conveniences and pop scares, in addition to certain silly visuals), but it is sure to entertain. Ultimately, for all the silly dreck we've gotten from them, Blumhouse (like A24 and various streaming companies) may be another place where the geniuses go to flourish nowadays.",The Invisible Man

Typically stories like this will show the hero's struggle against the villain, in this they're no different to each other, there's no hero just 2 villains, no redeamable quality's in either of them, just like all the ""gangster"" movies whose characters no one cares about because there is nothing for anyone to identify with, just another pointless story about pointless characters.
The decision to change the science from the original story is interesting, although extremely flawed, don't get me wrong the depiction of the suit with hundreds, possibly thousands of microscopic cameras is easily one of the highlights of the movie, we're it possible it would already be in the real world, as is only flat static objects work with this technology, no amount of money or time will ever change that, knowing that just highlights this as nothing more than a silly plot premise, better the story was kept to that of an evil scientist that had discovered the secret of invisibility & slowly turns insane from its over use,
Moss's character escapes from an abusive relationship, after hearing the abuser is dead she then meets the brother for a reading of the will & is told she's been left £5 million, now this is the writer's chance to show the ""hero"" for what she is by having her tell him to shove the money, but no, she happily accepts it, as if all the abuse was OK because of the ""payday"", for me that's when this movie lost its way, this was less of an observation of a victims point of view & more ""let's just get to the payoff at the end"", a huge missed opportunity by the writer/director to show the abused as the hero rather than just another ""gold digger"".
£123 million gross from a mere £7 million budget is nothing to be sniffed at, even with the limited cgi effects, I can only assume the actors took minimum wage or maybe a percentage from the box office, the cgi /special effects when used are extremely good.
Unfortunately this movie was always going to be let down by its story & lack of character development, as the viewer we're not privy to the abuse experienced by moss's character so have no prior knowledge of choen's characters ""evilness"" & the description of the ""abuse"" by moss's character fails to describe cohen's character as anything other than a control freak & certainly not that of a sociopath.
Again poor story was the reason for so many plot holes & the asylum incident was always going to be compared to T2 because its literally a rip off of that scene, these are supposed to be ordinary people within an extraordinary story yet cohen's character shows no restraint in murdering innocent individuals, this is not a case of ""the invisible man becoming insane"" because he isn't invisible his suit is, he can remove it when ever he wants, the classic story & the movie ""Hollow man"" shows how being invisible for a sustained amount of time can slowly turn the person insane & enable them to do shocking terrible things, choen's character would seem to be capable of these things invisible or not, again lack of on screen character development robs the audience of witnessing this.
As so many Reviewers have remarked this is ""the invisible man"" story told from the victims side, an interesting premise that the writer / director fails to do justice to, at the end of this moss's character is again given the opportunity to become the ""hero"", yet after 5 minutes of begging choen's character to admit his guilt in what has ensued she opts for donning the ""suit"" she hid earlier in the movie & slits his throat, an ending that was so obvious for all to see, again ordinary people don't do these things, no doubt leigh whannell's idea was to show moss' character as the ""tough woman"" yet she just comes across as another sociopath, this movie should have concluded with the ""asylum"" scene with moss's character finally shown as the hero, the earlier scene of her hiding the suit should have shown her taking it & the end scene of her agreeing to meet with choen for dinner should have been replaced with Cohen led in bed alone at night woken in fear by the word ""surprise"" leaving the audience to ponder whether she will now terrorise him or if he'll meet his death at her ""invisible"" hands.
All in all not a bad movie, but not a particularly good one, the lack of time passing between scenes & within scenes was another thing that let's this down, for example when moss' character visits the house after she's been attacked in her friends home, she finds the suit then hides it & is then confronted with ""the invisible man"", how did he get there so soon after she did? No vehicle was seen entering the grounds so what did he use to get there? This was a long drive so not somewhere he could get to on foot, plot holes such as this ruin the illusion of story's like this, this is just 1 story/plot hole, this movie has so many it can literally be torn to pieces, perhaps the original runtime was much longer & it's suffered from editing, whatever the case, this movie done right could have been epic, as is, it's a failed attempt, a better director would & should have seen how good this could really be, unfortunately this will be nothing more than a missed opportunity.",The Invisible Man
251,danybur,The trauma of abuse as a horror movie,9,28 January 2021,"English ReviewThe film opens with Cecilia (Elisabeth Moss) sneaking out of the spectacular home she shares with her husband Adrian (Oliver Jackson Cohen), a psychopathic abuser and optical genius. Despite finding out some time after the death of her husband, she begins to ensure that Adrian harasses her.The Invisible Man, by Australian Leigh Whannel is an extraordinary combination of drama, psychological and paranoid thriller and horror film. In many moments, the suspense, tension and the sense of threat generated by the frames and some small events of an admirable subtlety and even elegance are really intolerable. On the other hand, its dosed and sudden scenes of violence and special effects are wonderfully resolved.As in any good genre film, its core is the drama that Cecilia suffers based on the persecutory trauma she suffers like every abused woman, enhanced in this case by signs that do not seem to be from the real world, making the feeling of threat more omnipresent and desperate.Elizabeth Moss is the ideal actress to play this suffering woman who, even in the most desperate moments, never abandons a will to fight and access the truth that will allow her to discover the nature of the threat that torments her and to confront it.",The Invisible Man
252,canuckteach,Well below expectations...,5,4 September 2020,"A swing and a miss. I read a few reviews before undertaking a viewing & basically was told to ignore the reviews! I don't know what the script was trying to accomplish, but it did start out somewhat interesting enough with a bit of romance brewing between Cecilia Kass (Moss) & Adrian Gibson (Moss), who is a nerdy science-guy. Then, the story and the Gibson character peel off on unexpected (and unwelcome) tangents, and the movie sinks into a murky abyss. Leigh Whannell is the Director & Scriptwriter-so, I guess the blame should fall on his shoulders.The makeup work was good, and the acting was fine. There just wasn't a serviceable script to work from. This is the sort of example that guys who teach film-making school use to show what NOT to do with a story.",The Invisible Man

A that'll do kind of movie. The CGI is weak but that's to be expected as the movie feels half hearted. Cast are ok but no stand out performance, its hard to believe someone capable of creating an invisible suit would then find joy in opening and closing doors, switching lights on an off and just mess with an ex rather than actually do epic things with or get recognition for.. I'm sure it'll appeal to many but for me it was a bore. It tried to be smart but its very straight forward. The ending is pretty predictable. Just my opinion tho, a very forgettable film. Considering how long the movie has been on and off in production, you'd think they'd have added some flare or scare to the film but it's just long winded and at times, silly! Each to their own. Maybe if they'd got better cast it would have stood out abit more but as it is, it's very flat..",The Invisible Man
256,Bertaut,Starts brilliantly but ultimately undermines itself with plot contrivances and genre foolishness,4,14 March 2020,"H.G. Wells's original The Invisible Man (1897) suggests that rather than something as powerful as invisibility being used for the betterment of mankind, it would instead be used to fulfil private desires, ultimately leading to the moral corruption of otherwise good men. In probably the best cinematic adaptation, Hollow Man (2000), this is taken much further, with the suggestion that the results of invisibility would be nothing less than sexual violence, evil, and madness. However, despite the centrality of this theme in the core story, reframing the template as a tale of domestic abuse and PTSD, as happens in this latest adaptation, which focuses not on the male scientist but on a female victim of his, is a fascinating idea, creating the potential for some timely #MeToo social commentary, particularly as it relates to issues of not believing women who accuse powerful men of gaslighting. But potential only gets you so far, and what could have been a really insightful film eventually proves itself relatively incapable of using issues of domestic abuse as anything other than plot points to get from one predictable scare to the next.The film begins as Cecilia Kass (Elisabeth Moss) is putting into motion a plan to leave her domineering and abusive boyfriend, Adrian Griffin (Oliver Jackson-Cohen), a wealthy pioneer in optics. Having drugged him, she leaves their high-tech home in the middle of the night and is picked up nearby by her sister Emily (Harriet Dyer), who takes her to stay with their childhood friend, James Lanier (Aldis Hodge), a policeman living with his daughter Sydney (Storm Reid). Although assured that Adrian can't find her, Cecilia is clearly suffering from agoraphobia and paranoia. That is until Adrian commits suicide. Contacted by his brother Tom (Michael Dorman) who's handling his estate, Cecilia learns that Adrian has left her $5 million. However, despite her best efforts to move on, she just can't shake the feeling that Adrian is still around, watching her, sometimes even in the same room as her. And the surer she becomes that he's not dead, the more everyone else becomes worried about her mental well-being.Written and directed by Leigh Whannell, this latest adaptation of Wells's original is not actually about the invisible man. Indeed, short of a background shot of him lying in bed, a shot showing only his torso as he runs through a forest, and a close-up of his hand, actor Oliver Jackson-Cohen doesn't even appear on screen prior to his apparent suicide. Adrian is not only the invisible man of the plot, so too is his character ideologically invisible. Which makes its own statement, and it's a statement worth making - men like him don't need to be present to continue to cause harm. In this sense, at least initially, the film is more concerned with the fear Adrian has instilled in Cecilia; in the early stages, Cecilia's main enemy isn't Adrian so much her inability to move on from him. Along the same lines, the film looks at issues of how women who accuse powerful men of gaslighting are often ignored or openly disbelieved.Aesthetically, the film looks terrific, particularly Stefan Duscio's cinematography, into which is built Cecilia's paranoia. For example, countless scenes involve the camera panning away from her, moving across the room, showing us nothing at all, and then panning back. Ordinarily, this would be textbook unmotivated camera movement, but here it conveys how Cecelia fears there may be something in the corner to which we panned. And now, thanks to that camera pan, so do we. There are also many shots which in another film would be awful framing; isolating Cecilia in the frame and filling up so much of the screen's real-estate with empty negative space. Except, again, in this film, such negative space has an ominousness not applicable to regular thrillers. In this way, Whannell can instil fear and dread simply by pointing the camera at an empty room without the need for any FX, VFX, makeup, elaborate props etc (which no doubt played a significant role in keeping the budget down to a minuscule $7 million). And I'd be remiss if I didn't mention Moss's performance, which is excellent, especially given that so much of it is her on her own reacting to nothing whatsoever, having to communicate confusion, fear, anger etc through little more than her expression.Before talking about why I didn't like the film, however, I want to reiterate that I honestly can't say how much I admire the idea to reconstitute the genre template as a story about domestic violence. And it's an especially timely reconstitution, coming as it does in the era of #MeToo, when so many powerful men, once considered invisible in everything but name, able to perpetrate their crimes with impunity, have been revealed as the monsters they are. So I have no problem with the ideological paradigm shift. My problem is with the execution.For one thing, we know from the get-go that Cecilia isn't imagining things, that Adrian faked his suicide and is now stalking her whilst invisible. This isn't a twist, and the film makes no attempt to hide it. Granted, this is kind of unavoidable given how well-known the property is, but had the film allowed for even a little bit of ambiguity, it could have done wonders for emotional complexity, turning a story about invisibility into a story possibly about mental collapse. This would have effectively placed the audience in the same position as the other characters, doubting Cecilia's state of mind, which would, in turn, have enhanced the potency of the socio-political allegory. Another thing that bothered me is that in a film so focused on surveillance and privacy, there are several scenes where if there is even one functioning CCTV camera, the movie ends. A pivotal scene in a restaurant is an especially egregious example of this - one grainy image from a camera, and Cecilia can prove she's not going nuts and the whole plot unravels.However, my biggest problem is that what starts as a fascinating study of the lasting ramifications of domestic violence ultimately descends into genre stupidity, with a ridiculously over-the-top final act that says nothing of interest about anything. True, Hollow Man has a pretty over-the-top final act too, but Hollow Man never saw itself as anything other than a schlocky genre affair, whereas The Invisible Man clearly does. The fact that Whannell ultimately undermines himself in this way, deploying such important themes merely to get him to the gory dénouement, is especially frustrating insofar as he genuinely did originally seem to have some interesting things to say. Tied to this is that Adrian is introduced as such an abhorrent character from the start, void of nuance or subtlety. Domestic abusers aren't monotone evil-doers, oftentimes, they're very charming on the surface, and any film claiming to be a serious examination of this topic would make room to address this.Although The Invisible Man was very well reviewed and a huge box-office hit, it left me disappointed and frustrated. Initially positioning itself as an insightful allegory for the difficulty victims of domestic abuse have in moving on with their lives even after the abuser is gone, it eventually privileges genre beats and cheap thrills over emotional complexity. Which is a huge shame and a massively missed opportunity.",The Invisible Man
257,PetarNeo,Incredible horror theme inside classic story,9,24 March 2020,"Coming into this movie without any hopes and understanding what might come was the best thing to do because it was the best surprise that you might expect at the beginning of the year.Leigh Whannell presents us with a great knowledge about what anticipation, empty space, paranoid behavior and amazing leading actor can to to magnify effects of something that we expect to levels of unexpected. From designs to cinematography to smart story it just keeps on giving gifts and it will suck you like the same way you eat popcorn when things get tense keeping you wanting more and questioning every single thing.Elizabeth Moss is just perfect, there isn't a single thing that you might point out in her brilliant performance. From being freaked out to being frustrated to extraordinary bad things that keep on happening to her she just presents it all brilliantly.After some time movie might affect you the same way she is affected because of brilliant camera work and presentation of things that are there but aren't and it is freaking mad and enjoyable.Terror and tension are going through roof at some points and it will be chaotic, bloody, terrifying everything one horror lover wants to see and experience.Classic story told through eyes of Leigh and his touch of science was great if you come over some slight issues that present themselves along the way, but considering how movie is made and what it is about you will forget about them and that is what is all about focusing on what this movie does best and that is making you scared of empty space. 3.5/4",The Invisible Man
258,Lewis_Heather787,Visibly Brutal !!,8,29 February 2020,"I had huge expectations going into this film for two reasons. One, the trailer for this film was brilliant it sucked me in, immersed me in the world and the basis of the story, I was intrigued to say the least. The second reason being the director and writer of the film Leigh Whannell, who had astounded me a few years ago with the great Sci-Fi thriller ""Upgrade"". This film quickly shot up my most anticipated list of 2020.........so in some ways I was setting myself up for disappointment, however I am very glad to say that no I was not disappointment at all...........""The Invisible Man"" is a great film!!Lets start with the man in question Leigh Whannell, he has not only directed but written a truly gorgeously horrifying film........if that makes any sense. The directing in this film builds upon what he had shown in ""Upgrade"" only this time you can see this is with a little more budget. Flawless from start to finish , along with some great cinematography, production design and CGI this film is gorgeous to look at even in the most disgustingly uncomfortable brutal scenes.
The heart of this film tackles something extremely sensitive and very current in the world today and that is domestic abuse. Right as the film starts it drops you in at the deep end, with the main characters struggle of being in a abusive relationship she is trying to runaway from mental and physically. However her freedom doesn't last very long........ the idea of your abuser being invisible and stalking you is a truly horrifying idea. Even the thought of it gives me chills. Then to only go and start controlling her life again whilst invisible to everyone else, sending emails and hurting people she loves, this film is psychologically haunting. There are so many twists and turns throughout that left me gasping..............that doesn't happen very often!Fortunately this film doesn't have to rely on great CGI to keep you interested, the story and characters themselves are so intoxicating that you can't help but be absorbed by what is going on..........however the limited action and CGI used in this film is fantastic !! Couple all that with the films fantastic score and we really do have something that is elevated to another level!Another big big shoutout must be given to Elizabeth Moss who is simply incredibly in the lead role as Cecilia Kass. You can see the torment of the character just shown through her facial expressions , this is a really really honest look at what it is like to go through something like this. The film and Moss's performance do in no way either dramatise or over play the domestic abuse angle...........they show the destruction it can cause in someones life and the horrifying consequences you have to live through. I have personally never really like Elizabeth Moss as an actress but now I think I'll give her another chance because she was amazing to say the least.All in all I wasn't disappointed one bit and thought the film was really really good 85% out of 100 or 8.5 out of 10 , this is another home run for Leigh Whannell. I do truly think that this man could be the next Denis Villeneuve...........just let the man do whatever he wants to do because he obviously has talent !! ""Upgrade"" and now ""The Invisible Man""............I can't wait to see what he does next !!! This is a must see for fans of Horror, Thriller and Sc-Fi..............this film has a little bit of everything in it !!!!!!",The Invisible Man

It does a really good job setting up the story, the tension and the character of Cecilia. I liked that this was a different version of The Invisible Man and that it's focus was more on the victim and how he manipulates and terrorizes her and makes her question her own sanity. And Elizabeth Moss does a fantastic job. The movie is simple, yet effective with the scares and one legitimately surprised me. However, there is also some inconsistencies. For instance there is one scene, where she dumps paint on him (as shown in the trailers)...yet seemingly she reaches a point where she doesnt see paint on the floor anymore as though he stopped dripping paint, then she hears a faucet turn on and when she walks towards it, she sees paint in the basin. As though he washed it off. Well, why didnt she then see the paint being washed off? She tells a couple of people that she has proof, well if he's clearly overhearing this...why doesnt he then search his home to find out whats missing? He does catch her at his house the scene before...so wouldnt he put 2 and 2 together? Theres another thing as well in the 3rd act, but I dont want to give away the mechanics of how the invisibility works.Overall though, I thought it was very good. Not overly scary imo but effectively thrilling.",The Invisible Man

265,TuesdayThe17th,Leigh Whannell's passion is quite visible,8,28 May 2020,"""The Invisible Man"" is the third film directed by Whannell yet he is an extremely seasoned horror veteran and is one of the bigger icons of the genre. An auteur by nature, he seemed to at least have creative control over the substance of this movie and everything that went on screen, similarly to his previous movies. Though this is a really good movie, that's also just what hampers it: the substance. The structure of this movie is odd to say the least. The substance seems a bit melodramatic and although it keeps you interested, the movie almost feels more like a drama than a horror while none of the genres listed on imdb for the film are drama. This is a mature horror film. There aren't a ton of kill scenes but there is enough violence overall. There is one part where a large sum of people are attacked but the number of casualties is few to none. The mystery here is engaging but also very see through. There are basically no secrets, but there is drive to see what comes next. Leigh Whannell is an extremely talented writer and director and he is passionate about film. This is all clear as ""The Invisible Man"" is a straight shot of quality filmmaking. You cant knock the dude for much because you still feel the passion for the craft regardless of this films outcome. It was good. Very good. Not great. As much of a fan I am of Whannell I honestly can't see why this movie has garnered a rating higher than 7.0 but then again im glad the rating is so high. It deserves it. He deserves it.

269,kingofdanerds,Possibly one of the best (and scariest) films of 2020,10,5 October 2020,"The Invisible Man was a novel written in 1897 by H.G. Wells (who wrote The Time Machine and War of the Worlds). Since the novel has been written, many films and shows have been created but the most recent one is the 2020 film, The Invisible Man. The Invisible Man was released in early 2020 (around the time of the global pandemic). The Invisible Man was a box office and critical hit. The Invisible Man notably stars Elisabeth Moss but the rest of the cast (to me at least) is largely unknown. The film was directed by Leigh Whannell and was produced by Jason Blum. Yes, this is a standalone film and not apart of this Universal's Dark Universe which will never happen thanks to 2017's The Mummy. Also do keep in mind that this film is a modern interpretation (much like 2005's War of the Worlds).The film follows Cecilia (played by Elisabeth Moss) who is in a bad relationship with this guy named Adrian. She leaves him one night and barely escapes. Adrian is a smart guy and works with optics and stuff and supposedly kills himself after Cecilia left him. Cecilia feels that she can be happy now that Adrian is gone but that might not be the case.I had a really good feeling about this film when the trailer came out. The film looked scary enough and when it came time to watch this film, I was blown away. First of all, the acting is absolutely amazing. Elisabeth Moss gives an amazing performance. It was a very believeable performance. Her appearance and everything works with what the film is trying to portray. You want someone who looks insanse? You got it! The other performances are really good to. There is this one waiter dude who was really entertaining to watch even though he had one tiny scene in the film! The horror in this film is just amazing. This film uses suspense very effectively and can make scenes truly creepy and scary. There will be scenes where nothing happens but the setup makes it seem that way and it just builds on to the suspense and the cinematography is great here. The scary part is the horror that we cannot see. Which is what H.G. Wells had in mind when writing the source material. With that being said, the Invisible Man himself is truly frightening. A minor complait here though is that it is obviously CGI. It is not bad but very noticeable. The whole setup for this film works very well. We have a woman who is treated like she is crazy and everything just goes downhill in her life to the point where her life is on the edge of being completely ruined. It is a very believeable setup and everything here makes sense and is pretty straightforward. Even to the Invisible Man. What we learn about him, makes absolute sense. When the ending came around, I was not too sure about whether I like it or not. But, I have since decided that I like it because it just works. Plus it somewhat makes sense because of another film to be released as well.The Invisible Man 2020 is possibly the best film of 2020. It is also one of my new favorite horror films of all time.

281,hunter-friesen,'The Invisible Man' is one to see,7,6 April 2020,"""The Invisible Man"" opens on a secluded waterfront mansion. Inside of it, Cecilia Kass is executing her plan to run away from her abusive boyfriend, Adrian. She successfully escapes, but not without Adrian running after her in a violent fury.A few weeks after her departure, Cecilia is notified that Adrian has committed suicide. Her relief of his demise doesn't last long as a series of coincidences begin to take shape. Cecilia starts to hear noises and has the constant feeling she is being watched. After some time, she discovers that Adrian isn't dead, but invisible. He's gaslighting her into submission, playing vicious tricks around the house and tormenting others connected to her. With no one believing her situation, Cecilia must work to defend herself and the people she loves from unseen harm.As the writer/director behind several horror franchises such as ""Saw"" and ""Insidious,"" Leigh Whannell once again proves his chops here.He commands the material with his expert use of the camera and lighting. A multitude of slow pans and still shots imbue each scene with a lingering sense of terror that never ceases to grab hold of you. The dark, shadowy lighting puts a magnifying glass on Cecilia's isolation as she battles her internal and external demons.And because the assailant cannot be seen, Whannell also relies on some expert sound design that is similar to the style used in ""A Quiet Place."" Silence is the most abundant and effective sound device as it fills the gaps between the creaks and rumbles. It becomes clear throughout that hearing nothing is much scarier than hearing something.But what Whannell can be respected for most is his refusal to stoop to jump scares, especially considering the story allows for that. Sure, a jump scare here or there would have jolted some energy into the often overly-slow pacing, but Whannell's insistence on taking the high road makes for a more complete horror experience.Of course, the concept of someone turning themself invisible is a little silly. The movie doesn't totally defend against that criticism either, only mustering a quick line about how Adrian was ""a leader in the field of optics."" However, once you get past that barrier of disbelief, you'll open yourself up to what this movie has to offer under the hood.The script for ""The Invisible Man,"" penned by Whannell himself, has more on its mind than just scares. The movie does a great job of conveying the torment and aftermath that an abusive relationship can have on someone. Cecilia, as a character, is given a full arc as we follow her journey of slow recovery from beginning to end. This added layer brings a deeper meaning that is both used to educate about a serious topic and make the horror material pack a bigger punch.Portraying our heroine is the commanding Elisabeth Moss. It's another unhinged performance similar to her previous roles in ""Her Smell"" and ""The Handmaid's Tale."" Moss's all-in attitude helps suspend our disbelief of the material and grounds her character in the real-world. She's utterly believable in even the most bewildering of situations and carries the emotional weight of the film.Commendable supporting performances come from both Aldis Hodge as a sympathetic detective and Michael Dorman as Adrian's brother, Tom.Through inventive storytelling and craftsmanship, Leigh Whannell and Elisabeth Moss have quite possibly created the definitive version for this ludicrous premise. Released in a time of year infamous for forgettable horror movies, it's a breath of fresh air to see quality original content have its time to shine.",The Invisible Man
282,arabnikita,Could have been better,6,29 February 2020,"Ghost movies are scary because we can't see the source of fear and stalker movies are scary because the source of fear is real. Here the person is very much real and as you might have guessed it, you can't see him and while the premise might seem simplistic, the end product might surprise you. This movie works best if you are able to put yourself in the shoes of Elizabeth Moss and try to imagine how terrifying it would be to be terrorized by a real human being while not being able to tell anyone about it.While it starts of rather well with a number of good stalking sequences that made me scan the entire screen trying to spot the man, the overall feeling towards the end left me unfulfilled. Despite the predictability of the plot, the movie itself is an enjoable experience if you like stalking thrillers as it has solid music and camera work. Moss is great as she is able to capture the paranoia combined with the despair of no one believing her. What I found impressive about the film is how seemingly easy it is to tear down a person's life if one knows which buttons to press.",The Invisible Man
283,FKDZ,"Excellent, will keep you hooked for 2 hours.",8,20 November 2020,"I had pretty high expectations going into this movie as I already heard a bunch of positive comments about it and thankfully it met those expectations. This is probably one of the best movies I've seen in recent years in regards of ''jaw dropping moments''. And not in the jaw dropping way of kills or gore, there's very little of that, but for certain moments that just left me gasping.Now by itself these moments might not make that much impact except for the exceptional acting and writing in this movie which makes you care so much for pretty much every character. These two things were the key to really grabbing your attention and taking you along. The one that caught me off guard the most was the sister in the restaurant, and it was such a heartbreaking kill as well. Mainly again because this movie made you care it really sucked to see her die like that. Once this happens the movie really turned and went all in and it was a exciting ride until the end. That said, the movie does not wait around to long to get things started which I really liked. I think about 30 minutes in iirc the stalking starts.The directing is really solid as well and definitely utilizes the concept of their being a presence really well in its shots, most if not all the shots are very wide, and you always have that notion that something me be standing in that empty space over there. That said, I felt like there were some missed opportunities regarding showing the presence of the invisible man, it has a few key moments, but in general I felt myself wanting a few more tiny clues, like drapes moving from the wind created by moving around, or just tiny moments you might not even notice. This might've made it too obvious though, but I missed a bit of paranoia or anxiety that the main character obviously experienced. This movie isn't really scary, the only things that will scare you are the obvious loud jumpscares in a very quiet movie but besides that there's nothing disturbing or scary. Which leads me to the invisible man himself, obviously just an invisible man isn't really scary so turning it into a scary thriller is pretty tough, there's no emotion to play with from the antagonist.Now the antagonist, also brilliantly acted although not as many lines as I've wanted. I would've loved to see a bit more of him as a person, to really get to see that narcissistic sociopath.There's a few plot holes/gaps that I wasn't that happy about. First off was the complete lack of narrative behind Adrian manipulating Tom into possibly murdering a cop's kid for him. All we know about Tom is that he's the brother and doesn't'' have a spine, but he does almost manage to kill a kid and manages to knock out a buff cop. Though the plot twist that came from this was something I did not expect at all and worked really well so.. maybe when he was in the suit he should've been more clumsy or nervous, something to notice something's slightly off. Another gap is how Cecilia manages to go to the bathroom, sneak into the wardrobe across the room, change into the suit, kill adrian and after like 10 seconds come out fully dressed again. It felt like a few too many things were once again left out just so that twist would work. So there are som sacrifices regarding the great twists that are a bit annoying but nothing too major.The soundtrack is fantastic as well, uses a ton of silence but when the music is there it's used really well and its damn good.The CGI was ... almost okay. It was noticeable, not bad, but you'd know instantly, at least I did. So I wished some more practical stuff was used. Like for example the invisible man throws over a table, and they made the table CGI whilst it could've been done practical and look a lot less distracting. Especially the animation was off on that.The ending was good. adrian got outsmarted by a thankfully competent protagonist. Like I said before they cut a bit too much near the end for the twist but all in all it worked.8/10 definitely recommend.",The Invisible Man

287,lnvicta,As good as a modern Invisible Man movie can be.,8,24 March 2020,"Leigh Whannell is not a subtle filmmaker - at least, that's what I used to think. The Saw and Insidious movies are over-the-top and shocking, which is fine, and I enjoyed Upgrade quite a bit, but I was afraid the Invisible Man would fall into the same trap of shock-value over substance. Thankfully, I was wrong.From the opening scene, the movie sucks you in with tension and unease. Cecilia (Elizabeth Moss) is trying to escape from her abusive boyfriend while he is asleep, and with practically no dialogue or exposition, we immediately understand the situation and feel for Moss' character. She's trapped in an abusive relationship and fears for her life. It's a testament to Whannell's deliberate direction, using visual cues to give us the information we need while slowly ratcheting up the suspense. The movie is not reliant on jump scares. There are a few, but they're 100% earned and actually effective because we care about the characters. The excellent score helps add to the atmosphere, alternating between pulsating ambience and melancholy orchestral bits.From the concise writing, likable characters, clever directing, a powerhouse lead performance, and a genuinely scary villain, The Invisible Man gets just about everything right. I suppose you could nitpick some of the logic, but that's missing the point. It's a film about gaining freedom from a toxic relationship, and Whannell knows exactly how to pace the story so that we don't spend too much time dwelling on potential plot holes. Overall, a gripping and expertly crafted psychological thriller.",The Invisible Man

After being found dead, Kass' boyfriend is seemingly haunting her, leaving her being presumed mentally insane. When horror films works a plot through thoroughly, it sometimes takes the edge of the film, and the only reliable sources of actual horror sensation are the jump scares.

The invisible man is traditionally psychologically imbalanced by his condition but this begins with a question, what's been going on?Out sympathies are initially with Cecillia as the film initially seems to follow the ""#metoo"" format of many horror films these days.

295,bastille-852-731547,Serviceable thriller remake,6,29 February 2020,"I really like the original ""Invisible Man"" movie, and was hoping that this remake would bring a fresh update of this classic movie monster. I never saw Leigh Whannell's previous movie, ""Upgrade,"" but am aware that he is well-respected among fans of genre films. As a result, I was hoping that this would be a unique and contemporary endeavor. While the film isn't terrible by any means, it's unfortunately not too special either.In this remake, Elisabeth Moss plays a professional reeling from a traumatic and abusive relationship. She finds herself being haunted by an invisible man who seems to be her ex. The film has a very strong opening scene that uses both cinematography and suspense extremely well, but unfortunately goes a bit downhill from there. The characters are decently well-developed, but you still never really feel for most of them. The film's script is a bit of a mixed bag, with decent dialogue and pacing but a rather formulaic plot structure and a number of rather pointless scenes. To his credit, Whannell uses sound design effectively and appropriately to generate genuine suspense at times. He even uses jump-scares very well (and I normally don't like those.) The score is also generally pretty good and impactful. Despite his best efforts at suspense, the film itself isn't all that memorable because it is so easy to see where it is going after the first few scenes. The attempts at plot twists and foreshadowing end up falling flat. Like ""Knives Out"" and ""Joker"" (two other well-received films that I was more mixed on than many people,) the movie thinks it's more creative and clever than it actually is. 6/10Note: I saw the film in Dolby Cinema. In terms of presentation quality, this might be one of my best Dolby Cinema experiences, right up there with ""Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse.""

It isn't a chick flick per se - but most of the negative reviews will come from men as the male characters are only there to sell the progress of the heroine.I think it is fairly brauvera storytelling despite this, with enough of a twist to guide you away from the few logistical plot holes.

Ridiculous things actors say or do that seem completely unnatural because the writers don't know how else to tell the story.The breakfast scene was painful. The food catching alight in a matter of seconds... I ALWAYS fry on high heat and that's never happened to me. Considering everything else is happening in slow-mo why speed this up? Why put out the fire but not turn off the gas? How did that kitchen have no damage?The movement of the invisible man. Completely impossible. All angles are covered yet he manages to evade three people in a room and still make no noise at all? The one puff of air outside, how could he possibly be next to her all that time and not breathe or shiver like she was?Her sisters reaction to the email.

Wouldn't she have found it out of character? Wouldn't she have called her as soon as she read it to ask what the hell? Wouldn't she have found it all a bit odd and wanted an explanation?By this point I was done. I couldn't sit through any more. a quick flick through to find the lame twist, which was already obvious, and to find out that the invisibility was down to a suit... an impossibly quiet suit...The Invisible Man deserves a decent movie in the current world of amazing CGI and countless great directors.

302,Condemned-Soul,A smartly directed horror thriller from Leigh Whannell,8,21 March 2020,"Leigh Whannell's frightening reimagining of Universal's 'The Invisible Man' provides an answer as to what's worse than a narcissistic, abusive sociopath - an invisible one.Wasting no time to engage viewers' nerves, the opening sequence smartly illustrates Cecilia's predicament with her abusive partner. The extent of her torment is conveyed through not only Elizabeth Moss's nervous performance, but through the limitations of her prison - a house overlooking the sea, bordered by high walls, and positioned in the middle of nowhere to highlight her isolation and desperation. When she finally gets away, she hopes that'll be the end of it, but her partner is the nastiest of villains who'll do anything to continue ruining her life.What follows is a deliberately paced nightmare of building up an atmosphere laden with dread. The invisible man taunts her, humiliates her, attacks her, attacks others... anything to exert full control over his victim. And it's scary because it feels believable despite the science fiction element. The camera leers around corners, teasing us with his POV; the jump scares are effective, relevant to the plot; and the violence is shocking, whether domestic or otherwise. And Elizabeth Moss brilliantly embraces the role, forcing us to imagine the level of cruelty she's already endured.Writer/director Leigh Whannell adeptly funnels us through the experience of an abused victim without succumbing to cliches. The action sequences are unusual but masterfully choreographed, and the sound design is loud and disturbing, frequently puncturing horror sequences and adding to the images on screen.

At first, I thought that Adrian actually committed suicide and haunts Cecilia as a ghost or spirit. As the story progressed, it was revealed that Adrian is in fact alive and used his tech invention to haunt Cecilia. The costume which is made completely out of surveillance cameras was insanely creepy and sent shivers down my spine.This horror movie didn't have a shortage of jump scares. In fact, I remember quite vividly how I jumped up frighteningly in multiple scenes. Despite the movie having a small budget (7 million USD), it did not disappoint and left me in a precarious place.The opening title card of the movie was quite awesome. Granted, it was short and unimportant, but made the movie a tiny bit more intriguing for me.Elizabeth Moss shines in this movie. She portrayed her character Cecilia perfectly. The actress perfectly encapsulates the character's mannerisms, facial expressions, feelings of insecurity and paranoia and the emotional pain of having been in a abusive relationship. I'm guessing quite a few women and perhaps men can relate to her character and understand her frustrations.To conclude, this movie had a compelling plot and the twists were surprising and unprecedented. The final scene was a little anticlimactic, but still satisfying. ""The Invisible Man"" is a great horror flick to watch on the big screen, as it has plenty of jump scares and quite a disturbing and gruesome scene halfway through the middle act.",The Invisible Man

Its every bit as riveting as the H.G. Wells original book of 1837 and, the 1933 B&W film starring Claude (the policeman in the classic 1942 ""Casablanca"") Rains as ""The Invisible One/The Invisible Man"".Elisabeth Moss is very believable as the victim and in my opinion carries the film solidly; although everyone involved also plays their roles perfectly...she just has that tense edge to her portrayal! There are a couple of actions that I noticed that would just be physically impossible to do...unless you had the speed of Bruce Lee etc (they would be spoilers if I mentioned them but, I am pretty sure many of you will work out what the 2 actions are). Neither spoils the film in any way and you won't be disappointed should you decide to watch this tasty offering! I don't think its very Sci-Fi or horror orientated, as some have it advertised, rather its just a good glue you to your seat mystery.Its great to see a good strong film that relies purely on its cast of actors to deliver the goods. South Korean and Chinese actors manage to do this all the time.

The story is so cleverly woven that there is not a moment you're taken out of the movie because of something stupid that was said or some shark jumping.You feel as trapped and backed into a corner as Elizabeth Moss' character does. It is very easy for anyone to feel for the character or imagine themselves in that situation. There's no magic or mysticism here, it's so realistic that you understand and get why everyone around her act and react the way they do, because you most likely would have reacted the same.The shots and the score strikes the right tone, the acting is on point, Moss, Hodge, Reid, Griffin, Dyer, and Jackson-Cohen are amazing. It's not a big cast but they make this movie feel big. It is a smart movie well worth your time and very well made.",The Invisible Man
313,theredsky,The Invisible Man Review,6,1 March 2020,"I was genuinely surprised that a horror movie like this early in 2020 didn't suck. Most studios just throw out really bad horror movies in January and February just to get rid of them. The Invisible Man is the rare exception. While a had a lot of issues with the film, it still was a very solid effort and did the one thing a horror movie should do, be scary. The film's biggest trait is that it does not rely on cheap jumpscares. It instead relies on a natural build up of tension that pays off with an interesting and unique scare. The film also doesn't continuously use the same type of scare. Some horror movies will continuously use the scary face trope to get a reaction but The Invisible Man doesn't. Each scare is unique in its own way. I won't spoil any of them because they are quite creepy and need to be seen and not explained. Elisabeth Moss does a great job in this film. She is able to communicate this sense of loneliness while being surrounded by everyone and was able to convey the emotions of fear, sadness, and joy in a natural yet intentionally creepy way. The rest of the cast does a fine job but really don't compare to Moss. The only thing holding her performance from being top notch is the screenplay. Some of the lines of dialogue were very awkward and took away from some scenes because of how corny or lame they were. That didn't happen throughout the whole movie but when it did, it was noticeable. The rest of the film's technical aspects were pretty good. The direction from Leigh Whannell was unique and interesting and the cinematography was pretty great. Each shot was visually interesting and had something to offer. The way they shot some of the scenes was great. Exchanges were shot from many different points of view and the camera was able to spin around and follow characters exact movements during action sequences. One technical aspect I took issue with was the score. While the actual composition of the music was good, the repetitiveness of it was a little irritating. The film kept using the same song for more intense scenes and it got distracting after a while. It didn't delve into different ways to use music for scenes with high amounts of tension and I really wish it had done that. The film also has a lot of plot inconsistencies and dumb character decisions. One such inconsistency that isn't spoiler related is when a car crashes. The front of the car is really banged up but it's shown less than a minute later and it's completely fixed. Overall, The Invisible Man is a mostly smart horror movie with a great lead performance, story, direction, and cinematography but is almost undermined by a weak screenplay, plot inconsistencies, and dumb character decisions.",The Invisible Man
314,joelgodinho,A pleasant surprise,7,9 December 2020,"Invisible Man (2020)
Invisible Man is a 2020 horror film directed by Leigh Whanell and starring Elizabeth Moss, Aldis Hodge and Oliver Jackson Cohen.This is a really good film, when I first watched the trailer I wasn't particularly excited, it honestly just looked like a mediocre horror film but this turned out to be great. It's incredibly suspenseful especialy in the outstanding first scene that gets us on edge right at the beginning of the fim and also later on when Cee is left alone in the house after Adrian hits Sydney.The acting is pretty good and I really like Elizabeth Moss as Cecilia, even though her career has had a boom recently this is honestly the only film I have seen with her.Finally I absolutely love the futuristic set design, particularly in Adrian's mansion.7.6/10",The Invisible Man

Genre film that will make people talk over the years and become a classic like its predecessors. Elizabeth Moss is simply talented, disturbing, precise and meticulous in the representation of her character; among other things, accompained by a perfect and substantial soundtrack that never misses the opportunity to highlight every gesture and every perfect shot. Exemplary direction, limpid, simple and perfect, which plays a lot on psychology, on the very concept on which the story itself is based.

By saying this movie is 7, I'm trying not to insult it or director and keep it within the IMDB curve, since rating system is ruined by the people who don't understand the point of rating something on the scale from 1-10.Movies today lack the substance to be rated on such a large scale and imdb should change rating sistem to 1-5. To rate something on 1-10 you need much more elements and movies today simply do not offer that depth anymore.This movie should be 5 or 6 on IMDB scale, Parasite should be 3, Inception should be 10, Terminator should be 5 and so on.

318,WatchedAllMovies,Entertaining but not logical,6,23 December 2020,"Like many scary movies, the protagonist was made slightly stupid to fit the plot.
For example, if if a crime happened near you and the criminal put the weapon in your hand, why would you hold on to it for everyone to see? And if nobody believes the strange things that's happening around you, why not put up security cameras or try to gather evidence somehow?And later on in the movie, the protagonist suddenly changed from an abused woman personality, into an aggressive violent person. Real people just don't switch like this. While this makes for an entertaining movie, it is not very believable and is maybe written by a lazy script writer.This seems like a low budget movie, as none of the actors are familiar faces. Even the main character is plain looking and looks like she could use more makeup.Another thing, if you invent an invisible suit, wouldn't you keep track of how many units you made, and perhaps lock them up or make them not usable without a key or password? Apparently, the inventor is too stupid to think of this.The movie succeeds in being scary and has a good pace.

From the beginning, the mood was set and it was pretty tense. It held its own throughout the film with some neat little twists and turns.Cecilia was pretty good in her role and one could really relate to her situation. In fact, I really felt sorry for her at times!I thought it was a pretty solid film and consistently gripping. I liked the unexpected twists and turns, the plot was clever and the filming was good.I was hovering between a 7 and an 8, but after watching the film, I thought to myself, ""Yeah, I liked this film a lot!"" so gave it an 8.

Around halfway through the story turns away from a suspenceful psychological thriller and shapes itself into a rather generic, mainstream, twisty and predictable piece.After seeing this I thought the movie works because of Elisabeth Moss's work as lead actress. Her Cecilia is present in almost evey scene and her acting range, her connection to the character and her talent is what elevates this film a couple steps above your typical low-budget thriller. Also speaking of budget, the film is VERY good looking for just a 7 million. I've had some fun with this, I wish it could have gone a different path but it's what it is I guess.",The Invisible Man

326,haydenluz,The Invisible Man,7,14 April 2020,"The Invisible Man was orignated by H.G Wells in 1897, brought to life in 1933, and now remade in 2020 by the director of Upgrade, & Insidious 3, Leigh Whannell. Whannell had his hand all over this production, taking over the producing & the screenwriting, while also directing. Let me just say, I'm not the biggest horror film guy, but Leigh Whannell can make a damn good horror film! His direction had great lingering, rotational camera work, with great camera suggestion. With the concept at hand, it leaves you thinking ""did I just see something?""The story line was very focused, while having a few open ended re-writes, with some great twists. He sharpened all the classic sci-fi/horror/thriller genre tools, creating this edge of your seat thriller! Whannell had you guessing at all times, while the audience is trying to connect the pieces that just don't seem to fit. The way Leigh Whannell wraps everything up, is nothing short of genius! He makes you rethink everything that's happened, leaving great conversation for after the film.The very talented Elisabeth Moss KILLS her performance! Her emotions are beautifully sold, making it easy to be able to get behind her. Aldis Hodge came out of no where at first, but ended up being a decent addition, being kind-hearted, and somewhat funny as well. Storm Reid was really nothing more than another plot device, but she made the most out of her screen time, showing believable emotions and reactions. Michael Dorman & Oliver Jackson-Cohen, we're basically cut from the same cloth. They were both diabolical, sly & mischievous. They both put on good performances, making you feel some type of negative way towards them. My only issue with the characters; it seemed like they came out of nowhere, leaving us to infer where they came from, for the most part. Essentially it works, but I just would've liked a little more on all of our characters, besides our lead, because she gets more than enough enjoyable characterization.The cinematography by Stefan Duscio had a very deep and dark tone to it. Each scene was beautifully lit by either natural lighting, or from a single light source, creating this eerie tone. Not only was the CGI done very well, but their practical effects felt so real, it made you feel like you were in the movie, backed up with INSANE sound mixing, and a creepy and dark score.Though I really enjoyed this movie, I did have a few notable nitpicks. It's inevitable to have convenient scenes, and imbalances, especially with a horror film, but there was just a few too many, leading into a few plot gaps, with the logic that you needed to buy into. For a film that talks about cameras for a decent portion, some things could've easily been solved by security cameras.Overall, if you take this film too seriously, you may not enjoy it in it's entirely, but I found it to be a blast, with decent scares, a solid narrative, and a great ending.",The Invisible Man

328,sakram,An interesting take with many issues and flaws.,7,11 January 2021,"I went into this movie with the right expectations. I enjoyed every minute of it and it hooked me right to the end. The end is satisfactory. But this movie has so many unaddressed problems which puts a little bit too much mud over it hence my giving it a Seven.One of the biggest problems is the lack of logic. Throughout many scenes, certain mechanics/stunts would never ever work in real life given those certain circumstances. To put it subtly without spoiling, I hate when movies think of Kitchen Knives as the sharpest thing in the world, and they're ""cut-throat"" potential. In fact, that can never be the case. No matter how sharp they are, they're never made to be ""Skin-severing"" as that goes against the International Standards.That aside, the CGI looks a bit sketchy at times, and a little bit off, some scenes are completely useless, and the plot would've been much better towards the end.Nevertheless, a quite enjoyable movie that had so much potential yet didn't use half of it. 7/10.

I didn't quite get halfway through before I couldn't wait any longer for something to actually happen. I had assumed that this would be some kind of homage to the original classic, with some FX made possible in this modern age. What I found instead was a disjointed mess with a truly irritating lead actress and a fairly inept supporting cast. Plot holes galore, stupid moves, you name it. Another thing; I kept being distracted by the lead's too-white front teeth. They're obviously not real, and probably expensive, so why not choose natural looking ones? Anyway, if they just wanted to make money with this, I guess it succeeded, because it only cost seven million to make, (only? I can remember when that was a lot of money) and they took in a lot more than that. So, a lot of disappointed people walking around.

I have always been blind to European and American actors, and I am not sure if I have seen other works before. As far as the work of ""Invisible Man"" is concerned, the acting skills of the heroine really make me feel amazing. At the beginning of the film, the hostess took advantage of her husband's deep sleep to carry out her planned escape journey. Even her husband's deep sleep was the sleeping medication she had taken in advance in the water he drank. The escape process, as the audience is familiar with, will inevitably be a little bumpy. When escaping to the garage, a vehicle alarm was touched, but fortunately, it was successful to escape all the way from the seaside high-rise villa to the city road.

Its also the way the film is done with the camera work so well done it make you paranoid just watching it. Its the way it doesnt just stick with the characters the camera would pan across the room and stop at a certain point giving the impression that something or someone is in the room, it clever filming because you make you throughout the film watching every corner, corridor and doors making your paranoid which put you in the shoe of Cecilia Kass (Elisabeth).I've gotta say this film is not afraid to go to places where it gets extremely dark and extremely intense, with some Gory as hell scenes with some creepy as hell moments that really set the tone for this film.The visual effects are Spot on as well, so you might be thinking this will be just another Poor execute film but you miss this one your be missing out of a fantasy film that really keeps you on the edge.This is a new take on a classic universal monster that you will not want to miss and it's definitely worthy of going to see in the theater, especial with it psychological tone that will keep you on edge and the dark undertone of the story giving an amazing performance throughout that you will be watch you own home for a while after.Dislikes: There are some part of the film if you go in with logical thinking, that these small parts might be a little disbelieve-able but as a whole the film is good.",The Invisible Man

This movie is the winner of 2020 I've been looking forward to. I've been following the talent behind the film director from ""Update"". I've also been following Oliver Jackson Cohen from the time he starred in ""Man in An Orange Shirt""(of which he did splendidly so if you haven't seen this film yet, put on your must watch) I discovered the versatility of this very outstanding actor. I can't tell you how scratched my dvd is by watching ""Man in the Orange shirt"" -yes its one of those film you will watch multiple time. This actor is a breath of fresh air. I';ve heard of Elizabeth Moss, but I'm glad I feel like I've truly discovered how talented this actress is. This movie kept me at the edge of my seat the entire time waiting to see what would happen next. I watch this film in a huge theatre totally packed! The audience jumped in unison many times over and were gasping in aw. It's a nail biting experience that does not let up. The beauty of this film is that it is a very fresh take on one of Universal's jewels. And the premise is very plausible in today's technology driven society. I'm watching this film again over the weekend. I know this film is destined to be a cash cow for Universal and a star maker for Oliver Jackson Cohen because he's done several independents, but I think they will remember him and he will become a household name after this film. Elizabeth Moss this film will take you places. To the director, I can't wait to see what he does next, because I'll be there to watch! twenty stars out of five for this film.

This isn't a massive issue with the film, in my opinion.My major issue with this film was the lack of character depth and charisma of the villain. He just didn't come off as a character that you could understand the motives of. The ladder half of the film has some events that happen and you dont particularly feel anything when this man is involved. I believe this film would have benefitted a ton from having a more charismatic actor, along with a compelling back story for his character. When the invisible man is on screen, or not on screen I should say, he is an amazing villain and very creepy.

Would a billionaire genius who looks like Oliver Jackson-Cohen (""The Invisible Man"") have to pull such elaborate schemes to knock-up a woman? Why was The Invisible Man so obsessed with his bland, unappealing and uninteresting girlfriend (played by Elisabeth Moss)? Instead of a fake suicide/kidnapping plot, why didn't The Invisible Man just rely solely on his invisibility suit to stalk and drive his runaway girlfriend mad? Why did he repeatedly violently attack his pregnant girlfriend? What if she miscarried the kid he so desperately wanted? Why did his girlfriend casually expose the invisibility suit, she used to kill him, to her police friend? Who kills themselves by slashing their own neck?

It would have looked better if you saw the strings holding up the gun...The 'suspence music' was cringe worthy, it spoiled the scenes, it was either too over dramatic and loud or too loooong and unnecessary. It really did spoil the scenes.The storyline had plot holes galore, which I won't spoil for the reader..The acting was good, and I've gave it an extra star for that, but overall, the movie was just boring and dull and cringy and too long.",The Invisible Man

356,garethvk,A Genre Defining Example Of Making A Quality Horror Film,9,27 February 2020,"Cecilia Kass (Elizabeth Moss) is a woman living in fear. Despite living a life of wealth and privilege in a seaside home; she is ready to take drastic steps in her life.
Cecilia is trying to escape from her controlling and abusive husband who despite being considered a wealthy genius in the field of Optics; has made her life a living hell and forces her to make a daring escape that has her barely getting away with the help of her sister Alice (Harriett Dyer).
The film picks up two weeks later where Cecilia is hiding with a friend of her sister Officer James Lanier (Aldis Hodge) and his daughter Sydney (Storm Reid). Cecilia is scared to even leave the house and do simple tasks such as checking the mailbox and is livid when her sister comes to visit as she is sure that her husband will find her by tracking her Sister.
Alice informs Cecilia that her husband has killed himself and she is now free to live without fear. Cecilia gets a letter informing her that she is to receive 100K a month to the sum of five million dollars as part of her husband's will. The fact that nobody should have her mailing address does seem odd to her as does that fact that the estate is being handled by her ex's brother Tom (Michael Dorman).
With her new wealth Cecilia gifts James and also sets up a school fund for Sydney and begins to emerge from her shell.
It is around this time that unusual things begin to happen to her. A lost item from the night of her escape shows up and a mysterious kitchen fire starts. Cecelia also wakes up to find the covers off the bed and what appears to be something unseen standing on the blankets when she attempts to pull them up.
When she expresses her concerns to James that her husband is alive and exacting revenge, both he and Tom ignore her and when things begin to escalate, Cecilia is the one who starts to look more and more unstable as the tormenting continues and her life spins out of control.The film is Written and Directed by Leigh Whannell who rose to prominence as one of the co-creators of the ""SAW"" franchise. The film is the perfect example of how to do a film of this sort as it is very clever in how it is paced and allows for the suspense to build without relying on many of the standard Horror Film staples.The film is also good about having things happen before it pulls back so it is not an extended series of intense moments but several incidents between the tension and setup.The cast is very good and what is amazing is that the film was made for a $7 million dollar budget yet looks every bit of a major studio film.There are some interesting twists along the way as while I was able to predict two of them; the others were a very nice surprise.
It is so refreshing to see a film like this come along as in many ways it can help redefine the Horror genre and proves that you can make a quality movie that is also scary and intense.I for one hope we see more from this franchise in the near future.4.5 stars out of 5.",The Invisible Man

(Celebration by Kool and the Gang plays)",9,1 April 2020,"Not only is it a good remake, I'd say it's the best Universal Monster movie since Creature from the Black Lagoon! This remake is very different from the original 1933 film as well as the HG Wells novella it was loosely based on so purists may still be unhappy with this movie, but I'm all for updates to the classics (that's pretty much what the original films were, they're almost nothing like the original books) so it didn't bother me at all. The Invisible Man updates the story in very clever ways that I won't spoil here and it gives a sci-fi horror twist to a relevant story about an abusive relationship. Nobody sees it happening and nobody believes the main character when she tells people about it. Huh. The lead performance from Elisabeth Moss (yes, I'm spelling her name correctly this time) is fantastic, and this movie is SCARY! The original 1933 film was very effects-heavy with a lot of comedy. In this, there is no comedy to be found and the effects are very minimal, but even if the movie is showing you nothing it makes you feel the presence of an evil figure lurking around using only framing, sound design and Elisabeth Moss' performance. There are tons of tense and creative sequences (very similar to the director's last film, Upgrade) and a ton of suspense. You never know when the titular character is going to show up next and it keeps you on the edge of your seat! I think the movie was a little too fast-paced, the buildup to what's really going on could've been slower and more effective, and the score can be loud and overbearing at times, but overall I thought this movie was excellent. This is a must-see for any horror fan or fan of the classics! I'm so happy this movie is a hit and we'll be getting more movies like it! I can't wait, this is going to be awesome. The Universal Monsters are back and I couldn't be more happy. The director of this wants to do a remake of Dracula and James Wan is producing a Frankenstein remake, among a ton of other projects in development. Yes. All the yes. Give them to me.

But it's the so stupid it's funny as hell kind of terrible.,4,12 October 2020,"Another big budget Hollywood thriller about a genius, and adapted for the screen by a moron. This movie is so stupid that it's funny as all hell. It's just so hard to believe that anyone could dream up such crap, and that some people would actually think it's good. It is good, good for a few laughs actually. It was so stupid funny that it reminded me a lot of some of the 1980's campy horror films. Those films were trying to be campy however, where it's quite clear this film is not trying to be. Which makes it even that much more funny. The 1933 version of The Invisible Man based on the same H.G. Wells novel this film is based off, actually happens to be one of my all time favorite films. That's honestly the best thing this 2020 film can do for the world, be an advertisement/reminder for the old classic masterpiece that the James Whale version truly is. Do yourself a favor and watch that baby! Now there's one of the all time great Sci-Fi films of any era. It's an amazing film. This 2020 film, well I pretty much recommend one watch just for the laughs. I'm giving it a 4. For the record I did enjoy this more than that bananas Tenet film. I'm giving that mess a 3/10. Nolan can't even tell an interesting, nor relevant story anymore. The 1933 version of The Invisible Man is an easy 9/10 for me.

376,TheCasualReviewer,"Should be called ""Actively Inducing Paranoia""",8,28 February 2020,"SYNOPSIS:
Two weeks after the escape from her abusive boyfriend, Cecilia (Elisabeth Moss), begins to seemingly be stalked by her supposedly now dead boyfriend, Adrian (Oliver Jackson-Cohen) who's found a way to be invisible. As no one believes her, she has to find a way to stop the abuse and manipulation.REVIEW:
Leigh Whannell is a Director to look out for from now on. From his work on Insidious to Upgrade and now this? Amazing. In the nicest way ever he is quite the number. I'm never going to look at an empty corner the same way again. I want to start by saying that this isn't a perfect movie. There are minor flaws like continuity errors to having visible breathe in California, which maybe I'm being ignorant to weather, but I lived in California and do not remember it ever being cold enough to see my own breathe. Then you have an Uber driver who one person who goes completely unnoticed somehow. Being able to prove things if you just checked a security feed. However, with that being said, what a damn good film. Like, initially I was spotting these errors then Whannell did one of those *takes finger and pushes chin to make me look away* deals. There is so much yes in this film. He uses the camera to really plant seeds in your head. 20% of this movie is empty corners and chairs and the whole time your thinking ""he is right there, I'm with you Cecilia."" I'm shouting at those oblivious cops who are just too close-minded to see that there is clearly an invisible human RIGHT THERE! Can you not see the camera suggesting it (just completely forgetting they're in a movie)? Some people, am I right? Can't help everyone.Then the acting by Elisabeth Moss... WOW. Is it too early to say Oscar nom? Probably. Either way she was incredible. Another stand-out performance to me was Michael Dorman as Adrian's brother/attorney. His performance was very believable and he was very good at being a character you hate, but also sympathize with. All around the performances were great. This film has so many memorable moments that I know I'll remember throughout the year that's accomplished by superb camera work, sound engineering, acting, pacing and everything else. I will definitely be seeing this film again, not because you have to, but because I want to know if I missed any background details and I simply enjoyed the heck out of this film. Go see it! 8.6/10.",The Invisible Man
377,MagicMurderFan,It was watchable but not 7/10 watchable,5,1 June 2020,"It was the tech version of Enough, without Jennifer Lopez's pathetic whining. ""Can't I hit my wife?"" JL, as pathetic as possible. ""Noooooo"" Taco flavored kisses. That all aside, I have to hate the male abuser and they gave me nothing. Maybe him slapping her around in the beginning in the middle of an exhibition, he put together explaining the suit. But no, you have to guess. The scene where she supposedly slapped the kid?! What kind of depth perception does this kid have? She slapped you from a lying position 3 ft away on the opposite side of your face? Dumb. Honestly, I like the lead. But she plays one character all the time. Kind of a Diane Keaton, if you will. I like her, but always the same thing. Underestimated, plain chick. Not overly attractive by American standards, but cleans up well. I don't agree this was political, but the characters seemed forced because there was no explanation, who they were, except the sister.

379,ObsessiveCinemaDisorder,A Solid Horror Film With A Great Leading Performance From Elizabeth Moss,8,17 September 2020,"The Invisible Man is a solid popcorn horror movie experience that is tight with no ounce of excess fat. The story is immediately tense from the first frame onwards and the tension progressively grows at an itsy-bitsy dreading pace, like a rubber band slowly being unhurriedly pulled to the point of snapping but you're watching in agony anticipating when exactly when it will happen.The script adapts H.G. Wells' original story into a tale about domestic abuse told from the victim's viewpoint. Its relation to the source material is mostly in-name-only and does not follow the classic story about a descent to madness like Claude Rains or Paul Verhoeven's Hollow Man.Following up from 2018's Upgrade, writer-Director Leigh Whannel effectively puts the audience in the point-of-view of the victim. Stefan Duscio's cinematography is precise and creates that unsettled paranoia one gets when you think someone or something is behind you. The camera pans around as one would turn their neck to check what's there. The audience will find themselves unsettled from these panning shots of empty hallways and studying every inch of the frame looking for movement or reflection.Elizabeth Moss delivers a raw vulnerable lead performance. Admittedly I haven't seen much of her work before this film (only her supporting role in Jordan Peele's Us), it was impressive how much she pulled me in with verisimilitude. You can never feel Moss's acting; she just is the character. Her distressful performance as Cecilia could have easily been in an indie film about spousal abuse.The make-or-break point for audiences will be The Invisible Man himself, who acts as the monster of the story. Griffin is not a living and breathing human character. He's deliberately underdeveloped and hidden from the audience to be an entity representing the worst imagined version of an obsessive abusive partner. His obsession goes beyond the lengths of what a rich billionaire genius scientist would or could do at times to an unrelenting non-negotiable T-1000 level.Some viewers who crave a fleshed-out character and believability may find The Invisible Man's actions and behavior hard to buy. The film committing to its spousal abuse allegory does take its toll on the story. Though I don't know what the filmmakers could do about that. Horror films, for me, are about metaphors and every horror film requires one suspension of disbelief. I personally was fine taking The Invisible Man as a metaphor.That said, Oliver Jackson-Cohen is miscast as Griffin and doesn't carry the necessary dramatic weight when he is being the ""Visible Man"". An established actor who can exude a genuine sense of threat could have sold it much better and would have done a sufficient job closing the gap between Griffin being a character and an entity.Horror fans, Universal Monster film fans, and H.G. Wells fans will enjoy The Invisible Man as a good one-time watch at the theaters and will be in for some good scares and even surprises. While being a solid cinematic experience, it is still not quite up to being a classic status, but it's very well done.",The Invisible Man

389,whatdoes1know,The invisible plot,9,30 January 2021,"Cecilia is the plain looking town girl who has enraptured the heart and mind of the very possessive, manipulative, financially successful and brilliant scientist Adrien. At a point she even asks him why he's so obsessed with her when he could have had anyone better. As we find out, she not only carries a red herring with her to give viewers a superficial reason for his interest in her physical well-being, she outsmarts him on multiple occasions, and poses the ultimate conquest to a man of mind games, a lifelong challenge. The patriarchally phrased title, could have been more appropriately and simply renamed The Invisible, because it's not only a tale of female abuse-much of which is hearsay and thus invisible, and gratifying vengeance, it's about what the power of anonymity can turn smart and driven people into.HUGE ENDING SPOILER
Cecilia doesn't hand in the evidence which could acquit her or implicate Adrien, instead she uses it to definitively end their relationship and manipulates her cop friend to get access and testimony of the final event. She is broke and will soon be in need of financial support, but walks away from the man who stood in her way with the means to go beyond the law. Intentional or not, the movie is much more ambiguous than I've read in other reviews and interviews with the staff.",The Invisible Man
390,juliendussault,"Great, up until the end",7,21 March 2020,"This was actually a great adaptation of the original Invisible Man. I had my doubts as I walked in, but was suprised at how well written and acted it was. There were bound so be some sports where it looks like the actresses and actors were just swatting at air, and of course there are some moments where it is agonizing for you, as a spectator and viewer, when you know you'd be fighting much harder than these weaklings, but no matter. That is the horror and thriller genre today, as it is.The story is paced evenly, it is believable and makes sense, until the end.SPOILERS:🤰🤰🤰At the end of the movie, our main character has been framed for hitting her best friend's daughter, writing an incredibly hurtful email to her sister and then killing her own sister, and all of these things make her look and sound certifiably insane as nobody is there to see that it truly was The Invisible Man and not Elizabeth Moss who did these things, and then the whammy. She's pregnant.Moss's supposed ""deceased"" husband, our Invisible Man, had a brother who happens to be a lawyer, as well as the estate lawyer for his brother, and he tells her that she has two options oh, stay there and rot in jail, or have the baby. He then says to her ""We will be waiting for your answer."" Implying that not only is he in on it, but that he knew about everything and that his brother is truly alive.Skip to the end and Elizabeth Moss feins suicide and stabs The Invisible Man with a hidden pen and is able to escape after he subdues a guard. She then makes it outside only to be subdued by The Invisible Man who tells her that he will kill everybody she knows and loves and that she'll never be happy as long as he lives.The Invisible man gets to her friends home and tries to kill the daughter, the father comes in and is beaten close to death only for Elizabeth Moss to bust in, use a fire extinguisher to blast The Invisible Man and bust a few caps in his Invisible tookus, only for it to be the brother behind the suit and mask.The police break into the Invisible Mans home and find the supposted dead husband alive. Elizabeth Mods says that it was him all along and that it was just a set up. She then goes to his home, puts on a show that she's just there to talk, then goes to the bathroom to put on the stashed Invisible Man suit that she found in the basement and slashes the husbands throat to make it look like suicide.My problem with this movie is the fact that the only real evidence that we, the audicne, have to go on is the word ""Suprise"" that was said to Elizabeth Moss earlier in the movie, by her husband in his suit. It just felt more like murder than it did justified vengeance. Other than that, a great movie worth your time.",The Invisible Man
391,A_Llama_Drama,"A well-made, modern reinvention of a classic story",9,13 April 2021,"I always loved the story of the Invisible Man. Someone who finds, through not being there, that they can act out all their morally conflicted desires and get away with it. I even have a soft spot for Kevin Bacon's vehicle ""Hollow Man.""Leigh Whannel flips the script, though, and expertly creates an Invisible Man who is already quite the monster, choosing to focus on his victims. This isn't a fun, ""what if"" version of a man slowly losing his ability to be human, but a nasty, dark look at a woman who was terrified, long before she spotted the disembodied footprints on the carpet.Celia's struggle to get the World to believe her abusive boyfriend is still alive, is an interesting POV. Suffering severe PTSD and having barely superficial relationships with her family and friends following untold years under the oppressive thumb of Adrian, patience from her loved ones wears thin quickly. Even walking to the letter box is a struggle, so it's no wonder that she can barely explain the feeling she has that someone is breathing down her neck or standing beside her bed. Freed from the shackles of humanity, Adrian can indulge in all the horrors he could never visit upon her when he had to face people. As the violence ramps up, bodies pile and Celia has to take horrible actions to protect herself and the lives of those closest to her.The music, lighting and set designs are all moody and modern. A restaurant where a meeting descends into murder, is gloriously off-kilter long before knives appear. Adrian's house, so sleek and bright in the day, takes on a cavernous, hungry demeanor at night. A mental asylum takes on the appearance of Celia's old home, all bright lights and long corridors.Perhaps not what people expect. There's very little fun to be had here. What is present, instead, is a very accomplished horror about domestic violence, dressed as a classical movie monster.",The Invisible Man

393,AlbertCinefilu,The idea feels ordinary but it's good enough to place it among Don't Breathe and other similar horror movies but below A Quiet Place,8,10 January 2021,"While I have to admit it's not a jewelry in this new kind of horror movies that started to emerge in the past years and I don't yet have a name for (maybe horror movies that put more accent on using sound correctly rather than visuals?), it is still really enjoyable and you want to keep watching. There is the same old lame story about plot-holes and how the world of the movie doesn't make sense sometimes or the movie doesn't answer almost every question that it raises but I'm exhausted of always pointing plot-holes, so let's center on something else.Elisabeth Moss (whose talent I've got to know from The Handmaid's Tale) nailed it as the victim of a sociopathic narcissist who also stalks and haunts not only her dreams as you can see. I've discovered that the jump-scares are totally dependent upon sound and owe very little to what you see. I thought I'm way more scared by the face that jumps in front of me but actually sound is the one responsible for the thrill in my body. There are some twists spread across the story that - if you don't really pause the movie and think about where the story is going - surprise you in a pleasant way. It's pretty action-packed but also sentimental sometimes and some phrases really make you want to pause and think, something a horror movie doesn't often do. The rest of the cast is just decent, I wish some of the characters would have a more important secondary role.An 8,1 out of 10 from me.",The Invisible Man
394,greggman,"Liked the new take, hated the plot holes",5,20 May 2020,"Another semi-plot hole I didn't see mentioned in other reviews. When she finds Adrian's phone she now has the photos on his phone as proof because who else could have taken them? If I was her I would have immediately emailed them from his phone.The ending bugged me. She went from victim to psycho killer. We're supposed to feel justified because Adrian is a creep but instead it just felt like she'll be the next crazy person with the suit. Now maybe that was the point. There will be a sequel, the Invisible Woman, where Cecilia uses the suit to do bad things. For whatever reason though the fact that she could brutally murder Adrian removed my sympathy for her. James saw the suit, I can't imagine knowing what it could do he'd let her leave with it. Nor as a cop do I believe he'd be okay with Cecilia committing murder.I think a more interesting ending could have been her using the suit in other ways against Adrian but that's not the movie we were given.I would also have expected the existence of the suit itself to cause more of a sensation. As others mentioned it's hard to believe Adrian wouldn't have noticed the other suit is missing. Further it's hard to imagine they wouldn't have all been confiscated by the authorities one way or another. Sure they don't believe it was Adrian but the witnesses at the hospital / institution and James', the cop's experience, seem like it would have been enough to confiscate everything in Adrian's lab",The Invisible Man
395,MovieWarfare,A breath of fresh air in the horror genre,8,1 March 2020,"The Invisible Man is another movie that is based of the acclaimed novel by H.G. Wells. Fun Fact: this was originally going to be the second movie in the cinematic universe ""Dark Universe"" with Johnny Depp playing the titled character. However, the flop of the Mummy seems to have made Universal focus on standalone Universal monster movies. This new strategy seems to be the right move as The Invisible Man is an absolute thrill of a movie. The general summary of this movie is that Cecilia (Elisabeth Moss) who has escaped an abusive relationship from her ex Adrian (Oliver Jackson-Cohen) only for weeks later to find out he committed suicide. However, she suspects his death was a hoax and that she is being hunted by someone nobody can see.The biggest praise of this movie has got to be Elisabeth Moss performance.She gives an authentic performance of a character who has been in an abusive relationship.She makes the emotional stakes feel high and her agony feel genuine. However, she is also able to give a ferocity in her performance when her character decides to fight. She does an incredible job in carrying this movie. The score by Benjamin Wallfisch is also incredibly unsettling and intense when it needs to be. It manages to perfectly elevate the scene in every way and really make the audience invested what they are watching. I also have to praise their unique use of camera shots. The director Leigh Whannell uses a lot of wide shots and panning to make it really feel like there is someone else in the room watching our character Cecilia. The story is also really engaging and is a really smart narrative on woman who have been abused or manipulated. The movie has great scares and great suspenseful moments that are not just relying on jump scares(but there are some) and it is just a breath of fresh air for a horror movie.This isn't the director's fault but the trailers kind of ruin a fair amount of the surprise sadly. I highly recommend people don't watch the trailer for this movie cause it will lessen the experience. My biggest issue with this movie is just the amount of plot holes that really make me question things. I will avoid spoiler territory. The first thing I have to question is the lack of cameras? There are security cameras in this world and this movie emphasises cameras but when there is a scene that 100% would have security cameras in the real world, the movie decides it doesn't exist anymore. Also I have to question how a certain character is able to get to get from point a to point b so quick when there is clearly no transportation used by this character. Additionally, this character somehow knows where everyone is just baffling and unexplained. You have to suspend some of your belief to accept these and unfortunately that is kinda difficult especially considering the tech shown in this movie. The last act of this movie also feels really contrasting to the the slower and suspenseful pace of the first two acts of this movie and it kinda makes it feel like a completely different movie. Honestly, I also prefer the first two acts compared to the last one.Overall, this movie is just a great horror movie and a fresh contemporary adaptation of the novel. If you want a unique and vastly different horror movie experience then this movie is a must watch for you.",The Invisible Man

You feel increasingly bad for her plight when everything starts to collapse around her.The actions' also great.

398,helenbassett,The Invisible Man Film Review - Leigh Whannell Directs Elisabeth Moss In Blumhouse's Cracking Horror,10,14 March 2020,"In your average horror movie I am continuously scanning the background, but in Leigh Whannell's adaptation of The Invisible Man the horror is right behind you. You just cannot see it. The film is part of the Universal Dark Universe franchise, but reimagined by Leigh. Elisabeth Moss creeps around the gorgeous house, great production design by Alex Holmes, we are led to believe she has drugged her wealthy boyfriend Adrian played by Emerald City's Lucas; Oliver Jackson-Cohen. And in those few moments you could cut the tension with a knife.Barely escaping from this gilded prison with her sister's help, Cecilia finds refuge with her friend James and his daughter Sydney, but always feels someone is watching her. Attempting to beat her agoraphobia she eventually makes it out of the door to the mail box. A small victory. But when Adrian commits suicide, Cecilia's fears are over. With her and Harriet Dyer's sister Emily both amazed when he leaves $5 million to Cecilia, with a few unlikely codicils. But Adrian's lawyer Tom, his own brother, played by For All Mankind's Michael Dorman, assures her everything is fine.And it is. Using Adrian's $10,000 a month will allowance Cecilia sets up a Parsons College fund for Sydney, Storm Reid playing thecool daughter of Aldis Hodge's policeman James. And Cecelia feeling confident enough to work again, but why are her architectural drawings suddenly gone from her case during her interview?, and why is Diazepam suddenly on the bathroom counter?, the same medicine she used to drug Adrian, as she passes out. The hospital results show she had high levels of the Diazepam in her blood. She never took the pills.But Cecilia starts to wonder what if tech billionaire Adrian isn't actually dead, what if he created a way to make himself invisible? Could the man who abused her while he was alive, still be psychologically, and worse, terrorising her in his 'death'? We can see the duvet slipping off the bed, we know someone's there, as the photo is taken, but we cannot see him. Maybe just a foot outline on a sheet.I don't know HG Wells's The Invisible Man, other than there was a series with David McCallum when I was a kid. But Leigh Whannell has created a monster who question's Cecilia's sanity and in a shocking OMG moment ultimately robs her of her family. If no one can see her tormentor, then no one can help. But Cecilia has survived worse when living with Adrian, the painful admitting to James and Emily of the awful life she had is heartbreaking. Apparently self harm scenes were cut from the UK version which would have showed even more the psychological harm he caused her. And I cannot think of a better actress to play Cecilia than Elisabeth Moss, we are willing to invest in her as the abused woman who takes the fight to her abuser. With Tom offering Cecilia a menacing option we're totally up for it. Especially as Cecilia has an ace up her sleeve in this chilling sci-fi thriller.A terrific script and big success for Blumhouse. They are really having a moment with three of their films currently in cinemas. With an impressive score by Benjamin Wallfisch and haunting cinematography by Stefan Duscio that together builds up the suspense. As a horror fan this was superb from Leigh Whannell. The loft scenes were fantastic but it isn't relying only on the jumpy moments. Far too sophisticated a piece of work for that. Well done to the cast and crew.",The Invisible Man
399,pazu7,More annoying than terrifying.,4,19 May 2020,"(SPOILERS) On the front page for this film there's an article headlined ""What Makes The Invisible Man Terrifying?"".... Well, that's the problem. It's not terrifying. It's stupid. I love Elizabeth Moss in almost everything she's done, but this is an ineptly written tale that caused me more annoyance than fear. The only suspense is generated by the hackneyed jump scare tactics used in tediously long scenes of Moss navigating the dark corridors of her friend's house. The only thing missing was a cat jumping out of a garbage can,. And if it had taken place in an alley, I am sure they would have used that tired device. Perhaps my annoyance comes from a pet-peeve I have.; I hate stupid characters. I take no issue with the premise or the inevitable, (if not a bit trite) plot point that she will be thought mad and have to eventually prove she's telling the truth. But there she is, in her friends attic with the cell phone of her supposedly dead husband and the thing has pictures on it, of her and the man's daughter asleep in their bed.... and she doesn't even try to call someone with the phone and say ""if I am making this up then how did I get his phone?""... or just send the pictures to her sister and ask ""how could I have taken these?"" I don't know what it is about stuff like that, but for me, when a character turns stupid, it kicks me out of the story and I just spend the rest of the film rooting for the bad guy or I watch something else. But, imo, the real problem is stupid writing. Bold for me to say, since I'm no professional, but it's just dumb. They must have been able to construct a confrontation that doesn't turn Moss' character into a blathering idiot incapable of even a a modicum of rational thought. It's not the premise, or the fact that her invisible adversary gets away with framing her, it's the ease and predictability with which he does it. Because she's written as an idiot.",The Invisible Man

Another mention of the musical score is warranted- it is in the same vein of the Insidious movies, and it really added to the movie in a good way!The movie was not perfect though- there are times in the movie where common sense seems lacking and I found myself saying ""why doesnt she do this?"".

406,PerryAtTheMovies,"For me, a must watch...",9,21 November 2020,"Initial Thoughts:
As the viewer we're not given a ton of backstory into Cecilia, or her rich boyfriend Adrian, and that leaves us trying to piece together just how abusive and manipulating he truly was. All we're left with is her shaky words as she tries to let go of him. Once past the opening 30 minutes it gets juicy. Here's this normal girl just trying to live life when suddenly her world is rocked by an unknown presence. ""The Invisible Man"" uses a lot of time and space to build up suspense in this psychological thriller and that leads to an end that will leave you gasping for air.Pros:
Great camera work that truly brings the audience into the film. One moment you're being watched and the next moment you're watching ready to strike. I liked how the film isn't quick and dirty, but rather a slow build-up that eventually declines Cecilia's mental state.Cons:
Despite my enjoyment of the slow build-up, the film felt too long with some of the build-up to the tense moments. At times we're left staring into nothingness waiting for something to happen that never does. Other than that the film was almost seamless.Overall:
Great movie from Blumhouse. One of the few I've watched that didn't feel corny or cheesy. If you enjoy the psychological genre. I think you'd like this one. Most definitely adding this to my ""recommend to watch"" list.",The Invisible Man

At that point it is known that there are suits for invisibility and considering how her sister died.and why did the woman get the idea with putting something on the stalker to uncover him so late?why did nobody accidentally look in the direction of the murder in the restaurant?

409,crickwill,This Is Good..,8,1 January 2021,"I read reviews of The Invisible Man here, damning it for any number of supposed plot holes and gaps in logic.I failed to agree or see reason with any of them but instead had one gripe about one particular segment, which unfortunately stopped me from awarding this film full points and which nobody else seemed to notice or point out. It did come so close to earning them though (God was I rooting for this picture), which is why a small goof in a nearly perfect film seems so much more injurious than otherwise. Its pretty much seamless, the scares are classy and certain moments totally unexpected and beautifully pulled off. It's polished and looks good and runs the gamut particularly well between Sci-Fi and Horror but refuses to ultimately bow to either. And its assured, and its cast is assured. Early in the piece, I honestly felt like Kael watching Last Tango In Paris....""it has finally arrived, the breakthrough (thriller) of the decade has come"". I still feel a bit that way now, I believe its as close as we've ever gotten to a definitive thriller for a long while. My suspicions with this pic were aroused by polarising critical reviews (so what) but then later it seemed to be hanging around in awards circles (what is going on here?) Given a drubbing by many people here, whose obvious impediment is that they don't know 'how' to watch a movie and then those that are merely inclined to pick a movie to pieces and invent reasons why scenes don't make sense or 'connect' to their own personal satisfaction. Again these people have no clue on the processes involved in filmaking or on how to 'watch' a film. This is honestly as close as it gets to the real thing in the Thriller genre. Ok, Elizabeth Moss's character certainly rises from the wreckage as fresh as a daisy and seems quite unaffected in the aftermath of having nearly gutted her forearm with gold fountain pen mind you, but given the pure craftsmanship and adrenalin this picture provided me, I'm going to overlook that. Everything else on display was far too impressive. Was the invisibility suit stuffed into the handbag on exiting an easy construct for future franchising...?

Unfortunately some of those surprises are already in the trailer, which brings me to the next point- there is nothing really new in the movie itself. Ignoring some of the plot holes, the story is reasonable and so is the acting but nothing ground-breaking.
Some of the actions taken by many of the characters is questionable at best. Some examples: the sister is in low-enforcement but in several scenes acts like a teenager, the husband supposed to be a genius but then makes some really bad decisions etc etc. This is mainly the reason I give this movie a 6 vs a 7 but if you can ignore this and have a pop-corn box handy you should be able to enjoy the movie. A word of warning- there is no nudity or sex in the movie but there are some bloody scenes from time to time. Not for kids.

416,Marc_Action,Better than anticipated,7,30 May 2020,"I did not expect much from The Invisible Man (2020) other than a modern mashup of 1991's Sleeping with the Enemy and the original The Invisible Man film from 1933 as well as the more recent Hollow Man franchise kicked off in 2000 with Kevin Bacon. Well, to that end, it did not let me down. However, the Invisible Man was much better than just a modern mix up of the previously mentioned films/genres.For starters, Elisabeth Moss does a great job as the main character, Cecilia Kass--a tortured young woman trying desperately to escape the physical and physiological torture inflicted on her by her deranged and sinister, yet highly intelligent boyfriend, Adrian Griffin. Only to find that Griffin has invented a way to stalk and harass her brutally after she builds up the courage to leave him.Now, we never really get much backstory on Griffin other than he's some type of optics engineer who's very well off. This would usually earn the director and writer, Leigh Whannell, low marks for a lack of character development, but in this case, I think it works better for the plot that Griffin is a (mostly) mysterious character.Of course, writer Leigh Whannell lifted this character directly from the book The Invisible Man written by H. G. Wells all the way back in 1897. (Adrian Griffin was also the man behind the invisible cloak in the original The Invisible Man film from 1933. Of course, Whannell does bring the character into modern times.)Anyway, Moss carries the film and holds the viewers attention throughout. That said, Moss's character would never be mistaken for Miss U.S.A., but this is by design and part of what makes the plot somewhat able to stomach. It's also good to see a lead female character in such a role not be the typical Hollywood hottie for once.The movie itself is very suspenseful and there are a couple of plot twists to keep things interesting. While the first two-thirds of the movie is pretty solid, things get too implausible with the third act. In addition, the score probably was one of the most riveting and befitting of the movie it accompanies that I've heard in a long time. However, while great, the volumn was often deafeningly too high at points, and I'm not sure if this was the fault of the sound mixing of the movie or the theater's sound settings.Without giving away any spoilers, I think the plot twist that occur maybe 10 or so minutes before the actual ending would have been a more fitting end to the movie. I guess Hollywood types just doesn't know when they have a good thing.",The Invisible Man
417,darthsteele-39338,Entertaining BUT.....,7,27 May 2020,"First off, I am reviewing this movie on its own merit as I never saw the original and I am not really familiar with the character of The invisible Man. It did keep me entertained throughout, which is saying a lot for me. The first one third of the film I found gripping and suspenseful BUT THEN I found myself yelling ""she's so stupid"" at screen quite a bit for the remainder of the movie. I have a lot of questions! Who is the cop and his daughter that she goes to stay with and what is their relationship to her? When she finds all of the evidence in the attic why doesn't she try to take it with her or at least reference it when trying to convince everyone she's not crazy? why does she never use her own smartphone to collect pictures and evidence? She KNOWS Adrian is terrorizing her pretty early on in the film so why doesn't she hop to it a little bit quicker? Why doesn't she try harder to convince her sister that she did not actually send the email? How can pepper spray penetrate the seemingly impenetrable invisible Man costume? The friend / cop is horrible at his job! When returning home after our heroine is attacked, there is an obvious sign of a struggle! Why does this not alert him? Adrian is supposedly in the top of his field in optics, so why, at no point does anyone even bother to investigate our damsel's story. I have so many more questions! But I'm not going to ramble on. Just two more comments first, the movie should be titled ""The Invisible Man's Wife"" because we don't learn much of anything about the invisible Man and he's really only in the final scene of the entire movie.

CinemaSins is going to destroy this thing.Invisible plot holes. Invisible acting skills. Invisible suspense... invisible bank account after everything is done.The main actress (Elisabeth Moss) is seriously a horrible actress. Horrible. And she distracts you from being able to focus on the movie. She overacts every single thing. If she jumps from a sound she exaggerates it by 10x. If she looks over her shoulder to see if someone is following her she exaggerates it by 10x. I honestly am having a hard time even watching her face because it is so ugh.From the first scene the exposition is that of a first-year film student. How do you know she drugged him? She picks up the bottle of pills and shows it to you. But that isn't enough... no no, she also needs to pick up the glass of water and swirl it so you know it is in the bottle. Then she needs to say his name out loud so that he doesn't move. Then she needs to read the bottle again. Over and over.Why is this dude's research lab connected to the garage? Because the movie needs it to be. How did the dog get into the garage? Because the movie needs him there. Why in God's name did the sister stop the car to pick up the main character and then just sit there and not move?? She saw the man running towards the window and just sat there. You know she already knew that her sister was being abused, but she acted like she did not understand why she was picking up her sister in the woods in the middle of the night. Then she continued to sit there while the guy busted out the window like Superman.Am I spoiling the movie? NOPE. Why? Because all of this is in the trailer. Watch the trailer and you will know how horrible this movie is, because the trailer shows every single thing that happens in a linear fashion.Who greenlit this crap???? This movie is the reason why you do not let the director of Insidious 3 write a screenplay for a 100 year old franchise and then direct it, like he has free reign to do whatever tf he wants.

Second, this film has some intense and downright brilliantly directed scenes.While I enjoyed this movie very much, the ending was a little sloppy to me. At the end of the movie, she gets her revenge on Adrian(The Invisible Man) by using the invisible suit she hid earlier in the movie to kill him, but there is a huge plot point that happened earlier that revealed Adrian knew where her hiding place was. Wouldn't he know she hid the suit there? Did he not notice one of his suits were missing? I don't like nitpicking movies, but I was left a little puzzled. Also, the ending would've been more horrifying if Adrian got away with it and the movie hinted at the fact that he might continue to haunt her.It's extremely frustrating when a great movie doesn't stick the landing, but overall I thought The Invisible Man was well made and an intense experience.",The Invisible Man

And beyond that, she was physically abused.One day, she decided to run away from her abusive husband and moved into her friend's house. Later, her husband seemimgly committed suicide and she tried to move on. Did he really die? No. Did she really escape from violence? No.He is back with an invisible suit. He hit her friend's daughter, send an upsetting email to her sister and finally killing her sister. And he made the public think it was the female lead who did it.Unlike the movie's ending, many domestic violence goes unreported. It is clear that abusers like Amber Heard or Blake Jenner are not as bad as the invisible man. But their abuse leave a mark of trauma on the victim. Yes, I am a female and feminist.

432,villard,Invisibility Leaves a Lot Missing,2,5 September 2020,"This spooky murder-mystery barely held my attention because it is so dragged-out. The many scenes where Elizabeth Moss feels she's being stalked by a ghost, and later, invisible man, are at least twice and long as they should be.Her perpetual look of despair and anxiety is almost as monotonous as Joaquin Phoenix's Batman Joker character depiction in the 2019 film.By far the biggest flaw in the film is getting the audience to hate the bad guy, Moss' boyfriend, actor Oliver Jackson-Cohen. She describes him as really evil, but we never see his character in action until the final minutes of the film! So, his character development is pretty anemic.This film has a few parallels to the 1991 film Sleeping With the Enemy. A women is trapped in a abusive relationship in a luxury oceanside home with a despicable mate. A death is faked and the woman goes into hiding and is stalked by her former partner.But in the 1991 film we see so much brutality we are primed to want the male abuser dead, dead, dead! In the Invisible Man all when have is a long-winded narrative from Moss about what a creep the guy is. And, as any marriage counselor says, there are two sides to every story.Also implausible is the boyfriend's huge basement workshop that is full of as much techno-gear as Iron Man's lab. This never got Moss' curiosity until after he *disappears?* She must have at least been curious how he made big-bucks.The invisibility suit is cool and somewhat based on current technology experiments, and so, is plausible.

In fact, this could've been easily made in the 1930s. Not that it's a bad thing, but the title suggests a re-make of the classic film of the same name but with updated special effects.In reality, this film was more a re-make of the 90s film, Sleeping with the Enemy, than the 30s film, The Invisible Man. Obviously, the first mistake of this film was its title. It was less about an invisible man and more about a woman trying to get away from her controlling husband. It's a good film but not the great Invisible Man re-make I was expecting.Another problem was that it started out slow. It took a good half and hour before anything happened. Shaving 20 minutes off this film would've improved it.Overall this film was suspenseful and entertaining but it really wasn't about an invisible man. It's a good thing it was released online because it's not worth seeing in theaters. For a better Invisible Man re-make, watch Paul Verhoeven's Hollow Man. Very enjoyable and totally underrated. It's 20 years old but its special effects can hold its own today.",The Invisible Man

435,rustonreviews,"A solid, tense thriller.",8,14 March 2020,"Leigh Whannel has been operating within the horror genre for quite some time now. Primarily known as one of the co-creators of the Saw and Insidious franchises, he's also helmed underappreciated hits from the director's chair with Insidious: Chapter 3 (2015) and Upgrade (2018). Prior to the release of his drastic reimagining of H.G Well's The Invisible Man (1897), I decided to watch the original Universal 1933 classic. It's a somewhat hokey, humorous film, but the effects (for the time) remain impressive. Whannel's modern day revamp follows Cecilia Kass (Moss) who decides to sever ties once and for all with her abusive partner, Adrian Griffin (Oliver Jackson-Cohan). Not too long after, Griffin allegedly commits suicide. Believing herself to be truly free from his grasp, Cecilia soon starts to experience strange occurrences that hint towards an unsettling truth; that Adrian may, somehow, still be in pursuit. Nobody believes her, so Cecilia sets out to prove that her abusive ex is far from dead, even if it's at the cost of her own sanity.Way back in 2016, Universal were actively working on revamping their Universal Monsters brand in the form of the Dark Universe. The Invisible Man was originally slated to be a part of this cinematic universe (a move no doubt crafted to compete with the thriving MCU), but once The Mummy (2017, the first film of the proposed Dark Universe) flopped, all plans were scrapped. It's a wonder, therefore, that Whannel's reimagining has even made it to completion. Fortunately, The Invisible Man is a solid and thoroughly engaging thriller. Elizabeth Moss delivers a great central performance, portraying a survivor of emotional/domestic abuse perfectly. A key strength of the film is how Whannel frames a scene; there are various shots that hint towards an unseen observer stalking Cecilia when she's left alone, and it's these shots that (although there isn't anything too substantial going on) convey an underlying menace and tension that elevates the paranoia present throughout the film. It is a frequently tense watch, especially once the true nature of the titular villain is revealed. Whannel doesn't use excessive gore or jump scares (something that littered his screenplays when writing for the Saw and Insidious franchises), and instead favours for moments of genuine suspense. Although the third act does overstay its welcome (a good 10 minutes could have been trimmed from the final cut), The Invisible Man is still a tight thriller that both improves upon and respects the original classic.",The Invisible Man

Talk about your uneven results! Where that film was stupid, boring, poorly-crafted, and tedious, ""Invisible Man"" was a taut and well-made movie, part sci-fi / horror, part psychological thriller.

The effects are minimalistic, but when they are on display it's glorious.The film has a perfect mixture of silent moments of built up tension and the bloody action. The action pieces seem relentless. Where some thrillers are ready for a grand finale THE INVISIBLE MAN is only warming up.Leigh Whannell knows how to create action sequences, he even created his own signature visual, as the camera falls together with a body, connecting to the ground with a shattering blow.

Not to mention size problems, since such a suit wouldn't be easily wearable. Apart from the previous - that is, it's still not easily implementable, the rest is pretty good: Good cinematography, scenery and decent acting, with rising tension throughout . But centering the entire script on just this cloaking device/method and how 2 narcissistic psychopaths can use it to confuse and evade others and turn everyone's life into a crazy nightmare is a bit over-plethoric and somewhat tiring. Similar to exhonerating every psychopath's dream: To use invisibility like that and do what he wants and escape unnoticed, since nobody's seen nothing or turn the blame elsewhere from lack of visual evidence. Gore is decent and the story allows for a gradual understanding of how two narcissist genius psychopaths work and think. If you haven't seen it it's a plus, although it spends too much time playing hide and seek with someone who makes absolutely no other noises? and infiltrates any space available? (-2).

No offense to the main actress, but she was not a rake thin supermodel. (No disrespect. I'm just saying).The main thing that ruined this movie for me is the (lack of) character development. I'm really suppose to hate the husband....right? But we mostly know about him through second hand accounts and actions of the wife. Obviously, she is terrified of him. OK. However, we don't really meet him before his ""death"" (with the exception of him putting his hand through the car to get to his wife). As a result, it was hard to truly feel bad for the wife.Actually, I started to feel bad for the wife, but after the illogical nonsense of the script, I gave up. As the story slogged on, I was hoping that the wife would either win or lose.

Elisabeth Moss stars as Cecilia Cass, a woman who has escaped from an abusive relationship. Her ex is a wealthy man and a world renowned optics engineer. He is also a manipulative and violent abuser.
Scarred by her experience, Cass is trying to reclaim her life piece by piece when word comes to her that her ex, Adrian has committed suicide.
Any sense of peace she gets is rudely stripped away when strange events convince her that Adrian is still alive and has used his expertise as an optics engineer to make himself invisible.
Naturally no one believes her and she appears to descend into paranoid madness, alienating friends and family, losing job opportunities and more. We know she's right and the tension is built up brilliantly using empty space expertly to create paranoia for both Cass and the viewers. The effects during the invisible attacks are great and while the final section of the film does turn into more of a traditional chase and fight, it's still really well done and very satisfying.

445,Ingrouille181,A Very Good Remake,8,18 March 2020,"We can all agree that the Universal Monsters Cinematic Universe, the 'Dark Universe' was a disaster waiting to happen, and it did. Now we're back to what a Universe Monsters remake should be, a relatively low budget, mainly independent movie made by a director with a great idea or vision. And we definitely get that with director Leigh Whannell. This guy helped created the Saw movies, the Insidious movies, dead silence; the guy knows his horror, and with this he's proven he knows how to take an old idea and make something effective and most of all SMART with it.The movie centres on Cecilia who, after escaping from her abusive ex boyfriend, finds out a few weeks later that he's taken his own life, and has left her with several million in his will. But things soon change when Cecilia begins to realise that an invisible presence is following her. Believing her ex faked his death and is invisible, she seeks any help she can to fight back, before it's too late.Elisabeth Moss is the best part of the movie and she really holds the movie together. I bought her 100% as this character who's been left traumatised by abuse and she pulls off the right level of paranoia. All the other actors do a great job, but the only other memorable performance to me is Michael Dorman, who plays the brother of Cecilia's ex boyfriend. Dorman was great in 2009s Daybreakers, and he's great in this too. He allows his character to carry the right level of intimidation, and there is one scene he pulls that off perfectly in.This is a great way to update a universal monsters classic. Is it better than the 2004 Hollow Man with Kevin Bacon. It's definitely an update with (spoilers) an invisible tech suit being how invisibility is achieved. Personally I prefer Hollow Man, but the way they integrate the suit in the story, and especially its first reveal and the 'oh' moment is affective. There is also one jump scare in this movie that is leagues better than all the crappy ones we've gotten in DOZENS of cheap, lazy 'horror' cash grabs we've had for half a decade now. It's definitely a 'once you see it, you'll  bricks' situation. There are camera angles that make you question if the Invisible Man is there or not, or if Cecilia is acting irrational. It gets inside your head which is how a psychological thriller should do.If there's one thing I didn't like about the movie it's the ending. At first I really didn't know how to feel about it, but now I feel it could've been handled better and it left me not knowing what to think about Cecilia, our main character who we've been routing for. You could say it's sweet revenge, but it came off like the ending of a Girl with the Dragon Tattoo movie. Really could've been written better, in my opinion anyway.Overall though, I would recommend it. Better than most horror movies we've had the past 5 or 6 years, and one of the better movies Blumhouse has produced lately. I can finally forgive them for that giant pile of crap known as Black Christmas 2019. Definitely go see this if you get the chance.",The Invisible Man

Seriously...would you just hang out at home after your ex committed suicide? She's not really a hottie...wouldn't you go to the spa and get a makeover? Wouldn't you travel to Hawaii or someplace exotic? She should at least have bought a boob job!So she gets terrorized and because she is a single female with only the convenient police officer friend she doesn't talk to friends or acquaintances about anything. She also does all the stupid single woman in a house things possible. Hear noises at night? I think I'll just step outside in front of my bushes with no lights on and look around. No weapons in hand...don't turn out the lights...don't scope out the front from inside the house first. Nope. I'll just walk outside while ""Oh Mr. Krabs it is the music"" goes on to create tension.Then there is The Invisible Man himself. Does he not crap or pee or eat or sleep? I mean, if he is hanging out in the house all day and she is around you would think she would notice food or drink missing or that someone was using the bathroom. Where does he go to take a shower? How does he feed himself? Where does he poop? Who's toilet paper does he use? Does he ever wash? He has to be pretty ripe smelling if he doesn't get cleaned up.It is also somewhat cold at night where they are at. Is he naked all the time? Where does he sleep that no one notices?I've also known plenty of females. You know what most women do if they believe they are being stalked? GET A BIG GUARD DOG! GET A SECURITY SYSTEM WITH THAT $5,000,000!Ultimately this is a glorified LMN man stalking woman movie. At least LMN advertises their showings as such.This is just another awful piece of Hollywood dreck",The Invisible Man
454,brentn,Whannell reinvents a classic.,8,8 April 2021,"Leigh Whannell has done it again with his 3rd film in the directors chair. I'm glad I was given the chance to compare this film with Verhoeven's Hollow Man. Although both stories are far fetched, it's all about the intrigue with sci-fi and honestly, even though they both have some lame CGI, Hollow Man felt flat even with Bacon, Shue and Brolin. Moss completely carried this movie and I'm glad she did. She was incredible, believable, and a genuine pleasure to watch. Both films are dark and suspenseful but Invisible Man did a number on me with the spectacular camera work and the high-stakes tension. Whannell put a lot of effort into channeling very eerie silences and subtle movements to totally give the audience the whole ""somebody's watching me"" feeling. Great movie!",The Invisible Man

The big screen filled up with her emotive and expressive face, all without hardly moving a muscle, is a thing of magic.

The Invisible Man the title refers to is Griffin, a scientist who has devoted himself to research into optics and invents a way to change a body's refractive index to that of air so that it neither absorbs nor reflects light and thus becomes invisible. Thi film is based on the character created by HG Wells.This is where the similarities end. This is a totally different story from HG well's 1897 novel.

461,Her-Excellency,Mixed Feelings on the Subject of Domestic Abuse,6,24 March 2020,"While I understand that every person is different and reacts differently to different situations, the scared-as-a-mouse performance by Elizabeth Moss upon leaving the relationship, to me, was just not believable. It takes A LOT to leave a relationship which has become as abusive and controlling as the one that was alluded to in this film. By the time one is emotionally ready to walk out, generally, you've been through all the pain, the doubts ... the weakness; by the time one has been driven to stand up and leave, generally, there is nothing as frightening ""out there"" as staying IN the relationship would be, and there is NOTHING more empowering than the moment you step out of that door KNOWING that it is the last time you will ever allow yourself to go back. Now, again, I understand, and would like the reader to understand, that this is just my opinion. For others it may be different and very well may be as was depicted in the film, where the recovery process takes a while longer and during that time the survivor still feels emotionally or physically vulnerable and at risk. Either way, people (I won't define by gender because there are men who are abused too) who find their legs and leave a situation such as this, sooner or later do discover that they are indeed among the strongest on earth.That being said, what I did like about the film is that none of the prior abuse was actually covered or depicted. If people are really thinking about the subject matter, it opens you up to the thought that in many of these real-life situations, the abusee is sometimes doubted, seen as not entirely credible, or are downright disbelieved by others. This film brought that home by picking an ""abuser"" who looked like a nice, average-looking guy, with an obviously good job, who looked like he could ""never do anything like that"". That was brilliant.The special effects were nicely done as well.Going back and forth between what I liked and did not like (ergo my title of Mixed Feelings), contrary to what I see is a popular opinion, I do not think this ties in well with the ""Invisible Man"" franchise. If the creators were not actively saying it is, I would have figured it was a script about a tech-genius who discovers how to make himself 'not seen', and NOT about THE ""Invisible Man"" we've read about and have seen in the past.There were also plot holes galore which I took the time to list, but then thought better of it so that even though this is tagged with a spoiler warning, if you have not seen the film it won't spoil it too much for you.While I have some problems with the film, I still suggest you watch it. It is entertaining enough, suspenseful in some places, and most of the acting and special effects are pretty great.6.5/10",The Invisible Man
462,isabellacheng,"Decent thriller, revealed antagonist too soon",7,10 October 2020,"Besides plot holes such as why Sydney could possibly think Cecilia hit her when Cecilia was on the floor right in front of her, the reason I wouldn't give this film a higher score is because they revealed the antagonist too soon.There is no suspense whether The Invisible Man exists. His first ""prank"" with the bacon and egg was fine, but removing the knife in front of us audience really hurts the suspense. Now we all know The Invisible Man is real, and not some figment of imagination from PTSD. Thereafter whenever Cecilia stares at a corner, we know for certain The Invisible Man is there. Zero suspense.The writers also opened the door to there being multiple invisible men, which would have made an overused but still interesting plot twist.

468,i-max,My review...,7,6 April 2020,"The movie started out very tense, it's totally believable the man sleeping on the bed is some kind of psychopath and the girl is desperately trying to escape. Then after she thought she was safe at her friend's house, the invisible man starts to haunt her.The issue here was the audience didn't know whether if the invisible man was real, which was a good selling point, to keep you guessing. For all we know she might be crazy because of the trauma and the medication and did all those things herself, it could've been an ending like a lot of movies would've ended.But, the movie actually gave us what we wanted to know, and a little too early, that the invisible man was real. This takes away a lot of suspense and what was a thriller becomes a sci-fi, bad(s) vs. good.His brother being a part of this was a twist, but it was uncalled for. It would've been believable if the invisible man was really dead, and his brother had to carry on the ""mission"" to torture this girl. By being ""invisible"", he's not using any tech, but actually using his brother to implement his will, that would've been a decent second half of the film. The main guy is DEAD, better to keep it that way and reveal it at the end that he's still dead.So obviously there are ways to improve this film, but I'm glad I saw it.",The Invisible Man

473,gooseshaw,"A fine thriller, but a disappointing movie overall.",6,23 April 2020,"Like others have said, the start of this movie is great. It's tense, mysterious, and exciting. Despite this, the intro scene is also where certain character decisions begin to annoy me - like when Cecilia decides to wave around her flashlight as she's running from her husband, rather than turning it off. Now this wasn't a huge problem or anything, it's only the beginning of what becomes an irritating pattern, finally culminating in a scene where Cecilia lies on the floor next to a gun, watching Adrian, who's wearing a flickering invisibility suit, murder almost a dozen security guards.I won't ramble on about the various dumb writing choices in this movie, but I will say that it was a disappointment. I went in not knowing the plot, other than that an invisible man exists and the protagonist is played by Elizabeth Moss. I was hoping that I would see a suspenseful, creepy horror movie, perhaps with some psychological elements to it (maybe something to make the viewer think Cecilia's really just insane). The movie does have some of these qualities, mostly in the first half, but eventually it just turns into a sci-fi action movie ending with a poorly acted antagonist in a predictable final scene.Besides Adrian's corny acting, and the obviously digitally-imposed breath that we see Cecilia and the invisible man take as they stand outside on a porch, the quality of this movie was pretty good. Moss sure can act crazy, and the violence is well done - but excessive.All in all, I think this movie was a let down.

479,objviewer,"Dumb plot points, dumb characters, cool camera shots",3,31 October 2020,"First, the one thing this movie has going for it: spooky cool camera shots of empty spaces where the invisible man might be. But that's all it has going for it, and I suspect the envisioning of those camera shots was the original idea around which a lame movie was built.So mostly it's one of those horror movies where the viewer is continually asking ""why doesn't she?""
Why doesn't she, when she realizes what's going on, buy a gun and a can of spray paint? Why doesn't she simply tell her sister someone hacked her email instead of insisting it was her invisible dead husband? And why does she put her family in danger anyway? Character was so bland and dumb you wonder what a genius, albeit a psychopath, saw in her.And speaking of the body count, the character's reactions to the death of a loved one are practically nonexistent. Like the writers couldn't bother with writing a human reaction. So her brother in law's wife is murdered and nothing much in his life seems changed. He's even at work interrogating the supposed murderer. The writers are just too caught up in their cool scenes with special effects of fighting the invisible man. And BTW, that mental hospital scene were the guards realize there is a invisible something they are fighting seemed a little copy cat if the mental hospital scene in Terminator II.So no characters, no smarts. Compare to a horror movie like ""A Quiet Place"", in which the characters are smart, resourceful, and have actual complex human emotions.And I'm getting tired of watching Elizabeth Miss get abused.",The Invisible Man
480,ZuhayrRoha,One of the best modern day Horror+Thriller,9,25 June 2020,"Horror movies are my least favourite genre mainly because of cheap jumpscares and stupid characters & plots.This movie has so much style, amazing camera work. I saw the police & fainting scene and thought they were similar to Upgrade (one of my favourites from 2018). I later realised the director and cinematographer were the same duo for both films. Will be eyeing for more of their films.Elizabeth Moss shines in the role, she carried the whole film with her fantastic portrayal of scared and at the same time, strong feminine. She had some guts to escape and later getting into the same house.
Adrian felt charming and innocent, fantastic delievery of a psychopath. The other side characters were good at what they were given.Thank God I haven't watched the trailer, I stopped watching trailers for non-blockbuster films and wait for reviews or high word of mouth. The movie shocked me so many times.The movie kept me griping, a well crafted thriller indeed. There were some jump scares but they weren't cheap. I loved that the movie kept us with the protagonist and we were discovering with her, I even felt she was the one seeing all this ghost in her head and that was ganna be the last twist. Even with sci-fi elements this movie is highly grounded.The final twist was great, the other twist with sister were well earned shock value. Adrian died poetically just like he killed her sister.I rewatched some of the scenes, I discovered many things, like Adrian's phone wallpaper being hexagonal, invicible gun shaking just like in the end Adrian says. There were many respectful homage to the original version - hat, bandage. The movie sets up many key points in the background which comes into play later.For a few moments in the film, I felt it draged. There were playing with the same substance for too long. The 3rd act felt much quicker but first two acts were hella thrilling. 1st act did a great job of setting up the tone and characters.

Any movie with this rating must be pretty good right? Even though people's movie preferences differ, it must at least be something worthwhile watching one would think and I've always let myself be guided by the IMDB rating to determine if a movie is a time waster or not and it has seldom failed me.Well in this case the IMDB rating is just completely off.The movie is about a battered wife trying to flee from her cruel but brilliant husband. All her previous attempts were failures as he always outsmarted her. When she eventually manages to get away, she is informed by his brother that he is dead and she inherited a handsome amount of money. She starts rebuilding her life glad to be rid of him, although signs start to appear that he may still be around.The Invisible Man is full of cliches. There is nothing here that you have not seen before. The odd twist in the tale is advertised so clearly at the start of the movie that by the time it is revealed, most people would have figured it out long ago.Don't waste your time with this one.

At the beginning it is a thriller of suspense that catches you from the beginning: Gender violence, psychological abuse, drama, tension and manipulation by a gifted psychopath. The film is raised by the magnificent performance of Elisabeth Moss. In the middle it falls and becomes the typical Friday the 13th or Halloween horror movie.

It is one of the better Blumhouse horror films out there, but considering I haven't liked any of their movies except for Halloween. There's some good ideas, but by the end it feels mediocre and confusing. It also went on for another 20 minutes after it actually ended. There's odd camera work that doesn't seem to pay off in any way, odd character beats, and the ending message doesn't seem to work in any way whatsoever, at least not to me. There's confusing plot questions that seem to rack your brain and prevent you from enjoying some decent moments. It's got a more clever approach to the Invisible Man than most other adaptations, but it could have been a much better horror movie, with scarier scenes and scenarios.

489,GODZILLA_Alpha_Predator,"An intense, disturbing sci-fi horror masterpiece about escaping abuse",9,29 February 2020,"Leigh Whannell, known for creating a small but yet effective sci-fi film Upgrade, takes the left-over of a failed cinematic universe and turns it into one of the most intense psychological thrillers I have seen in years.After escaping from her abusive husband Adrian, Cecilia struggles to adjust having her freedom knowing that one day he will find her. And while his apparent suicide may seem good news for her, Cecilia realises soon after strange things start happening her still-living ex has invented an invisibility suit to do one thing: torment her life even more than before.While it is technically another remake of a 1930's horror icon, Leigh Whannell's reboot has more in common in with this generation's social horror thrillers like Black Mirror and Jordan Peele's Us and Get Out. Whannell uses the story of a woman being stalked and gaslighted by her invisible ex-spouse to explore the real-life horror stories that were revealed during #MeToo from victimized and abused woman. While we don't actually see what her toxic relationship with Adrian was like before she left, the story makes sure that we as the audience never question what Cecilla actually believes but to morally question everyone else choosing not to believe her even if the idea of an invisible man sounds crazy. By limiting the actual screen time of the Invisible Man's visible form of Adrian played creepily by Haunting of Hill House's Oliver Jackson Harper, Whannell makes sure that we focus on how damaged and hurt his victim is rather than relate to the title character himself. The story establishes very early on that Adrian's invisibility is not what makes him a monster but his cruel mind games on Cecilia that he feels is justified in his own sick way.Whannell knows in order to make a movie about an unseen assailant scary is to not rely on visuals. Long, drawn-out scenes with no score but with incredible sound design sets in the dreadful atmosphere. Stefan Duscio's cinematography weaponizes wide shots of empty corners, hallways and rooms to show how isolated and vulnerable Cecilia is while making you as audience feel paranoid if Adrian is listening and watching. And once the Invisible man does strike, Whannel crafts his attack sequence in very raw and physically brutal ways to reflect the horror of abusive relationships. Even when we visibly see Adrian wearing the suit that makes him becomes the titled villain, the tech-based design gives off a surprising creepy Lovecraftian feel. Once the score made by Blade Runner 2049's Benjamin Wallfisch does kick in, the mixture of classic orchestral music to loud jarring electronic beats makes the scenes feel even more intense and dreadful then they already are.But what sells the cruelty and terror of the Invisible Man is Elizabeth Moss's amazing performance. The small moments of her joy and happiness she has with her friends and family show what Cecilia's life could be like if she didn't have Adrian controlling it. But once Adrian goes full invisible, Moss makes you feel what is it like to be a victim who feels trapped and hopeless. From her just starring at what appears to be nothing or talking to empty space, we buy that her character is both terrified yet also frustrated with being used or ignored by others. Moss's grounded acting helps keep the movie's premise from going too far into a campy slasher film.The collaboration of Elizabbeth Moss as a performer and Leigh Whannell in the director chair make this modern-day reincarnation of The Invisible Man a true horror masterpiece.",The Invisible Man

Deservedly so, and she continues that for Leigh Whannel's The Invisible Man- An ambitious Psychological Horror that deserves to be ranked among the recent likes of Hereditary, Midsommar and A Quiet Place. Its cinematography, editing and lack of reliance of jump scares are remarkable; Aldis Hodge, Michael Dorman are terrific in terms of cast along with Oliver Jackson-Cohen's antagonist is chillingly real even though he ramps up in science-fiction abilities (or does he?).Under the guise of being a winter scare-coaster, it's more so a timely testament on the terror of domestic violence and the need for women to be believed and saved in the most dire of circumstances.

As she moves through the home and the surrounding property, we figure out that Adrian must be wealthy because the home is amazingly new, large and modern, and the walled-in yard is extravagant. There is also a quick blurb with someone saying he's done very well in the world of optical science.Cecilia's sister, Emily (Harriet Dyer), picks her up on an empty two-lane road near the home, and just as Emily attempts to ask why Cecilia is doing this, Adrian's fist comes through the window and tries to pull Cecilia out of the car. The two just escape his clutches and speed down the road.Cecilia gets dropped off at James Lanier's (Aldis Hodge) home. James is a police officer and lives with his daughter Sydney (Storm Reid). Cecilia feels safe there as we learn that her husband doesn't know about James or where he lives.Cecilia learns that Adrian has committed suicide, which, to Cecilia, seems out of character. Adrian's brother Tom (Michael Dorman) is the executor of Adrian's estate and tells Cecilia that she is to receive $5M in payments.However, strange things begin to happen to Cecilia, and she suspects that Adrian is still alive and invisible. This is the beginning of great acting by Moss to pretend this invisible person is stalking her while trying to convince others that her experiences are real. Yet, this is also where the film begins to wane because we just spend too much time, in different circumstances, watching Cecilia evading an invisible Adrian.We all know how it is going to end, so there is no surprise. However, the way it is handled by Cecilia is good and does add to the enjoyment of the overall film.I didn't think any of the relationships were well developed, which was disappointing. Don't know why Cecilia would even be with Adrian in the first place. Where did Cecilia and James know each other from? What was Tom and Adrian's relationship based upon? The film tried to make the audience believe what was said, but the over subservient way people acted with Adrian seemed out of character.Moss was excellent at portraying fear of an invisible person, and she showed this through her very expressive face. Hodge was wonderful as Cecilia's friend and protector. Dyer was perfect as Cecilia's sister in the way she was protective, questioned, and cared about her sister. Reid was terrific as James's daughter. Dorman was good as Adrian's subservient brother. Leigh Whannell wrote and directed this movie. The writing was good, but the story got old waiting for Cecilia (and the audience) to see Adrian and to get to the end. Part of the problem for me was the lack of character and relationship development.Overall: This film could have been better.",The Invisible Man

I love a twist, but really love double twists! The lead actress totally carried this movie. The camera-work really made you keep your eyes on the screen, even when you really didn't have to. That's smart directing. Thinking back, that actress went through a series of emotions and did awesome.
Personally, if I were invisible, I can think of 10 things I'd do than harass a woman, but then again, I live in a different reality. So glad I saw this. Will recommend.",The Invisible Man
496,blazesuncaster,Probably one of the best horror movie adaptation,8,12 March 2020,"Definitely a really good... sci fi film. It's marketed as a horror movie but in reality, we all know that it's just a really good sci fi movie, there aren't many jump scares, honestly the biggest one was probably the scene with the pooping egg. The ending of the film was very good. Watching this movie, you think to yourself, wow she is an insane person, but we all know she isn't, because us the audience knows that the film is about an invisible man. I could have done with more scary than sci fi, but it did a good job with it. I feel like I got the film spoiled from the trailer because you saw in the trailer the suit when he got the paint all over him. And in the opening scene in the basement of his home, I saw a suit that had the exact same design, so it wasn't. A really shock to me when I found out how he was invisible, so I feel like they could have avoided any sort of spoiler in the trailer. It would have been more enjoyable not knowing how he was invisible from the beginning, the acting was just acting, nothing to spectacular, Elizabeth Moss did a great job capturing an insane person. So I'll give her props for that. I know it sounds like I'm hating on this film, I'm not. I loved it, got to watch it with a group of friends late at night and had a good time.",The Invisible Man
497,DJKwa,A nail-biting thriller that has more on its mind than providing simple thrills.,8,26 February 2020,"What would you do if your abusive ex figured out a way to stalk you without fear of being discovered? That's the conceit at the centre of Leigh Whannell's latest film, The Invisible Man, a nail-biting thriller that has more on its mind than providing simple thrills.Starring Elisabeth Moss as Cecilia Kass, a woman who is rendered helpless in the face of an invisible evil, Whannell spins H.G. Wells classic science fiction novel of the same name into a timely and provocative exploration of psychological abuse.Having escaped from a controlling relationship, Cecilia's rehabilitation is cut short by the sudden intrusion of her ex who has figured out how to regain control over her life without anyone knowing: by becoming invisible.Expertly utilising sci-fi trappings to take gaslighting to a whole new extreme, the film depicts first-hand the anxieties faced by many modern-day survivors of abuse. As Cecilia stresses to those around her that her genius scientist ex has become invisible, we are left conflicted by knowing the truth of her words but also the understanding that, without hard evidence, it's hard to accept her story at face value.By operating in that grey area, The Invisible Man proves the horror genre to be one of the most effective means to reflect modern day anxieties to mass audiences.The trade-off, however, is that by focusing solely on Cecilia's plight, the films feels somewhat underexplained in terms of its villain. Certain actions of his seem straight up superhuman and, without an explanation, it feels as if some logical concessions have been made for dramatic purposes. Granted, to Whannell's credit, he wisely abides by the notion that leaving certain things up to the imagination is better than over explaining to the point of exhaustion.Where so many would-be franchises have failed by focusing too much on setting up sequels, The Invisible Man plays squarely to its strength as a strong, character driven film. Whether it connects to an extended universe remains to be seen, but the film, much like its protagonist, feels much stronger standing on its own.",The Invisible Man

This movie didn't even remind me of Hollow Man.The villain's presence is only made felt to us. For the most part he is not shown. We are effectively told how cruel and cunning he is and it only builds to his character development.The heroine did a wonderful job.There were some plot holes here and there, but I'd forgive it.Avoiding the cliches and giving us an entertaining flick in itself is big achievement. Kudos to the team.",The Invisible Man
500,lukas-ingel,Impactful and to remember,10,27 March 2020,"Very intense atmosphere with great cinematography. Excellent performances. I was expecting nothing after the trailers but then some reviewers talked it up for me and said it was nothing like the trailers. As my curiousity lead me to experience, it wasn't like shown. You have actually seen very little of the movie, and the context, build-ups etc. are incredible. The trailer really makes you think you've seen the whole thing and that it's kinda cheesy, but I'm so glad that was not the case at all as I'd been told.
One thing I really want to touch on is the writing... Having seen a horrible relationship up close where the guy would do the craziest stuff to keep her around while trying to control her, isolate her and make up insane lies about things and people from his own life, stalking, hiding around the house watching her and surprise her to see what she was doing etc., this movie just hit it right on. You cannot truly appreciate the writing and the meaning behind everything and how it touches upon it perfectly with not one moment misused, if you have not seen something like it happen up close. This story is a brilliant way of portraying this sort of dangerous, doomed relationship and trying to get out of it, and for that alone I'm glad it exists. Both as an obvious warning but also a powerful character played by Elisabeth Moss, a character I hope many will find aspiration in and will be remembered throughout the years. No feminazi agenda against men or making women superior for all the insecure people out there believing that. If anything, this movie encourages trust and fight together. Very good representation in all aspects and it doesn't rub it in your face, it all happens organically as it should.
As a movie and a piece of entertainment of course, it worked brilliantly. I hear talk about plot holes and I've got to be laughing. Either the people neglect talking about what plot holes there is (because *shock* there isn't really anything to be talking about as much of the relevant material is shown in the movie or indicated), or they refer to stuff that can be easily explained such as how an invisible man can come from place to place... Ehm, watch the movie.
A bunch of neckbeards are coming for The Invisible Man because things might get too personal for them or rather, too impersonal, but luckily it seems we are enough who can actually see the intent and are enjoying it. It truly does have Hitchcock elements and feels in terms of style, atmosphere and characters. A great homage and way to modernize a famous character, keeping a big present-day impact and showing not all monsters want the end of the world...but will go there if you try to escape them.BONUS: Perfect use of film score from start to finish.",The Invisible Man

A story of an abused woman trying to escape her abusive ex, but it brings in a classic universal monster at the same time. Elizabeth Moss' performance is so captivating, I'd be shocked if the academy ignores it come nomination time. I really hope this isn't another Toni Collett in Hereditary situation. I'd also really love for this to get a screenplay nomination, it brought The Invisible Man into modern day, and made it original (thank you Dead Meat Podcast for that quote). The score was solid as well, classical yet electronic and scary. Some of the shots reminded me of Paranormal Activity (burning pan similar to ouija board, and pulling off the covers). Also, sound Adrian made sounds kind of like the Predator from Predator. Finally, two twists in the movie, and neither were expected! Overall great movie.",The Invisible Man

506,pink_floydilia,Starts of strong and then it loses the general plot,6,19 March 2020,"I went in with zero expectations because usually over hyped films are just that. However this one started off strong, had some interesting concepts and then the general idea just went off the rails. It's like a weird, sci-fi, overly political attempt of remaking Double Jeopardy.Moss' portrayal of Cecilia was outstanding and that's probably the only redeeming quality of this film overall.Some characters just have no depth, like the part that irked me the most was the daughter who was clearly slapped by something invisible and she just blames Cecilia without any kind of attempt to understand what happened. Had she not been bffs with her the entire time leading up to this, one could believe that reaction to be normal. But the whole movie is filled with out of character moments from all the big players. Just weird.The sci-fi aspect was pretty cool. I have to say I liked that more than if it was paranormal. However the ideas became clunky, clumsy dialogue didn't help and then there was a bit of a messy ending that didn't really work with the rest of the film.The development of Cecilia from battered woman to bad ass was a bit too quick which I suppose had to be done for a movie but I would have liked a longer time lapse after 'Adrian's death'.Not a fantastic movie, but still worth a watch.",The Invisible Man

The heroine grappling and being thrown around by an invisible force looked cheesy on more than one occasion.The dinner scene with her sister though...that was crazy.Overall, this movie starts off with an incredible opening scene, slowly builds up the tension again, and unleashes it in a way that does get heavy-handed at times.The ending also felt a little unresolved and cobbled together.8.5/10.

There was one moment in particular where, for no apparent reason, a jump scare was accompanied by a Generic Horror Monster Scream #3.What the film does really well is use the medium of film. That's only enough to bump up it's quality a little bit in my mind, but it is still good. The camera lingers on empty space or even turns away from the main character to watch an empty room. This builds suspense and leaves the audience wondering if the room is really empty - if there's something malevolent in the void.All in all, not bad, but not a knock out.",The Invisible Man

I was waiting to be scared witless by The Invisible Man and although I was'nt, I still quite enjoyed this taut little thriller. Props to all the actors in this. The only one I knew was the exceptionally talented Elizabeth Moss. The rest of the small cast were not big names, or any names tbf. However, the acting was a cut above for this type of movie. I cared what happened to these people and that's rare. The directing was tight and the story an interesting sci fi spin on the H G Wells classic story, acting good as I've said above, but the movie just did'nt scare. The tension is ramped up and then the pay off is disappointing. A man in a high tech suit is just not really scary on any level. The original story had the scientist actually making himself invisible without the use of any prop. That would have been better. In this outing, the suit can be damaged quite easily, thus the protagonist is oftened revealed at key moments, which kind of cuts the drama. It passed a couple of hours in a ho hum way but an actress of the calibre of Elizabeth Moss really needs better than this potboiler.

Not what I anticipated.,4,27 September 2020,"The Invisible Man (2020) is either a stalker's dream fantasy that ends badly (he dies) or an abused wife's nightmare that finally ends by getting revenge (the happy ending?). A simplistic plot already done dozens of times but with high tech eye candy and loads of bloody violence tossed in to gloss over a sophomoric ""plot."" Either way, the movie left me sad and empty because someone should have done worthwhile with the plot. Some people may like a simple good vs bad bloody revenge movie so enjoy, but I'm looking for good old hubris as used in previous Invisible Man versions. What should have been done was make everyone a ""dirty shirt in the drawer."" Make the scientist an average guy who has an invisible technology that is his ""ship"" finally coming in after years of solitary work. Surround him with a perfidious wife, covert Government agencies, and duplicitous business partners who want to take the money and run. Have the scientist use a small version (mini drones) of his invisibility technology to discover he's being screwed on all fronts and decides he going to win. The scientist builds an invisibility suit and killer drones on his own dime and starts to get even, spy, and make money dishonestly (goes from being a lamb into a lion). Toss in a true friend who warns of hubris. In the end everyone gets his or her comeuppance and everyone loses due to hubris, greed, and not being honest. The ""winners"" end up being the world because the invisibility technology is leaked, but quickly realize everything will now end up worse because nothing is now secret or secure.

524,someokiedude,This is how you remake a movie everybody!,8,2 March 2020,"Believe it or not, I was in an abusive/toxic relationship, no not with a girl and it was actually a friendship. It's quite embarrassing to admit that you've been abused, and I must say that I'm still reluctant to call it abuse, but it was a very toxic and destructive friendship and I'm glad that I got out when I did. But years of shame, self-hatred, and eventually acceptance fell upon me as I had to deal with a multitude of emotions that were difficult, but I came out of it a stronger man. So I definitely could relate to how this woman felt, the fear and the paranoia that can eat you from the inside out.Hearing that Leigh Whannell was taking on a new version of The Invisible Man, I was excited to hear about it. His last film Upgrade, was an excellent, if not under-appreciated science fiction grindhouse thriller and I had a feeling that he could bring a new flare into the concept of an invisible man, and to that, he certainly does. Whannell once more proves that he is a filmmaker to be experienced and he once more creates a chilling and eerily fascinating film.To get some of the more obvious praises out of the way, the acting of this film are excellent. While in previous Invisible Man films, the actual Invisible Man is more of a tragic character. He's not very nice, sure, but he was simply trying to find a way to reverse his condition, going mad once he realizes that there is no way. The Invisible Man in this film is simply a monster, and we don't even really get to see him all that much but his presence looms over the entirety of the film, to good effect. Elizabeth Moss is also fantastic in this film, I felt bad for her character and I genuinely wanted her to get out of this safely and get back at the monster whose made her life a living hell. The way that Moss also conveys her character's fear and paranoia is also seamless, I never felt for a second that she was acting fearful and paranoid, she simply conveyed that she was fearful and paranoid. I also appreciated the genuine chemistry that Moss' character had with her friends and sister also felt real and you truly began to root for these characters and hope that they all get out ok.As films like The Shining, Alien, and No Country For Old Men have demonstrated, silence can sometimes be much more effective in conveying suspense and tension, and Whannell understands this to a tee. I thought that the quiet moments were far more effective in building suspense rather than the loud, bombastic moments, though Whannell also takes a note from John Carpenter in how to combine loud and quiet moments without losing the viewer's attention. Though also, the music and score of this film also conveys the looming tension and suspense that adds to this film's diabolical atmosphere.This is how you remake a classic everyone. Give something new to say rather than rehashing the old, tired tropes that have been done to death, and Whannell proves that he make mostly anything into something interesting, even if it is a story that we've heard our fair share of times.",The Invisible Man

526,kmjnhh123,When No One Believes You,9,5 March 2020,"Finally a fresh new idea for a film that hasn't been done many times before & its done very well.The film is very good at setting the tone for the audience, you may say its not a horror, but when something invisible is haunting you, something you cant see is there, it really plays on the mind of the audience & Cecilia (Played by Elisabeth Moss), she does a amazing job of playing that crazy mind person throughout the film where no one believes her, because lets face it, if something is invisible, you would never believe someone until they slip up or be less careful when being invisible. In terms of the film maybe being called horror, its not the usual type of blood & ghosts type of horror, it is purely something you cant see, which in its self is tormenting enough, just imagine having something invisible in real life haunting you & playing on your mind over & over till you crack & got no where to hide.The story makes sense, Cecilia's partner is a world leader in optical science but is very controlling in relationships & Cecilia try's to escape that life, but he ends up using his invisible tech to his advantage & use it against Cecilia. Cecilia has no idea on what to do at first to beat him, but she soon learns on how to finally reveal where he is, using paint at one point to reveal the suit he is using, she also uses some clever tactics like putting coffee granules on the floor because if he steps on the coffee it will leave a footprint showing where he is, so they defiantly thought of different ideas to catch him.There is a few big twists in the film which we did not expect, so we literally had to rethink what was going on until they revealed what the plot twist was, it was very clever & thought out. Now with a film like this there was some bloopers we kinda picked up on but tbh we weren't to sure on what the actual answer was so we just left it.We watched the film in Superscreen 2D & the bigger screen was nice to fill more of that empty space in the film, the enhanced sound was nice as well for the eery sounds.Overall though a really good film that totally refreshes the scary genre of films & films like this don't often come along so this is a deffo watch.Age - 25Cinema: Cineworld Milton Keynes Superscreen 2D (Unlimited Card)Watch, Avoid, Consider: Watch 100%.",The Invisible Man
527,warren-87235,"Pretty Good, but not Great",7,22 July 2020,"This version of The Invisible Man tale uses the hook of a controlled/abused spouse escaping their partner, who in turn is able to torment them whilst invisible. This adds a unique twist to the interpretation of this classic and is one of its strongest points.The updated story-line has garnered quite a bit of praise for The Invisible Man, but unfortunately _just_ hitting the correct topic buttons in the year of a film's release does not necessarily a good movie make.There are problems, but they are more to do with the execution. Quite often things are not explained when they need to be. For example, we get the impression that once Cecilia (played by Elisabeth Moss) escapes her abusive spouse, she stays with a friend of her sister, but we're not really given any details. It just ends up feeling as though she's staying with a random stranger who has inexplicably accepted her into his house and home along with his teenage daughter. Perhaps there's a throwaway line that explains it more clearly but, if so, it's easy to miss, as I've seen the same complaint from others.Then there are logic problems... The examples below are far from being the only ones, but they are of the most obvious.1 - At one point we see the invisible man's breath, whilst outside in the cold. It makes for an unsettling and effective moment. However, when we discover _how_ he is maintaining his invisibility, we realise this should not be possible. He is fully covered, head-to-toe, in such a way as to imply his breath should not escape in this way. You could just about excuse this for dramatic effect, but let's move on...2 - There's an incident where Cecilia tips paint on his head and shoulders. Within moments, the invisible man has run to the sink, washed himself, and is once again _completely_ invisible. Remember, whilst doing this he would not have been able to see himself, in order to see the areas he needed to wash off.3 - At one point, Cecilia gets hold of her 'dead' husband's phone, which contains photos of her sleeping. She clearly could not have taken these herself, and they prove the existence of a stalker which would in turn prove she is not imagining things. What does she do? She leaves it. She doesn't even send the photos to her own phone.4 - The invisible man appears to have been hiding out in the attic space. How does he get up and down without drawing attention? He certainly couldn't leave the ladder out, that Cecilia herself required to gain access.5 - During an excursion to her old home, she finds a second, spare invisibility suit, and then hides it at a time when she could have used it. Perhaps, you think, she did not know enough about the technology and how it works, or if it would even fit her, and therefore didn't take the risk. This is actually pretty logical. But then at the conclusion she does exactly this, in a situation of far less urgency. She also manages it very quickly.6 - And finally... During several scenes Cecilia has the upper hand, but conveniently pulls back or just outright waits to give her stalker whatever time he needs. There are quite a few of these moments (the paint spilling being one of them), but the most egregious is near the end, where the invisible man takes out a selection of useless security guards. Throughout this whole scene, Cecilia rests on the floor, watching, with a gun lying on the floor beside her. Only _after_ the last guard is defeated (bearing in mind that it has taken some time for the invisible man to work his way through all of them), does she pick it up and take a shot.One could excuse some of this behaviour by saying that it's part of her difficulty and fear at taking action against her abuser, but in these scenes she is shown as already having found the strength and will-power to fight back. She may be afraid, but there is no implication of _debilitating_ fear. Instead, she handily waits so that the action can unfold in the plot-required way, otherwise the story would finish too soon.Elisabeth Moss does well as Cecilia, although sometimes she feels a little one-note, though that could be down to the director and script. As for the rest of the cast, none of them really stand out, but that's not really a flaw. This is Cecilia's story, and the rest of the cast aren't really that important besides driving events where necessary.Visually it's well filmed, and builds tension effectively. Beyond that, it's a fairly average but enjoyable take on The Invisible Man story. Did I enjoy it? Yes, it wasn't a bad movie, but I certainly won't feel the need to re-watch it, and I don't feel it deserves the level of praise it gets. This is the 2020 equivalent of a fun little '80s straight-to-video thriller.",The Invisible Man

However, how difficult is it to create suspense when the audience knows there is a potential perperator who can't be seen?What this movie lacks is giving the audience the opportunity to assess how they would deal with an invisible attacker. I spent half the film internally screaming ""throw some flour at him!""I wont go into the plot holes as they'll give too much away, but the main problem with the movie is 2/3rds of the way through when it switches genre from thriller to comicbook like sci fi. From that moment the film loses all credibility and becomes a predictable mess.Elisabeth Moss is cast well as her facial reactions suit the subtle suspense in the early parts of the film, but the other charecters could be played by mannequins and you wouldn't know the difference.If you watch this filming hoping for cleverly cinematic invisibility scenarios I would urge you not to bother and as just a thriller it is not worth the time.",The Invisible Man
530,politicidal,Suspenseful and stylish update of a classic science fiction story.,8,3 September 2020,"Leigh Whannell takes what could had been a laughably trashy redux of Hollow Man and instead crafts an excellent horror movie.When a frightened Cecilia (Moss) leaves her abusive and wealthy boyfriend (Jackson-Cohen), she's terrified about reprisals from him. But instead she receives word he committed suicide which should comfort her. Unfortunately, Cecilia begins to notice strange things when by herself.Much of the movie is resting on Elisabeth Moss' shoulders as the tormented Cecilia seeking escape from a dark past. And she is great. The psychological anguish and dread that Moss conveys is gut-wrenching at times. The underrated Aldis Hodge has a supporting role as her faithful friend. Oliver Jackson-Cohen (The Haunting of Hill House) is literally not onscreen much but he's an intimidating presence.Whannell's direction is cool and confident. Some may consider the movie a tad too long but I thought it was effective at building the suspense and dread. It's a wonder how good this movie is when it could had easily been so stupid and pointless.",The Invisible Man

Some of the things I saw coming and other things I didn't. This is a very creepy movie and it does a great job of making you feel just as paranoid as Elizabeth Moss' character. The scenes with the titular Invisible Man are visually impressive and they look just as slick as something you would see in a MCU movie. So kudos to the special effects team for creating something slick on a 7 million dollar budget. I won't spoil the ending but it was very karmic.

The other actors just got a passing D, nothing special about them.The plot is not bad, a psycho genius in optics makes a suit that turns him and his brother invisible, driving the woman he is obsessed with, Cecilia (Moss), crazy.How it all ends up, that is for you to find out.Yes, there are holes in the story. Some things do not click at all, just as the killing of Cecilia's sister at the restaurant, or the punching of the daughter of James (Hodge).

It portrays a toxic and abusive relationship very well and Moss gets across the pain she went through without us even seeing it. The Invisible Suit thing can be slightly cheesy, but it doesn't hurt the message of the movie. It is very well made. The production design is amazing and the action is pretty intense as well.

In an action flick like Die Hard things happen that never take place in real life, but somehow they could be true. Being invisible is no such thing. Almost everyone has had some fantasy, usually early in life, of what it would be like to be invisible or to fly. So although it is impossible and even unimaginable the concept has a strong attraction. In this movie Cecilia's husband haunts her after she ran away. The plot makes this more or less plausible by having him - as an expert for optics - design a suit that accomplishes just that: being invisible. The effects of this when he ""shows up"" are quite scary and even as a skeptic for this kind of thing I found myself fascinated. And then we have this great actress, Elisabeth Moss. Maybe without her it would have been a different movie, but as it is I enjoyed it and just take the ""impossible"" for granted. Also the plot leads to an interesting and unexpected end.",The Invisible Man
542,dazjohnson,Don't bother,2,29 May 2020,A quick start (to rushed) an abused women attempts to escape her husband who has been terrorising and abusing her over a period of Time.It doesn't bother to show any evidence of this so how are we meant to care for the character from the outset. She escapes from him anyway aided by her sister who waiting for her as her getaway driver and ends up staying with her cop friend and his daughter who we don't know why she's staying there as surely more logical to stay her with her sister maybe I missed something there. Then after a couple weeks as gone by we are lead to believe the husband as killed himself and as left her five million dollars in his will over four years in installments (how considerate he doesn't want her to waste it) at the reading she then has a letter from him read out by his brother saying why did you leave me etc. From beyond the grave he begins to reak havoc again on her with a variety of acts what were quite simply hilarious at times. Elizabeth Moss is basically acting by herself most of the first half of the movie.(not very well) If this is meant to be scary it fails dismally. Many people hated Kevin Bacon's version of the invisible man (Hollow Man) but I'd take that over this miserable attempt any day of the week. After an hour you will be wondering shall I just leave now! but like me you will probly finish it and wonder why you did. I hated this film!! Please don't bother you have been warned by me and many others on here. Why has it got so many good reviews I asked myself because like me I believed the hype and ended up with this crap. And to top it off he wasn't even an invisible man it was a costume he had invented that he was wearing! NO science here! as were lead to believe earlier in the movie he was easily capable of making himself invisible so don't get me started there is so much I could say on that subject in terms of plot holes.

543,mulcahyj-07545,Surprisingly brilliant!,8,31 October 2020,"Another Invisible Man movie from the original source of the classic book and played by Claude Raines to Chevy Chase. I wasn't expecting much but it gripped me from the first scene. Without giving anything away (SO NO SPOILERS HERE) it is obvious that the focus, pun not intended, is from a woman in a terrible marriage. From that point the scifi element is almost, obviously not completely, pushed aside and it becomes a psychological horror thriller of a woman who may be brinking on insanity from two points of view really. One being characters attitude to her and the other you doubting whether she can mentally cope with her situation and obstacles.
There is not a huge cast in this plot so the actors all have big roles to play and they do so brilliantly in the demands a screenplay requires. As for directorship and cinematography it is all done very well.I honestly can't praise this film enough so giving it a huge 8/10. It is almost grueling than enjoyable and heightens towards a enthralling climax. The script takes the original source, rips it up and throws it out the window and creates a psychological horror/thriller. Or thriller/horror.

Even with all the spoilers in the trailer you still get a few surprises and unexpected twists. Plus writer/director Leigh Whannell, shows as with his previous film Upgrade, that he can bring a fresh new approach to well used stories. But the key element here has to be Elizabeth Moss, who puts in a great performance as the traumatized girlfriend trying to escape years of domestic abuse. It's a shame with such a good actor that film did not go with a more subtle and ambiguous approach, to keep audiences guessing. A bit overlong for a jump scare shocker, but thankfully never reliant on too much dumbness.",The Invisible Man
547,mkquinn91,"Great elements, but a poor story",5,8 June 2020,"The acting and directing are good, but they're in service of a B-movie script. It's full of plot holes, weird character choices, and dumb twists. The invisibility suit must also have teleportation powers, because otherwise I have no idea how this man gets around. And the invisible scares sometimes fall into moments of unintentional hilarity: I honestly laughed out loud when the sister's throat is slit and the knife magically ends up in Cecilia's hand. And the double (triple?) twist at the end is just obnoxious.The worst part of the story is that it relies on one of the worst tropes of horror or thrillers: a victim of a conspiracy rambling about their persecution with a wild-eyed intensity rather than acting rationally and calmly, immediately discrediting themselves. Especially with a victim of domestic violence, such a trope is a massive disservice to the character.If you want to see a great movie about invisibility and female abuse, check out The Entity. The effects and direction are just as impressive, and the lead character acts like a sane person.",The Invisible Man
548,ashecatlin,Great movie just not that rewatchable,8,24 October 2020,"There is no doubt that this is a great film, though I wouldn't say it's the most rewatchable film. I've watched it 3 times this year, the first was utterly phenomenal, the second was decent and whilst I enjoyed it a lot more the third time, it simply didn't pull me in as much as watching it the first time.I'd say it has the same effect The Dark Knight has were it's a masterpiece in the genre, but when you're sitting down wanting to watch something simpler to enjoy, this isn't exactly what you're going to go for.After watching all the other Universal Invisible Man movies, this is clearly the best if not second best to the original. They're very different movies so it's hard to compare, on the third watch I'd say I preferred the original more just because it was a bit more quirky.Elizabeth Moss provides a great performance in this, it's just not that interesting when rewatching it. I myself loving the bits where she had someone to bounce off of, even it it was the invisible man. I do love the fact the actor actually wore the green screen suit to do all of his bits, instead of just being the guy to show up in the beginning and the end as the character, he was the same all around and I really appreciate that.So yeah it's a great movie, just not something I would watch multiple times a year. I did notice a plot hole this time, when the sister comes in with the news that Adrian is dead it's a news website, how did that happen? Being that he faked his own death I get the brother bits where he saying he's dead and pretending he's in the urn but for it to be on a third party website came off as a bit weird. Being that at the end it shows that he was tied up under his house, if that was the case why where the police sent to search that area being that he was supposed to be dead. It just felt a little off, as I said the brother and the whole solicitor thing made sense, they could do that. But the media and the police, it just contradicts itself.",The Invisible Man

Her fear of Griffin tells us a lot about the power dynamic of the relationship and also serves as a metaphor for a certain type of toxic male. However, we soon are into the thriller aspect - Cecile believes Griffin has developed the ability to become invisible and is stalking her. Is she crazy?
For me this film worked incredibly well. Such a tense and anxiety inducing film, with a few shock scares and a thoughtful ending. Really engrossing and enjoyable. Moss is predictably excellent.

Several scenes in this movie are absolutely horrifying, despite the lack of jump scares, with a perfect atmosphere created by Leigh Whanell. The Invisible Man's antics are incredibly disturbing and cause anxiety for the viewer as well as the characters and the dominance he has over Elizabeth Moss' Celicia, even in death, is unbelievably sickening. Elizabeth Moss is absolutely outstanding in the lead role, delivering a wonderful performance, which causes the viewer to truly buy the trauma her character suffers. However, this movie really slips in quality during the third act. During which, the perfect psychological horror movie, this film was about to become, is destroyed. The third act involves an incredibly confusing plot twist and a completely ridiculous plot device that causes the movie to dip way too much into science fiction.

What if you have this feeling that you can never get away from their abuse no matter how far you run or where you hide.

In a few words The film is about how Cecilia ran away from her husband Adrian who was an abuser, after a time she finds out that he committed suicide, but she discovers that it is not so and that he is now invisible and is going to do the hell life. This begins with a scene in which Cecilia is escaping from her house, and this secuence seemed to me well accomplished because thanks to the details you understand what kind of man her husband was, so that he wants to flee from that life full of luxuries, You can understand why he is doing all that, then we are introduced to the people close to Cecilia who would be victims of Adrian's plan. Adrian or the Invisible Man could have me a well-written villain, I admire how the writers managed that the film did not need flashbacks for you to understand what kind of man he was. The way in which Cecilia is tormented despite the fact that at certain times it is more comical than terrifying, seems creative to me, the film makes, in certain scenes, feel the discomfort that the protagonist feels that she is being watched, harassed, what Which manages to generate tension, all this is reinforced with the convincing performance of Elisabeth Moss. Part of the bad of the film would be involved in act three, since it is the one that brings more conveniences, and things that are the opposite of real life (Apart from the action scenes, the special effects are somewhat bad ), for example those who have already seen it will know what I mean when I say that it is too much strength that they gave to the invisible man, nowhere in the film do they give you a sense that this trajectory gives superhuman strength, I know being invisible is a more difficult opponent to fight, but the way Cecilia's friend James defeats him is so unreal, the only thing you can say is ""So much muscle for nothing"", there are also the typical Cliches that the villain is going to kill someone important to the protagonist but due to his slowness salvation comes just in time, this can be applied in the scene where the invisible man is going to kill to kill Sidney the daughter of James, since although previously l or we saw mercilessly kill a group of guards at once, it does not do with Sidney and surprise comes salvation just in time. The end of this movie is interesting because of the way it is executed, but I find certain time contradictions in the way Cecilia kills Adrián, if it enters what they were trying to tell us, it is that Cecilia acts acting through the This rules because I knew you would never admit to being guilty, after all he's a manipulator, but how could he get to the trajectory and then shut it down so quickly? Maybe fans will start to come up with theories that someone else was actually wearing the suit, but I'm sorry I won't swallow it. Also, despite the fact that I said that the film manages to create tension at certain times, to be honest, it ended as fast as it could and never came back. ""The Invisible Man"" is not a smart movie with a complex plot, but it is a movie that manages to create tension at certain times and is perfect to see if what you are looking for is above average entertainment.",The Invisible Man

This movie is horrible, full of plot-holes, characters and stories both didn't get proper development, illogical story line. Let's see what's we have here:1. Incomprehensible acts doing by the main character (and everybody else in this movie, but MC was the most annoying here) for ex. there are so many chances for her to have evidences needed to uncover and revealed the truth but she always did the opposite and made the story more...complicated (or let's say, stupid)2. There's no background story of MC and Adrian to convince us about their problematic relationship and how things ended up like it did. Why Adrian was so obsessed with her?never explained.3. Every element such as characters or stories told by the MC herself narratively. I think there should be a better way to unfold the plot, yet they choose the most boring one : let the MC describes about the whole plot4. Near the end of the movie, there was a scene revealed the villain killed and Adrian locked in the room to show that he was innocent from the beginning. I didn't buy it, nobody impressed by it.

582,saeedahmedsasoli,All this was a terrific film.,10,20 November 2020,"This movie definitely scares you. It's not just jumpscares or loud noises, it's something psychological. From the first opening shot, you're immediately put inside Elisabeth Moss' character Cecilia's head. She is stuck in an abusive relationship and can't get out of it. The whole opening scene makes you uncomfortable as we see Cecilia trying to make her escape. This kind of tension is kept on throughout the film.Another thing this film succeeds upon is the writing. The story progresses in a fast paced way which doesn't seem hurried. The 2hr runtime feels achieved. There's definitely more than one 'WTF' moment in this film to keep you on the edge of your seat.The score and the sound design definitely puts you in Cecilia's shoes as you struggle with her to point out where exactly the invisible man might be. The camera work is exquisite, I mean did we really doubt the director who brought us Upgrade? The action sequences definitely feel thrilling and the way it's shot makes you feel like you're living it.I thought about it a lot and I can't really think of anything that didn't work. Some of you might complain about the camera work and how it focuses on the actor's faces more than the action but to me that worked. I think that definitely sold the drama.

584,tpkrause1,The Invisible Man meets Gaslight,8,3 March 2020,"The movie was very good, in my opinion. A fun watch. Full of suspense, twists, great acting, and interesting surprises. I think Elizabeth Moss is extremely talented, and this was a great showpiece for her, demonstrating her strong ability to carry a movie pretty much on her own. The scary parts were scary, suspenseful, and the pay-offs were gory enough to be billed as horror.I could have used more cool invisibility effects, more creative methods for finding the invisible man, and less of the flashing stuff. The explanation of his invisibility was fine with me; any more, in my opinion, would have detracted from the main story line. The man's obsession was never fully developed or understood, and that bugged me more than under developing the invisibility stuff.This really had very little to do with the book, except for a few nods to the source material, but it stands on its own as a completely separate story with interesting, fleshed out characters. It was like elements of the Invisible Man mixed with Gaslight, an old play about a husband driving his wife crazy. Both are interesting, scary concepts and the ideas blended nicely.",The Invisible Man
585,jg_1977,A soon-to-be horror classic,8,28 February 2020,"It's quite rare that a remake of a classic film ever reaches the same heights as the original, and even rarer for the updated version to surpass its predecessor. The Invisible Man (2020) is that rare remake. Leigh Whannell's follow up to 2018's Upgrade (a fantastic grind house sci-fi thriller) was always going to be an uphill battle, especially since he chose to adapt a classic novel that was made into one of the most iconic horror films of the 20th century. I personally had high expectations for this movie after seeing what Whannell did on Upgrade, and can thankfully say that he did not disappoint. The Invisible Man is a great movie, not a perfect movie, but damn near close. When judging the film against its apparent goals, it's hard not to tick off all of the boxes: it is legitimately suspenseful and scary, it actually has something deep to say that is thematically woven throughout, and the technical aspects of the film are expertly crafted. I'll address each of these points individually, starting with the horror elements. Whannell is no amateur when it comes to horror, and that is quite apparent in this film. He seems to understand the basic, yet often forgotten concept that is essential to any horror film: the audience must care about the character who is in danger for it to be scary, and you have to slowly ratchet up the tension throughout the scenes so that when the jump scare comes, it feels earned. Whannell wrote Elizabeth Moss' character Cecilia to be incredibly sympathetic, a victim of an abusive relationship who only wants to get her life back, yet he never strayed too far to make her seem helpless. We understand right away that she is smart, determined, and capable, but still vulnerable. This balance is executed perfectly thanks to Whannell's tight writing and Moss' stellar performance. This serves the horror aspects of the film so well, not only because you care when Cecilia is danger, but because since she isn't completely helpless, the audience can intuit that her stalker ex-boyfriend is that much more threatening to make her so unnerved. This movie also suited my taste quite well, in that more time was spent building suspense than throwing jump scares at the audience. When the jump scares do come, it's after the tension has been heightened to a fever-pitch so the resulting scare is amplified and legitimately frightening. Moving onto the deeper theme that motivates the action and horror, again Whannell knocks it out of the park. Abuse, gaslighting, and PTSD are real world problems that the audience can relate to, and Whannell ties them in perfectly with the antagonist of the titular invisible man. The whole idea works as a metaphor just as well as it does as a horror movie: women get tormented physically and psychologically by men in ways that the rest of the world can't see, and often are labeled as crazy because of it. This thematic statement is evident through every twist and turn the plot takes, every scare sequence, and every choice a character makes, and as a result, elevates the movie from good to great. Finally, I would be remiss if I didn't gush about the technical mastery that Whannell displays here. After seeing Upgrade, I knew that he had inventive and thrilling ways to stage and shoot action, so I was excited to see what he did in a horror setting. Throughout the film, and particularly in suspenseful scenes, Whannell's takes are long and lingering, often meander away from the subject to show an empty chair, or open doorway, before panning back to Cecilia. This tactic is brilliant because as the camera wanders around a space, seemingly showing nothing at all, the audience is on the edge of their seats, wondering if that empty chair actually has an invisible man sitting in it. This is just one way that Whannell uses the concept to adapt his visual style in a unique and effective way, but there are countless more scattered throughout including the return of the fixed-tracking shot fight scenes that he used so well in Upgrade. The Invisible Man is a meticulously crafted film, with a powerful and relevant message, that never fails to put the audience on edge and then scare the hell out of them. I wouldn't be surprised if in 5 or 10 years, this movie is considered to be one of the modern classics among others such as 28 Days Later, Get Out, and Midsommar. Go see this movie in theaters, it is well worth it.",The Invisible Man

I finally put it on last night and while the beginning half was very ""pro-this and that"", the 'thrills' were great and I decided to go along with it, in fact, I kind of liked it so far. HOWEVER, that movie should've ended in the mental hospital, when they strapped her to the bed and injected her - Maybe when the doctor shut the door, the light should've flickered, or something, as some indication of is it? Was he?? Or even drag it to court where she has to try to prove her innocence.. I don't know, something better than what we got.
To me, trying to prove your innocence when all signs point to your guilt, is scary enough!
I think keeping it vague would've been A LOT better than the ""Offred-y"" ending we got, with Elizabeth Moss's extreme close up and all that 'messaging'.
I hate messaging in movies, it's just instant cringe for me, it ruins any story that is trying to be told.

And you feel bad for the protagonist (Elizabeth Moss) because she's been through so much trauma and is innocent the whole time and it makes you want other people in the movie to believe she's being tormented by an invisible force.

And, and try to perform, although I'm not crazy, but everyone else thinks I'm crazy. The combination of male PUA and domestic violence with this traditional horror theme is also dense, at least reasonable and reasonable. The end of the deal is still very feminist, very enjoyable.

To give a fair assessment, this movie is on the same level as the 2010 Wolfman remake. I am not sure why they needed to go with an R rating when clearly, it wasn't used to its full potential in both these films and especially in the Invisible Man.It would have been fair to have put The Invisible Man under the category of Sci-Fil/Action/Thriller rather than Horror. It has a decent start but like most other recent films, loses its plot after the halfway mark. Starting from the mental hospital sequence, there is little that makes sense and the plot becomes akin to a slice of Swiss cheese.

617,JICNZ,Boring and Utterly Predicable,1,2 July 2021,"Watching Elizabeth Moss writhe around in an empty room is not my idea of entertainment. Obviously, for most of the movie the husband is invisible, so there she is, flinging herself around with nothing else to watch.Moss is far too dull and plain an actor to have as the only thing on screen. The whole premise of this movie is predicated on the fact that the husband can't let her leave him. So, billionaire with a genius-level brain who's invented something that would change the entire world is fixated on Elizabeth Moss? It's not even credible. Even the filmmakers know this is daft and so throw in a line that he can't let her leave because she's the only one who has left. Yeah. Try harder, scriptwriter. When there are other characters on screen, notably a cop, his daughter and Moss's sister, the dialogue is weirdly chunky and badly delivered. It's as if the actors kept missing their cues and stood around glancing nervously at each other... you, go on, it's you next. Very odd. The storyline which did work well was underplayed: everyone else thought Moss was crazy. It would have been nice (as another review has pointed out here) if they'd played it with more ambiguity so we, the audience, aren't sure whether she's going mad or being driven mad.So, another waste of time movie from Hollywood.",The Invisible Man

Elisabeth Moss presents a compelling performance, which is probably something we can continue to expect. The film is also greatly assisted by Benjamin Wallfisch's incredible score, something he does very well. So we have all these top notch assets, and still the movie doesn't go far enough. The plot twist wasn't very confusing, but lacked elaboration. The question that comes with all twists is left unanswered. How? How did they do it?

626,gadfeal,"Thriller-Horror twist to previous goody-two-shoes versions of ""Invisible Man""",7,25 September 2021,"When I first read the title, I thought, ""Lordie, not ANOTHER remake for a younger audience who know little about cinematic history - with CGI and slick digital cinematography, loud annoying background music but two-dimensional characters!""However, I was pleasantly surprised at a psychological-thriller that's NOT ridiculously gory, and in which the ""invisibility"" was just one element of the plot.The premise starts with a rich couple with an uber controlling husband, whom the wife leaves. Soon after, mayhem follows her, sight unseen, leading up to the apparent murder of her own sister in a restaurant, and her apparently stark raving ""mad"", screaming about an unseen malevolence.As it turns out, the husband had two prototypes of a form fitting cloaking suit, which he and his lawyer brother used. The only reason that he was ""caught"" was that he made his wife pregnant after his faked death, and her leaving him was the first time someone had stood up to him; sort of like a woman rejecting Donald and he turns like a diapered baby crying to get her attention thereafter.Plot Holes. Since this is a fantasy, I cannot truly fault the ""suspension of reality"" BUT, with the psychological twists so well written, it's just a pity that the technical narrative was so amateurish by comparison.1. The moment one determines that the person is ""invisible"", as ""Hollow Man"" had in its plot, infra-red cameras or googles should have been immediately considered. After the brother had been killed (revealed by a spray of fire extinguishing foam), the SWAT team sent to the brother's darkened house should have used nightvision goggles.2. The protagonist played by Elisabeth Moss, was obviously intelligent, but she acted like a hapless, stereotypical hysterical dumb blond, which even her sister found annoying. Yet, at the end, she find the wherewithall to kill both the brothers when the police couldn't. It's just ""out of character"".3. When the protagonist was being chased in building, the first thing that came to my mind was to set the sprinker system on to see the outline.4. When she found an invisibility suit in her husband's house, why didn't she put it on? Instead, when she was alerted by the dog that he was returning, she folded it up and hid (poorly) in his huge walk-in closet.At the end of the day, an amusing psychological thriller that could have had tighter narrative. I also think that Elisabeth Moss was miscast. She is a fine actress but it beggars belief when her handsome, fit, rich husband would say that she was ""beautiful"". Without being unkind. That's not how I would describe her.",The Invisible Man

637,johnral321,good movie; not as many plot holes as people say,7,27 April 2020,"I'm surprised at the number of highly negative reviews on here. Most of them pertain to plot issues. I'm all for exposing plot holes, but most of these could be easily explained with a little creativity. Just some examples: People complain that the antagonist has super-human strength. This is not the case at all. He has the advantage of the element of surprise. A moderately strong (invisible) male could lift a female in the air, and could toss her across a table; and could beat the crap out of bigger dudes. People complain about the third suit: But there could have been ten suits, and he could have lost track of a suit. People complain about the dog being at the house; but for all we know she lost track of the dog on the night of her escape and the dog returned to the house later. People complain that she would not risk her plan by taking the dog with her; but it would be simple enough to take the dog with her and meet her sister in the road, while her husband sleeps. People complain about how he gets around: but his brother could drive him; or he could jump on a bus and hide; or he could just take off the suit and drive around like a normal person; or he could put on a wig and makeup. People complain about the guards not defending themselves better; but they have never encountered an invisible man before and would not know what is going on. People complain at her reaction in the restaurant; but she would be in shock and there's no telling how a person would react to that. Some people complain about how quickly the Uber driver arrives; but the scene does show her looking at her phone (and the Uber app), and we don't know how much time has elapsed before this time. (It's possible that she was running and hiding in the neighborhood for 5 minutes.) Maybe the husband developed the suit at a research facility and made a few extra suits for himself and took them home. I'm not saying there are no plot holes, but the complaints here are far too harsh, and lack imagination. The movie is novel, suspenseful, and interesting, and well-acted. (This is not exactly a plot-hole, but wouldn't a DNA test on the fetus prove that it was his son, and thereby implicate him in the crimes? The brothers weren't twins.)",The Invisible Man

643,benmundie,A Fantastic Modern Take on a Classic Story!!,9,7 November 2020,"'The Invisible Man' is a fantastic modern take on a classic story written by H.G. Wells which was originally adapted to film in 1933. Cecilia (Elizabeth Moss) escapes from her abusive boyfriend, Adrian Griffin (Oliver Jackson-Cohen), who then takes his own life, but she suspects his death was a hoax.
Leigh Whannell is the director and writer of the modern take. He does a great job at putting the audience in Cecilia's position. The cinematography (Stefan Duscio and Daniel Grant) is brilliant due to an interesting camera trick where they linger on empty space to build the anxiety inside the viewers mind which mirrors the main protagonist.
All the acting is perfect, in particular Elizabeth Moss who unsurprisingly is able to do a fantastic job when acting next to nobody in scenes with the invisible man. Aldis Hodge (James Lanier) and Storm Reid (Sydney Lanier) are great foils for Moss and all of them seem to be having genuine fun when in scenes together.
The writing is thrilling with most of the twists genuinely coming from out of nowhere. Whannel pays homage to the original story in certain scenes whilst also grounding this picture in reality with the source of the vanishing being a suit of technology as oppose to the older explanation of chemicals falling on him.
However, the weaker parts weren't as apparent and are mainly nitpicks. My big nitpick is that for some reason, there are no security cameras in any public areas which is really obvious in certain scenes.
Overall, this is a very enjoyable thriller that expertly builds suspense. I can't wait for more modern retellings of old stories by 'Blumhouse Productions'.",The Invisible Man
644,nambivp-33248,Leigh Whannell doesn't want you to use your brain too much,7,29 February 2020,"The first 15 minutes of this movie is more gripping than the entire length of many movies that came last year. A woman escapes from her abusive husband but soon experiences events that make her doubt his death.
There are numerous scenes in this movie that are shot excellently and they really give you the chills. The emphasis is not on jump scares; the atmosphere itself causes goosebumps. A big house occupied only by two people; an abusive husband who wants to control even his wife's thoughts; the premise is great. It is very easy to scare your audience using jump scares. But it is very difficult to make them shiver at the thought that even a small holding facility can have an invisible person. The director excels at that.
In some scenes, you expect a jump scare but it ends on a plain note. That is good directing. Don't give us what we have in our mind. Make us crave for more. Surprise us.
Towards the end, the screenplay goes downhill. Yes, the husband wants to stalk her and torture her. But, why does his brother promise the protagonist that he would help her get out of prison, if she agreed to raise her child with her husband who is indeed alive? It does not make sense. If her husband really wants to be with her again, why send her to prison in the first place? The director does not give enough answers to satisfy us and that did let me down.

The Invisible Man features and conforms to many of my film-making styles and I found that very satisfying. Subtlety, silence, a slow pace and a terrifying atmosphere are the most crucial ingredients to horror and the film had plenty of them. One would typically expect a modern remake of a 1930's horror film to be a stinker, but for this one, expectations will be fulfilled, if not exceeded. While it does not exactly break new ground, it does pretty much everything right. One of the most admirable things about this movie is that it's based in science, not fantasy. The Invisible Man is not a mad scientist who drinks a potion, he's an ingenious optics engineering tycoon who creates a suit covered with hundreds of cameras to manipulate light and fool the human eye into thinking he's not there. The inventive modernization of the source material (with a feminist twist) makes the film more compelling and believable, thus more frightening. Elizabeth Moss is perfectly cast as a woman suffering from domestic abuse. She always seems to have the look of trauma, paranoia, and fear on her face. However, one thing that I would have added to the movie was flashbacks of her character's relationship with her boyfriend, especially the beatings.

Which means you can pass right thru him. At times they couldn't help bumping into him and other times when they seemed to pass right thru him, but this is based on a movie from 1933 where they didn't focus so much on those things. And the ending went from total shock and not knowing who did these things to wait a minute, was so and so really the bad person here or not?

Together, they're a perfect team, creating a story that moves quickly and supplies more than a few well-executed jolts and shocks to make your jaw hit the floor.

651,LansTaylor,Anxiety filled,7,28 March 2020,"From the opening scene all the way until the first reveal, I was on the edge of my seat squirming with anxiety. I love how throughout the movie, the camera just starts randomly panning around like something or someone was there; this really engages the audience. I notice throughout the pan shots that I was really concentrated on the background objects, like, if there was an indent in the couch cushions or if the curtains moved.
There were a few moments when Ce would do something that left me wondering why she did that because it didn't make any sense. Also, I'm sure how I feel about James. I'm not sure if it was how he was written or if it was the acting that left... off. I'm not sure how to explain it but his character didn't really fit.
Overall, an entertaining movie and I love how they change the premise from the original and made it more modern.
The phone in the attic was easily the most suspenseful part of the movie and honestly one of the most suspenseful horror scene in a while. But, my favorite part by far was the restaurant scene. You think that Ce and her sis was just going to agree to disagree (also love the comedic relief with the server) and then you see a floating knife, which I had to do a triple take on.

They're all, by nature of the theme, intriguing. This one is unique in how it expands on the idea of pathological domestic abuse being exploited by the invisible character. It's also probably the best filmed version -- the cinematography is superb and always mood building. Most scenes are a rooms, so how could it be 'shot so well'? Ah, the Kubrick effect -- slow steady pondering views that suggest you should be seeing something in that space, but... And, of course, Kate Moss, was perfect in this role.My only complaint, which was minor, was that the antagonist had little to no back story about either his abusiveness or his science background that allowed him to develop the special technology. It (the background story) was so buried and obscure that when it was revealed in pieces along the way it was about a relative stranger that the audience had no investment in.Nevertheless, thumbs up for The Invisible Man, 2020.",The Invisible Man

It's actually a pretty good little movie.
Until you start poking holes, and looking at the characters, and then the ending... well, then it starts to unravel.
This movie hits the points of a standard horror/thriller very well. From the music to the downright genius photography.
That being said, they have a major issue of how they are getting there. This movie needs some exposition and a little more backstory of the main antagonist and really, just to what is going on in this world.Then... the daughter. Casting, set dec, and character is key. In real life she was the age she was 'portraying(17)'. However, she gets a college schalorship, but still sleeps in kid pajamas with toys in her room? Sometimes she reacts as if she is 22 and a young adult, other times she is a 12 year old just learning things. Very awkward that they are sleeping together. When she is introduced, you almost think she is 35 and the wife or best friend. You'll understand when you see it. It's off putting.Overall it is worth the rental. Tons of horror tropes including the usual attic scene and the ol' sheets pulled off a sleeping person.Would be a 6 out of 10. But Moss ramps up the pace and emotion.

Elisabeth Moss' performance made this movie even more engaging to watch. The plot is a bit dissapointing but Whannel managed to establish a game-changer. Overall, ""Invisible Man"" is a good suspense-thriller movie but it's too much to consider it as the horror movie representative of 2020.",The Invisible Man
661,mulhollanddriveway,Very Entertaining,8,19 March 2021,We all know 2020 was a bad year for movies and a bad year period but this was a bright spot for me.

662,ross-547-585754,A real thriller that grabs you from the start,9,3 March 2020,"I am not a fan of horror films, as they tend to become blood lust epics. Whilst there is some blood in this, the film excels in building the thrills through tension and good story telling.
There are some clever Special Effects, but the film does not become a slave to them. Instead you are swept along with Cecilia (Elisabeth Moss), as she tries to navigate the ever increasing insanity that is foisted on her.
Strong performances by the whole cast and a storyline, that once you accept the 'invisibility' premise, is fairly persuasive that the narrative is more or less inevitable.
Good horror works by letting you do the work. Scenes where there is no visible threat, but you know it's there means you help create the tension.
If you like suspense/horror without too much blood and mayhem, this is for you.",The Invisible Man
663,gatheringsnow,Surprise!,9,28 February 2020,"With the recent letdowns of earlier horror films released this year I was expecting all that much from this most recent horror film from Australian writer/director Leigh Whannell who also helmed 2018's body horror/action thriller ""Upgrade"" and previously the third installment of the Insidious franchise in 2015, however I was quickly proven wrong within the first ten minutes of the film during the dark and incredibly tense sequence when Cecelia Kass (Elizabeth Moss) escapes her torment at the hands of her sociopathic, evil, but brilliant scientist lover Adrian who specializes in optics technology.Even though he physically doesn't actually appear throughout the vast majority of the film, surprisingly he still manages to maintain a sinister presence over just about every scene in the film, illustrated both through his psychological torment over Cecelia who with her wide eyed paranoid stare and somewhat insomniac appearance makes it all the more easier for Adrian (Oliver Jackson-Cohen) to both manipulate her as well as her friends and family into distrusting her and causing her to become more isolated and frantic as the film progresses.The entire cast, which also includes Aldis Hodge as her close friend James who is also a cop, Storm Reid who plays his teenage daughter Sydney, and Harriet Dyer as her sister Emily all unanimously turn in great performances and even some smaller bit parts were done quite memorably. I've never read the book or seen the original The Invisible Man from 1933 so I can only judge this film as a standalone effort. However from what little I do know about the source material it appears that Leigh Whannell decided to take a different approach or reimagining of the story as opposed to a direct remake, which in my opinion is how you do proper remakes. Surprised, you bet I am!",The Invisible Man

It wouldn't have left the main character with the full redemption...but it would have been a much better ending no one saw coming. Too often modern Hollywood movies are more worried about agenda than story. You can achieve both...see Get Out for example. A few simple changes and this would have been an 8 out of 10.

676,josephbrewster-88279,"A crisply done suspense thriller, with plot holes",7,10 July 2020,"This movie largely succeeds, despite giving away its premise from the start, as both a nail-biting dramatic thriller and poignant social commentary on unhealthy relationship dynamics. Does it have plot holes? Yes. Do they spoil the movie to the extent some reviews are suggesting? Not unless you are uncommonly cynical and picky.This is not an HG Wells Invisible man. I've read the book, and this is not it.I was skeptical that a rather worn horror/thriller trope could yield fresh frights, and while I don't think the scares are all incredibly original, the film does what it sets out to do. It was infuriating to constantly know that a jump-scare was looming on the horizon, yet still feel jolted in that disconcerting way that makes jump-scares an enduring staple of the genre. I want to complain that the sparse soundtrack and tired inception ""booj"" effects were unfairly wielded or that the timid, slow-pan camera was applied too often, but honestly, it worked. I could have done with less predictability in the sound design, however. I was scared, despite myself. I was thrilled. And isn't that what thrillers are supposed to do? It kept me on the edge of the seat.Acting was solid, with the lead giving a praiseworthy performance of a harried, mentally unstable victim, whose mannerisms and appearance gradually deteriorate into convincing madness. Her character is believable in ways that Barbieesque horror girls often are not. She possesses an every-woman charisma reminiscent of the first Halloween movie, or Drew Barrymore's Scream opener, seems impossibly average, and the audience is both compelled to empathize and also dared to question her sanity, so that the plot manages to leave a few questions to be answered until the closer (and perhaps even after). It's not a cliffhanger or a I-didn't-see-that-coming movie, but it's still satisfying.If you like a good thriller, see it.
If you like a good psychological thriller, see it.
If you like fast-paced thrillers, maybe pass on this one.

If the movie title could have been something different and team could have been creative to keep us on edge with a suspense, just around Kate Moss being acting crazy and why .. showing actions where she' being thrown into the window and more .. and we would have been left wondering if it' someone real after her or something unexplainable. Currently after watching the trailer I went ahead with Hollow Man rewind and knew there' something sci-fi etc.Even I laughed at my own so called promotional approach but I think, my experience and amazement would have been a lot more if I had found during the movie that it's really her husband in some sci fi suit :DOverall, a decent watch.Possible, new audience who haven't watched Hollow Man will like it and rate 7+ ..",The Invisible Man
682,barrelhousegutboy,Sci Fi Thriller That Watches Back,7,21 March 2020,"This film fits into the same box as Sleeping With the Enemy, Enough, Extremities, Gothic and others where a woman becomes more than what her tormentors bargained for. While these movies have various stories they all play on fears women must have in common as the driving factor. Not being believed, abuse, manipulation, isolation, helplessness, the feeling of being watched all get their time playing on her psyche. I'm thinking many women will be followed home by anxiety. The metamorphosis of Cecilia when she finds herself trapped is as dramatic as Sarah Connor between the first and the latest Terminator movie.
The title 'The Invisible Man' is a bit unfortunate though, something like Unseen Eyes or Man of 1000 Eyes would have eliminated certain expectations which never come to pass. One of the coolest aspects of the film is the tech is actually real and has been for some time now.
The movie unfolds with C (Cecilia) making her escape from the house/mad scientist lab she shares with her betrothed Adrian with the help of a friend. Unsure how she will go on with life she soon begins to feel the presence of her now dead husband (suicide, just look at these 8x11 glossies!). Lawyer brother of her deceased husband informs her 5 million dollars is coming her way provided she doesn't fall into vice and criminality. I would like to think some things that happen next are aimed at punishing theater attendees who have divided attentions, watch close or you'll miss it! Not much time goes by before C is tagged with a drug problem followed by a murder while screaming about the man nobody can see but her. Now locked in a psych ward we will get our first clear look at her tormentor as he goes through an entire symphony orchestra of armed guards who must be in Stormtrooper training. C breaks free of the ward hot on the trail winding up at her friends house to thwart the next diabolical ploy. After tagging the apparition figure by spraying a fire extinguisher around C pops 5 or 6 rounds into his chest. When she pulls off the mask the person she expected see isn't there, later being found tied up in a closet the very next scene. C doesn't buy it so she seizes control of her destiny by her own hand.
While suffering from occasional bouts with continuity and flip a coin character actions the final product as a whole is fairly entertaining with a big wet spot of believability not of the characters but of the tech and the ways it will be abused.

After that though - the dialogue fires up, the characters come alive and the movie starts to churn around Elizabeth Moss's increasing disbelief and confusion, as ""something"" appears to alter her reality at a whim.
The early silent camera work is superb. You'll need to watch several scenes more than once to spot what's really happened, but don't spoil that on the first run-through.

What struck me was the lengths her abuser will go to to control her, keep her close, assuage his own issues by projecting them on to her and I know some people would suggest that it's far fetched. But I worked with survivors of interpersonal violence (aka domestic violence) and their stories echo much of what this protagonist goes through. We once had a guest speaker who had survived 24 years of stalking after she left her wealthy boyfriend when he tried to control her with his substantial wealth. He'd never experienced anyone leaving him before and he bugged her phones by bribing a bt engineer, bought the flat opposite hers, discredited her profession by circulating fake stories online, (she was a self employed writer) bribed her closest friends to give him information and the list went on and on. His goal was to financially ruin her to force her to return to him, and eventually she had no choice but to live in a caravan and move every two weeks! This film highlights how abusers encourage the victims supporters to question her sanity, label her as hysterical, become fatigued and give up on her. Often society doesn't acknowledge the constant pressure and stress the victims experience and the damage it causes.abusers take advantage of this apathy, or ignorance and they just need a different kind of visibility: an absence of scrutiny.

This was not a re-boot of the original classic, but a completely unique film in a modern setting with state of the art technology incorporated with believable realism.This movie is getting very strong reviews from both professional critics and the general audience. There are minor flaws, but in the full scope of things these can be easily overlooked considered the entire body of work. Moss was superb, and the supporting cast did not let us down whatsoever. Adrian takes a place as one of the most evil villains in modern times.It's creepy, it's gut-wrenching and the audience is all in with the almost impossible situation that Cecilia is placed in.

How would a story from more than 100 years ago fit today? This film succeeds and with honors, manages to cover current issues but maintaining the original premise, it is a story that has parallels to other science fiction movies in which man abandons his real form to become something else, this film is not exactly a mutant transformation like David Cronenberg's The Fly, but it is about a man who plays with technology to improve his skills, although it does not show the same level of depth as The Thing, it is a very well made film whose story is quite flat but satisfactory.The Invisible Man constantly breaks his own internal logic, has great technical achievements, very well directed, can be seen in some scenes, as the main scene that shows that the director knows how to create suspense and also shows an ability to make us feel that there is someone in between but we cannot see it, just feel it, this same resource is repeated later, an action scene that is made as a long shot is simply fascinating, another conventional film has action scenes full of unnecessary cuts that do not let the action taste at the moment, for that reason this scene is exemplary.

The film spends a lot of time continuing the bashing of a women clearly dealing with a lot. Soooooo slooooooow. Lots of shots just looking at nothing. This film stops short of calling women crazy.Probably a good flick to fall asleep to... a nap. You know one you really don't have to pay attention to, just sound in the background.

709,majoreasy,Don't really know what I watched...,4,2 March 2020,"A rather strange take on the Invisible Man story...If taken at the movie's face value, then this is a mediocre thriller with many unexplained / ridiculous logic-less points... Going with this... This movie gets a lame 2-3 out of 10...On the other hand... If one can speculate on those plot issues and come up with an alternate explanation (which changes the story entirely...), Then this could be quite a good movie.Going with my take on what the story twist is... Then the issue becomes the details in story telling... Which wasn't the best in the world...Nevertheless, with my version of the plot, my rating jumps to 6-7 out of 10... Still many unanswered questions but at least more of the movie becomes relatable...
Spoiler alert...
Going the ""face-value"" route... There were many ridiculous actions taken...-- She didn't take the phone from the attic which is her evidence of his existence...
-- She jumped down from the attic when she would be safest up there since he can't climb up without lifting the ladder... She has plenty of time to call for help with the phone in her possession...
-- The scene at the hospital with CCTV clearly showing she was not responsible for any of the killing... Why run when he already left...
-- chasing after something invisible by herself doesn't look like she is afraid of him (something she has claimed from the beginning...)
-- only one of the hospital staff with guns would come out to the car park when she (a patient) is running around the place with a weapon... Hmmmmm...
-- she finds the absolute evidence in the Invisible suit but she hides it instead of bringing it with her to the police?Many many more of such things make me believe this is not really how things unfolded...My take...At one point, she was shown the picture of the dead Alex, which looks suspicious like how she left him at the end...I postulate that she actually did the killing at the beginning of the story... Then she was caught by the police, and what we watched is her explanation to the police on what she claimed happened...She may or may not be crazy but she is the killer and the plot ""holes"" we witnessed are actually her story telling missing many of the details since she was making it up...That last scene of her trying to convince James that Alex killed himself is exactly the position she is stuck in... Trying to explain to/convince the police how it happened...James is just one policeman who reached out to her and she convinced herself that he is her best friend who will side with her...Unexplained points are still her sister's death (can't tell that story unless she is really dead in the manner told...) And Tom's death (or not)... Plus how she escaped from the asylum... Surely these things can be investigated but let's assume she was desperate to bring the story to Alex's suicide and the lies expanded beyond her control...This makes slightly more sense to me but still leaves an unsatisfying taste in my mouth... The story is a bit like ""the life before her eyes"" but messier...Because there is a really good chance that I am wrong about this... Plus some still unexplainable plot points... I can't go to my own version whole heartedly...Hence... My rating for this movie will split the difference and land on a 4.5 out of 10...",The Invisible Man

I would say finally a role on her character, a role which marks her career in a positive way.
I'm saying this because I think after and before ""The Handmaid's Tale"", not all movies were overwhelming, but this one surely is.
The film is well constructed but seen from a different angle and concentrating on Cecilia Kasses character first, even though the story is quite a new one, quite authentic and different from the book by H.G. Wells.

720,sarandivyam,The Invisible Man (2020)- Review by Divyam Saran,6,28 March 2020,"First of all, I would like to express my gratitude towards all my readers for taking out time to read my first film review.
This past weekend, I saw the movie The Invisible Man (2020). Since it is inspired by the famous novel of the same title by H.G. Wells, it was one to remember.
The story revolves around a woman, Cecilia Kass (Elisabeth Moss), whose boyfriend, Adrain Griffin (Oliver Jackson Cohen), is working on the technology which enables one to become invisible. The movie starts with Cecilia waking up at midnight and tries to run away from the captivity of her boyfriend at an isolated house. She becomes successful in doing so with the help of her sister, Emily Kass (Harriet Dyer), she then stays with her sister's friend James Lanier (Aldis Hodge) and his daughter, Sydney Lanier ( Storm Reid). While coping with her past she gets the news of Adrain's suicide, but soon she starts to feel the existence of someone you can't see, but can hurt you!
Watching this movie was a wholesome new experience for me. I even did not remember the names of the star cast. the acting of Elisabeth Moss is worth seeing. She has done a fantastic job. Other supporting casts have also done their part honestly. Direction and screenplay were also good. I can't judge the dialogue delivery since the movie was available in Hindi at my cinema.
Overall, it was an average movie and I would say it to be a one time watch. What didn't impress me was the storyline. I think it is a reboot of the novel storyline and I miss the invisible man wrapped with white bandages all over his body. But still, if you are free this weekend, you may watch it out.",The Invisible Man

722,superkt,Tense! But not without its problems,7,23 June 2020,"The past few years or so, any horror movie I've watched in theaters just didn't do it for me. Never heart racing, gripping the armrest, just waiting in total suspense type feelings. This movie got that part right.There are holes to the story and I won't pick it apart since, for me, it does work overall. But when the suspense picks up, it really picks up. You can never know where he is gonna pop up and the movie plays on that quite well. I mean, he's invisible.I read a lot of reviews that try and pin this as a feminist Hollywood placating everyone SJW type of trope film and I just don't see it. It's an abused woman up against a genuinely bad man. There's no girl power message behind it. No ""all men are bad"" sentiment that seems to be forced into some of these reviews. Don't let those scare you away.Of course, and as with many films, the ending is problematic. It leaves an air of mystery, yes, but almost too much. The main subject of the film - the case of who is doing this, why, and can we stop him? - isn't fleshed out enough to be satisfying. A good enough answer just isn't there. It's okay to have an open ending but the movie barely gives us any kind of solid answer to one of those questions.But... Since this movie got my heart rate up and had a decent enough story, I can rate it higher than most scary movies Hollywood has produced as of late.",The Invisible Man

However when i started thinking about the movie once it was over many plotholes came up. Many reviewers already mentioned them, the ones that stood out fhe most to me were the superstrength the invisible man seemed to have and that he was a ghost aswell. When he was fighting with people they couldnt feel him, grab on to him or hit him.
I missed the part of the story why she left him, what his goal was or the point of his suits (besides stalking her).
Also to me this movie felt like a jab at white men. Al the white men in the movie are evil or incompetent. Ofcourse the black guy is good and the victims are women.

738,ryanmoynihan,Inviso Man is Scawwy,6,22 September 2020,"When I saw the trailer for this movie I had mixed emotions. The first half seemed like an effective psychological thriller about an emotionally and physically abusive partner. Then the second half turned into a silly action film with the hallway scene giving me flashbacks to Luc Besson's Lucy. It just felt like two completely different movies. And I was getting preemptive disappointment that the cold, methodical and tense horror that I saw in the first half would not be fully realized by the end of the movie. Now that I've actually seen it, I still feel that is the case.The first hour to hour and a half is brilliant. Elizabeth Moss's character is smart and likable which makes her torment genuinely frustrating. I had to root for her to escape the abuse. Shots are lit in subtle yet effective ways. My favorite was a scene in an attic lit entirely by the flashlight of a phone, or at least it appears that way. Often in dark settings it's difficult for filmmaker's to balance realistic lighting with communicating everything they want the audience to see. A phone flashlight is such a simple solution but it keeps from breaking immersion and visual communication in a way that I really appreciated. And there are decisions like this one littered throughout the film which make it a creative and thoughtful ride.For me the movie becomes irritating about 45 or 30 minutes before the end. Without spoiling too much, there's a scene where the main character is framed for a crime by her invisible abuser in the middle of a restaurant. It was shocking enough to make me gasp, but once that initial surprise wore off I couldn't help but wonder ""wouldn't a fancy restaurant like that have cameras? Police would want to see the footage right? Then she would be cleared of any wrongdoing."" But no. People still think she's crazy and she is blamed for the crime.I'm not one to usually pick apart plot and complain about it over the filmmaking, but in this case it did interfere with my ability to really enjoy where the story was going. I'm already sympathetic to the main character's struggles so the movie skipping over what seems to be a clear win for her is unfairly frustrating for me as a viewer. This frustration continues when we get to the fight scene in the hallway that was shown in the trailer. It's about as silly as it looked in my opinion. This is especially annoying though since I was enjoying a majority of the film so much. The whole scene is filled with conveniences and plot armor for the antagonist. I couldn't help but roll my eyes at several moments.Despite all of this, I would still recommend The Invisible Man. The overrall product may not live up to the ground work laid out by the beginning, but it is an intelligent and suspenseful movie. It also tells the story of a distrusting and broken victim of abuse without falling into any cliche traps. She doesn't lose all self sufficiency, but she still needs time and care before she's ready to be her own person again. And that's the core of the story. A woman torn down again and again reclaims her life from a genius abuser with power and connections. I can get behind that.",The Invisible Man

742,bseaman-20248,"Relentlessly tense and Hitchcockian in style, The Invisible Man should propel Elisabeth Moss into the A-List",9,3 June 2020,"I confess to having felt a bit leery when deciding whether to watch this. I wondered how what has become a cinematic trope (i.e. somebody invisible wreaking havoc whether for comedic or dramatic effect) could have any legs even with the benefit of modern CGI. Then I read the reviews.One minute into this movie, I was absolutely hooked. The directing, cinematography, pacing and the relentlessly tense musical score were the elements that helped propel this movie forward. But the absolute genius and raw power of Elisabeth Moss' acting is what left me in awe. She is at the top of her game in this one. I am going to watch The Invisible Man again with a female friend who managed to get out of a relationship with an abusive narcissist a while back with moderate damage to her psyche and sense of self. I will be watching again so that I can relish the nuances that Moss brings to her character.Before this movie, I had regarded Moss as one of several 30-something actors who are capable of delivering their lines competently and reliably, but never regarded her as particularly compelling, not even as a repressed Handmaid. Her role in The Invisible Man tells me that she was simply an actress of iconic talent whose agent had yet to find the right script and director for her. She deserves a Best Actress Academy Award for portraying an abused woman on the apparent edge of madness who is determined not just to survive her relentless stalker but to destroy him.This is drama at its best. Imagine what Julia Roberts' could have been in ""Sleeping With The Enemy"" (Moss was only 8 years old when that movie about spousal abuse and escaping from a stalker came out in 1991), coupled with the very best that Hitchcock could muster and you have some idea of what Moss has done in this movie. Film buffs will appreciate this reference after reflecting on what they have just seen.Moss will certainly be in that $20 million + earner category after this movie, if she wasn't there before.",The Invisible Man

Also,we never get any information about this ""suit"", other than he must be some rich, closet, crazy genius, who invests millions into his man cave.

Another illogical part of this movie was the ending. It just felt rushed and not creative at all, it actually was so bad and cliche it got cringey imo. The last thing that bothered me was that the relationship between the family that the protagonist was staying with was never explained. I didn't need a deep explanation because that's not what the movie was about but if you're going to put it in our face's explain a little more. Like why were the cop and attorney separated? Why doesn't their daughter live with her mom? Why would the attorney let her sister stay under the same roof as her ex husband and not with her?

The pacing is really terrible after like an hour i thought this should be over soon and felt bored. Acting was bad. Schockers not really present, sound was ok, effects were very underwhelming for an invisble man movie even fighting looked illogical and don't waste too much time about being logical with that movie it makes many mistakes.

The acting was superb, the character development, complexity and like-ability for the lead was incredible. You genuinely liked her and was rooting for her the entire time, admiring her intelligence. Even the character development of the young girl was better than most film leads.

757,jaeelbooks,Interesting Start to a Yawn of a Movie,4,28 September 2020,"Elizabeth Moss can do no wrong. I've always said it, and in this interpretation of 'The Invisible Man' she manages to hold her own against a script that loses itself and becomes more of a yawn than frightening. Perhaps Hollywood has forgotten how to make a movie scary. Perhaps writers don't know what scary is. Either way, this film begins entertainingly suspenseful but it quickly loses its steam. For instance, when we know the Invisible Man is in the room with her, we expect bad things to happen. In today's world, an audience needs to be surprised and caught off guard - something this film fails to do. Perhaps 'The Invisible Man' has been played out. It's been done, done again, and now overdone. I would enjoy seeing originality return to Hollywood, but I have a feeling in a few more years, we'll have another rehashing of this film, which I've nicknamed 'Sleepy Time Tea.' If you're craving an 'Invisible Man' story, watch the original. If you're craving something stellar featuring Elizabeth Moss, look elsewhere.",The Invisible Man
758,westerfieldreviews,"""The Unseeable Descent into Madness""",9,5 March 2020,"""The Unseeable Descent into Madness""Leigh Whannell returns in full force after his visceral sci-fi darling, ""Upgrade"" (released in 2018) to reinvent the classic H.G. Wells novel for modern audiences in one of the most successful Universal Monster films we have seen in years. ""The Invisible Man (2020)"" is an intense thriller that will have you examining every corner of the frame as Whannell masterfully builds tension with every passing second. The film places Elisabeth Moss front and center as she leads the film and puts on a fantastic yet transformative performance that sees her falling deeper into the abyss of paranoia and trepidation. ""The Invisible Man (2020)"" is an exciting film that is not bound by Universal's haphazard decision of trying to create a disastrous shared monster universe (something Universal tried with ""Dracula Untold"" in 2014). This film is proof that eager visionaries can craft great works without the interference of lousy studio heads and executives. ""The Invisible Man (2020)"" stands as being the first truly must-watch film of 2020.
""The Invisible Man (2020)"" may share its name with H.G. Wells' original novel published in 1897, and Universal Pictures 1933 film adaptation, but that is where the similarities end. ""The Invisible Man (2020)"" opens with Cecilia Kass (Elisabeth Moss) as she quietly plans to escape the prison she calls ""home"" under the cover of night. Cecilia quickly gathers her belongings and desperately flees from her abusive and controlling millionaire boyfriend, Adrian Griffin (Oliver Jackson-Cohen). Having run away, Cecilia contacts her sister, Emily (Harriet Dyer) and gets a ride from her to leave the area once and for all. Cecilia refuses to seek shelter with her sister for fear that Adrian may find them both due to him knowing Emily's home address. She decides to take refuge with an old friend, James Lanier (Aldis Hodge) who is now a police detective and his daughter Sydney Lanier (Storm Reid), a student wanting to make her mark in the fashion industry. However, Cecilia still fears for her life not knowing when or where Adrian may strike; so much so that she can hardly even step foot out of James' home. That is until Emily arrives at the Lanier residence and reveals to Cecilia that Adrian was found dead in his home due to a successful suicide attempt. Emily also notes that Adrian left in his passing five million dollars that are all to be paid out to her. Hearing the news, Cecilia is conflicted and becomes overwhelmed but a veil of relief washes over her prompting the next phase. Cecilia takes back control of her life and moves forward. Unfortunately, along the way, several instances of misfortune strike her life and Cecilia believes in the truth that Adrian is not actually dead at all. It is here where Cecilia begins spiraling out of control and those around her begin questioning her every move, all while she battles with trying to unmask the culprit behind the veil of the Invisible Man.
""The Invisible Man (2020)"" is a project that Leigh Whannell was intimately attached to. Whannell not only worked behind the camera as the film's director, he also penned the original screenplay, and acted as an executive producer behind the film. It should be stated that without Whannell's close proximity and handling of ""The Invisible Man (2020)"", this film would not be what it is. Given the subject matter, is it clear that Whannell had a specific approach to the directing of this film; he had a distinct vision he wanted to execute. Going into a screening of ""The Invisible Man (2020)"" the audience is already privy to the fact that whoever or whatever the threat may be, we will never fully be able to see it. Whannell takes this information and perfectly plays on that individual fear by ratching up the tension in every scene. Whannell does this by applying a couple of impressive techniques. For starters, let us begin with Whannell's shot selection and camera movements. Throughout the entirety of ""The Invisible Man (2020)"", we as the audience are just as unsure of the threat's presence as Cecilia is. Our levels of immersion are locked in as Whannell will have actions occurring on-screen in one corner of the frame, but he slightly shifts the camera over to the uninhabited space where he holds it and lingers on the emptiness until switching the focus back to the present action. This is a brilliant method at play that keeps our eyes scanning the entire scene as we attempt to spot a curtain slightly shift or find that an object has been displaced; we investigate closely as a means of gaining any kind of clue as to where this invisible being may be lurking. Another technique Whannell employs with the camera is his ""pov"" shifts. I put pov in quotes because we are never quite sure if we are looking through the Invisible Man's eyes, or just viewing the scene from a different perspective. We are positioned in empty doorways or down a hallway just beside a corner patiently watching character interactions unfold waiting to strike. These techniques have been used by scores of directors in the past and they will continue to be used until the end of time, but Whannell makes it work because the looming threat is never known to the characters or the audience.
Whannell not only works magic behind the camera as the film's director, but he also shines as the sole writer on this project. Taking an old classic and attempting to reboot it for mass audiences can be an extremely tough ask for many. Questions will rattle in the minds of both writers and directors as they try and figure out a way it can be done. Whannell took the hokey-wacky character of the Invisible Man from the '30s and '40s and found a way to reinvent him in a shocking way that takes a more modern approach. Whannell also takes the entire original narrative and turns it inside out opting to show how those affected by the crazed Invisible Man fall into insanity, rather than having us watch as the Invisible Man slowly rots into lunacy. Despite all of that being said, the greatest asset of the script is its well-fleshed out characters. From side characters like Sydney and Tom (Michael Dorman) to main ones such as Cecilia and James, every character is tended to with a great deal of care. No one is left behind or presented as a one-note pony that is there to serve a particular archetypal role; it is absolutely refreshing. Whannell's good character work is only bolstered by the cast, as everyone onboard delivers performances that are grounded in reality. No one plays their characters in an off the wall manner or comes across like a cartoonish exaggeration mimicking reality, which is fantastic, as it ensures the tone of the film persists. Yet, there is one performance that stands out from the crowd and it should come as no surprise that the honor is given to lead actress herself, Elisabeth Moss. Moss works wonders with Whannell's script as she allows the audience to feel the dread collapsing upon her with every passing moment. When she frantically searches a room for her invisible predator or must plea with those around her for help, Moss does so in such a manner that will you wondering how she pulled it off. From her line delivery to physical presence, Moss delivers a stellar performance that is equal parts emotional as it is terrifying. We hold her hands as we dive down a deep well of panic.
""The Invisible Man (2020)"" is a film that takes the classic H.G. Wells story and adapts it through a contemporary lens of reality to great success. With Whannell's exciting script and brilliant direction, he perfectly reinvents the tale of the Invisible Man in a way that will have audiences questioning their own vision. With exceptional character development that allows every performer (both major and minor) to deliver good performances across the board to unsettling shots that will leave you questioning, ""The Invisible Man (2020)"" is a suspense thriller that exceeds the bland staples the genre has been plagued with for years. That is why, all of these attributes and more make ""The Invisible Man (2020)"" this year's (this decade's) first must-watch film.Final Verdict: A",The Invisible Man

762,baraa_z88,Superb for a horror movie,10,28 September 2020,For its genre it's a superb movie. The psychopathic nature of the villain is what made this movie good. Unexpected ending. 10/10 for a horror movie,The Invisible Man
763,travisyoung,A performance you must see,5,19 October 2020,"As a thriller, The Invisible Man is well intentioned and crafted with moderate competence--a machine designed to take you breathlessly from one scene to the next, your emotions shattered but logic intact. The story is familiar enough, not so much because of it's namesake, the original 1933 The Invisible Man starring Claude Rains, but it's resemblance to 1991's Sleeping with the Enemy.At least these filmmakers are smart enough to know that if a woman is going to be repeatedly placed in peril, she had better be the heroine and headline the film, even if from the very moment the film begins Cecilia Kass (Elizabeth Moss) is a woman who is determined to no longer be a victim. She escapes her house by the sea and sleeping husband (Oliver Jackson-Cohen) by running away in the middle of the night. No backstory is offered, we just observe the bleeding edge tech lab as she painstakingly disables each security feature from a single laptop, and from this we surmise that hubby must be a bad dude who is rich and has a playroom less transgressive but sadly more boring than Christian Grey. There are other minute glimpses of his character which suggest his general unfitness for marriage, but these assumptions still do not demystify him in the least. He isn't even a one dimensional character--he truly remains invisible, a cipher whose actions and motivations remain largely unknown for the majority of the film.Cecilia finds safe haven with a single father cop friend (Aldis Hodge) who happens to have no personality or backstory beyond what I just described. Her new domestic life is portrayed by her being afraid to go outside to get the mail. Sooner rather than later the plot thickens when bad hubby's brother/executor (Michael Dorman) shares the tragic(?) news that hubby is dead, and willed five million to Cecelia paid out a month at a time for about four years.By now we all know what is going on, even if we don't know how or why, but it is more or less fun to watch. Here these scenes draw from better and more notable films like Poltergeist and The Shining, and ultimately we are the better for it. Cecilia is stalked and seemingly gaslighted through a plot that twists but never quite turns dull.Elizabeth Moss delivers a tour-de-force performance. If you are like me, it is quite possible you have already witnessed countless hours of her degradation and determined glares directly into the camera on ""The Handmaid's Tale"". Though the material in that series is arguably better fare in every way, in this film, Moss leads us to scenes which may seem far too contrived to be plausible, however she herself remains totally and utterly believable throughout every frame. Her pitch-perfect performance does not make The Invisible Man a particularly significant film in the scheme of things, but it does establish that she is a film actor of the highest significance because she carries this film completely on her back.Trust me, if she wasn't in this, it wouldn't be worth watching.",The Invisible Man
764,bhaskarulichi,A Potential Thrilling Slasher Flick Ruined By Incoherent Motives and A Casting Fiasco,3,21 September 2020,"""The Invisible Man"" is about how a genius Optics Engineer (33 yr old Oliver Jackson Cohen), obsessed with his wife (38 yr old Elisabeth Moss), invents a suit that makes him invisible, solely for the purpose of tormenting her. Only God knows what he wants from her.Apart from the storyline, the biggest disappointment in the film is the casting of Elsiabeth Moss as the leading lady.Not all scripts, necessarily, demand an attractive leading lady but this film does. Coz, The entire film revolves around her husband's obsessed of her. Unless people find her incredibly attractive, the reason behind her husband's obsession can't be convincing enough to root for her character. Elisabeth Moss is neither attractive nor delivered an effective performance.Apart from that, the film is filled with other plot holes and irrational character behaviours like below:1. Throughout the film, The leading lady laments that her husband controlled & abused her. So, why can't she file a case against him? Why should she run and hide? Why can't she use media to expose him?2. How could Cecilia's sister believe that her sister sent a hate mail despite she denying any knowledge of Such mail? Wouldn't she get suspicious? Or is she not her real sister?2. When Sydney is attacked by Tom (Invisible Man), why would she blame Cecilia for that? Even a kindergarten kid would scream that a Ghost attacked him.3. How can the invisible man get rid of the paint?4. Why police didn't bother to investigate the murder of Cecilia? Why didn't they check CCTV footage?5. How could the invisible man reach his house from Cecilia's friends place? Did he use a private jet with Invisible suit? Or did he use a car? Or is it Tom's brother in the suit? In either case, how come Cecilia never noticed a vehicle outside the house When she comes out?6. Now, the most annoying part. The hospital action sequence. Cecilia stabs Tom with a pen making him partly visible. He murders the first police which is reasonable coz he saw him. But, if Tom's motivation is to Pin Cecilia for her sister's murder, why the hell should he go on a killing spree? What's the motive behind it? Does he now want to become like Thanos, all of a sudden? It was really annoying to see Tom killing each and every police officer that comes despite they not noticing him. He could have simply escaped pinning the police's murder on his wife as well.7. When Tom is about to kill police officers, why didn't Cecilia try to shoot him from back? Never mind. Now, when Tom escapes from hospital, why didn't she try to convince police of existence of invisible man, through CCTV footage? She could very well seek their protection. Nope. She also escapes, steals a vehicle and chases her husband, because she's a strong woman who can fight injustice.6. When Invisible Man attacks Sydney at the end, how could he quickly move from bedroom and attack her from front, despite the space being so narrow? Can he pass through people?7. If Tom's brother is in the game, what's his motivation?8. At the end, when Tom says that his brother controlled him, what does he mean? We don't get to know his version, because Cecilia murders him by using the suit that she stole. She also gets away from that murder, thanks to her cop friend.9. Why didn't Tom use all his strength to protect himself from Cecilia cutting his throat? Is he that weak?Could Tom be completely unaware of any such suit? Maybe yes, cause he might have been controlled by his brother throughout. Maybe he didn't fake his death. But his brother made all that, when Tom's unconscious. It could be true that he was held captive in his own basement. Anything is possible in a Leigh Whannell film.Considering the history of Mr. Whannell's writings, he might have very well written a similar plot twist .However, due to ongoing #MeToo movement (as stated by previous reviewers) he might have been forced to change the script.Anyway, as this is a standalone film, the ending makes this film a major disappointment as I'm not at all concerned about the female lead.PS: Wouldn't have expected much from any unknown filmmaker.
But, as it's a Leigh Whannell film, I was waiting for the usual mind blowing plot twist at the end, which to my surprise, is............................................. that there isn't any.",The Invisible Man

766,whocares-96237,Just neutral yet so typical and predictable,5,7 March 2020,"All the raving reviews makes me think people are new to this type of flick....this is such a predictable and typical story line...
Create an invisible threat and all of a sudden it's superhuman.I really have a hard time with this type of writing, the lack of common sense or articulation of the lead character to communicate to the other characters, is mindbogglingly insulting to ones intelligence.
I get it, its not real life, its the movies, and entertainment, but lets not forget they are writing it to convince the viewer that it is in a ""realish"" setting, meaning the presumption is that this is plausible.In today's day and age there are cameras everywhere, proving innocents is incredibly easy, also when something bad happens to a person and the other person is 4 ft away, blaming that person is not realistic.
Especially in a public area like a hospital or a police station or even a restaurant there would be a multitude of cameras that would show odd but easily provable things.As mentioned above, I don't get the incredible superhuman strength that seems to be present, to overtake a large contingent of folks, yeah-no!I just completed it while writing this review and the ending bumped it up 1 star, but all in all it was a typical run of the mill physiological cat and mouse type of thing that makes a person say, oh geez whats next...if thats your bag of balls then go for it, but if you expected more, I would say you better prepare yourself for a rehash of pretty much every psychological thriller ever made.Side thought...what a waste of a great premise!",The Invisible Man
767,ajacayen-47694,The Invisible Man - A Breakout Performance by Elisabeth Moss,8,6 March 2020,"I remember the old Invisible Man film wherein it focuses on how the scientists experiments the titular antagonist and everything goes wrong once the villain has taken control over them. In this 2019 remake, it delves into a different story which follows Cecilia, played by Elizabeth Moss, as she feels paranoid when she thinks her ex-boyfriend is stalking her. What's stressful about this is that everyone close to her doesn't believe it and therefore conclude that she might be going crazy.I had enough of horror films once the start of January began as The Grudge, Brahms: The Boy II and Fantasy Island were all released and did not satisfy me that much due to their lack of story, tone and paranoia. However, 2020's The Invisible Man did not disappoint me at all and made me thought about the theme of the film more than its horrific sequences that all come into play. The film is symbolical and included a very serious topic that people should understand: the effect of an abusive relationship.Because of the main theme that was idealized by the film production, Leigh Whannel's direction made every scene of the film as horrific as ever and terrifying to see how Moss's character struggles in keeping her sanity while also confronting the man who abused her in the past. I could only imagine how hard it was for Cecilia to overcome this trauma, knowing that even she found freedom, the sense of vengeance from Adrian will always be stuck in her mind. I also loved how the team made it so realistic in some of Cecilia and the Invisible Man's fighting sequences with one another.The third act of the film becomes quite a punch as Cecilia tries to discover the identity of the Invisible Man and figure out how to stop it once and for all. It kind of reminds me a horror action scene like The Matrix and The Shining was combined into a bloody and horrific massacre. Also, the third act is actually has the most intriguing twists I could have expected as it explains everything from start to finish.Although this is just the first quarter of 2020, I'd say that The Invisible Man is a very entertaining and better horror film than the lacklusters released. I was very hapoy as to how the story turned out and Elizabeth Moss's performance should deserve a lot of credit in her terrific role as the paranoid protagonist. If you are looking for a good horror film, then try giving The Insible Man a shot.",The Invisible Man
768,heyitskeane,A modern spin on a classic tale..and it's actually done right.,7,9 March 2020,"Directed by Leigh Whannel and starring Elisabeth Moss, Oliver Jackson-Cohen and Aldis Hodge, it's actually pretty good.I will praise the film on its focus to tell a good, neat story instead of world-building or franchise-creating. The directing is pretty well done by Whannel, with well-done clever camerawork always hinting the prescence of ""the invisible man"". The jumpscares also feel rather nostalgic, yet surprisingly refreshing. The score by Benjamin Wallfisch is also terrific and equally haunting. It also feels very modern which honestly is perfect.I suppose a flaw could be the lack of characterisation in, well, any of the characters. Even for Cecilia, other than her past experiences, we are never properly introduced to her as a person. Just more as a victim, which isn't false.There are also a few plot-holes in the writing, but they aren't the ones big enough to fall into and are easily overlooked.I suppose The Invisible Man proves that remakes aren't always a bad thing, as long as it stays composed and focused on the main objective: to make a good movie. And that's exactly what it did.",The Invisible Man
769,Sabaher,I want more horror movies like this,9,1 March 2020,"With The Invisible Man¸Leigh Wannel continues his hot streak. This movie blends the fantastical elements and real world horror so well. The actual journey that the main character's on is the same journey so many women escaping abusive relationships face. It's just taken to a much more extreme level and more literal sense with some of the things that she's facing. In part of the struggles of modern day of people getting others to believe their stories, trauma and not to think that they're going crazy. The story of The Invisible Man provides a way to do that. They're having all the thrills and fantastical elements while at the same time it's terrifying and feels real. It doesn't have to do big things in the moments to be terrifying. It slowly builds the tension as this woman tries to continue on with her life, but clearly someone is doing something around her to try and drive her crazy and people don't belive her which ties so much into real world situations. Instead of starting with jumpscares and all typicall horror tactics, it instead looks at what actualy scares people in real life.The movie also relies really well on practical effects rather than CGI. While at the center of it you do of course have visual effects on to make a man invisible, the way this plays out in the scenes is they're using actual real world trickery with things actually moving, rather than CGI objects. So when someone gets hit, you feel it. When someone slams into something, you know that it's real and it just ads this visceral element to this movie that's filled with all kinds of things that we know aren't real, but they feel real.This is a type of movie which doesn't work if you don't buy into the performances. Thankfully, Elizabeth Moss gives a great performance and she feels like a real person, rather than a movie charecter. She's not too charismatic, cool, funny etc. She feels like a real person you would really know and that would do things like this. As you start moving into the part where everyone thinks she's going crazy, you buy into the performance even more because you bought into her as a real person.If you dont know, this movie was made for under $10 million, but it just looks great. The shots are framed so well. Because you're looking for the things moving and what's not supposed to happen, you're paying so much attentiont to the shots which are framed so well and they are gorgeous the way that they're shot. Some of it just looks so clean. I'm seriously wondering how did they make such a cheap movie look so beautifulFinally, the movie just provides the expirience that you want from a horror thriller. Very early on you buy into the character's struggle and you're constantly on the edge of your seat waiting for something bad to happen. Tension is always buliding little bit at a time, it's escolating more and more, and its moving faster and faster. You're getting more and more invested as you watch it and that's what movies should do. You should be getting more into it as the movie goes along.First half of the fim is very slow and deliberately paced. There's not a bunch of jokes to fill in the entertainment nor is it bunch of jumpscares to keep you engaged. You have to buy into it's slow burn nature. I think that's very well done, but people expecting a fast-paced horror movie won't get what they were expecting.The only baf thing about the movie is that in order for the movie to happen, there's a lot of plot conveniences, contrivances and a few gaps in the logic. That pulled me out of the movie at certain points in time.Overall, besides a few plot conviniences here and there, The Invisible Man is a great horror thriller that has a well constructed story, great characters that you belive in and that relies on actual scares that are based of reality, rather than jumpscares.8.6/10 go see it in the theatres.",The Invisible Man

while in its original 1933 ""The invisible man"" is a sci-fi / horror, in this remake, the film proposes to be more of a horror thriller, a mixture that works much better by the way.What stands out is the choice of the protagonist, Elisabeth Moss was undoubtedly the best choice for this film, in addition to delivering a sensational performance, she still manages to fit perfectly in the role of ""crazy"" victim being chased by a psychopath.The invisible man is able to explore the camera angles and their positions in strategic places, with the camera always prioritizing long-distance shots, or even those that have ""nothing"", to generate the effect of doubt.

Because it is invisible, its ""appearance"" is done in a well planned and creative way.Something I believe the film wasted, I believe it is the ""Doubt of the viewer""
for example...
It would be much more interesting if, instead of knowing that there really is an invisible man, we were embarking on this doubt together with the characters, something to think about, ""is there really someone invisible, or is this woman going crazy?""
I feel like I would look great in this film, although I love what was shown to us in the film.
Another controversy of mine was about the ending ...
Did the movie really need this?
: /
my only negative point,
that ending ...
did the movie really need it?
Did it have to be like this?
Seriously?
This ending can be impressive and disappointing at the same time.",The Invisible Man

Though I did enjoy it and was a good watch, I think this movie would've been a major improvement had they brought in much better actors/actresses (Mary Elizabeth Winstead as the lead would've been my pick; Elizabeth Moss is an amazing actress but she didn't really mesh well with the other actors/actresses), added more premise and story to the characters as we don't know too much as to her relationship with her ex-husband, or why she moved in with her friend who happens to be employed within the Law Enforcement field.Overall the big problem was this movie was moved too quickly, if they added more premise, answers, and detail I think it'd be deemed as one of the best Sci-Fi movies ever.",The Invisible Man

Every character who's on screen for more than 2 minutes makes unrealistic choices that would have to be made for the story to advance. The twist was also predicable.The good:It's entertaining and well directed. Acting is solid as well.The bad:A dog brushing up against a car doesn't set it's alarm off.Cecilia flees her home to get away from her abusive husband..on foot? There's a car right next to her. Cut the tires to the other vehicles and drive away.The invisible man shows up and starts messing with her, nobody believes it, so she doesn't install a single camera or use the one on her phone.A girl gets hit in the head. Cecilia is in a position that would make it essentially impossible to have done it, but gets blamed.Cecilia, knowing she's being stalked and attacked by the invisible man, meets her sister at a restaurant and decides having a knife on the table is a good idea.Cecilia is attacked by the invisible man in the mental hospital. When a guard comes in and is attacked she just watches, and then steps over his body and runs away instead of grabbing his gun.Footsteps make noise, but the invisible mans seem not to. Not even on an old wooden floor.We're meant to believe that Adrian set Tom up, but how? And why would Tom put the suit on and attack people? Say Adrian made him a gunpoint, okay. Now Tom is in the suit and invisible, he could walk away and tell the police.Was Tom in on it the whole time? If not, who's ashes did he have? Who took the picture of Adrian's body?How did Adrian put himself in the basement and then nail the board in place from the outside?When Cecilia shoots the suit it quits working and is completely visible, so why does it work when she puts it on afterwards to kill Adrian? Won't people wonder why the suit is missing from the previous crime scene?When Cecilia kills Adrian she comes back and calls 911 while pretending to be distraught. When she hangs up she doesn't try to help him, but taunts him as he's dying. She does this in front of the security cameras that she knows are there.There's more, but those we're the most frustrating to me.",The Invisible Man

779,BennyBamLegacy,Kubrick in spirit; Moss in Force.,8,9 March 2020,"Sprawling shots build tension and make the environment a character in every scene because of the unknown. The Shining did this incredibly well. Kubrick was very good as using specific cutaways, zoom ins and outs; playing games with the audiences expectations of when and how they could be frightened. The Invisible Man is a title you hear and go ""yeah, okay, another remake?"" But it isn't just that.Elisabeth Moss I have followed since her name was Zoey Bartlet on the West Wing. Peggy Olsen as the only sane woman on Mad Men. Then a handmaid. One thing about Us that was crazy was the idea of playing two versions of the same person that are completely separate entities, another role she smashed.But that is all just a lead up. The Invisible Man uses classic acting techniques and old filming lessons to reimagine a story in a way that makes you glad everyone is visible. What could things be made to look like when you can only see half of the equation? Moss talks to no one, pantomimes, fights thin air, and shows that her acting range is to infinity and beyond. I thought the only weakness of this film, was not picking a more intimidating actor who could help balance her immense power. It seemed as though, eventually, Adrian would be gobbled up by the sheer force of Moss. But apples are apples and oranges are oranges.This movie is tense. The opening scene nearly gives you a stroke even though literally nothing happens. This is how you film a movie that would otherwise be much less. Use the elements and the angles to create more.

This, as well as the great directing, keeps us on edge throughout the film. Long takes and shots with noone in them add to the stress of the character's situation.There were, however, several jump scares and moments with loud music that didn't need to be there to make the film scary, as the plot was already sufficiently tense.

784,tildagravette,Elisabeth Moss' Finest Hour,9,8 March 2020,"It's been a long time since I've been fortunate enough to be this much on the edge of my seat throughout a movie. The Invisible Man takes an admittedly hokey premise, updates it, and infuses it with a truthful, emotional center and a brilliant performance by Elisabeth Moss.When an abused wife escapes from her psychotic husband, she believes all her problems are gone. Even better, she learns that he's since killed himself and left her 5 million dollars. Eager to rejoin the human race, she starts trying to rebuild her life, but she starts to get the creepy feeling that she's being watched. Is her husband really dead or has he found some way to fake his death and continue terrorizing her. Even scarier, is she just going insane?The Invisible Man works so well in no small part to a taught script and directing job by horror veteran Leigh Whannell and a genius performance by Elisabeth Moss who manages to make a woman staring at walls and empty chairs captivating.Even better, the film's marketing hasn't given away every single twist like they usually do, so there are tons of surprises in store, each one upping the stakes for our heroine.The Invisible Man is an absolute must see for any serious horror/sci-fi/thriller fans.",The Invisible Man
785,mwpowelllde,Invisibility subdued by domestic spousal abuse,3,21 March 2020,"Much of the film did capture the sense of a real or imagined invisible presence, The Invisible Man, if you will. They did a good job at portraying that essence. However, as the film progressed, it became more about one woman's liberation, almost emancipation, from a marital, spousal abuse situation, and less about The Invisible Man. In fact, that just became a plot device in the end, which, IMO, really killed the whole premise of the film. Which, not entirely surprising when you consider the type casting of one actress, Elisabeth Moss. Sad, because it really could have been ""just"" about The Invisible Man, and that whole thing, but that was muted behind what it morphed into. I even got the sense that a hallway tussle with almost an entire a police unit was pretty much an Invisible Man apologetic of sorts, but it does not make up for the confusion in the messaging, even to the point of trying to play off this man in the very end as being somehow ""reclusive"", i.e. ""invisible"".",The Invisible Man

She gets away with killing the abusive ex boyfriend and lives happily ever after.But after thinking about things for a minute you realize... other than her saying it you don't see any real indication that he did much to her. You are pretty much taking her word for everything. And then when it comes to the boyfriend... what is it about him? You see yeah he can be manipulative but you barely see that. But then you see the main thing the movie is about... the invisible suit and what are they really made for? Who were they made for and how many of those suits did he really have?Then on top of that when you're learning about the boyfriend you learn that he is supposed to be on top of everything. Very observant . And knows what is going on in his place. And especially when it comes to those suits he would know how many he has and what's going on with them. YET when she hides one of those suits that doesn't register in his mind. Like she took the suit off of the dummy, didn't replace it on the dummy in the place... and in fact was attacked moments later. So it should've been known that the suit was missing AND that it would be in the closet or somewhere leading towards the closet since that where she went and yet... nothing.Then there is the scene where her sister gets her throat cut in the middle of a fancy restaurant. And the thing about any eating establishment... there are cameras everywhere. The fancier it is the more cameras there would be. So how is it that they were so sure she killed her sister and didn't spend a single second looking at any of the video footage? Because if they would have spent any time they would have seen a floating knife to notice... something isn't right. But nope somehow all of that was ignored and she was just immediately guilty.And there was the when the daughter got hit while the main girl was down on the ground. Like she's starting to get back up to her feet and is a little distance away. The daughter gets hit and doesn't register that there is no way she could have hit me. Something had to have hit me. Nope. Like if you're on your hands and knees there is no way you're generating enough force to knock someone to the ground and that didn't register with the girl.But yeah its like if you watch the movie and remove your mind from it then its pretty good. But if you start thinking about it you notice things that should've been thought through differently and at least fleshed out a lot more. So that's why the rating went from a near 8 down to a 4.

Its called cliche and generally is mark of generic or uninspired writing. This movie tends to leads you along to make your assumptions and then subverts them and then subverts them again.

I decided to take the plunge and rent the film to help you decide for yourself if you'd like to also participate.The Invisible Man stars Elisabeth Moss; head of Hulu's smash hit, The Handmaid's Tale, as Cecilia the victimized wife of optics genius Adrian Griffin (Oliver Jackson-Cohen) whom a la #metoo, valiantly decides to take her life back by leaving her abusive husband after drugging him in the middle of the night.As Cecilia hides out of sight with her friend James (Aldis Hodge) and James' teenage daughter Sydney (Storm Reid), strange occurrences begin to happen forcing Cecilia into a state of panic. Questioned at first and then shut out by her sister and best friend, Emily (Harriet Dyer), Cecelia takes a hardcore ride into the mouth of madness.As bizarre occurrences escalates, those who once believed in Cecelia's sanity diminishes in beautifully crafted suspense and friction by mastermind director Leigh Whannell; suspense which is reminiscent of the Great Depression noirs, with their Hitchcockian vibe and slow burn to frantic climax.The Invisible Man will be a favorite of cross genre fans including seekers of the thriller and suspense experience but will also appeal to the horror film base. For those of you who are keen on a drama, The Invisible Man will tickle your fancy with its strong backstory brought front and center-as long as you don't mind some edge of your seat, nail biting.So grab the folks you're quarantined with and pop the corn. You deserve a break from the worrisome pandemic. And remember-it could be worse; an invisible man could be stalking you while you're quarantined during a pandemic.Again, the first ever major studio movie to be released direct to the consumer after movie theaters were shuttered along with everything else in the country due to the Covid-19 pandemic, is available to download at a cost of-a very enjoyable 2 hour reprieve from pandemic life.",The Invisible Man

8.5/10🔪✒""Leigh Whannell channels his inner Hitchcock in his reimagining of an iconic character by creating a horror/thriller that is sure to keep you on your toes.""2020 has had it's share of multiple horror misfires, however The Invisible Man brings the genre back to the top. With Director Leigh Whannell, famously known for his involvement in the Saw Franchise, he is able to put a spin on the classic tale of the madman turning himself invisible to wreak havoc on the world. In this case, the ""world"" comes in the form of one woman, played beautifully by the wonderful Elisabeth Moss, who is the wife of an abusive technological genius. We then come to realize that he committed suicide and she believes her nightmare is over. What goes from the great escape ends up turning into a deadly game of cat and mouse. The way the film portrays this is by using the silent technique to keep viewers on alert that anything can happen at this point, with no music involved either, as well as the paranoid portrayal that Moss delivers, allowing us to understand the mental torture she endures. Story wise, the film tends to be a bit jumpy here and there but it does well enough to keep itself on track to help explain the reasoning of the situation that occurs. Coming from Leigh Whannell, we are expected to find violent sequences, which are not overblown here like in his previous film, Upgrade, but rather strategically placed for effectiveness purposes. My biggest criticism here is that the film does play it safe a little too much. With a premise like this, it should be fair to expect and assume that anything can happen to pretty much anyone, but upon it's final act, the film tends to fall into a small pit of predictability.Verdict: The Invisible Man is all the what a solid movie that proves the worthiness of Leigh Whannell as well as the acting chops from Elisabeth Moss.

We have plenty of suspense, generated by a great script, perfectly filmed/edited, with not too much CGI.All in all, this film has everything viewers need. Yes, it's a ""comic book"" movie. It was never intended to be ""real"" in the sense that everything MUST fit into a logically built universe. I agree that there are big gaps here and there. I actually expect that there will be at least a few of these in a film like this.I hope Universal brings back all of those great monster movies from the 30s and 40s. For me, the remakes can be in modern times or they can be retro/costume pieces. Both will work for me.",The Invisible Man

First of all the acting was top notch, no corny lines or crappy acting at all. I really loved Aldis Hodge the most. He brought a certain vibe to the movie that made me glad he was in it. The story felt very fresh to me. It was so well done I was surprised the budget was only 7 million. I am so glad I watched this movie. It was really outstanding!

820,jorge-30143,Excellent movie.,8,30 June 2020,"Forget about all of the nonsense, negative reviewers and dimwit trolls leaving One-Star comments.
The Invisible Man is an excellent movie.
And innovative director, Leigh Whannell, (who directed the superb Upgrade (2018), gives us a fresh take on the whole
psycho-horror drama. Elizabeth Moss is an acting tour-de-force. And I thoroughly enjoyed this movie.
Considering that The Invisible Man was produced with a budget of just under $8 million, actually what Leigh Whannell
has managed to achieve here, is something short of a major miracle. Bloomhouse does it again.It's refreshing to watch a film, director and ensemble cast that, for once treats it's audiences as intelligent adults, and that
offers something very original and different from the usual Horror film fodder.As for the numptees talking about plot-holes. Well, show me one horror movie that been made in the last decade, that also
doesn't have huge plot-holes? The Invisible Man is much more than a remake. It's storyline tackles head on the psychological effects of domestic abuse, intimidation and bullying. And just how sociopaths and abusers can easily manipulate, exploit certain situations. And I also thought that the movie got all of the pacing right.
This was never ever going to be a 'jump scare' movie. It just offers us something else. Which is a good thing.And what really makes this movie sing is the strength and depth of Elizabeth Moss' performance.
Moss with every new roles just keeps on becoming an even more impressive actress.And for those of you that are 4K UHD Blu-ray movie collectors. The Invisible Man looks outstanding in the 4K format.",The Invisible Man
821,yishu-75061,Great premise but vague story.,6,1 April 2020,"The motives of the antagonist were purely vague.I don't understand why would someone be that dumb to not check CCTV footage at restaurants to back Cecile claims.I also don't understand why Adrian's brother would do something that impulsive to his brother & his brother's wife.Yes, the antagonist is Adrian's brother, and I somehow feel that Adrian was indeed innocent and Cecile didn't wanna accept that.
Or perhaps lack of back story was missing to see things from Cecile's perspective, I mean what Adrian actually did to Cecile?
The suit was amazing, using optics technology for suit was a brilliant idea.
The movie just wanted to show an amazing optics technology of suit nothing else.",The Invisible Man

For everyone (even her friends and family) turn on her for what he has done just is scary. There was multiple twists in the movie where none of them felt forced.

She has him cornered several times but let's him go cause she all of a sudden gets scared?? So stupid.

The story evolves around a woman who escapes from her severely controlling partner. This has an obvious modern theme surrounding this issue . The suspense is incredible as he then uses his Invisibility Technology to severely harm her and her family in many different ways. Ultimately she fights back with an ending that will make you wonder who was real protagonist was and question her sanity.,The Invisible Man

But once you get the whole idea and the main back bone of the movie gets clear (which is much more sooner than it should have been) the plot holes begin to emerge, and most obvious the security cameras in the restaurant and the psychic hospital which for no reason no one cares about, the ""ready to grab the knife"" hand of the girl in the restaurant, the easy washable paint in one scene ...
The idea of the movie is not original of course, but it starts pretty decent, uses good CGI (few times when it employs it) and good music but disappoints through it's course.",The Invisible Man

At the end the characters change personalities. The bad is good, the good is bad. That's so stupid. Characters don't change so abruptly. It ruins the films that ¿twist? Come on!

I wont write this review with a bunch of spoilers but I will say if you're not watching this movie and saying ""COMMMON"" during certain scenes you're not much for looking at things objectively. Overall it was a cool syfi thriller but they could have focused a little more on the syfi rather than focusing on Elizabeth Mosses overacting damsel in distress faces. Oh and please directors, filming something in the pitch black is STUUUUUUUUUUPID. If I can't see a damn thing that's happening it's not that scary, more annoying than anything.",The Invisible Man

I just watched it on a flight and had to fast foward to the end. However, I connected to the invisible force that sabotages someones life. I can not believe that my fellow humans allow such invasive destruction. A friend of mine in Portland, OR described her torment similar to this film. The fact that I am now experiencing the sense that something invisible is ruining me is too coincidental. I live in Portland. I moved in with her ex boyfriend. Destroy this evil.

837,thtsme,Great movie falling short,7,25 November 2020,"The movie is really good. It manages to keep you interested all the time. Elisabeth Moss delivers, as usual, a superb performance. From my point of view, this woman is really one of the greatest actresses of her generation.The story is just ok. Of course, it is not new, but one would expect it to either remain true to the original or bring some new interesting twists. This movie gives none of those. It is a good movie, based on the same idea of being invisible, but that's about all it has in common with the original one.It is a stalker thriller, a bit like Sleeping with the enemy but the enemy has an invisible suit. It feels like the movie just explored the surface of the invisibility topic. And being it a property of a suit (instead of being himself invisible) makes it less interesting to explore. There is no purpose or personal conflict with the invisibility, just a means to stalk. In the original movie, the guy is looking for the antidote, as being invisible all the time brings some good, but many bad, situations.The movie focuses on her rather than on ""The invisible man"", which considering Elisabeth's performance is not such a bad idea, but at some point you may be wondering whether the invisible suit does not only make you invisible but also mute.Overall, it is a good thriller, with great acting, good soundtrack, directing, editing and not a bad ending, but it won't leave you thinking much by the end. A bit like having a very well cooked but medium to low quality steak.Nonetheless, it is very well cooked, so I do recommend you watch this movie.",The Invisible Man

I wasn't a big fan of the plot, but it surprised me in a positive way, because I was expecting something idfferent.
Some part didn't make sense, like the simplicity of the invention, the fact that she hides her uniform in the bathroom, he gets in there, sees the uniform, yet he doesn't suspect anything the last time he sees her. Unless it was the brother that entered the bathroom while she was at their house.
I don't understand how she went to his house after all this without being scared? How they both pretended to have a civilised dinner?

Leigh Whannell created all three and accompanied the film with a remarkable and handsdown bloody terrific score. I haven't watched such a superb and scary film in yonks.
But, in due deference to the grumpy reviewers, the latter third of the movie left the sphere of realism somewhat. But despite those glitches this movie by Whannell rises to a definite 8 stars by this viewer who hasn't felt chills like that since The Wax Museum, a horror film I saw when I was a kid! My bad memory! Sorry ( !!!) for film buffs the 1953 film with Vincent Price was The House of Wax by Andre de Toth.

Also, is the Invisible Man's obsession about Elizabeth Moss's inner beauty?

The story line / plot twists are a bit predictable like a Scooby Doo episode, but a few of the jump scares / suspense moments were great.This is more of a thriller drama movie, not for action Sci-Fi fans.

There is very little to excite the mind throughout a pretty trudgingly slow plot, and the villainous portrayal of a man in an invisible suit would work much better with a more realistic representation of the person in the suit.Does it provide super-human powers to the wearer? At times his strength and agility while invisible seem outrageously overdone. Does this suit somehow afford him incredible speed to catch up to his wife who was in a car (and seemingly let him know just where she was going)? But most importantly, what is his endgame?? There doesn't seem to be much motivation for Adrian/Tom in the plot other than to simply torture Cecilia, which diminishes the story until the ""surprising"" reveal of her pregnancy.

852,wyattap,So promising yet so so so disappointing,3,1 December 2020,"A film that brings the feature title in to the 21st century.
Rather than it being the human who goes invisible, it is a suit that makes the purfect disguise.However, though the original idea was reinvented with a technical twist, the writing of the story was left lagging in its wake.I feel there are more holes in this story than there is plot, which starts from the very beginning where Cecilia runs for her life with no explanation.Whilst you can excuse the introduction as a director allowing your imagination to fill in the gaps, there was no back story of the characters for you to engage in. This continued throughout the next for scenes as the story unfolded new characters to the fold.Whilst the film leaves you to consider the girl is a little unhinged, the almost poltergeist endeavours begin which is where the totally unbelievable events start.Example.... Cecilia sits down with another girl, the daughter of the cop she is staying with. The other girl gets slapped in the face, which is suggested Cecilia did. Yet the girl was clearly sitting in front of her, sees she made no move.... yet blamed her by not saying anything to her dad.....She didnt question the fact she was hit by an invisible force. She didnt acknowledge Cecilia didnt touch her. It went undiscussed. The daughter may have been in shock, but really....?After this she drives all the way to the house where the story started. This is some miles away over the Golden Gate bridge.She does to the suit ""which is hanging up'. Takes it, and proceeds to hide it whilst the invisible man has managed to follow her, undetected, to the house. Did he fly? How did he know she was going there? And why, when she was being chased around the house, did she hide the suit..... surely you would put it on to leave the building undetected? Further more, nobody believed she was telling the truth about the invisible man.... So she said in the following scenes she had something to show them.... another hole.... why didnt she just take it to show them? Bonkers.....Then there was the restaurant scene. A huge knife which cant be hidden inside a skin tight suit that can only be taken off from the back, appears in front of Cecilia and her sister which proceeds to slice the sisters throat and placed in to Cecilia's hand.
Like Cecilia would have sat there and watched it happen.... let alone have the knife placed in to her hand.I could go on..... but I wont. The film has sapped my energy.If you see this on your TV planner, please choose a different channel and save 2 hours of your life.",The Invisible Man

Psychopath scientist : It is understandable that scientists seem to be crazy people because they keep themselves immersed in research but it is bit over-the-top to portray them as psychopath. A scientist who has invented an invisibility suit that has paradigm altering capacity to change the world will forget everything and pursue his drifted wife just to torture her ?2. Adrian is killing people in public buildings and restaurants that are monitored y CCTV cameras and not even police investigated the matter. How come guards are not talking about having seen man appearing in front of him out of thin air !!3. It was female protagonist all the time.

We're on a desert road in the middle of some pine forest, dark as coal so you need a lantern to see your way through. A car comes to pick you up, you're scared as hell and the driver is just like this was the most common thing to happen. Then comes the aggressor, breaks the car window and now your finally start the car and disappear in the night. Magically, a tiny vase of pills is instantly seen in the dark mist. Amazing.Then the perfect wave. A mail sent to her sister saying a lot of bad things but one thing you might think immediately is ""what about passwords"" Right after a scene where a James daughter gets hit by the Invisible man and she says it was Cee when she was a mile from her. So much love but no doubt it was her.Cee gets back to Adrian's home. All the passwords remain the same. Great. She discovers the suit or one of the suits, runs away, get on the uber, long lone distance ride to have dinner in a fancy restaurant with her sister. The invisible man is already there and takes out her sister life. Well, around here (Portugal), restaurants like that all have cameras. Not in there. Cee is arrest on a mental institute.
T
hen comes the rain scene. What the hell. So much suspense around the rain for nothing. At least when Cee begins her escape we discover that even hurt several times the suits must also give super strength to his owner as well as the suit mal function only seems to appear to Cee and right after we have a sweet Deja-vu Terminator scene as Cee tries to get out of the Mental Institute that has a bunch of highly harmed cops, badly trained and that appear by pairs.In the parking lot the not so invisible man, with the suit mal function gets seen by a cop. No bother. Never heard about it again. The invisible man starts running to James house to hurt his daughter. He got there and the suits is working just fine again. Although is a suit completely closed the spray does some effect. He got killed a minutes later. The suit was working fine and no one saw if it was the same guy with some pen holes.Right to the end. Another WTF moment. After some crying at the table moment Cee goes to the bathroom. Adrian is killed from behind while the bathroom was in front and some seconds after Cee appears running calling 911. You might think. There a third guy in there but no. It was her with a Suit perfectly her size and that she dressed up and undressed in just a few seconds. Wish she can be faster like this during the all movie.",The Invisible Man

Expecting a predictable storyline, there were a couple of unexpected twists and turns that kept me guessing (and even gave me a shock or two).My only gripe was one particular moment where the main character does the typical horror movie thing of walking into a blatant trap. Admittedly I was shouting at the screen at this point.However, overall this moment was overshadowed by an effectively put together suspense film.",The Invisible Man

874,ewanfortune,Tense,9,4 March 2020,"This reboot of the classic horror villain begins with a very tense scene and doesn't let up from there. The film manages to feel both classic and modern, thanks to Leigh Whannell's script and direction.The acting is very strong, with Elisabeth Moss in particular turning in a very strong performance. The tension is palpable throughout the film, aided by the pounding score from Benjamin Wallfisch. The movie doesn't opt for cheap scares either, each jump feeling earned at not just stuck in there for a reaction.My favourite thing about the film is how it combines supernatural horror with real life horror. The Invisible Man is of course unrealistic, however combined with an abusive boyfriend the stakes feel higher and the fear is heightened. It's a unique investigation into domestic abuse and the effects that it has and elevates this film above a standard horror film. I definitely recommend seeing this film.",The Invisible Man

878,barcham_99,Predictable from the beginning to the end.,6,21 March 2020,"Nothing in this movie surprised me. It seemed to take forever to get going and I found it very formulaic. I was able to predict what was going to happen with very little effort.The standard questions and problems apply here... how is it that every scientist who is a little on the warped side seems to be a fantastic fighter and in great physical shape in these films? Have writers ever spent any time near anyone in just about any scientific field? They aren't exactly gym rats or martial arts adepts, they spend all their time working on their projects. Think Big Bang Theory instead of Bruce Lee. But here we have a mad genius who is also a great fighter as well as an expert in psychological manipulation. Amazing how he found time to create his fantastic suit!Was ANYONE surprised when she opened her portfolio only to find it empty? No? Didn't think so.The sister's fate is so obvious that Stevie Wonder could see it coming, and once again we have someone in a movie falling dead as soon as the knife cuts across her throat. In reality, there would be so much arterial spray that people on neighbouring tables would have it all over themselves, and she would take minutes to bleed out, not die instantly as if she was shot in the head.Was anyone surprised part 2: Cecilia is PREGNANT! The only surprise was that it took so long to get the news out. There needed to be a reason to keep Adrian from simply killing her to get revenge, that would have made for a much shorter and most likely more enjoyable film, and his wanting to be a father at any cost was the key to that. No matter that he was incredibly rich, lived in a fantastic home, was very good-looking and could probably have had his choice of women at the snap of his fingers, he wanted the one who did not want him. Even though from the beginning she seemed to be as stable as a bowl of Jello in an earthquake. Go figure.Then there is Cecilia's ineptitude. During the major escape/attack scene in the facility, 'Adrian' is about 30 feet away from her in a suit that is flipping on and off, and she is maybe a foot away from a guard's gun but just lies there yelling and only grabs the gun after he has shot one more guard and taken two others out and is running away. I will not even mention the incompetence of the guards. When she does finally catch up to him, like usual the bad guy takes three or four in the chest and keeps coming. Hasn't anyone in these movies ever watched one of these movies? Usually the bad guy is wearing body armour. Go for a head shot, especially when you have a stationary target or the bad guy hits the ground. But no, lets just take chest shot after shot while the guy keeps coming. I felt like screaming at the screen HEAD SHOT!!!!! And then came 'was anyone surprised part 3': the big reveal when the mask came off, which was a surprise to no one still awake.The ending was problematic as well when it comes to timing. How did she get in the suit, cut his throat, run back, get out of the suit and then walk back in time to see him die? Suddenly Cecilia has become a quick change artist. We also need to consider that she never really had any time to learn how the suit actually worked. And learning how to walk and move in a suit where she herself likely could not see her own limbs would have taken some practice. I don't know, maybe it is the suit itself that turns scientists and lawyers into killers with Jason Bourne like skills and also makes the wearer instantly know how the suit works, if the wearer can figure how to even turn it on.But hey! At least Adrian took a more realistic length of time to die from his slit throat. The only realistic thing in the movie. And Cecilia really pulled herself together from a total wreck to turn into a calm, cold-blooded killer in a few days or weeks. Incredible.So to summarize, the movie seemed to take forever to get going, was very predictable, and seemed to never want to end. But she walked away with the suit, so I guess we will have a sequel coming along eventually. Oh joy! LOL!",The Invisible Man

885,gwsteinmetz,Amazing!,9,14 April 2020,"This movie is still masterclass of horror to me, an instant favorite.That said, this'll be my spoiler thoughts on it because I just rewatched it and it definitely holds up on a second viewing. The movie opens with Cecilia (Elisabeth Moss) going through this very well thought out plan and trying to escape her abusive relationship with her now ex-boyfriend. Let me just say, this movie never tells you outright what happened, it's all implied, and that's the scariest part. After she flees and drops her bottle of diazepam, it cuts to two weeks later and she's living with James (Aleks Hodge) and his daughter Sydney (Storm Reid). I love this relationship and how it's not a romantic one, it just makes you very happy for them and you feel Cecilia's development.
Then she finds out that Adrian killed himself, or did he? After they get back from a meeting with Tom, Adrian's younger brother, the movie changes, and for the better, and I love it even more! You start getting perspective shots of the titular Invisible Man, the first being when it cuts to down the hallway while Cecilia celebrates with James and Sydney. This is when you realize, this is no longer a house of three, it's a house of four.
After some very suspenseful and dreadful scenes that are masterfully crafted, Adrian sends an email through Cecilia's account saying things that drive Cecilia and her sister apart, and once she finds out she's crying on the floor when Sydney comes to comfort her, but then Adrian punches her in the face, hard, and she calls for her dad, James. Now this part could've been handled better, I believe James' character but Sydney was punched from an opposite side then Cecilia was on, and her immediate reaction was, ""Why'd you punch me Cecilia?"" So that just didn't work for me that much. James and Sydney then leave and Cecilia lays out coffee grounds to track Adrian's footprints, he doesn't cast any, but then she calls him and the phone is ringing from in the attic. She goes up and sees the phone, a bagged up knife, and her projects she's worked on that were missing in an earlier scene.
I have another problem, why didn't she take the phone to James or the police and say, ""Hey, my crazy, invisible ex has been stalking me and tearing my life apart, here's some evidence."" As she shows them the picture of her and Sydney sleeping. Again, weird. Also she dumps white paint on the invisible suit and Adrian washes it off with a kitchen sink, yeeeeahhhhh, no. I would've bought it if he went in the shower but the sink? That's a little bit too far for me. She then goes to Adrian's house form the beginning and finds a second suit that she stores away in the place she hid her bags in in the beginning of the movie. Okay. She gets in a scuffle with Adrian and leaves.
Now it's time, time for my favorite scene of this 2 hour movie, the beginning and the ending are both super close to also being my favorite, but this one tops them all. Cecilia meets up with her sister in a public restaurant. The waiter was very funny and I enjoyed his performance even though we just get glimpses of his face. However, Cecilia goes on this monologue to her sister talking about how much she loves her, how she'd beat up James if she wanted to, and how Cecilia feels age when that strength is with her and scared when it's against her. She handles this very well and then starts talking about how she's found something, how she found a suit that can turn invisible, but then the sister looks over her shoulder, and we see a knife hovering there, and in a blink-and-you'll-miss-it shot, the knife slashes the sister's throat, and Adrian puts it into Cecilia's hand, and heads out. It's horrifying, it's the thing that sacred me most in my first viewing, and yeah, I know it should've been caught on tape, but I don't care. It's handled terrifically and it's a nice Segway into when Cecilia gets taken to a holding facility.
In this part she finds out she's pregnant, how Adrian's brother is working with him, and then there's an escape scene after Cecilia gets the better of Adrian and damages the suit. So now she's chasing him because he's going to punish her for this by killing Sydney, and Cecilia tells James the news. Then the Invisible Man shows up at the house way before Cecilia. In my second viewing I felt like Tom was closer and he put on a suit and after Adrian contacted him, he went to kill Sydney. That's the only reason for me to Redon how he got there so much earlier than Cecilia. Anyways, in a brutal scene Tom beats the daylights out of James before Cecilia pumps his guts full of lead! (Home Alone) She takes off the mask and it's Tom, Adrian's brother, I already explained how this might've happened above but yeah. Finale time!
In this finale Cecilia goes to Adrian's house for a date, because they made it look like Tom kidnapped Adrian and did all this stuff to Cecilia. So Adrian greets her and lets her in, they sit down, then Cecilia says, ""If you want to be a part of this child's life, then we have to start with honesty."" She tries to get him to admit that he was the Invisible Man but he won't budge. ""... that shouldn't come as a, Surprise."" After that line she knows, he did this to me 100%. So she excuses herself saying to need to tidy herself up and it cuts to Adrian alone when suddenly he starts shaking and his hand holding a knife come up to his neck and spits his own throat. Cecilia comes in and starts screaming at the sight that just happened she's all frantic and calls 911, notes the security camera visual line, backs up out of it, and ends the call. She did it, she killed Adrian, and because James was listening in through this the whole time he rushed down and knows Cecilia killed him but, ""It sounded like he killed himself."" So Cecilia got away with it, she walks up the steps, music swelling, and Leigh Whannel.
I may not have really given my opinion in the spoiler thing, but if you're any more of it, it's in my earlier review for The Invisible Man, anyways, that's pretty much it.",The Invisible Man

887,productionslykos,A Thriller Done Right,8,22 March 2020,"A thriller done right. The suspense was the greatest accomplishment this movie had to offer among many other attributes. Every songless scene, every faint sound effect, every camera angle all aided in building a tension that at times was never broken. However, when destroyed would feel entirely earned through premium scares that never fell short of authentic. A huge part of such amazing tension was birthed from a simple yet effective shot where simply nothing happened in frame, really emphasizing that invisible man facade and bringing to life Cecilia's constant anxiety to the audience. Elisabeth Moss murdered her role, achieving an exhausted, vanquished woman defined through violence such as s emotional manipulation, and psychological warfare all weighing down on her fabricating a person about to snap. The ending felt truly earned and as such had myself mentally applauding for the death of the cockroach of an antagonist! And in regards to the antagonist, the new iteration of the Invisible Man brought to life through technological means was a perfect addition. Providing an alternate
solution for invisibility other than through paranormal or magical elements grounded the concept better than most thrillers care to do.
Leigh Whannell did wonders with his seven million dollar budget,

I find it interesting that 90% of all the bad reviews are a 1/10. Seriously guys...It is basic knowledge that if you rate the movie a 1/10 you want to make a clear statement about something that is not the quality of the movie itself. It seems like most of these 1/10 - 4/10 reviews are about how BAD the movie is for focusing on a woman. This is insane, people! Are we living in the 18th century. You don't have to whine about the lead being a woman and if you have a problem with it then don't watch the movie. The other negative reviews are about plot holes.Yes there are some inconsistencies but no more than in other movies that I guarantee you that you rank higher than this one.

911,jyer-74265,Movie of two halves,5,31 May 2021,"This movie has a very strong first act. The director does a great job creating environmental tension such as using first person camera footage (I believe from Adrian's point of view watching Cecilia) and subtle imperfections to things like a chair which looks as if someone is sitting in it when in fact no one is visibly there.Overall the movie has great camera & editing work. And initially feels like a powerful piece of drama acting from the main actor but the movie turns a little wayward in the third act. Things like Cecilia so easily walking out of the hospital, or making it back to James & Sydney's house without a trail of police following her. The twist felt unnecessary. And the final scene which I felt tried to leave the audience with an ambiguous twist finish, just felt like a bad attempt at fitting in with the Horror genre. If the second half of the movie continued with the story telling of the first half and didn't try too hard it was very close to being a classic. Interested to see it the director finished the way he did to leave room for a sequel...",The Invisible Man

934,gillianronnie,Leigh Whannell crafts a visceral thriller with a new updated take on the classic story.,9,26 February 2020,WHANNELL has been in my opinion one of the most underrated director /writers for a long time. He was mostly behind the insidious and saw franchises And came out with the spectacular futuristic thriller upgrade in 2018. His brilliant style is once again back with full force in this new adaptation of the invisible man. many people will just look at this like another Blum house manufactured film at first but realize that just because it has the production name on it doesn't mean it will be another throwaway film. This film much like upgrade thrives with a crisp smart script and fantastic visuals. Whannell has a keen eye for detail and it shows in bunches in this film. Elizabeth Moss also gives a phenomenally dedicated performance And sheds emotion throughout. There are many moments in this vicious film that you will not see coming and I was actually surprised by the amount of brutality which serves the overall story well. This is a new take on a classic universal monster that you will not want to miss and it's definitely worthy of going to see in the theater unlike many films of late.,The Invisible Man

Another reason to go see this film is because of the director who previously made upgrade in 2018 which was also pretty good and in this film he uses visuals to guide you through a lot of the film, mainly using some cool camera movements. And of course the horror and it works even though I wasn't frightened by the film it was very intense and this film had a very dislike able villain. Anyway ignoring my one small issue with the film I recommend you go see this in theaters.",The Invisible Man
937,v-19461,existing some problem,5,24 May 2020,"There are a lot of fun points, say something I was impressed.

That doesn't make sense.
There are also cloaking suits with cameras all over them, and trypophobia is very uncomfortable.
The end is also very ambiguous, in the end is the male master's brother is the real murderer, male master was mistakenly killed, everything is she imagined. Or male master is the real murderer, do not admit, she made a quick decision to kill.
In short, the experience is incoherent and the sense of fault is too strong. It's not a good substitute, but if it's just a horror movie, it's probably ok, for the atmosphere. Or commendable point. A lot of classic scary stuff and music. For example, invisible people throw coffee sand on the ground to make him visible. The noise in the attic.

945,forchennfederation,A Thriller Worth Seeing (Get it?),9,18 May 2020,"I have been rooting for the Universal Monsters franchise to get the reinvigoration that it's desperately needed for some time. As much as I've enjoyed movies like Dracula Untold and The Mummy (2017), clearly there was something about those movies that didn't click as far as attempts at kickstarting a franchise is concerned. With The Invisible Man, from Blumhouse and directed by Leigh Whannell, I hoped that it was a sign of Universal taking a more humble approach and letting said movie be a movie focused on telling a thrilling & good story that's not trying to set up a cinematic universe (an approach that allowed many of the Universal Monsters films to be regarded as classics in the 1st place). And, I must say that The Invisible Man (2020) was a really, really good, perhaps even great, sci-fi thriller. So, now, let's get into why it's so good.First, a plot synopsis: The film focuses on Cecilia Kass, who left her abusive boyfriend Adrian Griffin. After finding out he died, she tries to move on, but then she starts noticing some very unusual things which lead her to think that Griffin has found a way to torment her using invisibility.There's a lot that I can praise this movie for, but we'll start with the acting. The acting in the film is very good as a whole, but Elisabeth Moss, as Cecilia, is the one who commands the screen; she does an excellent job at conveying the emotions of a woman who has gone through Hell and whose life is just about to get worse, and it makes the viewer feel for her and root for her in her struggle.The film also has great direction going on from Leigh Whannell, who has proven himself since Upgrade, the 2018 film, that he is a name worth looking out for. He's definitely taken pointers for his film from his fellow filmmaker, James Wan, whom he collaborated with for several past films that Wan made, and I can say that Whannell has certainly refined his skills to a substantial degree. There are several scenes that involve great cinematography, from the setting of Griffin's estate to scenes where Kass is looking out for any signs of Griffin, as the titular Invisible Man, possibly being in the same room as her. Another scene worth noting is when the Invisible Man is fighting & killing a bunch of people in a hallway, which provides some hard-hitting action and some brutal, bloody kills.There's also plenty of suspense going on as the film keeps you guessing on whether the Invisible Man is in the same room as Cecilia or what he was gonna do and when, which would lead to some well-executed scares, some intense scenes of Kass confronting the Invisible Man, and even scenes that are surprising (I can say that there were a couple moments that totally caught me off guard when I saw it in the theater).The story is also a well-told & compelling tale about what a manipulative & abusive relationship could do to a person and the film tells this story in a way that doesn't feel pandering but rather in a way where anyone, no matter what gender, could relate. I can also say that the film has plenty of surprises, that I don't want to spoil because the marketing for the film actually keep a lot in secret for people to see cold and I want people to go in the same; I was worried that the trailers had given away more than necessary, but I was wrong and I couldn't be happier about being wrong.If there's anything that I could say that isn't so much a negative as it is something that's kinda iffy/questionable, I would say that there are a couple of moments in the film that make me question how the Invisible Man got to certain places as well as how one scene, despite being still an effective scene, raises a question about whether or not there are security cameras in the room that could somewhat raise people's eyebrows about a certain event that went down in said scene.When it's all said and done, I can say that The Invisible Man (2020) was one of the best horror reboots that I've seen in a while; it's certainly the best modern reiteration of a Universal Monster to come out by far. While perhaps not perfect, it's suspenseful to a nail-biting degree, it's expertly-directed, Elisabeth Moss is fantastic, and the story was very engaging from beginning to end. And, the best part about this film's quality, as well as its financial success, is that it has given me hope that the Universal Monsters franchise may finally have received the reinvigoration it's needed for modern times, and I'm very much looking forward to seeing what Blumhouse does with this franchise in the future.",The Invisible Man
946,MovieWatchDad,"A gripping Sci-fi premise with highly effective tension ratcheting, tainted with non-stop unrealistic human behavior.",5,29 February 2020,"This INVISIBLE MAN would have been an excellent thriller bringing fresh suspense and edge-of-your-seat tension to the big screen, but you can hardly enjoy the movie due to the blaring non-human-like responses made by almost every character in each 'frightening' scene. Only one character performed with genuine emotion that truly reflected what was happening onscreen, and that was Sydney Lanier (Storm Reid). Other actors reacted to their circumstances in a totally unrealistic manner. None reflected the type of behavior, reactions, or even reflexes that a normal person would have had in that same situation. This weakness in the screenplay was so blaring, that it was a distraction and greatly subtracted from the positive traits of the movie.Here are just a few examples of unrealistic human behavior that did not reflect how a normal person would have acted in that scenario. WARNING SPOILERS AHEAD!1. Cecilia has taken EXTREME measures to meticulously plan her middle of the night escape from her dangerous husband, in Mission Impossible fashion, down to the very last evasive detail. Yet when she gets to the very last step of her escape, instead of simply walking out of the open garage door, she decides to stop and talk to the large family dog and waste time trying to remove its tightly latched proximity collar, which results in the dog bumping the car and activating the noisy car alarm. NO REASONABLE PERSON TRYING TO ESCAPE WITH THEIR LIFE WOULD HAVE DONE THAT.2. Cecilia is in the house alone in the kitchen, and thinks she hears a noise, and turns around to notice the front door chain has been removed and the front door is wide open. It is freezing cold outside. So what does she do? She takes a short stroll outside the mysteriously wide-open door and just stands there like she is about to take a smoke break or something. NO REASONABLE PERSON WOULD HAVE JUST STROLLED BLINDLY OUTSIDE INTO DANGER WITH THE DOOR WIDE OPEN. (This scene was obviously just written that way so they could show the invisible man's breath in the cold air.)3. Cecilia hears the sound of Adrian's vibrating phone coming from the attic and she decides to climb up the ladder to investigate the dark attic...by herself...WITHOUT CALLING ANYONE ELSE FOR HELP BEFORE GOING UP.4. While in the attic, she finds his phone, and a butcher knife, and a set of keys. She then suspects the invisible man is waiting below on the ladder, so she tosses a can of paint downward and terrifyingly discovers that he is. She then, with two phones available, decides to jump down out of the attic to the floor, and try to pursue the invisible man with the butcher knife...INSTEAD OF TRYING TO CALL FOR HELP FROM THE SAFETY OF THE ATTIC WITH ONE OF THE TWO PHONES IN HER HANDS.5. Cecilia visits her sister to discover that someone has sent her sister an ugly email and made it look like it came from Cecilia. Her sister accuses her and slams the door in her face. She spends only about 2.5 seconds trying to defend herself, and then just leaves. NO REASONABLE PERSON WOULD HAVE LEFT WITHOUT INSISTING THE EMAIL DIDN'T COME FROM THEM.6. When she gets home, she logs in to her laptop and reads the ugly email that was sent to her sister. She breaks down crying and lies on the floor for hours. SHE MAKES NO ATTEMPT TO CALL HER SISTER AND PLEAD HER INNOCENCE.7. While Cecilia and her sister are sitting in the restaurant talking, a butcher knife begins to float in mid-air next to Cecilia's head. The sister sees it and just sits there watching the floating knife and NEVER REACTS TO IT OR SAYS A WORD ABOUT IT.8. After the invisible man murders Cecilia's sister with the butcher knife, he immediately places the bloody knife in Cecilia's right hand. SHE NEVER TRIES TO DROP THE KNIFE OR LET IT GO, OR MOVE AT ALL! SHE JUST HOLDS IT FOR ABOUT 45 SECONDS, LONG ENOUGH FOR EVERYONE IN THE RESTAURANT TO SEE IT AND THINK SHE KILLED HER OWN SISTER.9. WHAT RESTAURANT ON EARTH PROVIDES A GIANT BUTCHER KNIFE AT THE TABLE instead of a steak knife or dinner knife?? THEY HADN'T EVEN ORDERED ANY FOOD!10. When Cecilia is in the hallway at the mental hospital struggling with the police officers, the invisible man attacks and injures 4 police officers. Officer number 5 runs up on the scene, after having witnessed officers 3 and 4 being literally knocked around by some invisible force, AND HE DECIDES TO JUST STAND THERE AND POINT HIS GUN WAY DOWN THE HALL AT CECILIA, WHILE YELLING ""STAY DOWN CECILIA"" 7 TIMES???11. At the mental hospital, Cecilia attempts suicide by jabbing a sharp pen into her wrist, and then pulling in downward, tearing the veins. After that... NO BLOOD? NO AGONY? NO MEDICAL EMERGENCY? NO NO DYING? WAS SHE ACTUALLY A CYBORG??12. At least 10 characters throughout the movie are physically assaulted by this invisible assailant, and these people just stand there and stare into blank space. NOBODY YELLS, SCREAMS, PANICS, OR CRIES FOR HELP DURING THE ATTACKS?? ARE THESE PEOPLE EVEN HUMAN??The list goes on and on, but I believe this is enough to show you the frustrating 2-hour pattern on unrealistic human behavior that ruins this movie experience. The INVISIBLE MAN would have been so much better if the characters had at least reacted to their circumstances with genuine emotions or reflexes that any reasonable person would have shown.",The Invisible Man
947,aleksandersochan,Strange movie logic overshadowed by quality suspense and spooks,8,1 October 2020,"Very predictable at times and very frustrating at others with some of the actions and logic in the show. You'll get pissed off at a multitude of the characters and feel these people are dumb as hell or just feel like it's a gaping logic hole in the plot. The main character does have her shining 2000 IQ moments though, which are attention grabbing and pleasantly rewarding.Despite all that, the movie is fantastically suspenseful and entertainingly tragic. The acting was pretty solid and the cinematography and effects as well. My girlfriend and I were sufficiently spooked after so that's an 8/10 for me.

And, I noticed a touch of insensitivity in me with respect to empathizing with the victim. But, I took a minute and checked that, then went back and enjoyed this very good movie.

975,Wayne1138,Proof that Blumhouse should have remade Universals Classic Monsters from the start........,10,2 March 2020,"(MASSIVE SPOILERS)So after Universals Dark Universe died before it even got started, they have gone back to the drawing board updating their 'Classic Monsters'. The Invisible Man is not a Dark Universe movie (I doubt we will get any more), but Universal have made the right decision getting Blumhouse involved and to be honest, after this effort, that's what they should have done from the start. At the time of writing, the film has made three times its production budget back in a single day in the U.S alone.The Invisible Man is a classic case of awful trailer, incredible movie and updating it to a modern audience perfectly.Telling the story of Cecilia (played brilliantly by Elizabeth Moss) who from the start flees a very abusive and violent relationship to one Adrian Griffin who in turn is a genius in the field of optics. After being told Griffin has committed suicide, Cecilia feels free at last. However, once strange occurrences start happening while staying with a friend and her daughter, Cecilia comes to the conclusion that Griffin is still alive, is using his genius in optics and has made himself invisible. What happens from here is what makes the film is that, as well as Cecilia, we the audience also know what's happening but watching her being accused of horrendous things she hasn't done (including a shocking murder in the films best scene) is where this film excels. There is also a scene involving Adrians brother, who is also in on what is going on and explains that Cecilia is pregnant after swapping her birth control pills for something else. This is why Adrian refuses to actually kill Cecilia. Due to all this, we are just willing for Cecilia to fight back and wonder how she will clear her name, as well as stopping what Adrian is doing to her.The film ends where, in a twist and after a fight to the death, we find that it is actually Adrians brother who was The Invisible Man and he in turn claims he faked Adrians death and has imprisoned him at Adrians own home. Or did he?????? This is where the film excels in paranoia, but due to how strong the character of Cecilia is, she knows her husband and the sort of manipulator he is and she turns the tables on him using his own technology and getting her revenge.Leigh Whanell has just excelled himself here, after being involved with horror for quite some time now, especially with the brilliant Insidious series. The film he has directed here is beautifully shot, the San Francisco setting makes it more special, the cast are excellent and the icing on the cake is another great score from Benjamin Wallfisch. Even the tech used to bring the Invisible Man to life is grounded in reality to make it more believable.Horror is back in brilliant style at the moment and as mentioned, after the success of The Conjuring Universe, Insidious and now Halloween, Blumhouse, James Wan, Leigh Whanell et al should have been responsible for the Dark Universe from the get go. They know how to do horror brilliantly and The Conjuring 2 was the best horror film in years.The Invisible Man though was beyond what I thought it was going to be and if the ending of this film is anything to go by, The Invisible Woman will be next. I only hope Blumhouse oversee all the updates of Universals Classic Monsters going forward. Brilliant.",The Invisible Man

980,ebabsy-60853,Marmite Movie,7,14 September 2020,"As you can see from other reviews, this is a marmite movie: you either love it or hate it. I fell somewhere in the middle. Like a lot of people I liked the initial premise. Instead of the usual trope of seeing how he becomes the invisible man, we switch sides and come in a few months/years down the line and follow his abused and terrified girlfriend, Cecilia, as she escapes and tries to live a new life being cared for by her sister's friend and his daughter. Cecilia lives with agoraphobia and PTSD until her sister comes to tell her that Adrian, her abusive ex, has killed himself. Excellent. Clever. Different from previous versions. Of course we, the audience, know that he isn't dead because it's called ""The Invisible Man"" not ""How I Hid Until He Died"". I was happy enough with that and content to wade through people thinking she was still struggling and even losing her mind as long as she killed him at the end. However when that ending comes, I was a little disappointed. And I was for one reason: We were presented with what could have been a great bait and switch. Earlier in the film we meet Adrian's brother Tom who is handling Adrian's estate after his suicide. During this meeting he tells her she has been left $5million to be paid over time. There is fine print saying she is to commit no crimes, etc. Later, Cecilia's sister is killed and it is made to look like Cecilia did it. Tom turns up and tells her that as she committed a crime, she is no longer entitled to the money. There is some other stuff but I won't fully spoil it. Fast forward, Cecilia kills the invisible man, only to discover it's Tom. Does the movie end here with a ""Haha, you thought you knew what was coming. Yes, Adrian was a ba$¥@£d but he had killed himself after all."" ? No. As we are trying to make a social comment we have to swing back to ""Adrian was a ba$¥@£D and now she has to kill him"". For me, and probably just me, the movie would have been better for the twist as it would have subverted my expectations. Tom did actually have something to gain from harassing her, killing her sister and making her look crazy. He would have got the money back and revenge for his brother's death. It fit nicely. It's still a well done film, and if that hadn't happened I wouldn't have felt I missed out.
But it makes me wish they had. See it and decide for yourself.",The Invisible Man
981,johnhandsome-32658,Excellent for what it is,8,1 March 2020,"For what Invisible Man lacks it in logic it make up for in lack of pretense. Here, you have a horror-thriller that absolutely bolts into an engaging and well acted story.If you're looking for Terminator 2 tone of the past meets Friday the 13th then jump on board. Twists in turns, it's more than a one trick pony and if you're willing to suspend your disbelief then prepare to be highly entertained.Look, if you can't put all that aside you might find it tricky to enjoy... but it's February and twice as good as many big budget horrors try to be. While the substance and undertones of abusive relationships are ""common"" they are no or more less important. While this film lacks of the sophistication of some psycho horrors which were released a few years ago,: Green Room, Killing of a Sacred Deer, Blue Ruin, and others, those movies didn't do so well at the box office, thus making room for higher concept movies like Invisible Man.The Invisible Man might not be an instant classic but it should trail along nice.

She does bag things, and his brother does bad things, but Adrian?No evidence of him being any kind of villain whatsoever.They did nothing to establish him as a bad guy. and there is zero evidence of him every having been in the suit at any point in the movie.Obviously they didn't want to do anything as troublesome as establish his villain bona fides, so you are just supposed to accept that he's done all the things she and his brother claim.The movie opens with her having drugged him, and her ""escaping"" from their home.He wakes, he chases her and he punches through the car window and tries to pull her out. Is that evidence that he's a monster, or just that he's mad as hell that she drugged him?And that's it. Nothing more.Adrian smashes a car window and tries to grab her.Everything else is done by his brother... oh, except for when she puts on the spare suit and makes it look like Adrian killed himself.Hodge's character lets her go, not because he is on her side, but because he is scared of crossing a known murder who has a stealth suit.

985,fixerjb,The new invisible man!,7,10 August 2020,"This film directed by Leigh Whannell was a surprise.A scientist fakes his own death to torment his former partner by turning invisible. Elizabeth Moss plays Cecilia, a woman tormented by her ex-boyfriend. Taking the element of science fiction, this is a film about the traumas left by the abuses in this case committed by a man towards a woman and how even if the abuser disappears it can still remain in one's mind.The cinematographic techniques and the camera shots that the film uses are forceful to show us in the environment that there is someone who cannot be seen, this drives Cecilia more crazy and nobody believes her. It may be a clear metaphor when a woman is abused and sometimes they don't believe her. And what is sad is that they can be close people who you trusted. She must draw strength from anywhere to fight it with interesting turning points on how to get rid of a scientist who is a genius but who is a controlling psychopath and who is ahead of everything.It is not a perfect film but it is a little different from the others of its genre because of the atmosphere it raises, the suspense and also a good level of acting.

This is not normal human behavior (even for a mad scientist/and his brilliant lawyer brother). Insane people do better. Scenes don't play out like this in real life. It's cartoonish. ------------ And the girl herself- at first- a coward, cry baby, whinning around like a idiot- but then- all of a sudden- she's a courageous goddess of a super action hero.

994,sane1216,Beware Glowing Reviews,4,25 October 2021,"There are too many things in this movie that are obviously forced and not well thought out for the plotline the creators were trying to convey and the emotions they were equally trying to create within the viewer.The problems all start in the beginning of this story. You don't meet the villain and have enough time with him to have any type of insight into him nor create empathy with the MC, Cecilia played by Elizabeth Moss. But let me stop here and commend Elizabeth Moss on her acting. If there's one thing positive about this movie, she did a phenomenal job acting at times when she was wrestling against an invisible foe. As did many of the other actors and actresses. Ms. Moss also did her best with what she was given and I commend her on that, but the writing and internal consistency and logic fell short for me. I know at times you're supposed to turn your brain off to enjoy things, but when minor details are obviously forced to try to manipulate a story and force the plot, it's pretty obvious.As said, if the beginning had provided a different viewpoint, I might have grown more invested in the story and overlooked some of the silliness. There's a point in the story where Cecilia is framed for murder by the villain and I told my wife at that point that if the story had likely started there, I would have been invested without caring about seeing the aforementioned abusive relationship.There are other elements such as the story wants me to believe this obsessive compulsive controlling ex-boyfriend will go to such extremes to torture his ex-girlfriend, but somehow Cecilia managed to befriend another male whom she's able to flee to immediately after escaping said overly obsessive compulsive controlling boyfriend? When was she able to meet this over six-foot tall, muscular, athletic, intimidating (her own words) man? As a guy, I could tell you that even guys who aren't insane obsessive compulsive controlling boyfriends and secure in their relationship would question their girlfriends befriending a guy like that. And no, before someone wants to call it insecurity, she's in such a relationship with this other man that it's intimacy with out the romantic and sexual intimacy. She's so close to this other guy that she professes love for his college age daughter? My point, again, is that unless said guy is already a friend of the couple which disarms alarm of any other normal guy who would be in a relationship with her, somehow we're supposed to believe that this insanely controlling ex-boyfriend stood by while she befriended this intimidating other male?I know in society today, the above alone rubs some people the wrong way, but if you think men and women aren't intimidated by other men and women getting in relationships with their significant others, then you're quite naïve. It happens all of the time. Even with women. So don't go to the ""Insecure male"" stereotype and think about it. Think about the women who just harmlessly asked in probing, ""Who was that lady you were talking to on the phone?"" and such.Apart from that, there were other forced and question raising things that diminished the story for me.Then there was the lack of information that I mentioned in the beginning. For about 15 or so minutes, my wife and I were trying to figure out who the aforementioned male friend was and what his relationship was to Cecilia. I kept vacillating between platonic friend or someone she was in a romantic relationship with until my wife pointed out that she slept in the room with the guy's daughter. But we didn't get that revelation until well into the movie when the villain decided to show (well through actions) himself.Then finally there's the entire plot itself. It's quit unbelievable and the MC herself asks the overarching question to the villain, ""Why me? You could've had any other woman?"" So, why her? As I stated above, we're led to believe that this guy is so insanely obsessive to the point that it's compulsive for him, he can't control himself but to control others, specifically her and he just can't let her go. I know there are people like this in the world, let me reiterate, THERE ARE PEOPLE LIKE THIS (AS IN MEN AND WOMEN, NOT JUST MEN), but I cannot for the life of me believe beyond fictional representation of such people, that either control freaks would go to such extremes. Especially given the man had plenty of other ways to torture his ex should he chose to do so. He had money, he had resourced, heck if you watch the movie, he had willing family who would go along with any of his plots, yet he chose this route?In other words, the story feels like it's missing a necessary element that would glue all of this together and make it even believable enough to suspend the proper amount of disbelief to remove questions.",The Invisible Man

It's a great idea, and that's all this movie was.Building up suspense by doing what every other ""thriller"" does already made me dislike it by the 60 minute mark. The second part of the movie started out right, but then made me actually hate it.Dumbing down the plot by making the main character paralyzed with fear in every other scene, the main villain having superhuman strength and agility, guards in an asylum using deadly firearms, and of course a restaurant not having a single camera to record how someone got murdered among other things, made me absolutely anxious. It was movie night for my wife and I, so I stayed until the end. Otherwise, I'd have shut it off after 30 or 40 minutes in.And then the ""thriller"" part of the movie.

The only other place I'm familiar with Moss was Girl, Interrupted and Us. She absolutely killed it in the lead role. Seeing her emotional response to an abusive relationship and the fear of her husbands return mixed in with questioning her own sanity or admitting her husband was invisible.

Ends up way too long for what it does.Elisabeth Moss seems, in many scenes, as if she has been given direction to walk here, look that way, emote this feeling. She comes across as very acted. Not sure if it is she just doesn't have the acting chops for a movie or if she was put into so many scenes to act completely alone with no other actors to work off of. I understand that is a tough thing for actors. Either way, it ended up looking like she had just finished an acting lesson and was doing the practical portion.Overall, skip this one.

The story is good, acting is excellent, soundtrack is very good, cinematography is good and the twist is unexpected...The movie starts immediately with the main story without any boring setups. The movie respects itself and do NOT use any cheap materials like unnecessary sex or nudity just for attracting more audience. It is serious from the beginning to the end. It caught my attention all the time. Never got bored and what a shocking ending!I didn't give this movie 10 because it has some minor plot holes. But those holes never damage a wonderful movie like this. I recommend it.",The Invisible Man
1008,sparkerd,Good sleeper movie,5,28 May 2020,"By review title I mean good movie to help you fall asleep. As other reviewers stated, music is louder than dialog so most of movie I just watched and guessed what was going on as husband was sleeping and I didn't want to put volume at full. The plot was ok, kind of vague with no backstory. No, who I am, how I got here, how I know these people explanations straight to this invisible guy is trying to kill/frame me. Nice camera work of panning to empty spaces and conveying feeling of is someone there? But again, dialog was so low and overwhelmed by the music it just ruined it. So, if you want a nice quiet movie to play on repeat while you fall asleep, turn volume down halfway and drift off, you wont be missing anything.",The Invisible Man

I watched the premiere, without seeing any reviews about it before, and enjoyed every second of it.
The movie from the very first scene, fascinates you in a way that you can't stop watching and gets you excited about every little thing that's gonna happen.
Great plot, great cast. The music was a bit too loud. I got so much into the movie, that once the movie ended my body was still shaking.",The Invisible Man

1018,haydentheroadhogmain,A Must See Psychological Horror Thriller,7,1 April 2020,"The invisible man 2020 is a good Scifi horror movie, it has tension, psychological horror, and a standout performance from Elizabeth Moss, that makes you really want to root for her character throughout the runtime of the movie. It tells the story of Elizabeth Moss's character escaping from the clutches of her abusive boyfriend, and two weeks later finding out that her boyfriend had commited suicide, but later on she finds out that she is being stalked and harrased by someone that she cannot see. Leigh Whanell has really put his stamp on this project. This movie builds tension, and actual scary thoughts and scenarios, executed greatly and effectively by Leigh Whanell and his crew.PROS:
-Amazing cinematography
-Stand-out performance from Elizabeth Moss
-Plot twist makes the story a lot more interesting
-Has that sense of uncertainty of is the Invisible Man there or not, and if Elizabeth Moss's character has gone insane or not
-A modern take on the old Universal monster Invisible ManCONS: Minor spoilers ahead
-Some plot inconveniences like how is the invisible man able to catch up to the heroine so quickly, another example would be at the ending like she killed him with a knife right, but then she appears without the suit right after immediately, like I'm pretty sure putting on and removing the suit takes a little bit more time than that, and then when she moans his death, the police officer rushes over, and he sees her all packed up and ready to go, come on how fast does she move? The speed of light like bro come on
-Some parts of the movie are a little bit stretched out and kinda boring, I had to pause for a bit and do something then come back and finish the movie for a better experience, which I don't normallydo, what I normally do is I watch the movie from start to finish continuously, but just when it's starting to get boring the twist comes in and brings me right back on board with the movie.Overall The Invisible Man is a good horror Sci-fi flick, that has excellent built up tension, amazing cinematography, a strong female lead in Elizabeth Moss, and a pretty interesting twist to round it all off. I give Invisible Man a 7/10, I did not enjoy it as much, found some parts boring, but it's still really good, and I would recommend this movie to people who are looking for a modern take on a horror classic, or people who are looking for good underrated films that will probably fly under the radar, Leigh Whannell is now on my directors to watch list.",The Invisible Man

Period",The Invisible Man
1023,kikogod,Surprisingly good!,7,6 June 2021,"I came in with minimal expectations, but the film turned out to be a super adequate adaptation of the hardened story of the Invisible. Yes, this is the biggest ""minus"" of the film - it really does not show a niche new and unseen. Especially after the cult Hollow man, almost all the tropes were clear to me. It's literally the same, only less over the top than Verhoeven's film was. Director and screenwriter Lee Wanel has managed to convey a great atmosphere of constant fear of something you don't see. The very good editing and interesting flirtations with the camera, showing that there is something in the room, almost do not let you catch your breath, maintaining the disturbing feeling that you are being watched. I knew there was bread in this guy after his low-budget over-the-top sci-fi action UPGRADE, which I also recommend with both hands! The other strengths of the film are the good acting, especially from the lead actress (although I don't particularly like her), as well as the painful music, which changed wonderfully dynamically with what was happening. The only difference in the script was the fact that this time, perhaps the Invisible had a clear goal, which pursued and resulted in an interesting game of cat and mouse and some cool twists between him and the heroine.The finale annoyed me a little, because it seemed a bit cluttered and quickly concocted, but I would forgive him. Overall, it's impressive what the film's crew and director have achieved with a budget of just $7 million. Some scenes are so well done that you can't understand that the film costs pennies. In these times of bombastic budgets and effects it is a breath of fresh air to see something like this.",The Invisible Man
1024,caboooze,"Some minor plot holes, but overall a real thriller",8,22 March 2020,"It's interesting to see the majority of the written reviews being 10s or 1s.
The first half of this movie was hands down excellent, although I feel like the director should have left the audience a bit more in the dark.
The second half contains a 1-2 ""face-palm"" kind of moments where the main character makes some slightly less logical choices, but with a bit of thought it's easy to explain away the ""holes"" some of the reviews talk about (i.e. the movie didn't show certain things, which maybe they should have somehow, but with a bit of critical thought it can easily make sense.. if you're not a hater)

1027,hungry_nirupam,Amazing film: scary and anxiety inducing,9,26 February 2020,"First of all, let me start with how excited I was to see this movie. Luckily, I got to catch this in an advanced preview. And I will say this, the excitement, counting of days, posting on social media, all paid off.This movie definitely scares you. It's not just jumpscares or loud noises, it's something psychological. From the first opening shot, you're immediately put inside Elisabeth Moss' character Cecilia's head. She is stuck in an abusive relationship and can't get out of it. The whole opening scene makes you uncomfortable as we see Cecilia trying to make her escape. This kind of tension is kept on throughout the film.Another thing this film succeeds upon is the writing. The story progresses in a fast paced way which doesn't seem hurried. The 2hr runtime feels achieved. There's definitely more than one 'WTF' moment in this film to keep you on the edge of your seat.The score and the sound design definitely puts you in Cecilia's shoes as you struggle with her to point out where exactly the invisible man might be. The camera work is exquisite, I mean did we really doubt the director who brought us Upgrade? The action sequences definitely feel thrilling and the way it's shot makes you feel like you're living it.In my book, Elisabeth Moss can do no wrong. Her acting here is definitely something to be noted. From her being hysterically scared to her fighting back, Moss sells it. She makes us root for her. Oliver Jackson Cohen, who plays her abusive husband has a small but really pivotal role and boy o boy he is scary. The rest of supporting cast is also really good. Overall, this is Moss' movie and she carries it with ease.This year (so far) there hasn't been many horror movies that genuinely gave me anxiety or made me jump. So I am happy this film succeeded in doing both. Leigh Whanell is an amazing horror writer/director and proves that he can still give us a solid entertaining flick.There's some solid moments of blood so gorehounds can rejoice.I thought about it a lot and I can't really think of anything that didn't work. Some of you might complain about the camera work and how it focuses on the actor's faces more than the action but to me that worked. I think that definitely sold the drama.All and all this was a terrific film, really made the universal monster scary by mixing the monster with a relevant story. I will give this film a 9/10.If you liked this review please like my page Let's Talk Horror.",The Invisible Man

There is no balance or fluidity, acting does little other than make you uneasy.
The actors can barely keep it together long enough to convey the plot.
Bad camera work makes for constant closeups of ugly people making weird faces.

When I first saw the dog's food bowl with the name 'Zeus' on it, I envisioned a devil dog, a terrifying accomplice to his abusive master. But moments later we meet a sweet pup that wants to leave his hellish abode with his mommy.
However she takes his shock collar and then, just leaves him there? With the cruel husband she just drugged and is running away from? Who does that? Couldn't the sister have taken the dog to a shelter?
I was relieved to see him alive and well later (how?) but her initial action turned me against Celia and had me rooting against her for most of the movie. The right people died at the end though, including her sister who must be one of the grating characters I've seen in a long time.

1042,DanielNeil1237,Leigh Whannel continues to amaze with finally a modern Universal monster film done right.,8,4 March 2020,"When this film was first announced I wasn't really looking forward to it at all because I was still getting the bad taste of The Mummy 2017 out of my mouth. However, once it was announced that Leigh Whannel was set to write and direct. I knew it was in good hands.I have been a fan of Leigh Whannel since his work on the Insidious franchise and his amazing but extremely underrated film Upgrade. This film is great with amazing acting from Elziebeth Moss who is being haunted by her boyfriend of a previous abusive relationship who is now somehow invisible. The film is always building up the tension and due to the fact that he is invisible, they do camera angles where it's as if he is always watching her even though he might not be there at all. Having a budget of only 9 million dollars the effects are great and it's extremely impressive with all the scars they get out of it. In the directing department, Whannel is fantastic by creating a creepy atmosphere and leaving you with not a single moment to breathe. As for flaws, the only real one I have with the film is that the tone of the last half is extremely different from the first half of the film. Well, the second half is still just as good the first half there tones are extremely different. So it can at times feel like two different films though both halves are still great and extremely entertaining. Overall The Invisible Man is a great horror film being one the best ones I have seen in years its everything you would want in an Invisible Man movie. If this is now what the new films based on Universal's classic monster will be like then I can't wait.",The Invisible Man

It's amazing to think that ""No-one Believes The Protagonist"" is still considered a viable plot device.I watched it to see how bad it could get and it wasn't even entertaining in that sense. The innovative title sequence and bombastic music appear to promise a fun, thrilling ride, but what you get is a high-production, low-brow, nonsensical film that clearly think it's much cooler than it really is.The character motivations are entirely illogical, the pacing is erratic, the dialogue appears to have been written by 12 year-olds who have been exposed to only bad video games, and there are plot holes everywhere, like the suit appearing to give you superhuman reflexes and psychopathic tendencies. The melodramatic acting belongs to a bygone era. Perhaps that's what they were going for, like children's theatre: at one point she says ""he's behind you"" just when the suit miraculously starts working again.

1058,horrorbladesreviews,The unsettling violent crashing of the waves in the intro of 'The Invisible Man' sets the mood and tone for what's to follow...,6,8 July 2020,"The unsettling violent crashing of the waves in the intro of 'The Invisible Man' sets the mood and tone for what's to follow. I knew from the beginning that at the very least, the soundtrack and score would keep me hooked throughout. I wasn't wrong.'The Invisible Man' begins with Cecilia creeping out of bed in the middle of the night, looking panicked and obviously desperate to form an escape. The intro to this film is shot sublimely, it kept me on edge and was a perfect starting point. If the rest of the film were able to maintain the same level of tension then we'd be looking at a horror classic right here. Things settle down after the introduction for a pretty considerable amount of time before Cecilia starts to notice strange occurrences.Cecila is smart, much smarter than most of the other characters deem her to be. She has great direction throughout the film, utilizes space properly and uses common sense to get out of danger. Which is very refreshing to see in any horror film these days.The main issue with this film are the plot holes and ultimately the lack of plot itself. There's not an awful lot of backstory to the events that transpired before the introduction of the movie. This causes a lack of emotional connection and empathy with the main characters. However, the unpredictable and tense nature of the film is enough to carry you through if you can forget about the plot. The 120-minute runtime doesn't do this film any favours and makes it feel a little drawn out at times too.Surprisingly, there's not an awful lot of jump scares throughout 'The Invisible Man'. There's one real shocking scene and a twist or two that occur but most audience members will be able to sense and predict these. Especially those that are switched on to the horror genre. I highly recommend watching this with earphones or headphones that have good bass and audio quality. Either this or with a home surround sound cinema system. The best feature and detail of this film is the soundtrack and score.Except for the soundtrack, Elisabeth Moss (Cecilia) is the star of the show here. She delivers an excellent performance which kept me hooked from the start and throughout. The other characters leave quite a lot to be desired.'The Invisible Man' provides a somewhat enjoyable viewing experience, just don't get expecting film of the year material. It's certainly one that you could watch when you have nothing else to do or anything else to watch. Will it blow your mind and leave you speechless? Not really, maybe just in a scene or two. However, it's definitely something that will keep you occupied for a good couple of hours.",The Invisible Man

All the elements for a great horror/thriller were there, I just hate the ending.The movies I love the most are the ones when I can't wait to get home from the theater to read other people's comments and discuss the movie.I wish this movie were 30 minutes shorter and things were left open ended.Was there an Invisible Man or was she psychotic and suffering from severe PTSD? That would have been amazing.At the middle of the movie I thought that that were where things were heading but it didn't end and it kept going and going to a very cliché and predictable finale.I feel so disappointed. It was meh. No space to discuss it or to contemplate other theories. Nothing.I loved Upgraded from the same writer/director, also a fantastic movie with a terrible ending.I can't speak for more of his work but Leigh Whannell needs to take some time and figure out how to end his movies without these cheap clichés endings.Funny enough, SAW was a fantastic movie with a fantastic ending. The Saga is mostly crap but that first movie was amazing in every possible way.That ending was legendary.",The Invisible Man

1061,weatherladykatie,Didn't see that twist coming...,9,14 April 2021,"... But let's face it, I probably should have.This movie provides an interesting twist on the classic story of a woman leaving her abuser. Without spoilers, she sneaks out in the dead of night, he catches get trying to leave. Soon after she receives word that he's dead and she's too inherit his fortune. That's when the weird things start.Elisabeth Moss does a brilliant job as Cecilia, and they have done a great job at making her look crazy. There is a twist or two, and I really should have seen them coming but it was clever enough that I didn't. Very enjoyable movie, it gave me more than one jump from my seat!",The Invisible Man
1062,Wanoooo,Watch Hollow Man Instead,2,5 November 2021,"No Spoiler part:Everyone who likes this probably didn't watch Hollow Man movie parts 1 & 2. Although this one is a lot newer so it had the opportunity to be better due to advancement in technology & by learning from Hollow Man, it deosn't even compare to how good Hollow man was done.Spoiler part:1. The movie DOES account for cameras, but only when it doesn't expose the invisible man! What about the murder in the restaurant? Where it really make sense to have cameras. And other places.2. Doors? The invisible man seem to make it through every place he wants. We only see consideration of the doors towards the end. Quiet places, public places, a hospital that is presumably has really high security.2. what about the white paint she splashed on his face before? Stopped dripping so easily, then was washed out with water so easily! What about the water itself that washed it?? What about the water in the showers? What about the blood that was splashed after he killed the security guard? No splashes on his? No water on him? Oh, then really heavy rain. And he just cannot be spotted! At some point he was covering himself right under the car hatch, but he wasn't so wet already? Only after that when he attacks the girl we see the water on him!! Just like the cameras thing, it's like the maker show clearly that they recognize the potential effect but they only choose to show it when it's not exposing the invisible man.3. The baby. For real? How did it happen? You just want us to fantasize about it or what!? Not even given a hint? Hello? Is this meant for children below 12? She can't just get pregnant by him. How did he manage to do that?? Let's say he was with her in the shower, ""surprise"" about the water again? Her feeling something? She didn't even recall anything when he told her she's pregnant!? Use as proof? At least after his brother was killed to prove it was Adrian, I don't know if you can do a DNA test for the baby while in the womb, but definitely after. Too many holes. Too many things not addressed.4. The sister got a long F you like it's an essay from Cecelia. Like if that's how sisters communicate. The sister just believed it was cecelia! Didn't even call her, and waited until the Cecelia visited and told her it wasn't her then she just slammed the door on her face. Like she didn't have any doubt it was her sister Cecelia who loved her who typed a long F you EMAIL and sent it to her. It's just ridiculous.And I can keep going but I'll bore you.Too many flaws.They should've learned from the movie Hollow Man.",The Invisible Man

But really, the entire movie is things being moved around by an invisible man and Elisabeth trying to convince people there is an invisible man. That's about it.The real issue in my opinion is that once you know there is an invisible man (before the film started), then things moving on their own isn't particularly interesting, because you know there's just a guy there that you can't see? So, you need a good storyline to carry the film. And there wasn't one.Anyway, it was alright but don't pay for it :)",The Invisible Man

I actually had to go rewatch scene by scene when the very poorly executed ending finally revealed the ""truth"" about the invisible man.I was so frustrated by the fact that the moviemaker seemingly holds me for a fool with how he just ignores ALL the impossibilities (yes I have made up a new word because hey it is allowed isn't it?)I am sure many people like my better half who is not after #thingslogical #evenmovieuniversehasphisicallaws wil be satisfied with the immagination this producers had and the story they tried to sell us... BUT! Yes it is a big but...
For the rest of you prepare to be taken for a fool, get popcorn and laugh out loud when you spot one of those moments where (I am warning you there are alot) you will think you are watching a parody/comedy type of movie which got confused and tried to be a horror/action/mistery movie.
I think 4 is very generous of a score, as I originally gave it a 3, but 7+ score as it has right now? If it marketed itself as a horror parody maybe a 5 and that is pushing it... LAUGHABLE Go watch reviews on Youtube, you will see what I mean.

He's young, intelligent, successful, rich, and good-looking.Some people are abusers because they are just terrible human beings, but for a guy who can build an invisibility suit, the drive must be matching.Now, imagine if she had filed for divorce and took half his money or if she had stolen some of his ideas and made a fortune out of them, that would have given him a proper motive to ruin her life and would have made the movie a lot more palatable.",The Invisible Man

There's quite a few. I didn't think it was very suspenseful either. Even though the man was invisible, I could see the storyline coming from a mile away. I gave it a 5/10 rating because it is at least half way decent. The story is a parallel to ""Sleeping With The Enemy"". Character development is weak and it would have been better if the bad guy was more fleshed out. Without much detail of who and what kind of person he is the viewer ends up hating a generic ""monster"". So actually he was invisible in more ways than one.

It was certainly entertaining and Elizabeth Moss's acting wasn't pretty good for someone going crazy thinking an invisible person is attacking her. But I thought the movie just fell flat. I know it's a movie but too many little things didn't make sense. How did Adrian (who was following her everywhere) not know she had the other suit? And who was the random dude who drove her miles and miles to the house? Why did Adrian not kill the one police officer in the parking lot?

1106,www-KZR,"I'm so glad this movie wasn't bad, I thought it was gonna suck.",8,14 April 2020,"The first third of the film focused on building tension around the concept. There were some nice shots here but I thought it was a bit too slow. The dialogue and acting were competent but nothing special. In the middle some crazy stalking-stuff happened, which sometimes came across as unintentionally comical or illogical, but was generally fine. The latter third was a quite solid action-thriller with a few twists. After the slow start I hadn't been expecting so much action. The CGI was excellent too. There were a few jump-scares throughout but overall I didn't find the movie very scary.There was a somewhat feminist vibe to the whole thing (escaping a gas-lighting stalker) but it didn't come across as heavy-handed or preachy. There was a little overly on-the-nose dialogue but it was at least trying to show-not-tell. The main character approached things in a semi-believable feminine way rather than a cliched action-girl way. Honestly I was kind of itching for her to throw a few more punches even though that wouldn't have fit her character, oh well.Overall I'd probably give it a 3/5. People really into thrillers or women who empathize more directly with the main character's experiences might enjoy it more.

Elisabeth Moss portrays a woman who escapes her abusive partner who later commits suicide and just when she thinks she can start all over again incidents start happening.
The tension build up certainly gave my better half a couple of frights but I would not call this a horror. Yes there is blood being spilled but the build up of suspense I found more akin to a decent thriller. One of the plot twist I could see coming from a mile away but there were other twists that did catch me unaware.
I found the acting of everyone to be good and it was a surprise to find out the cost of this movie was only $8 million with the CGI being well done considering that budget.

The occasional plot hole can be ignored as situation films such as these shouldn't be shackled- because essentially this film was made with the purpose to keep the viewer on edge, and, by sacrificing some logic, they did it to a much higher effect.Massively exceeded my expectations and has actually changed my outlook on what a film needs to do be tense, simplicity is key!",The Invisible Man

I love horror, suspense, thrillers, and just about any genre of movie there is as long as the story is good and the actors do a brilliant job of convincing me of their roles. Sadly this movie has none of it. It was incredibly slow in the beginning first half, most of it was predictable, and the build up towards the ending was sub-par.I did laugh though. The effects look so fake it was beyond ridiculous. Honestly, it's like a really cheap B rated rip off of the movie Hollow Man (which I thought was pretty damn good).The ending was a joke. Was that supposed to be a twist? I have no idea how people have given this such a high review. Seriously a 7.2 right now? I could give you the names of at least a dozen movies in any genre related to this film that are all miles beyond compare.Honestly, I'd rather watch a lot of B-rated movies. A lot I've seen are way better than this movie. I'm shocked that this is the same director that directed Upgrade (shockingly a good movie). Sadly the only other popular movie he directed was Insidious 3, not anywhere near as good as the first Insidious. I guess with him it could be a hit or miss, mostly miss it seems like. I don't consider being an executive producer for the Saw movie series as direct hands on role to make a difference of what is shown on screen.You don't have to take my word for it though, if you want to waste 2 hours of your life, then please by all means go ahead and see if you can even watch it till the end without wanting to turn it off halfway through.

1120,cgmovie85,Meh,5,8 March 2020,"Wasn't planning to review but after seeing all this praise I had to. SPOILERS LIKE CRAZY BEWAre. ESPECIALLY # 4.This movie is mediocre at best. Very easy and expected plot and a forced story that is way longer than it could have been.1. In the hospital scene where Moss's character was on the floor and Mr. InvisIble was beating all the guards to death, why didn't she pick up the gun that was right next to her and shoot him in the leg. Why'd she wait 5 minutes, just so we could see some action scene and once he ran out the door, decide to pick up the gun.2. Moss is hard to look at for extended periods of times. Just like Micky Rourke is. All those closeups made me cringe.3. Did the suit give him super strength too? Because we was breaking limbs and throwing people around like rag dolls4. There are plenty of movies where women are in physically abusive relationships, they run away and somehow plot and end up killing the man at the end. And we're supposed to cheer them on? Enough with J. Lo for example. The men never tried to kill the women. At least J lo worked on becoming a fighter. Moss was a coward in her actions. Booooo5. How can someone be on the other side of the room, you get punched in the face and blame them? Booooo",The Invisible Man
1121,brentonwiseman,Laughably Terrible,2,16 March 2020,"Where do I even begin? Even without spoiling it you can easily pick apart this entire film. The positives of this film include the decent cinematography, a couple scenes with real and effective tension, and the fact that it's not boring or overly offensive with how bad it is.
This film takes place in a world like no other. Footsteps and breathing are completely inaudible (even though they would actually add tension and make things a tiny bit more believable), people make the most idiotic decisions when their lives are in danger, and --
What's worst about this film is how much it painfully lacks self-awareness. While the film definitely does some surprising things, showing you just how corny and low-brow they can get, you already know where things are going long before you get there. The overall plot of the movie is incredibly cliche and unsatisfying rather than interesting and thought-provoking.HOWEVER: Once you realize what kind of movie you're in for, things get really fun.For me I believe it was 40 mins into this long, lovely, and laughable movie. The film decides to lose all subtlety, all mystery, and all creativity pretty early. So what do you do? Nothing is scary anymore and the story is so off the rails you can't relate to anyone or anything that's happening. So you find entertainment in the mess that shines before you.
You laugh at the cartoony dialogue, jump and chuckle at the cheap and random jump scares, scratch your head at the brainless actions of the main character, snicker through the bad acting during the encounters with invisman, and try not to burst into laughter as things get crazier and crazier and the film takes itself waaaay too seriously.
So would I recommend this experience? Well I used a gift card and had the whole day off and wanted to spend some time with a good friend that I haven't seen in a while. It was free and I was entertained. Not as I was hoping to be, based on the reviews from people that actually thought it was good, but I had a good time. My friend actually liked it tho so that made things awkward.

I was apprehensive at the beginning because I don't like horror movies at all and I'm not for cheap scares. However, I love thriller. Thus, I wouldn't really consider this movie to be horror, it's not ""scary"" per se. There are no cheap scares. It's a thriller pretty much.A thriller that deals with delusions and mental-illness, specifically bipolar. Some symptoms of schizophrenia are there because everyone thinks she's imagining it. I have a problem with this movie, though. It spoils itself in the description. ""After staging his own suicide, a crazed scientist uses his power to become invisible to stalk and terrorize his ex-girlfriend.""I believe this movie would be way better if we didn't know what was happening and tried to decide that for ourselves, there might a huge plot twist element there.

As a matter of fact, this 2020 film, rather than being compared to the '33 one, shows much more similarity with ""Sleeping with the enemy"", a 1991 movie, directed by Joseph Ruben, with Julia Robert and Patrick Bergin, adapted from a novel by Nancy Price: gist is the same, main difference is that in ""The invisible man"" the stalker is, obviously, invisible. So 2020 movie is a sort of combo between two good movies, the '33 and the '91 ones, but it does not succeed, unfortunately, to get to the level of either one, mainly because of the lack of creativity.

This movie has really great scenes with great cinematography and great acting and the plot for the most part keeps you fairly engaged and involved with the characters until the end portion of the movie where everything falls really short. This more down to earth plot about someone who's dealing with the main conflict in a very realistic way is broken due to very over the top scenes and turns the plot makes to make the movie feel corny.

But after seeing the reviews, I thought that maybe I've misjudged the trailer and the merits of this movie, so I decided to give it a chance. And I'm glad that I did. The trailer only scratches the surface of the movie and gives away nothing of major importance.The movie is filled with suspense from start to finish. There is a sense of dread that doesn't let up (well, mostly). There are some instances where the movie does devolve into a typical horror flick, but it would redeem itself quickly with another thrilling twist. I'm a huge horror movie fans but I find most Hollywood movies to rely heavily on CGI, which directors just love to shove in, front and center. They fail to realise that the scariest things about horror movies are not the images shown on screen, but what the movies make our minds conjure up. The Invisible Man got this right by taking it to the next logical step, by basically removing the ghost/demon/villain from the screen.You would find yourself holding your breath in many scenes, most of which are just empty rooms and hallways. And that's the beauty of this movie, to convey fear by basically showing nothing at all.Unlike most horror movies where the struggles of the victims are merely collateral of them trying to deal with the unexplained, this movie's villain has a singular goal, and the way events unfold will make you feel helpless, just as the main character.

This movie has some decent scares, and very little gore (barely any in my eyes, though others may see more), so I should really like it. But it's just decent. Not necessarily a bad thing, but nothing to rave about.I like the message. It's important to see an allegory of how women are treated just as much as Get Out was important in its themes. And Elizabeth Moss really inhabits the part. My issue is with the characters. They're either so thin that you can't imagine them existing when not on screen, or they make the strangest decisions that are so not in character. No real spoilers here because these are things you can determine just from the premise, but are we really supposed to believe that characters who got along so well suddenly turn on each other over a slight misunderstanding, or refuse to believe each other. And the main character has so many chances to back up her story, but she never shares them with anyone. That's Lame-Horror 101.In the end, I feel like I've watched an average horror movie.

The acting is superb and subtle camera work keeps you in suspense and staring into the dark corners wondering if there is something to be seen.The movie does a fantastic job of not insulting the intelligence of the audience and instead puts you directly into the shoes of the lead actress. The pacing is greatly appreciated as from the title alone we understand what is going and it moves fast enough that the two hour run time feels much faster but not rushed in anyway as once the story begins to gain speed it continues to a well deserved and satisfying ending.The cast is spectacular and delivers a top notch performance, if you are fan of suspense this is exactly the type of movie for you.",The Invisible Man

1187,scarecrowgusblue,The Invisible Man's Girlfriend,7,29 February 2020,"This is a very entertaining thriller. However, for those who are seeking to explore the character of The Invisible Man further, as in the original 1933 film, please note that the focus here is the character of The Invisible Man's girlfriend, played very competently by Elisabeth Moss.In the #MeToo and #Timesup era, this is a new, intense and, at times, nerve-shredding look at domestic violence, blended with the sci-fi of The Invisible Man legend. It is a story about the heroine's suffering and how she brings herself to fight back.A number of films that this reminded me of whilst watching it included Sleeping With the Enemy, What Lies Beneath and, to a lesser extent, Joker. There is also a sequence that closely recalls the plight of Virginia Madsen's character in Candyman. Therefore, if you enjoyed any of those films, you are likely to enjoy this one as well.Fans of all the fantastic thrillers made in San Francisco may also enjoy the fleeting glimpses that we receive of the city (although the film was primarily shot in Australia) and admirers of John Carpenter's The Fog will also be pleased to see the town that featured as Antonio Bay making a ""blink and you'll miss it"" appearance towards the climax.However, once again, if you seek insight into the particular psychoses of The Invisible Man, you are best to watch the original Claude Rains film. Otherwise, there are plenty of jump scares and this is a very effectively made psychological thriller that effectively communicates the heroine's plight to the audience. A marked improvement on the Tom Cruise version of The Mummy.",The Invisible Man

However, if Cecilia had a great plan escaping as seen at the beginning of the movie, why didn't we get to see another well thought out sophisticated and convoluted plan to trap and expose Adrian?

With an opening, I'm tempted to call it a tracking scene, as engaging as ""Double Jeopardy"", it was fairly easy to tell where this story was coming from but it took a while to see where it was going.
Again, I had suspicions from the trailers that there was a good amount of Bergman/Boyer ""Gaslight"" to be burned but completely missed the Audrey Hepburn/Richard Crenna ""Wait Until Dark"" connection. Once it got me (or I got it), I completely understood all the open floorspace in the kitchen.

However, some mistakes can not go by unnoticed- I mean when Adrian slits Cecilias' sisters throat in a very public place wasnt realistic, as nobody seemed to see that the knife was floating and the cameras didn't pick it up either, and it made it lose its umph, somebody would have noticed. Then the ending was a massive let down, I loved the concept of her killing him, but the timing seemed awfully off, so she'd have to leave the room, put on the invisibility suit, go over to Adrian, slit his throat, then somehow manage to go back to the bedroom to get changed out of it and pretend to be shocked by him dying- this all somehow happened during a 10 second period. It's simply unrealistic so much so I thought someone else was wearing the suit and slit his throat, which would have been a much better ending, but she managed to do it all.

Seeing sheets pulled or closed doors open when the name of the film is ""The Invisible Man"" doesn't leave much to the imagination.No mad potion, a suit that if marketed to the Government would have made him billions more.Then what irritates me immediately they not only go to the will, but she takes his money like the abuse earned it.If this man was such a nightmare and she was prisoner why go near any affiliates.

Why in one's right mind would any woman return to the home without anyone to find the secret.Then the invisible suit like I haven't seen that a million times....
Then anyone in any incarceration facility regular, maximum security or psychiatric; all visits are recorded so the entire conversation between the spineless brothers including ""keep the baby and return to him"" is known. Her breakout with the suit flickering it's on all the surveillance. A proper crime scene job after knocking him off the ladder with paint would show you she's not insane.However without a picture of their three years I assume relationship/marriage Can't pick up an idea of how psychotic he was until her breakout from the hospital or killing her sister.Then to push it from Neutral to under 5 stars a plethora of hacks from other suspense films. The typical neurotic Domestic Abuse woman who's clearly a ""lunatic"". Refracted lighting.... Cameras recording and projecting simultaneously... this has all been done ad nausea.If he didn't fake his death and had alibis it may have notched it up a bit.The total lack of background on her sister's relationship that one offensive email would have the door slammed in her face knowing what YOUR SISTER HAS BEEN THROUGH seems a bit ice cold.

In general, I hate those horror/thriller movies that rely exclusively on immense silence followed by a loud bang to jump scare you. It's super lazy and tiresome.There are some good visuals, the way the camera moves and shows empty rooms is eery, it adds suspense and a sense of the unknown. A threat coming from right in front of you, and you can't see it. But...ultimately, it just relies on loud bang jump scares to make it tense.The suit itself is cool, but never explained at all. How is it powered? Can infra red cameras see it? How does he mask the sound of his breathing or his foot steps? How is he suddenly super strong and capable of picking a person up with one hand? Taking multiple stab wounds to the chest and neck area without seeming to be affected at all? The suit makes a lot of noise when you see it, cameras everywhere constantly moving, why can that suddenly be silent when it's on? How come something like this can go unnoticed by the government or military? Is he Tony Stark?! How does he always get around such distances? Why did no one sort his house out? Someone covered his stuff in sheets but then apparently gave up on sorting it? Who was looking after the dog? How come a tin of white paint can get washed off in seconds and leave absolutely no trace? Why would he get himself locked up in her mental hospital room every night? How is it that no one ever bumped into him? How come a total drenching from rain does nothing to damage an entirely camera pased suit? Why wouldn't she carry a can of spray paint and a video camera around everywhere she went? Why did that girl ever think she'd hit her when she was literally looking directly at her, from a good 6 feet away, at the moment she got hit? Were there no security cameras in the restaurant when she was framed for murder? When and how did he put his phone and a random knife in her attic? And why do that at all? Was he living up there? How would that work? He'd make so much noise just moving an inch. When he stepped on her sheet and was walking towards her, why didn't she throw herself onto him while shouting for the guy to come in? How could she ever go back to sleep knowing he was there? Why wouldn't he change the pin codes to everything after she left? Why was he so obsessed with her? If he knew she was pregnant, and that's why he still wanted her in his life, why terrorise her and put her in real physical danger? What the hell was the point in the entire plot, what was his end game?! She killed him because he said one word? Her sisters boyfriend (a cop) was immediately ok with knowing she killed him? Her constant pathetic, weak, terrified persona instantly gets transformed into a cunning, ruthless, brave, deceiving superwoman out of nowhere?....SO MANY FLAWS IN LOGIC.The movie does a good job at building suspense.

1227,campuzanofilm,"""Plot holes"" are not valid criticisms",8,19 April 2020,"Wasn't originally gonna write anything here but after reading some of the negative ""reviews"" here I feel like i have to put something.Great horror movies work on 2 levels. The first is the suspense and the atmosphere that the film is able to create. How the director is able to put Elizabeth Moss in a room by herself and have the audience on the edge of their seat with baited breath. Both anticipating and dreading what will happen next. That is what makes a horror movie fun on the first watch, the uneasiness and uncertainty of what might happen next. The second level that great horror movies work on is what the film is actually about, not the story but the message, what makes the film worth seeing again and again. At its core Invisible Man is about domestic abuse and the trauma and PTSD that can follow. How it can ruin someones life and make it almost impossible for them to continue their life, even after the abuse has ceased. How abuse can isolate an individual and alienate them from their closest family and friends. And even how difficult it can be sometimes to convince people outside of abusive relationships that the abuse is even happening. And its pretty obvious, or at least I thought it was.When I see people complaining about the ""plot holes"" and criticizing how a phone could fit in the invisible suit (modern phones are very slim so not actually a problem) or even why he would carry it (there is a very obvious reason right in front of your face watch it again) or whether or not a millionaire would use an invisible suit for harassing his ex instead of stealing state secrets (really? this is a horror suspense movie not a heist movie) why Elizabeth Moss character did some of the things she did that don't make sense (when people are in abusive situations they don't always make the best decisions, real people are not emotionless automatons) and the ""criticisms"" go on.Ultimately this movie really brings to light the fundamental flaws with modern online film ""criticism"". It isn't about dissecting a film and figuring out the directors motivations or what deeper meaning may be in the text or even what the films theme or message is. Its about nitpicking minute details that actually have not effect on the quality of the film and getting hung up on the smallest of details.Pointing out ""plot holes"" is not valid criticism.",The Invisible Man

Also, Elizabeth Moss does an amazing job.",The Invisible Man
1244,mercurio-14347,How to get scared about something you can't see,8,1 March 2020,"After a failed attempt by Universal to create a shared Universe of Monsters that began with the Mummy in 2017. This second attempt comes to return the stories of iconic horror characters, and it is an unexpected success.This is the second film by director Leigh Whannell, which began with the underrated jewel of Upgrade, which in my opinion is very good, but not well known on this side of the world. Still, Universal seems to have seen potential, and thus man turns the franchise into his own.The commercial horror movie industry is often very generic, they are simple plots with cheap and not well crafted jump scares. So how to scare you with a movie about something that can't scream in your face? The answer is simple; A good script, a good direction, and the performance of Elizabeth Moss.The script creates situations, which although they may seem few, are very well built to achieve the necessary impact on the audience, and they grow as the story progresses, to reach a strong outcome, as well as one of the best Directed scenes of the movie. and that shows that the director can offer much more. This, with the credible performance of the main actress; his expressions, his way of moving and the appearance she brings. Give a tone of anxiety and anguish to the film, which make you feel that the threat is real and at the same time, to imagine that in that empty space there is someone watching you.The proposal of the story is different from all the previous adaptations of the character, and it is very interesting to see in this new installment. It becomes original for the entire duration of the movie, and shows us a very frequent theme in our society, about power-hungry controlling men, and adds an invisible one.Photography, also very well done, has movements that cover a whole space and that repeatedly put your imagination at stake, by making your mind work and make you think about where this enemy can be, in several scenes, it can show you where It is without the need to see it. and it gets creepy.Finally, the soundtrack is composed from Benjamin Wallfisch (IT) that increases the emotions of each scene with electronic and loud sounds, which combine very well with the tone of the film.In Conclusion it is an interesting new proposal by the director, as of Universal. By betting on a more independent approach and not as commercial as it was driving. That thanks to its script and execution, result in a good horror movie, with an original message, inspired by real situations.P.S. the new way that this character becomes invisible it's something to see 7o7.",The Invisible Man
1245,YenniferH,Interesting,5,21 June 2020,"The concept is obviously there but there was too many plot holes that I couldn't get out of my mind while I was watching the movie. I would like to point out two things. Firstly, how did her spouse follow her back to their house so quickly. Is he like the Flash? Secondly, how did pepper spray penetrate the suit? Is there like breathing holes? Seems rather hilarious. Nonetheless, it's a HUGE coincidence she aimed directly on his FACE. Maybe, they could've explained the anatomy of the suit more because it plays such a huge role. Overall, it was interesting and decent. I didn't expect too much from the trailer.",The Invisible Man
1246,gfennimore-79939,"Boring, dumb, dull and it sucks.",3,10 March 2020,"The casting of the lead as a femme fatele is absurd. She is bizarre and unattractive. She looks like a bag lady.

1248,bradliano,Did I watch a different movie?,4,23 May 2020,"After watching this film, I was not only annoyed at wasting 2 hours of my life but I was utterly perplexed at why it had such great reviews! According to some of these 80+ point reviews on Metacritic I was going to see the ""terrors of domestic violence through the lens of a classic horror movie monster"". Where exactly did they see these bits? I was expecting a film full of tension and nervousness which, to be fair, the opening scene has, hence my generous 4 out of 10. But from then on, what I saw was Ofred from the handmaid's tale Vs a rubbish Predator topped off with a Scream-esque twist that was as pointless as it was daft. There's no real exploration of what Ofred (can't even remember her character's name from the movie) went through with this guy, we learn nothing about what he did besides one drab scene where she says ""he controlled everything"". We know nothing about why he's so loaded apart from he's a ""world leader"" in optics, whatever that is. In fact, as a bad guy goes, he's pretty much a nonentity. Maybe that's what they were going for with this film? He is invisible after all I suppose. The scares are not that scary. The guy's invisible so immediately you assume he's followed Ofred to her mate's house and is in the room with her all the time. Everything that follows is entirely predictable. In the bedroom scene my wife even called ""and here we have the bed sheet being pulled off"" 5 seconds before it happened. Ofred does stupid things throughout the movie, like taking a knife out of a plastic bag to get a good set of incriminating prints on there, well done Ofred, and not thinking to say ""check the CCTV"" which would clearly show things appearing to move around by themselves. Anyway, that's enough about the actual film. It's boring and about 40 minutes too long.
What I'm really struggling to understand is why such good reviews? And why is everyone raving on about Elizabeth Moss? I just don't get it!! She's not a terrible actor but she is playing the exact same character here as she does in Handmaid's Tale, even down to the stupid faces she pulls, ranging from she's just smelled something really bad to she might be having a small stroke! I feel like I am existing in an alternate reality where the rules of what makes a good film/character have suddenly changed and I haven't been told. Do critics nowadays just decide what films they're going to give a good review to based on their own preferences as opposed to the actual content of the film? It certainly feels that way. Us is another fine example, compared to this tripe Us was actually an OK movie but 93% critic score on rotten tomatoes?? What film did they watch? These critics really need to sharpen up their game because they are at real risk of becoming utterly redundant!
If you really want to watch a good film about the horrors of domestic violence that actually is full of gut wrenching tension then I recommend Once Were Warriors, although in today's climate it would probably be panned for being ""too violent"" ironically.",The Invisible Man
1249,csabagoeroe,Sci-Fi high budget Babadook!?,5,4 March 2020,"The theme instantly reminds me of the Babadook and the plastification of it in a more modern sense of how the hermetic seal is placed on the psyche of the opposite is barely okay. I really enjoyed how the movie plot falls together with its manifold leitmotifs, like the ladder or the two suits. However, it's to simple just like it's acting (besides Elisabeth Moss who did a fairly good job imo) and poorly used CGI in 2020. It's a movie you watch once, nothing more to say to it.I only went into this movie given that IMDB gave it a 7.7Ouch... Overrated but I can see how things change when David Fincher is being represented as the ""Director of Gone-Girl"" in his involvement in The Women in the Window.",The Invisible Man
1250,boudicagamer,No respect for the SciFi aspect AT ALL,4,7 March 2020,"The invisible man concept is creepy AF, but it also buckled under the weight of of it's sci-fi thriller origins.This modern day interpretation embraces FULLY the emotions of a woman that has been beaten, completely controlled, possibly raped, then gaslighted (was gaslit??) and terrorized throughout the rest of the movie. Step by step, through her eyes, being terrorized. Always terrorized.No other point of view is brought into the story. I left the movie still vaguely unaware of how some of the people in it had anything to do with the main character or her life. When the main antagonist showed up he looked random and strange.Elizabeth Moss did a great job of looking miserable and scared throughout the movie and Aldis Hodge did a good job of looking incredibly nice. Those are the 2 good things I can think to say. None of the story made any real sense.Other than that, this is not a movie for intelligent people, The story was flat out disrespectful to it's original scifi origins, but I can see it being okay for folks who like movies that invoke feeling.",The Invisible Man
1251,samleejb,Fresh Review Immediately after Watching,5,24 May 2020,"Some of the scenes could scare you, although expected but the scene control and the background music is good enough to stress the audiences.Plot holes as others discussed, yes what the hell is the dog sitting in the house when nobody is staying? It doesn't need food?As globally known optics scientist, his techs are just lying there?Scene with Adrian's brother is a bit of the twist but didn't carry much weight as the killing spree in the mental hospital is laughable. Even when the killer (assuming is the Brother) fled from the hospital and obviously passed through guards and metal detectors, the sensors didn't trace anything? There are more to explore in the raining environment.This is not a movie of dark ages but have we installed all cameras in the world on the suit until no one noticing abnormality especially in the restaurant?Lastly, not meant as plot holes compilation for this movie, so called heat sensors were a lost tech in this movie, not that I want to break the movie enjoyment but not practical. Suit seems to be programmable and easily suit any body type haha",The Invisible Man
1252,kevbeard-32202,GREAT FILM,7,2 November 2020,"This movie really surprised me. I had pretty low expectations when going in to this film, main reason being - is that the trailer (I thought) revealed too much of the film - and what I saw through the trailer ; I had viewed through a lens of cheesiness that blumhouse films are notorious for making. The overall premise of the movie seems silly if directed poorly. I hadn't seen Leigh Whannell's previous works the time I watched this, so I didn't know his overall talent so it came as a shock to me that I loved the movie so much. Despite a couple of plot holes in the story I won't get into, I really enjoyed his directing a lot. The tension created by the panning shots really helped establish that overall feeling that someone is watching and sense of paranoia that the main character, Cecelia (Elisabeth Moss) feels. I really recommend it to people, and to everyone that seemed turned off when viewing the trailer first I say give it chance, you won't be disappointed. You'll get a great performance from Elisabeth Moss, some amazing shots, great suspense and great action/fight scenes towards the latter half of the film. Has a pretty satisfying ending! All in all 9/10 for me!",The Invisible Man

Most horror movies are usually scary because of how the monster/killer looks but in this movie you literately cant see the killer. One thing that is great about this movie is that you don't know when the invisible man is in the room or not in the room. There is one very scary jump scare and mild gore. It was so suspenseful because I was in a theater. I would recommend seeing it in a theater. A few things did go unexplained and I don't know if that made the movie better or worse. One thing that did make the movie better is Elizabeth Moss, she killed it. Overall great movie, would see it again",The Invisible Man

I think the personality of the main character was really good, unlike the classic main characters in other movies. The development of the story was actually really evocatory. I never got bored during the movie and the ending was pretty satisfactory. The action and the tension of the film were in point. I also loved how the costume that provided invisibility and its structure were shown, it made the movie more realistic.

I love horror movies and was ready to be scared pant off.So Cecilia is escaping from her evil boyfriend his gizmo palace. This bit was good but then he wakes up and finds her (in the wood?!) and punches her car. So unbelievable her friend just asks why he punches instead of driving. Don't you want insurance claim!Rest of the film is Cecilia going crazy cause he is invisible now or maybe not. She burns the eggs (why this scene?) and slaps her friends. How can she see all the time if he is invisible????Then the film turns into John Wick and he use mad skills to shoot his enemies. Then there is mega twist that no one needed then why when the film was already over. They call this super classic?!!!!The acting is dumb. All the characters are just saying their lines. Why did her friend leave her in his house when we know she dangerous (eggs!)Avoid this like it was invisible! It is cliche with no horror (Where is my shock!?),The Invisible Man

1287,rj-misal,Few things are neglected by script writer,5,16 August 2020,We see that if they shown us someone built a suit with cameras for whole invisible movie is tilted towards technical generation and showing how we can inventing things but at the same time they are not believing her instead of watching cctv recording? Ans at the end of movie she remember that there is cctv means she was suggest this thing before somehow he might get capture like in hotel while he was killing her sister? But no one keeping cctv cameras in hotel in California great so i gave it 5 because actord did well their work only script sucks. Few things are so advance and few like 19th century. So this thing makes audience feels they are some kind of idiot which is unable to figure it out.,The Invisible Man

The only storyline and characters that are enjoyable are the side character cop and daughter. Unfortunately, Miss Handmaid overdramatizes every single scene and the camera lingers on that unfortunate face for much too long, trying to build tension that doesn't exist.What is the point of this guy turning invisible and stalking her?

1301,yorai,AMAZING MOVIE!,9,20 July 2020,"Elisabeth Moss, PLEASE keep making more stuff, I loved seeing her in this movie.
Her acting was amazing, off the chart, you can literally feel her feelings throughout the entire movie.
I also felt that more movies should use the ""camera movement"" kind of thing for horror movies, for example; when the Invisible man wasn't shown on the screen, before he was painted or his suit was damaged, the camera kept shooting to add cinematic effect of ""where is the man, did this knife just moved?""
or for example Cecilia was looking at a place and she knew he was there.
Elisabeth, keep making great stuff and your acting is amazing.",The Invisible Man
1302,rivalution,"Worth the watch, not a masterpiece",7,25 January 2021,"It's definitely not a 1 or 4 star movie, as some over dramatically rated it.
Here are the pros - masterful acting from Elizabeth Moss, the rest of the cast performed very well as well. I really liked the angle play with the cameras. Quite original take on the haunting / invisibility idea.
The cons - plot holes. Just simple mistakes that could easily be avoided (examples: the man is covered in the fire extinguisher foam and then suddenly in the middle of the room - he's not anymore, even though there's still a long distance from there to the sink where he washes it all off. The sister's refusal to believe Cecilia didn't send the email even though it's completely out of character, you had a great relationship up to this point, your girl shows at your doorstep and vehemently denies it, she's in tears and clear distress - but you just slam the door in her face? I mean even if she's indeed loosing her mind you'd at least hear her side and try to help her? The friend's daughter is clearly punched while at a distance from Cecilia, I mean she can *visibly see* that Cecilia was like 2 meters away from her, yet insists is was her? Why are there no security cameras in the restaurant? How does he never make a sound or nock something over or stumble while moving? How was he one moment on the armchair then not? Stepping on the blanket then not? With no jumping sound? Why not show anyone the photos taken of her while sleeping, that she found on his phone in the attic? Why with all the cameras in the care center they send guards after *her* rather than the guy who beat them all up?? (I mean at this point shots were fired, you sent backup - you don't even bother to take a look at what's going on? When there are clearly screens behind you?) Why the hell when she found the other suit in the house she just dumped it at a random spot rather than trying to wear it or run out with it to use as evidence?
This things just really took me out of the story, which could otherwise be great. As some other reviewers mentioned it would have also probably been better if in the beginning it wasn't all that clear if she's imagining it all or not (also I was given that twist in the description of the movie so there you have it...)
All in all I'd say a 6.5/10 bit let's round it up for miss Moss.",The Invisible Man

There seemed to be no chemistry between any of the characters and no depth or back story either. We're supposed to believe that this multi-millionaire tech genius has come up with this intricate yet flawed plot to come back from the grave in order to keep the very average and boring Cecilia under his control. This just makes no sense. There is then the ridiculous idea of an invisibility suit being created without any government/military officials catching wind of it, especially after the creator allegedly kills himself and leaves all of this technology and equipment in his house. Why didn't any one check and find these invisibility suits which appear to be just lying around when Cecilia comes to investigate Adrian the genius' house (along with a dog that no one seems to have bothered into taking care of). These are just a couple of the plot inconsistencies here and I could write pages full of them but I will not waste my time. All in all I did stick it out until the end hoping for some sort of twist or turn that could save this film but there were none.",The Invisible Man

1309,david-43978,Great Film with a REAL Female Lead,10,12 July 2020,"After seeing Justin Dec's abysmally terrible and borderline offensive directorial debut, ""Countdown"" this weekend, I was in much need of a reprieve.Countdown is about an app you download and it tells you when you're going to die. It's an incredibly predictable film with one too many subplots that don't tie together whatsoever. Over- used jump scares that you can see a mile away. And of course there's a priest and Latin literature and rituals and all that stuff we've seen a million times before in movies that were 10 times better than this one. Countdown is also a cheap rip off of the Final Destination films.But what I found most revolting about this film is that it inserted a social commentary on the #MeToo movement and it backfired big time. Our female lead is only strong, courageous and powerful because in the finale scene, we see her flat belly, and supple breasts as she wears a tight black tank top and is pretty much covered in sweat.But no really- it's not about objectification. Mmm hmm. Whatever, Justin Dec.For your next film, take some damn notes from Leigh Whannell. Whose that you say? Why, he's the director of 2020 version of The Invisible Man. You HAVE to see this movie.I don't want to sound arrogant, but I knew this was going to be an excellent film as soon as The first shot popped up on the screen. It was an eerie contemporary mansion perched on a cliff. It was dark and stormy and desolate. But there were strange amber orange lights coming from within the home. That combined with the haunting soundtrack told me that this was going to be a film made by a real artist. And it was.Our lead character, Cecilia, played by Elizabeth Moss, has just left her boyfriend. And we see right away that this is no easy feat. She seeks shelter in the home of an old friend and his young daughter because she fears for her safety.We begin to discover the boyfriend is quite dangerous. And without giving anything away, I can still share the premise of the film (well, because it's the premise and not a spoiler). Cecilia begins to sense she is being stalked by an invisible man. And she is. Cecilia's terror and panic is so real and vivid thanks to Whannell's skilled use of angles and extended camera shots.There's a chilling scene when we see things from Cecilia's perspective when she's all alone at night. We are forced to look at a stove. A door. A portable clothes rack. Everyday objects and vignettes in everyday homes. But we KNOW something is wrong. We KNOW someone is there but we can't see him. And it's not because we see objects fly through the air (that comes later of course). It's because we SENSE a presence. We feel like we're home alone and are certain someone is in the house with us. I can't recall the last time I saw a horror film where what was NOT on the screen frightened me. This was actually a new movie viewing experience for me!!!And my goodness how refreshing to see a horror/thriller with minimal jump scares. But the ones that ARE used are timed perfectly. This is not a film that throws stuff in your face right off the bat so that you're bored by the end and your nerves are shot to hell. No, this film takes it's time. The terror is unleashed slowly, inch by inch. And with each inch we get pulled in closer and closer. This works so well that by the end of the film I was sitting upright in my chair, wide awake and eyes glued to the screen. I didn't think about my little life in the two hours I was sitting there. My mind did not wander. And that's because of pacing, convincing actors, some genuinely scary moments and a really fulfilling ending.Elizabeth Moss does such a great job of slowly descending into madness. And the fact that no one believes her makes her craziness even crazier, and we begin to panic with her. I love that she is not the typical sexy blond leading lady with her breasts always out. In fact, she becomes quite sick looking as the film progresses. Oddly unattractive. But she is a strong and powerful character nevertheless. Her frailty, or her ability to combat her own frailty is what makes her strong. It doesn't have a damn thing to do with sex appeal and I wish ""woke"" movies would give some consideration to that. Elizabeth Moss's performance is a great example of TRUE wokeness (hint: it has everything to do with what you're made of and not what you look like).And thank you Leigh Whannell for including the character of James. It is SO nice to have a black guy in these movies who DOESN'T have to develop a romantic relationship with the leading white lady. And he's not gay. And he's not your stereotypical mocha colored black guy that seems to be in so many bad horror movies. No, this guy is a big, dark black man. And he's a freakin cop and a single father. Not a word is said about his trials as a black man or the issues he faces as a black cop. No discussion on whether his daughter's mother is on drugs or something like that. Whannell refused to make him a typecast puppet. He's just a normal damn person.This film had ALL the ingredients to make the ""white chick fall head over heels for the black guy"" and vice versa. But they left it alone. And voila! What we end up with is an excellent horror/thriller/sci fi film with suspense and scares throughout, characters who behave in believable ways and we like them for it. And don't let me forget about that soundtrack. Especially the number at the very, very end right before the end credits role. Superb.I'm putting The Invisible Man right up there with standouts like Hereditary, Midsommar and Us. Not because it's anything like an Ari Aster or Jordan Peele film. But because it's new and exciting and refreshing, just as those guy's films were when they were released. I'm going to keep my eyes on Leigh Whannell. Looking forward to seeing what he does next.",The Invisible Man

I will leave this spoiler-free as a warning to people who are debating watching it, but the spoilers are ultimately what makes this movie so silly. Without spoilers though; the movie makes ZERO sense. While the acting is great for what they are all given, the plot and script are so silly and laughable that it makes the intensely serious acting equally laughable. Characters have ZERO common sense, public cameras don't exist, dialogue is borderline preschool, and the plot is as if a 15 year old wrote it (a lot of moments that anybody above 20 would say ""okay thats not how this works"").

They are everywhere BUT the places they absolutely need to be, say, a damn restaurant. It is so bad it is cringeworthy.

1315,bensdave-11987,Just really not very good. At all.,3,12 March 2020,"This is what happens when you throw a bunch of 2nd rate TV actors (I implore you to look at their IMDb resumes - all quite unimpressive) into roles in which they all try to overact. This film is a bumbling mess.It begins with some curiosity; an opening that has been xerox-ed from ""Sleeping With the Enemy""; dark, stormy night, woman desperately trying to get away from abusive man/relationship. After you say, ""Ah, I've seen this before"", it only goes downhill from there. The acting is quite atrocious. The lead, played by Elisabeth Moss, is an unconvincing girlfriend of a rich optics entrepreneur, who could have any girl he chooses but who mysteriously chose this dour-looking, frumpy, annoying thing. She is the overreaching lead in any of your high-school plays; acting for attention from her drama teacher but failing miserably. I don't see a deep run for Ms. Moss in the film industry. Her sister, played by Harriet Dyer, another no-name TV actress, is a smarmy sorority type who is annoyed by anyone who dare disrupt her unseen perfect life. Every role here is massacred by TV-rate acting. The invisible suit emits an annoying Predator-esque sound when the unseen foe moves in the room, removing any modicum of suspense. Unseen needs to be unheard as well and the film lacks any serious editing and feels, again, like a cheap TV movie. The ending tries to be a dramatic, symphonious reveal that would not surprise even the most devoted Bachelor or Kardashian watcher. Do not be fooled by the excellent and intriguing trailer. They should have put that on a 2-hour loop to gain an extra star from me.Don't waste your time.",The Invisible Man

I thought it was gonna be another bleak, ""everything is on the trailer"" type of movie that's overrated. Obviously I was wrong. It turned out to be very satisfying. Storyline was well perceived by the audience and movie goers which indicates that it was written solidly. Unlike most of the thrillers that came out recently that rely on jumpscares and mediocre writing, The Invisible Man's atmosphere is controlled and it dictates the whole movie. Some scenes ought to get your heart racing and some would want to make you clench your fist so hard due to the lead role's desperation. The camera work was also spot on, panning was one of the best and really gets that suspense out of you and into the crowd. Overall, great movie, great cast, huge clap at the end!",The Invisible Man
1341,turbineinc,The invisible plot,4,1 March 2020,"I have no idea how this movie has such a good rating.I went to see this movie with my girlfriend and before we went I told her that I was interested to know why this girls boyfriend faked his own death and when I came out, the question seemed even more relevant.Here are some of the things I noticed during this movie:* everything is ridiculously noisy from the creaking of the trees to the creaking of the doors, the tapping of the floors as they are walked over, EVERY sound seems to be exaggerated which raises the question even more that if this guy in this invisibility suit is around her literally all the time, how can he possibly be so quiet when the slightest sound is so loud
* this girl, she is supposed to be frail, her boyfriend supposedly abused her mentally and physically although we see zero evidence of this and when he is finally in the movie at the end he doesnt come across like that at all, anyway, she is supposed to be frail, lacking in confidence, scared of her own shadow etc etc, this is even a plot point in the movie about how she cant go outside blah blah blah yet by the end of the movie she has turned into a stone cold killer...........it makes no sense to me that someone can transform themselves so drastically in terms of their behaviour when they are supposed to have been through so much
*back to the guy at the end of the movie, the boyfriend...........all through the movie they make a point that he is controlling, abusive, etc etc..........when she agrees to meet him at the end though, its her who is mentally abusing him. I say this because she is trying to coerce a confession from him even though we dont ever know if he has actually done anything at all wrong other than fake his own death............she basically has the character traits that she accuses him of having all throughout the movie
*so the guy kills himself and apparently his brother has been going round in this invisibility suit harassing this girl....why? what does he have against her? what does he have to gain? people may suggest the money, but we dont know what is meant to happen to the money if the girl does not get it, its never stated it would default to his brother so i think its wrong to assume that, so why bother, how well does he even know her............he said he hated his brother, so it makes sense to me that he probably would not be around him all that much in that instance, so likely would not know his brothers girlfriend that well, if at all
*the brother, acting as a lawyer, tells the girl he can get rid of her murder charges if she agrees to go back with his brother to have her baby with him (how do they even know she is pregnant?) , how exactly does he intend to get rid of this murder charge? should we just accept that he is able to do so and not question how?
*why would this girl want to keep the baby? she clearly is not in the right state of mind, she is unemployed, has no home...why would she do it?
*when she is put in the mental institute, am i supposed to believe that the cop she has been living in would then be part of the investigation? that there is no conflict of interest present?
*why would this girl want his money? surely if he is as bad as she made out, she would want nothing of his? sure money is good but so are morals, right?
*the boyfriend apparently knew everything, he knew what she was thinking before she said anything, he knew she was on birth control without her telling him and was able to switch the pills..........yet he didnt know about her little hiding stash inside his own wardrobe..........
*the movie relies on jump scares
*the movie is blindingly predictable..........of course it was his brother in the suit, of course the girl is going to suit up at the end and kill the guy, and of course when she does so she is going to use his little catchphrase ""surprise""..........so predictable
*the registration plate of the cops car changes
*invisibility suit also seems to have super stealth and enhanced strength
*the girl suggests that although the brother was caught in the suit, that it was in fact her bf and only at the end became his brother.........this is never explained nor is it ever specified one way or the other whether this is true or not
*the cop at the end, ridiculous, he knows she just murdered someone and if he doesnt he is a moron, he sees the suit, he sees her demeaner yet he allows her to just walk away
*why would the boyfriend leave her 5 million in the first place
thats the stuff i can think of off of the top of my head anyway, of course there are plenty more, but this movie is filled with holes left right and centre, the acting is poor and in some cases questionable and over acting especially by the black copit seems the writer expects us all to just blindly accept what is put in front of us with no questions asked, its very lazy writing, very unskilled writingi am not particularly a fan of the horror genre, i have never seen a ""horror"" movie that i thought to be ""horrifying"" but none the less, i would not place this movie into the category of horror, certainly not sci fi either........id call it a thrillerit also gripes me that this movie is called ""the invisible man"", after all, we are all already familiar with ""the invisible man"" as a character........he does not have some suit that makes him that way..........to me its just called that to piggy back off of an already established franchise to try and gain extra hype.......again, to me, this is lazy and unskilledthroughout the movie the girl does a pretty good job of coming across as insane (and an idiot) but she claims her boyfriend made her that way etc etc, would be nice to see some evidence of this, somewhere, anywhere..........otherwise, could it not be the case that actually, she is just insane, she is just imagining things and its her who is the unhinged killer.......maybe it really was her who slit her sisters throat but we are seeing it from her warped perspective and she doesnt believe it was her due to her insanity?anyway, i cant be bothered to write any more than this, i think i have said enough.........its not a good movie unless you are the type of drone who likes movies purely because they are classed as horror, who can believe quite literally anything whether there is evidence or not - if you tick those boxes you will probably love it but if you have the ability to ask questions then i doubt it is going to be for youi have just realised why this movie is rated so highly..........most people are idiots, we all know this to be true, right?",The Invisible Man

If you're looking for a tense movie, not a scary one, you might enjoy this. There is some blood.Elizabeth Moss is fantastic in this movie. I really believed that her character was being tormented.This is NOT an adaptation of H.G. Wells' book.Plot-
The movie follows Cecilia (Elizabeth Moss) who has escaped from her abusive husband and is later tormented by the eponymous Invisible Man.I thought that the pacing was fine, but there were some slower moments for me. I never checked my watch though or found my mind wandering to other things.The ending felt rushed, but it wasn't bad, just ok.Cinematography-
Great. There are a couple of scenes at the beginning of the movie that really tease you. Tension is built well.I only remember there being one jump scare.Length-
At two hours it was fine. If the ending had been fleshed out more it could've pushed it a little further.Believability-
I didn't think that stupid decisions were made, and I can't think of any damming plot holes after one viewing.Soundtrack-

1361,Rui-Wen,Whannell + Moss = Excellence,9,6 February 2021,"Leigh Whannell's 'Upgrade' touted his ability to produce a slick, tight thriller with incredibly inventive visuals. In the Invisible Man there are touches of those visuals but he mostly strips them back, allowing Elizabeth Moss's performance to drive the story. And drive it she does, like a powerful car down a narrow lane, the tight storyline grips and once the full tension sets in you'll find yourself holding your breath until the inevitable gasp before the credits roll.
Like the best horrors The Invisible Man exists to do more than cause jumps, it makes you invest in the character's plight. Her fears are yours and the paranoia surrounding her experience invade your own feelings, making you question if what you've just seen on screen is what you saw.
Seeing this as I have post awards nominations I've no choice but to agree with those who've recognised the failure to consider Moss for a best performance nod. If more horrors of the calibre of Get Out and The Invisible Man are released, it can't be long before we start to see statues going towards those that make them.",The Invisible Man

However, it does have those traditional horror movie flaws. The ones that make you go, ""Oh my god, turn around, grab the knife and kill it! Standing around is not doing anything!"".

My one issue is how the hell does the guy not produce a shadow. They tried making the film logical by using a current invention regarding cloaking using cameras. Except here it's been perfected in the form of a body suit. But that doesn't change the fact the he is still a solid figure that does not allow light waves to go through him, so its no way possible to make him 100% invisible.

Outside of that - predictable and full of holes.I started to get quite annoyed with the phone in the attic and the fact that all of that evidence was left in the attic. The person in this suit makes no sound whatsoever either, so in addition to being invisible, the person wearing the suit is inaudible as well. So the initial attack scene commences and miraculously, all the paint that ended up on the suit is easily cleaned off in the sink in about 1 minute. Rubbish!Moss runs out of the house after this confrontation and got an Uber in about 30 seconds (as they are like bees at a hive in this neighborhood) and then went to Adrians estate. She discovers the bodysuit and has to leave in a hurry as Adrian returns (the dog is barking to alert Moss). She had nothing in her hands as I recall, but later in the film, she has the suit (in the not so thrilling conclusion) and who does she call? The press? The police? No - her sister. So she actually has the evidence which would prove that Adrian didn't kill himself and is stalking her and she calls her sister. Crap!After her sister is murdered in a restaurant, Moss is arrested and her friend, who is a policeman, interviews her with someone else in the room. In a police station for an interview, you would expect CCTV and there were two armed policemen present, so probably safe to say 'Listen, Adrian has this special suit...blah blah blah...', but nope she chickens out for some odd reason. (Not to mention that she has the evidence stashed somewhere).At the mental ward/jail, we learn that the cameras in the suit can take multiple stab wounds with no problems (in addition to the person wearing it). Only a slight malfunction for a second or two happens. In addition, the suit is completely water repellant despite being obviously electric. Also, Moss decides to kill herself by starting to slit her wrists. However, this is glossed over until she is wearing a bandage later in the film.Nevertheless, the wound magically is no longer an issue (running on adrenaline and the meds that the people at the ward gave her. Not likely to be a stimulant) neither are the stab wounds that the brother had inflicted on him. Invisible man driving a car also, not an issue.Basically, the ending was very predictable and also crap although I had to laugh at the close up face of the euphoric Moss at the end as the camera lingered there for far too long.Avoid this film....",The Invisible Man

Woman then goes to the good black guy to help her.News arrive that evil white husband commited suicide. Everything seems to be going too well at this point and you start wondering where this film is going to screw up.The invisible man appears and starts making the woman's life a living nightmare by harrasing her ,sending an awful e-mail to her sister on behalf of her and other stuff.Good black guy continues to shows us how good he is by being very supportive and understanding.The film falls into a wide array of horror movie tropes of the protagonist being stupid and not ever doimg the right thing to protect herself.Also evil white man makes no sound when he is in a room,does not speak nor does he ever state his intentions and goals to the audience because he is reduced to a caricature villain by the film. Evil white man also has super strength when he wears his suit apparently.We learn in the process that even though the evil white man is a genius,has invented and manufactured not one but TWO invisibility suits and is a billionare,evil man has faked his own death trying to get revenge from woman for leaving him. Why? Because he is an evil white man of course.A 2 hour film with a lot of contrived scenes and situations that in the end feels like less than the sum of it's parts.",The Invisible Man

1409,casbadass,Written by a Man - and I guessed with 20 minutes,5,28 February 2020,"A friend was determined to see this movie and I was somewhat interested in the revised premise. However, 20 minutes in, I leaned into my friend and whispered ""this was written by a man, she's so unbelievable."" I have just gotten home to look it up (because the name Leigh didn't really tell me) and I am not surprised to see that I am right.I can tell you this is not necessarily a bad thing: not all writing is marred by the author's gender. However, I just felt from the beginning that this writer didn't understand what it is like to live in a society where you are expected to be responsible for how you are treated all the time, the self-blame of it, yet raised to be constantly compassionate. I felt that way immediately when she didn't take the dog with her in the first few minutes of the movie (studies show few women leave without the pet because, if she is subhuman, imagine how he'll treat the non-human, especially if she loves the pet! It is a concern for shelter-planning).Later, it just felt false in that she was too brave. The writer/director didn't understand how it feels to be broken down. Sometimes broken women are the bravest people you'll ever meet, but there are little behaviours and expressions that leak out to show how the bravery is forced (this is likely a combined issue with script, directing and portrayal work, but even one can throw off the others).There were just a whole bunch of tiny things that broke the fourth wall for me, where I thought ""wait a minute"" and had lost my suspension of disbelief. By the climax, I was mentally critiquing the special effects rather than lost in the tension of the moment. I wish I could get my money back or, better yet, a chance to revise some of these characters. She was not redeemed in my eyes, nor a hero in her survival.",The Invisible Man

1421,NinjaOwl,"Nothing new, but still enjoyable",7,26 October 2020,"This is a wonderfully entertaining movie, although it certainly doesn't have much new to offer. It is interesting, however, that the subject of the invisible man is reversed here and viewed from the perspective of an ""outsider"", i.e. his wife. And this is done in a very intriguing way - at least most of the time. At the beginning of the film some scenes felt like from a dull B movie horror film, but as the story goes on, things get more and more exciting. Generally, I liked how they sort of mixed ""Sleeping with the Enemy"" with sci-fi elements.
The actors fulfill their roles well, with one exception: the husband / invisible man himself. Unfortunately, this actor has no charisma, and the question arises as to why the wife would fall for him in the first place.
The plot holes criticized by some users are not such big issues, though, and can be explained if you have some imagination. Admittedly, it is not entirely understandable why the man wants his wife back at all costs - and why he hauls out the big guns. The reactions of the woman, on the other hand, are too logical. After all, she has to put an end to the threat once and for all.
On a side note, some of the reviews with the lowest ratings are mostly based on the irrelevant fact that the evil guy is white and the good cop is black/the victim is female. If the gender or color of the characters are such a huge problem for these reactionary reviewers, then the best and most logic movie might not be able to satisfy them.
In conclusion, The Invisible Man is a highly entertaining film with a few weaknesses you can ignore.",The Invisible Man

And in this case there's a bonus: this movie is so full with cliches that you can easily predict the next piece of the domino coming and, eventually, falling down, until there's nothing else to expect or to wish for, and you're left with the not-so invisible feeling of regret.

1425,faye_marie-13530,Seeing is believing,6,15 April 2020,"Can't move. Too tense. Must try and breath, and then relax, but not for long. From the initial scene we are in survival mode with our heroine and the beauty in this film is the tension created by the invisible assailant.At just over two hours long The Invisible Man is a relatively long horror and struggles to maintain the level of tension that is it's biggest draw and thus lacks the ability to keep the viewer engaged. Especially as the story line is pretty basic and almost assumed as you wait it out for the next action scene. It's nice to see Director Leigh Whannell in a much lighter horror relying on tension and jump scares rather than gore as in Saw his break through hit.
Elizabeth Moss is fantastic as the controlled victim who fights back, you'll recognise this from her powerful performance in the Handmaid's tale.
Everything happens in this movie that you think should happen, there's no unfair twists that will stick in your gut, everything is justified and the feeling of ease is almost boring.

In the filmography of horrorfilms specifically, I have never ever seen such a great mix of performance, MUSIC (phenomenal), storytelling, directing, Cinematography and dedication ETC for creation of a horrorfilm as this one.This film has NOIR and it includes a little bit of Art-house in it as well, along with a lot of other things of course.Here we don't talk opinions, we talk facts and these things YOU as a normal viewer don't understand is EXACTLY what the Academy Awards specifically values and looks at...Moral of the story, this film is by fact greatness.",The Invisible Man

Rife with stand out acting performances, especially from the film's star Elisabeth Moss who practically carries the film with her incredible portrayal of a woman suffering from PTSD and paranoia, sequences of breath-stopping suspense as Cecelia (Moss), and the audience, are psychologically stalked and toyed with by her invisible adversary, and tight, purposeful direction from Whannel, fresh of the back of his previously acclaimed film ""Upgrade"", ""The Invisible Man"" is another solid and stand out entry into Whannel's filmography of ever-growing horror classics.

And the CGI of the invisible man in all scene including in one pertictular scene not saying what one have to see it in cinema to find out. The CGI of un reveling the invisible man with object and how they did it was amzing. Elizabeth play her role tremendously well.
It definitely a must see.",The Invisible Man
1439,mrbeal-53006,(7.4/10) An Excellent Suspense Film That's Worth Your Time,7,29 February 2020,"Is It Worth Watching: YesIs It Worth A Movie Ticket: YesThe Invisible Man is a movie that excels in one particular area: suspense. Once you allow yourself to step into the reality of the movie you realize that there is a crazy, invisible man who may be behind you at any moment. It becomes worse as that invisible man begins to torment you. You tell your friends and family, but they don't believe you. And the invisible man goes out of his way to isolate you, to destroy your integrity, to harm loved ones, and to prove that he is always in control.There are a lot of complaints about this movie and a few of them are justified. But these complaints can be easily forgiven if you take the time to appreciate what's important in the movie and what isnt. For example, people complain that this is a PC propaganda piece because it involves an abusive boyfriend (the invisible man) tormenting a woman who decides to leave him. However, that relationship isn't really ""important"" to the movie despite being much of its foundation. What's important is that there's an invisible bad guy and a victim who needs to find a way to fight back before their life is completely ruined.People also complain about some plot holes and technical issues. How does an invisible man drive around? Why is he so strong? Why didn't she take videos with her camera? These are the sort of complaints that are a little more justified and they are part of the reason this film doesn't go into the hall of fame. But if you can overlook these (very minor) problems, then you will find yourself on the edge of your seat as you watch this story unfold.You could compare this to movies like 6 Underground or Anchorman. The first of which is a movie that excels in terms of action. If you begin to focus on the mindless story elements, then you'll suspend your connection to the movie's reality and find it unlikable. Anchorman excels in raw comedy, but if you focus too much on the evolution of the main relationship and the potential real-life consequences of character actions, then you'll once again leave the reality of the movie and find it unlikable.Returning to my initial statement, this is a movie that excels in suspense. If you find yourself worrying about the political climate, what should have been done in a particular situation, or how a person can wash off a gallon of paint in 30 seconds, then you lose your connection to the reality of The Invisible Man and will miss out on an otherwise fun and suspenseful adventure.Finally, the play my own Devil's Advocate, the missing elements from this movie are what create a true masterpiece when they all come together. Had this story been a little more careful and thoughtful with some decisions it could have been even better. The Invisible Man may not be a masterpiece, but it doesn't take a masterpiece to drag me to the movie theater.",The Invisible Man

1441,kalebwes-89269,Exceeds expectations at least.,7,22 March 2020,"The Invisible Man starts off well. We get the notion that we are in for a treat and towards the middle of the film the treat turns more into a simple snack... While the first half of the film intrigues and intensifies while even nearly going a little too far with that, the second half of the film was almost what I feel like I have seen dozens of times in thrillers. Simple twist at the end and you care for the character and the position she's in and the story itself is still intriguing although there are plenty of plot holes making me question certain things. Over looking those plot holes and the near run of the mill feel of the second half of the film I believe it is a fresh movie with fresh ideas but just simply comes off feeling like a really good thriller and not something as great as it could have been. I give The Invisible Man a 75%.",The Invisible Man
1442,amaroagm,"Without exaggerating, this movie is a complete masterpiece.",10,7 March 2020,"This movie in particular, after watching many of this genre, I can assure you that this one is completely different from all the horror movies I've ever seen, and I say that in a very good way.Lately, some films and series of these days are trying to put, in a forced and at the same time very annoying way, plots that support the cause of political correctness, falling as a consequence, big companies that lost the respect of the real moviegoers. And I don't say ""big"" because of how good their movies are, on the contrary, by ""big"" I mean the large amount of money they make from making films like that, which, to be honest, are a complete mess.Themes such as feminism, cultural diversity and political ideas are often the reasons why cinema industry is falling into a bottomless pit until it can never get out of it. And don't misunderstand me, I'm not saying that these themes are bad, on the contrary, they are themes that should be very interesting to implement in a work of fiction, and I say ""should"" because, until now, I haven't seen any film or series that respects its script by wanting to implement these ideologies in it, which is more than regrettable... but that has just changed right now.The Invisible Man, written and directed by Leigh Whannell, wants to give a deep meaning to one of the themes mentioned above, and it does.The film is about Cecilia Kass (Elisabeth Moss), a woman who lives with Adrian Griffin (Oliver Jackson-Cohen), a mad scientist who made her life impossible. One day Cecilia escapes from his expensive house, and weeks later she feels an evil presence in her home, something or someone she cannot see, but who can hurt her. Cecilia soon will discover that this presence is more than familiar to her.The Invisible Man is hooking from start to finish, having a more than satisfactory ending, adding excellent performances, well-achieved scares, crazy direction, great photography, and a chilling soundtrack, making this film a complete masterpiece.And remember when I mentioned that this film is very different from other horror movies I've ever seen? Well, I didn't lie to you.What I liked the most about this film is the fact that the theme of feminism is very, very well implemented in the story, without comparing it to certain films that I don't even want to remember existed. Women in this film are not put as semi-goddesses who can deal with everything, on the contrary, at the beginning you see the protagonist with fear of the evil Griffin, escaping from him, suffering, so that in the end, she gets her well-deserved revenge, giving us a great ending, and at the same time, a great film.",The Invisible Man

1446,e-36426,The most sinister,8,21 March 2020,"This movie tells the heroine who managed to escape the control of the crazy scientist boyfriend's claw, but soon learned that her boyfriend had committed suicide, but soon she found that there was an ""invisible person"" around her and began to monitor her every move , Disrupting her life, and ruining her life ...The invisible human surveillance around you will even actively attack this setting of your own, although horrible,However, what makes me feel cold is that the fragile relationship between people in modern society reflected in the film is like the spider silk in the wind and rain. With a light flick, it breaks.Before the invisible man actually kills the woman around her, using only a single email full of bad words and a single blow is enough to destroy the love and trust between the hostess and sisters and friends. Stay. Moreover, they have no doubt at all, even did not insist at all even for a moment, the heroine is not such a person, the heroine cannot suddenly swear or hit someone for no reason, the mailbox may be hacked for no reason The attack did not cause them a hint of suspicion.Even if I really felt that the heroine did it, I didn't think about it at all: ""Is the gentle and cheerful heroine suddenly doing such an offensive thing for no reason? Is it because of the recent nervousness and illness? Is n't it physically uncomfortable, is it not in a good state of mind, or does it need help? ""They just immediately felt that the hostess was acting out of malicious intentions, or even if there was a little guess in her heart, it may not be the hostess's act, but rather than trusting and caring for the hostess, than trying to maintain the relationship , More willing to protect themselves, regardless of other people's affairs, so immediately turned to look at the hostess, and asked the hostess to get out of her territory.This part is too horrible but so real. It is even more frightening than having an invisible person who doesn't know what to do at any time may threaten their safety at any time.",The Invisible Man

1452,kanehagen,See ya wouldn't want to be ya!,7,8 April 2020,"When I was a child and teenager growing up and coming home from school my genuine objective each night was to find a good film to watch in order to fill the void of monotony on a school night, with the next early morning school day ever lurking. During this unprecedented and and certainly unorthodox period of quarantine from COVID-19, it seems I have dug back into my roots of indulgence in cinema as a means of an easier existence. I knew little about Leigh Whannell's, The Invisible Man (2020) other than it seemed like a cheap simulacrum from Kevin Bacon's 'Hollow Man (2000), and also that it starred Elizabeth Moss, the latter proving more enticing however not overall encapsulating, but then again that is the problem with assumptions.But WOW! And I mean that with utmost enthusiasm, this film provided a riveting, jaw-dropping and side-winding experience of deceit, manipulation and disturbia. To summarise the sci-fi horror plot, Cecilia Kass (Moss), is entrapped in an abusive relationship of which she narrowly escapes within the first scene - her husband Adrian Griffin (Oliver Jackson-Cohen) is a controlling and manipulative boyfriend. He is also the creator of an optics company and it is understood throughout that he is very successful at what he does, both in controlling people and inventing new technologies. After Cecilia escapes, Adrian fakes his own death and uses a suit which turns him invisible in order to haunt her with his memory, amongst other stomach-curdling things which you will have to watch to find out - it really takes Samuel Jackson's character (Frozone) in 'The Incredibles' notorious exclamation of 'Honey! Where's my supersuit!?' to a whole new level.This film plays very much on a sort of 'invisible enemy' motif, establishing ideas surrounding domestic abuse with an extension of PTSD following our main protagonist Cecilia, quite literally. The film transcribes very much the ideas of vulnerability of women and extends it into the outer world of societal perception, both figuratively and literally. The fact that Cecilia has experienced such abuse and then starts to realise that Adrian is not dead, yet still torturing her with various methods, such as loosening her tethers with others which is done methodically in order to exacerbate her anguish and serves to portray real life problems which mirror the science-fiction narrative of the film. That females, and males included, do unfortunately succumb to domestic abuse and this can have an adverse effect on them mentally, however for our protagonist it is both mentally and physically.When Cecilia resumes back into everyday normal life without Adrian she seems instantly vulnerable and at the worlds mercy. Although, we learn that Adrian has apparently committed suicide and this allows Cecilia to begin to reintegrate back into normality, supposedly. However, her safe haven is cut short when she begins to realise Adrian's not dead and instead using his invisibility suit in order to terrorise her. The proceedings are rhapsodic, unbelievable and shocking throughout as some of the scenes and things that Adrian does in order to destroy Cecilia's life prove almost unwatchable, literally, multiple scenes I was grasping my mouth in horror. I do believe after seeing this, that what victims of such acts have to endure is a loss of control over their everyday life, which proves as demeaning as the acts which the antagonist pursues.This is achieved in a multitude of ways, of which the films cinematographer crew and camera men have worked extravagantly, again wow. From privileged spectator position shots, POV's bouncing between protagonist and antagonist, de-centralised shots to accumulated a sense of suspicion, such as staring into a space and away from the key signifiers of the scene whilst zooming slowly and ominously, again establishing a 'invisible enemy' and is once again off-putting, when Cecilia knows Adrian is present all work very well and serve purpose throughout. The music is also inviting, adding a disturbing nature, and used to build anticipation - the anticipation often drawn out to gain maximum effect which proves more beneficial than any jump scare I've ever seen.The characters are also all so diverse and brilliantly portrayed. Moss wouldn't have had her work cut out for her due to her involvement in the dehumanising role of 'The Handmaid's Tale', where again she is subordinate, however the range of personalities is small but fulfilling, with a charismatic father and daughter taking Cecila in, a stern sister and Adrian's brother of whom if he told me the sky was blue outside I'd go out and check. I suppose the healthy relationship of the father James (Aldis Hodge) and his daughter Sydney (Storm Reid) earns a sort of contrast from that of the fragmented/broken relationship Cecilia experienced, and their involvement throughout creates a gut-wrenching foreshadowment which incurs worry surrounding their fate when Adrian is involved. As for Adrian, his dialogue is limited and really established the idea of the 'invisible enemy' well, just like how the alien from Super 8 is shown very little, the little he has to say only enhances his actions, whilst creating the suspense for whenever Cecilia believes he is present. There are twists in the plot throughout so don't think you will have everything sussed out before the end, however the end does invite a really interpretation of the film as a whole and what has just happened.Whilst, everything I have said thus far has shed light on a pretty terrific and differentiated science-fiction film, issues do come to light throughout unfortunately. The main for me I think is that I just don't really understand the whole agenda of Adrian, things do come to light later in the film which portray him as a and I quote 'narcissistic sociopath' however, faking his own suicide just to haunt a girlfriend who didn't want to be with him due to his own behaviour seems over-exaggerated. Again, things do come to light and there are a few things for you as a viewer to decipher upon viewing, which will make this review a lot more meaningful, as I do believe the twists and turns in the film are its gateway to authenticity, therefore I do wish to leave that ground untrodden. Moreover, a few gimics do become notable throughout such as Cecilia knowing Adrian's password to everything. I mean if he was that controlling the password to his invisible suit wouldn't be the day you guys met, I mean like come on we can't all be hackers, I know, but we can all have the self respect to not be that level of cringe! Cecilia only sometimes suspects someone lurking around her, and I mean if I was being haunted by an invisible man with evil intentions of destroying my life and hurting everyone around me I'd be flailing my arms like an Octopus turned sushi chef, but Cecilia doesn't seem to ascertain the same survival techniques as me, that or she just hasn't seen as many Kevin Bacon movies as me *cough* Hollow Man *cough*.To conclude, and to reiterate my first point, 'The Invisible Man' did fill my night with a very entertaining and enthralling watch, and as I do joke about Hollow Man, it isn't nearly as well executed as The Invisible Man. The undertones are fun to decipher, even in their macabre nature, the acting is stellar especially from Moss. However the sister, although a stern lawyer, can seem a little lifeless and unconcerned. The camera angles and filming however do steal the show for me from all aspects, and the lighting especially within the scene in the loft is immersive. The music is great as well and does its job. Apart from the problems established, I really rate this as a breathe of fresh air in the sci-fi horror genre, intertwining a societal issues of domestic abuse with a sci-fi villain you can't see is overall understandably intriguing.",The Invisible Man

1454,JovansOpinion,Intense Thrill-Ride at Its Peak,7,14 May 2020,"The Invisible Man is a tension-filled, really well crafted thrill ride. It is filled with moments that will make you clench in your seat while watching it. Elizabeth Moss is really great here as she shows a lot of emotions throughout the course of the runtime. It is also very well directed by Leigh Whannell as he masters the true sense of horror through images and relies more on tension rather than a jumpscare fest. The film can get a but ridiculous at times, but it is saved by Elizabeth Moss' truly great performance and Leigh Whannell's steady eyes for the camera. One of the stand outs of 2020 so far.RATING: 8/10",The Invisible Man

I saw the movie trailer from a YouTube ad and was interested to know if it was good or not. Later, I learned that my friend, who absolutely loves movies, loved it. In fact, I asked her what would be her top 3 movies to live with and this was one of them. So, yes, I had high hopes for this film. Now, let's talk about my film experience. I laughed...a lot. A somewhat inappropriate amount for a movie like this. Did I find this movie scary? Not at all. Did I find it thrilling? You guessed it, no. Kudos for the concept, I'll admit, it is interesting. But I expected so much more. And, if you ask me, I would say this movie is more of a comedy than anything close to horror/thriller. This movie really disappointed me.

A typical ""couple of beers and a big bag of crisps"" film.I fully expected more scares or ""jumps"" (although I'm not a huge fan a jumping out of my seat) although there are some eerie moments and some good effects, too.Without putting spoilers in, I did find the parts where it became more Sci-Fi in my opinion, to be the disappointing aspects.There are daft or silly elements in more than one scene (without using spoilers) when you think ""just check the CCTV"" which appears to be everywhere but doesn't appear to be monitored, used or checked at any point.Elisabeth Moss is great. Really good in her role and I'm pleased she was cast. A definite leading role in the film. Personally, I had many ""why won't anyone listen to her?!"" moments which shows how I identified with the character.On the whole I did enjoy it and if there are plans to produce more universal monsters films then this one has interested me in the franchise which, after Mr Cruise's escapades I felt was a lost cause.",The Invisible Man

1468,raffaelregis,Best I've seen this year,10,24 March 2020,"I went on to the movies to watch this film without even watching the trailer, or hearing from it from friends or reading any reviews, so my judgement of the plot was based on the last movie I went to see which was about invisibility, and that was John Carpenter's Memoirs of an Invisible Man (1992), starring Chevy Chase and Daryl Hannah, a film I don't have words to describe, but maybe you should check it out if you found your taste in the garbage can like I did.My expectations were below the line and I got pleasantly surprised by this film. It is not a film about discovering invisibility or about science fiction, it's not even about the social implications of invisibility. Science play a minor part in this film, which is great because when you go for the title, you expect to watch something that will develop around the amazement of the possibility of being a transparent and how well the FX team got it on screen. Like Chevy Chase chewing gum or wearing makeup in that scene.Well, but what is it about? It is about abuse in a relationship. And in here I draw an outstanding reference (which I think the director had in mind) from another movie, a classic called Sleeping With the Enemy (1991), with Julia Roberts in her prime, and Patrick Bergin vigorously playing the villainous husband. In this film, Julia Robert's character, Laura, is a captive wife in an awesome designer house by a beautiful beach. The movie theme explores how a marriage can seem perfect from the outside and abusive from the inside, how people can turn whatever feelings of love they have into possession an then into obsession and of course, it explores fear (it's a dramatic thriller).This film has left a huge mark on me because, being a young man, I couldn't understand how women let themselves be involved in abusive relationships to the point of being violated in every way by someone who should love them (and clearly does not), and chose to stay in that situation only waiting to be abused again. This film made me understand the part fear takes in an abusive relationship, and how trauma is driven from this fear and instrumentally placed over the love as to drive women so insecure, so fragile that they become highly paranoid and obsessive about their own actions and how those actions could trigger a situation they want avoid at all costs. It's a really powerful movie and a powerful feeling, and the thrill of being able to experience the point of view of a woman in this situation is even more powerful as a statement. The film also gives a statement about a the heroic courage of the character to engineer a fail-safe plan to leave this relationship, and has a ""rebirth from the ashes"" theme also.The Invisible Man drinks HEAVILY on that, as even the designer house by the beach (but in a cliff by a beach) is in the movie. There's an abusive husband, a ""perfect"" marriage, and the overcautious and brave abused wife, which escapes violent obsessed husband only to be haunted by the trauma of him suddenly appearing and hijacking her back to him.The elements are all really well placed, but the movie then tweaks this by turning the husband invisible. And here's when the thriller alarm goes wild and you start to scratch the arms of the movie seat as the point of view of the paranoid abused wife becomes THE moral question. Gaslighting is brought on screen as we watch our heroine pour coffee powder on the floor trying to proof that someone who shouldn't be there is actually right there. It goes on taking from us all the possible flooring we could stand on, as we watch the invisible man cornering her more and more into madness, even murdering people and blaming it on her. And as a brave female hollywood protagonist could only, she crawls out from the bottomless pit of structural female discredit (she gets institutionalized) and finds a way to hurt her creepy ghost stalker back by herself as help won't come from anyone - even the tall, muscular, mindful and terribly handsome police officer who takes her in after she escapes from her husband -, and finally gets to higher ground.This film has a really well balanced measurement of pain and pleasure, as it ends with a vindictive ingenious supper with protagonist and antagonist giving perfect closure to the story. I couldn't really ask for more.",The Invisible Man

1511,SeeJay23,Good movie for the most part but major plot holes,6,14 August 2020,"I honestly thought it was a decent movie if you take it as it is and acknowledge that the actors, especially Elizabeth Moss, did a really good job playing their parts and making it believable and that the jump scare scenes were pretty decent as far as I'm concerned and I consider myself a fair horror movie buff.However you can't really ignore the many plot holes.The one I struggled with the most during this movie was that at no point anyone considered using a thermal camera, she's friends with a cop for gods sake and never once considers that he might be able to obtain something like that for her.. but a thermal camera may have been too easy of a resolution which doesn't exactly make for a good movie.And the scene where everyone's racing to stop the husband from killing Sydney, somehow there is no phone in the house that could reach her, nor does a COP have numbers of any of their neighbours to try and reach, which in 2019/2020 you would think at least one of those options is available. It is somewhat believable that some circumstances are working against them such as no house phone, phones being dead, or even that no one is answering, yet they chose to just ignore including any of that and I guess leave it up to the viewers imagination..Any other plot hole that I noticed has already been included in other reviews so I won't bore anyone by going over it again, but I couldn't rest until I pointed out the above.Regardless of the plot holes though my stance remains that this wasn't a terrible movie, and if you can get past the logical plot holes then I recommend watching it anyways because you may still really enjoy it.",The Invisible Man

About the film, I think Elisabeth Moss pulled over a master class performance. The story paced beautifully over the two hour scenario. The ending was just as well.
There are few plot holes I won't disagree. Like, when Emily gets her throat cut, the restaurant must have caught that in one of the security cameras. Also, about the suit, why was it built? Just to stalk his girlfriend? There are very little information for the viewers.

They are so prevalent that NOT using them is a plot hole, and not a small one. It really kind of irritates me.There is one legit good jump scare and some good tense moments.

1542,numchuck-35937,The Invisible Man With a Clear Agenda,1,1 August 2020,"The Invisible Man is another movie made for todays 'woke' culture with more political correctness that Hollywood feels they need to subject us to.The characters in the film are incredibly weak and the protagonist is yet another victim of an evil male. Her motivation is poor (to say the least) and her character arc is virtually nonexistent. This type of film is nothing new to mainstream Hollywood films, but here is the fresh take offered in this film - the villain is evil simply because he is a man.We have to accept Cecilia's (Elisabeth Moss) word as to why her psychotic husband acts the way he does. But we are not meant to question her reliability. The cliché evil-genius-psycho-guy angle is now a given. Plus, making him a round character with motivation would cut into valuable screen time for Cecelia to try and find interesting ways to see if her invisible stalker is in the room.Show don't tell is the unwritten rule in filmmaking, but we don't actually see Cecelia's husband do anything but give a menacing grin near the end. Then she murders him in cold blood. The ending is so bad that the audience is left to wonder if her husband was actually innocent, and if his brother was the one behind it all. This is not an open ending, just a bad one.Cecilia's buddy-cop friend is just about the worst detective ever. His covering up Cecilia's murder of her husband is horrid. I'm tired of watching films where cops break the law and bend the rules when their friends are involved, or if they feel the antagonist really deserved it. Do your job and uphold the law. He didn't do anything the entire film but paint his house, leave his friend unattended (after kicking her out of his home) and get beat up. Pretty weak for a detective.Watch the original 1933 version or go read the book by H.G. Wells, but don't waste your time on this film.",The Invisible Man

The acting and cinematography are not bad, hence I'm gracious with the 2 stars. But other than that the story is utterly bland and the characters are as one-dimensional as they can get. Instead of spending some time to build them up, so we can understand their motivations and actions, we are told that the husband is so brilliant and single-minded in his pursuit that he uses his greatest invention of limitless potential to enact his diabolical domestic violence scheme. None of the characters have any depth to them whatsoever. And even if you accept the premise of the story, the logic and twists flicker throughout the movie, much like the invisibility suit after it took a ton of damage, but eventually fade and disappear.If you are reading this review before watching the movie, make note of the plethora of negative reviews here.

1566,michaelramann,My favorige movie of the year so far!!,8,28 February 2020,"The Invisible Man is the brand new Blumhouse production. As expected, it is a horror movie that also deals with another genre. Here it is the science fiction. After criticly aclaimed movies such as Get Out or Us, by the well known Jordan Peele, it was time for viewers to experience an original story, written and directed by Leigh Whannell. I didn't know this director and I also didn't know that much about this movie. I only saw one trailer, and I didn't read any reviews, which I think was the best idea to fully appreciate this kind of movie.
The story is about a woman, who is terrified by his boyfriend who decided to fake his death, and starts to terrifies her, by literraly being an Invisible man.
I really enjoyed this movie! It is my favorite movie of the year so far! It's been only 2 months, but I can tell you that I had a great time! The story in itself is not inovative, but the way the filmmaker is building the tension is really impressive! All the shots in the house helps to create this creepy atmosphere of being watched by someone who is invisible. I also loved how he does use the jump scares at the right moment! Moreover, thank you for all of these scary scenes without music! Finally a guy who understand how to scared the audience!
Spoiler alert: the 2 twists really worked on me! Maybe that I was too dump to get them, but I don't care! At least, it worked!
I only have few negative points:
At the end of the 2nd act, it was no longer scary when it was the invisible man point of viewI understand that Adrian is a sociopath-killer, but I would have appreciate to have a little bit more background about his relationship with CeciliaThe dog? What's the purpose of this dog? In my opinion, he is useless",The Invisible Man
1567,jnotars,Not so good,4,23 March 2020,"Good sound, good music, but thats pretty much it. It seems to be a good thriller until they show you that hes invisible, literally. After that there are plenty of details like, ok this make no sense, but its a movie. I think is good for someone whos looking a little entretainment, but If you have your standars (probably you do If you are reading reviews) I wouldnt recommend it",The Invisible Man
1568,jeerjurky,Almost There,7,10 March 2020,"*Minor Spoilers*I make mention of certain scenes or objects that will add an unfair sense of anticipation and expectancy in scenes you should go into blind.This film features many, many instances of well thought-out moments and details; many of which are just tiny things, but it's the tiny things that make all the difference. Little details that the producers clearly gave much thought really help this film go far with depth and substance. For example, the way the ladder is introduced, then used later; same with the painting of the walls and the paint.
The ending, I found, was a little bit weak and rushed. It felt as if they spawned their idea for the ending, and were so excited to make it, that they overlooked important details. I also found it lacking of any real meaning or message, as the film carried a theme of domestic abuse. The film proposed this theme and message, but then said nothing of it with its ending. I was left sitting there thinking, ""well, what is that supposed to mean? What are they trying to say about their theme?"" There were also instances of overlooked details that ruined the realistic feel, making the film lack authenticity.Also, violence doesn't make films good, it just makes them violent. I found their level of gore inconsistent. The final act of the film lacked scare for me and felt underdone. On the other hand, the small cast worked wonders, and I was on the edge of my seat for, definitely, the first two thirds of the film. I loved how they worked with just a few characters. Unfortunately, the ending scene in the house did feel quite low-stakes.When it has you hooked, it really does, but it fails to finish in a fulfilling manner, and I also think they misrepresented James's character in the end. I would have preferred an ending where they tried less, so they could have fleshed it out and done it properly, so it would have held up to the standard set by the rest of the film.
Overall, quite enjoyable. Good scare. For me, not one worth watching a second time, right way, anyway.",The Invisible Man
1569,attilasmetak,One of the best lately,8,27 April 2020,"I don't know what movie these other viewers saw but I truly enjoyed this.

1570,Rob59,Mediocre film that could have been so much better.,5,8 July 2020,"TIM begins well with plenty of tension. As the film unfurls,the audience considers that Cecilia really is being stalked by her invisible partner or is she so stressed out she's gradually going cuckoo? The film plays on that mystery and while that mystery remains, it ticks over quite nicely. Unfortunately,and inevitably, the film has to play its hand and comes clean as to what is actually going on. And when it does, the film effectively falls apart. Had the film gone down the 'psychological' route then it would have ended up a more entertaining viewing experience than it did. Instead it went down the 'sci-fi / thriller' route, relying on clever special fx to distract from the general silliness of the plot. Over all the film is good fun in the same way as 1950's b-movies were good fun but as a potentially brilliant piece of psychological drama (as the film starts off as being),unfortunately it falls flat on its face half way through.",The Invisible Man

If you're looking for a horror movie, this isn't it, the feel is more of a Lifetime thriller about domestic abuse. The plot isn't really that suspenseful and is sort of comedic.

The plot twist was unexpected and very well put into the narrative. The whole movie is very well written, the key shots made in the beginning all correlate to essential parts of the story later on.

There are lots of details missing in the movie, the story still needs improvements. The woman character must play better or let's say the director should pay attention to the actress play on the scenes she is confronting with an invisible man.

1586,chrischryssovergis,Suspenseful with a few plot gaps,8,1 March 2020,"I typically don't see horror or suspenseful movie but made an exception given the positive buzz and reviews. (My daughters and wife playfully tease me because of my unease with this movie genre.) Terror can be displayed in many forms. The subtle terror of much of The Invisible Man, where the antagonist is lurking but hidden, or may not be there at all, is executed brilliantly. Elizabeth Moss does a stellar job carrying the movie. She has learned to communicate effectively without words. Her ability to convey myriad emotion through facial expression, learned well from her time on the cast of The Handmaid's Tale, effectively translates to the big screen in this novel adaption of this classic story.Leigh Whannell does well building tension throughout the movie. The successful integration of sound and music adds to the palpable terror felt by the movie goers and enhances Elizabeth Moss's portrayal of a shattered person.There are a few big, plot gaps that made the movie more unrealistic than it needed to be. I can support the concept that made Oliver Jackson-Cohen invisible. I found myself less willing to embrace a few items that disturbed me immediately in the moments I saw them. These are the two that bothered me the most -
the guard staffing level @ the hospital during the late eveningthat the Invisible Man would exhibit unreasonable strength during some of the climactic moments of the movieAn aside, but potentially worth mentioning as well - there are scenes depicted in the trailer that aren't in the movie -
the Invisible Man's hand-print on the shower doorthe action that occurs in the investigating room when Elizabeth Moss is in police custodyThere are scenes from the trailer that would have been better if first observed when watching the full production -
the Invisible Man's visible breath when he's standing next to the protagonist on a cold eveningI'm supportive of scenes that end up on the cutting room floor being used to boost interest and ""word-of-mouth'. I'm less supportive of scenes depicted in a trailer that are better served and best viewed in the movie itself. From my perspective, it's a missed opportunity to make the movie experience ""pop"" in the moment.I was able to set aside my misgivings during these moments because my objective when viewing most movies is simply to be entertained. And The Invisible Man was able to entertain, even if that entertainment was experienced mostly through elevated pulse and blood pressure. Bring someone you care about and enjoy the energy together because overall, the big screen serves this telling reasonably well.",The Invisible Man
1587,emmalinneanilsson,I really can't understand the high rating of this movie,6,1 March 2020,"I had very high hopes for this movie, and it did have its upsides. The idea of the plot is interesting and the picture is very good. You can tell that the team behind it is talented as it really is a well-made movie. The lead actress has to be acclaimed for her role. Even though, I was bored watching it as well as disappointed when walking out of the cinema.The start of the movie was good and quickly pulled you in. But after that... it didn't really go any deeper. Although the movie addresses some important topics such as domestic violence, it failed to make you care about them. As the movie lacked engagement, it became quite boring. The characters also failed to impress. There was very little explained about the relationships between the characters and you failed at getting to know them. There were some pretty non-believable character development as well as them behaving in - to say the least - not very credible ways which were really annoying and made it hard (impossible) to have compassion for them.The plot, a woman escaping from an abusive ex that manages even after his own death to keep controlling her, is by the sounds of it a captivating story. But unfortunately it was both predictable and full of serious plotholes (hard to describe closer without spoiling). The movie would have been way scarier if had been conducted in a more believable way.I'd say I enjoyed the first 25% of the movie, when it was mainly a combination of a thriller and a horror film, which definitely kept me at the edge of my seat. The rest of the movie though was more of an action movie, which made you periodically yawn, mostly just waiting for the movie to be over (as by this point it was pretty obvious how it would end), alternatively come with up with some clever twist (it didn't).So for people wanting to enjoy an occasionally scary action movie, this is probably a pretty good movie. If you want to watch something deeper, more psychologically scary with a clever story, I'd recommend something else.",The Invisible Man

I took my daughter to see the movie This pass Sunday and right when some action was peeking... the fire alarm went off and we had to leave. We returned yesterday to finish the film and seeing the first half again still had us at the edges of our seats! When I read the synopsis on Fandango, I thought that it ruined the plot of the film but, that wasn't close to being true at all! Having seen a few titles with the same concept, This Invisible Man stood out by far. I absolutely loved the storyline, shot choices, and cast. I am a fan of Elisabeth Moss after watching her performance in this film, she was the perfect choice to convey what the character was experiencing. Some of the major plot twists in this movie were unforeseen and really put this film at the top of my list! The only thing that had me a bit unfulfilled was some of the character's backstories and relationships with each other. Overall, I was really happy about how this movie had hooked me from beginning to end and kept me on the edge of my seat. My kid said she heard that they were working on the next one...I don't personally see how that would happen but, after being blown away from the plot twists, I won't be surprised.",The Invisible Man
1592,jeffdarude,Do NOT watch the trailers!!,7,7 March 2020,"When seeing the trailer numerous times leading up to its release in theaters, it led the impression that it was going to be another typical ""horror"" film, which had to include an old-school monster, in order to have some people in theaters. But, be as it may, this was a surprise, in terms of Blumhouse and the ""Dark World"" cinematic universe that would have died had this not been better than expected.First, Elizabeth Moss was the best actor in the film, being able to accurately portray herself as a battered woman, who have just (literally) escaped an abusive relationship from a sociopath. As the movie progresses, she begins to be losing it, as that's how everyone else sees it, refusing it believe what Cecilia was going through, being tormented by an invisible being at all times. Now, you could see this as typical of this kind of movie, OR this can be used as analysis for how victims of these types of relationships can traumatize them, making them believe that they're never really safe from their abuser. There's a scene where she ""talks"" to Adrian, asking him why did he choose her, stating that the sad reality of him being able to get with any girl, and she was the unlucky one. This might be giving them too much credit, but this is one thing to take away from the movie.Here's the biggest critic of the film that if you've seen the trailer, may have broken the illusion of the main antagonist of The Invisible Man: The Invisible Man. It has been building up this narrative, leading you to think that Adrain was the one who terrorized Cecelia, killed Emily, and kill a bunch of security guards in the second half of the movie. But, it turned out to be his brother that was doing all this. Gasp! And the way they went about it, explaining how he became invisible, albeit cliché, it was a way to modernize the old tale. But, the main issue was that they chose to reveal it in the trailer, spoiling the dynamic of whether or not there was ever any Invisible Man in the first place! It could have just gone with showing Cecilia being seen as crazy, leading both the cast and viewers to think she was just imagining all this, until The Invisible Man actually revealed himself. It seemed they were trying to go that way, as evident by him making cecelia look like he attacked James' daughter. But, the moment you finish seeing the trailer, you knew that- oh, he IS real. Wow. He looks dumb.Still, this review is to NOT discourage you from seeing this movie, it's more of a warning to avoid trailers at ALL TIMES! If I had never seen it, or if they had done a MUCH better job in making it present itself as a thriller, then the intensity and themes of the supernatural would have been retained.",The Invisible Man

Its rather difficult to keep such a story interesting and scary. I mean think about it, how do you make a movie where the audience needs to be frigthend by something that isn't there. That get's boring really fast. This film kinda nailed that. Even tho it was a bit slow at times it never got really boring. The actors did a great job.

1596,elenasalcedoruiz,"Brilliant Acting, wonderful Scenes, perfect Score",8,12 March 2020,"The Invisible Man directed by Leigh Whannell is a remake from a story by H.G. Wells. The movie follows the life of Cecilia Kass, a young woman brilliantly played by Elisabeth Moss. Low key lighting sets the opening scene, where Cecilia is shown sneaking around her luxurious, minimalist, and modern bedroom in the dark. While her partner Adrian (Oliver Jackson-Cohen) sleeps, she rummages for a bottle of pills under her mattress and eventually takes one in the bathroom. We see her walk to her closet, open a secret compartment, and pack a duffel bag. As she continues creeping around in the dark which feels like forever but effectively builds my anxiety through the roof, she mistakenly kicks a large silver dog bowl across the living room, causing a loud commotion and giving the audience a well-placed jump scare. She walks down toward the garage and opens the door only to be surprised by her pet Doberman. Feeling guilty for leaving him behind, she attempts to remove his shock collar however, he bumps into the car setting off the alarm.As she runs down the hill, we continue to get the creepy feeling she will be caught at any moment thanks to the amazing score. Cecilia makes it to a dirt road in search of someone or something. At this point in the film, I was sure her fiancé would catch her and drag her back up the hill. Instead, a woman pulls up in an SUV which we later find out is her sister Emily (Harriet Dyer). Before Cecilia can explain what is going on, Adrian appears out of the pitch-black woods and punches through her passenger window. The women narrowly escape, but Cecilia unknowingly drops her pill bottle on the ground, which Adrian finds.The audience is given a moment to breathe through all the tension, with a view into Cecilia's new life, living at her friend James' (Aldis Hodge) house with his daughter Sydney (Storm Reid). This new environment with warm, cozy, and bright lighting is the perfect scene for a new start. The tension quickly rises again though, as we see how hard it is for Cecilia to literally go outside of her comfort zone. James is there for her, like a comforting bowl of chicken tortilla soup, all while looking stunningly fit and handsome. We know something is coming, we just don't know what.As the day progresses, Emily shows up with some unnerving news. Adrian has committed suicide. This doesn't seem to settle too well with Cecilia, as she is still visibly shaken by the mention of his name alone. Emily assures her this is the best news that can come of the situation, since Cecilia will finally be free. Not only do we learn Adrian is dead, he left his ex a massive amount of cash. This feels like a sick trick from the start, but Cecilia decides to take the bait and accept a meeting with Adrian's brother, Tom (Michael Dorman). With the funds hitting her account, she shows her gratitude to James by purchasing him a new ladder as a gag gift and asks Sydney to check if there's anything at the top. Sydney happily climbs the ladder and discovers an envelope containing information to her new checking account, with funds scheduled to be deposited once a month, enabling her to attend her dream University. Everything is starting to get better piece by piece.Cecilia is getting braver by the day, and able to go outside more often, but she may be seeing things? Why is she so cold and why is the blanket on the floor? Why isn't the blanket moving off the floor? Are those footsteps?! Okay so maybe she appears a bit paranoid. Odd things are happening but not anything drastic or anything she can prove. Just that horrifying feeling she is being watched. So, she trudges forward by attending a job interview which she's prepared for. She brings her portfolio along but embarrassingly her sketches are nowhere to be found. At the interview, she faints, prompting a doctor's visit where we learn she is pregnant. With her progressively bizarre behavior, she starts to alienate her roommates and ultimately, her sister receives a nasty email written from one of her accounts. She's spiraling out of control and increasingly paranoid. There must be a clue or tangible proof to what is happening, so she decides to take an Uber to the house of horrors, aka Adrian's mansion. Walking around this vast, cold place, she discovers a room with a camera and discovers an invisible suit. After placing the suit in the secret compartment in the closet, that horrible feeling of being watched quickly returns, so she jumps back into the Uber and drives off.Thankfully, her sister agrees to meeting her for dinner to discuss her health. The nauseatingly snobby waiter at the LA restaurant prompts a hilarious exchange with Emily, allowing for some comedic relief. As Cecilia attempts to explain the odd things she's experiencing, and how they are linked to Adrian, the audience receives a shocking scare as we watch Emily's throat being slit by a flying knife. Cecilia goes into full panic mode, sitting there like a deer in headlights, frozen with horror as the knife flies into her hand. The rest of the patrons quickly realize what is going on, and scramble to get away from this murderous monster.Poor Cecilia cannot catch a break, as she's thrown into a psychiatric facility. Her friend James, attempts to defend her by interviewing her in a ""safe"" way, trying to see things from her perspective. She continues to talk about Adrian being behind all of this, and how he somehow has managed to become invisible, just adding to her crazy. Fed up with being ignored by everyone, Cecilia knows tonight is the night she will battle it out with Adrian. She forces him to reappear when she wants, by slitting her wrists, therefore placing her unborn child's life in jeopardy. Adrian places pressure on the wound, giving her the perfect opportunity to stab him multiple times, causing damage to the suit. A security guard walks in and gets attacked by Adrian as well as a group of other security guards in the hallway. Whannell makes a point to show us that all of this is caught on the facilities' cameras, perhaps to explain something in a sequel. Cecilia can escape Adrian's grip, for the time being.Desperately needing this to end, she decides to meet with Adrian face-to-face to reconcile. This is the second time in the entire film, that the audience sees Adrian without his suit. He's visibly nervous, almost charming, and decides to order three different entrees for dinner. Cecilia opts for the steak and begins light conversation by asking Adrian to confess to all he's done. Refusing to do so, like a true psychopath, brings Cecilia to tears. She asks to use the bathroom and the next thing we know, Adrian slits his own throat, with the very steak knife he'd given Cecilia. This is all captured on the in-home security cameras, with the final scenes showing Cecilia calling 911 and walking triumphantly out of the house for the final time.",The Invisible Man

1601,peterandoliverhorror,Unseen Presence,8,17 March 2020,"I was reminded of an Iron Maiden lyric when I sat through the atmospheric Invisible Man this past Wednesday. ""I have a phobia that someone's always there"" from Fear of the Dark perfectly sums up the notion this film brings to the table. Fear and suspense are built on what isn't present, and this movie has us searching the entire time for a figure we know we can't see. It is the subtle movements and sudden changes to normal everyday situations that make our heart pump a little faster and our ears prick up to listen in. This movie will certainly make your neck skin crawl as you watch scene after scene with lingering shots and negative dark spaces.Undoubtably, this is a movie about the lingering presence of an abuser. A person who escapes a controlling and abusive monster might find they have layers of damage and paranoia hammered deep into their psyche. A quick look over the shoulder every minute or so, a second or third checking of the lock on the front door, or perhaps a weapon hidden close-by at all times. These are all terrifyingly real scenarios people find themselves in, and so too does our character. Cecilia (Elizabeth Moss) has the added disadvantage of financial reliance on her former prison warden, and that plays a major role in the power he wants to exert over her. It is one of many control mechanisms her former tormentor held over her, but this film shows, rather than tells, us about her past situation. It's a welcome mixture of well-executed shots mixed with natural and believable acting. In short, this film is a win for the genre.While many films in the past years have tried to take advantage of a climate rife with abuse stories and sexual violence, this film engages smartly with the topic and does so without pandering. It is easy to attempt this theme with dollar signs in your eyes, but if there is no understanding in the writing, then it comes down like a house of cards. The titular Invisible Man is genuinely horrific and scary, but this monster is well-grounded in reality. The performance by Elizabeth Moss was both believable and gut wrenching. I was strongly reminded of the desperate performance put forth by Winona Ryder in the popular Stranger Things series. There is incredible depth to her skill set, and because the dialogue seemed so natural, it exerted a strong sympathetic response from the ol' amygdala.The deciding factor that made this film great was not what was on screen or what was said, but just the opposite. What you don't see and what remains unsaid is what stokes the engines of your mental cogs, and so the negative spaces are filled by your own mind's worst cast scenario. For a filmed called the Invisible Man, it does so well with POV shots and odd angles. You're never quite sure if there is something you can't see, or if it is Cecilia's imagination. Naturally there is a point where the imaginary phantom is replaced by an actual one, but you're often guessing and unable to tell where the next scare is coming from, which means you're on edge for most of the film.The only detractors in play for this film are a handful of odd plot holes, and a third act that is less horror and more action, otherwise you're missing out if you don't go see this. This is an adaptation worth the cost of it's recreation, and that is seldom a compliment handed out in the horror genre in general. Bring your ear plugs if you're sound sensitive.",The Invisible Man

First in many years!This film was a good flick. Was it a classic? No. Was it atrocious? No way. Like every single film, there are things that could have been done better. But the film moved, it was ""slow"" and some people are saying. it was not a ""blow it up and make 2020 ""like"" stupid quick satisfaction"" film Elizabeth Moss was very believable in the film. She did a good job in the role. Is she the world's most beautiful? No. But it's not like she is a piece of trash either. The film had some situations that were ""predictable"" for sure. That is expected in almost every film out there. But the film was not like so many of the reviewers are saying. Get this: at 48 minutes I thought: ""if this situation"" (which was with Elizabeth Moss and the young actress playing the daughter getting slapped) is what is going to happen in the rest of the film, I was prepared to ""hate the film""...but it did not continue and I did not hate the film, although from some of the atrocious reviews, I was thinking so. So glad we continued to watch. Don't get me wrong - this is not a classic film but it is in no way a piece of trash or 1 star movie like some of these ""paid haters"" are portraying it. It's ""fake news"" and you no what to do with that.....go with your gut and don't believe the stuff that people who must hate Elizabeth Moss have to say.",The Invisible Man

(Scared to step out of the house, paranoid over hearing noises.) Scenes were directed so immaculately it seemed even I, the viewer, shared Cecilia's paranoia as any uncomfortably lingering shot could be the invisible man himself- you start to look at all the objects in the shot, the details, anything that might hint he's there. Cecilia looks worn out and portrayed as scary by everyone around her throughout the whole film, which adds an extra layer of charisma to her going bad-b at the end, putting the invisible suit on, killing her boyfriend and walking out looking femme fatal and poised; for once she doesn't need men in her life, and for once she is in control, and in fact, in a way this is the first film which shows the targeted female to become the invisible man herself, a big statement on abusive relationships.

1629,benmcneiluk,Gaslighting 101,1,3 May 2020,"This is a terrible movie. Its whole conceit depends upon the audience believing everything our 'protagonist' tells us about her ex partner, despite not being shown anything to evidence it.
She claims she was abused, downtrodden, controlled and exploited, but what do we really see about this in the film to support it? Aside from the opening scene 'chase' there is nothing to connect the boyfriend to any harmful act. Indeed, even after his death her provides a large sum of money to the female lead, ensuring she is taken care of.
At no point do we see the ex-boyfriend in the suit. We have a drug addled scene in the psychiatric ward where the word 'surprise' and 'bang' are heard but these could be hallucinations brought on by stress and Medication.
The female lead is shown to be irrational and prone to bounds of serious emotional imbalance. She acts wrecklessly: drugging someone, setting fire to things, stealing cars.
We see that one single email is enough to have her own SISTER drop her like a hot potato. No questions are asked, the sister just outright tells her to go away and never see her again. This is not what happens to people with a history of normal behaviour.
And as for the ending! We have a police officer complicit in a murder of a man and he allows female lead to get away with it. He HEARS the man's gargled death cry - and we know she is wearing the wire so must be in the room at the time. All in all this film is bad.",The Invisible Man
1630,arockna-42654,Strong start but disappointing end,6,25 May 2020,"The movie starts out strong with a sense of mystery and an atmosphere of dread. The sound design is fantastic with large chunks of silence pierced by deafening sound. A sense of isolation is created pretty well in the early parts of the movie.When the movie needs to progress to the next act it fails. The supporting characters are fairly believable but the protagonist's behavior is at times baffling. It just doesn't feel convincing at all. The end of the movie doesn't feel right. There is no build up to this. It just happens. A longer runtime would have helped.The villain of the movie is invisible but also gains super strength which simply does not make sense. Seems like he could give Dwayne Johnson a run for his money. It also doesn't feel like the characters fighting the invisible man are doing their best to fight him which just makes the whole thing fall flat.Some of the things he gets up to as an invisible person are just not plausible. His reaction speed is godlike. This is most notable in the restaurant scene where I was thinking 'How the hell could he possibly have done that?'. Also seems the protagonist and antagonist are both well trained weapons experts which also makes no sense. These are the kinds of things that are normally setup in a film. If either character at minimum owned a gun it would have been believable. Instead they both steal guns and are pretty great at shooting.The explanation for the invisible man doesn't feel believable in the context of the movie. It's simply... 'he genius, he invisible'. To conclude it's hard to suspend disbelief with this movie. If a little more effort had been put in to setting up the events of the movie it could have been great.",The Invisible Man

1635,JordyV28,Encapsulating right from the start,7,15 October 2021,"Despite not being much for horrors myself, The Invisible Man is enjoyable and most riveting, as it tells the story of a woman imprisoned by an abusive relationship at the hands of her partner. It undoubtedly delivers in capturing the attention of the audience through a gripping plot, escalating suspense, and unexpected twists. Performances of the whole cast are to be highly commended in their changing character circumstances throughout the story. The effortless camera-work and audio are also major focal points for viewer buy-in, using prolonged silent shots of an inanimate environment to elicit the woman's feelings that she is in the physical presence of her partner, despite him being deceased. The film's pacing is also what makes it quite enjoyable, giving the audience less and less relief time from moments of building tension. It is gripping right from the opening scene as the protagonist attempts to escape her partner's house, whilst giving the viewer small pieces of the back story throughout this. Overall, The Invisible Man is, a super interesting story with great cinematography, which would be ideal for watching in a group setting, given the fist-clenching moments of silence and baffling twists... and this is coming from someone who prefers not to watch their horror movies after dark.",The Invisible Man

I rented and watched it with my husband the day that it was released. He reluctantly agreed to watch it with me, as he figured it would end up being just some basic 'woman empowerment' movie. Let me tell you though, within the first 15 - 20 minutes of the movie, he put down his phone and became completely engrossed in the story!!
I'm not going to give anything away, but it captures your attention starting with the opening credits, keeping you on the edge of your seat for the majority of the film, all the way to the shocking ending. And Elizabeth Moss delivers a rollercoaster, and sympathetic, performance.
On a side note: if you've seen Hollow Man with Kevin Bacon, the overall unnerving sense you will feel while watching this movie, is what Hollow Man tried to create, but tragically failed!!",The Invisible Man
1640,samcbird,Why The Invisible Man is A Film for Now,7,15 June 2020,"It seems now more than ever, the film industry is turning to the literary world to find its stories. The big studios feel adaptations is where the money is. So, whenever I sit down to watch a translation of a beloved book to the big screen, I must admit, I'm always sceptical. It is essential to ask the questions; do we need this and do we need it now. For Australian Director Leigh Whannel's sci-fi-horror, The Invisible Man, that is a resounding yes and yes. This smart and timely film takes H.G. Wells classic of the same title and ultimately changes the main characters perspective. Instead of assuming the eye of an invisible man, we follow his victim, here Cecilia Kass (expertly played by Elizabeth Moss.)
The film opens with Cecilia's escape from her abusive boyfriend and optic tech giant Adrian Griffin (Oliver Jackson-Cohen.) After news of his death a few weeks later it seems Cecilia can finally begin to rebuild her new life. However, an inexplicable and invisible presence begins to show itself to Cecilia who struggles to convince those around her of its existence.
We have seen Moss in this role before, I'm thinking of the breath-taking The Handmaid's Tale in particular, a strong yet vulnerable woman battling a dystopic patriarch with force and wit. And she certainly does the role justice here too. Let us not forget that for most of the film she is reacting and even fighting with something that isn't there. Convincing the audience of something that is not there is to the credit of Whannel's direction also. He's experience in the genre (with both the Saw and Insidious franchises under his belt) shows in tense moments of empty hallways and open frames. One of my favourite moments in the film sees Cecilia panting in the cold outside as checks to see if anyone mysteriously opened the front door. Just next to her, literally breathing down her neck, we see the cold breath of the invisible man. Stefano Duscio's photography and the design of the sound department help to sell these moments. The combination of slow measured pans across empty rooms with moments of silence interrupted by ear shattering synthetic booms received many jumps and gasps in the theatre.
But ultimately it is not the filmmaking that makes this film so worthy of your time. It is Whannel's choice to follow the woman instead of the man that makes this an important movie. It is not possible to separate The Invisible Man from the context of its time. The stories of #MeToo, men who after using their positions of power to abuse women are exposed by those same women, sound eerily familiar to the summary given of The Invisible Man. Despite the hybrid of a genre Whannel is working within, he is still able to maintain the seriousness this type of story deserves. It is for that reason I see The Invisible Man as a film adaptation that we need, and one that we need for a film industry of today.",The Invisible Man
1641,bradbakerlol,Stop overthinking and enjoy,9,25 June 2020,"All of the bad reviews are based on missing small details like camera usage, how'd he travel, etc. Perhaps these could have been touched better, but it's almost beside the point. His brother was evidently in on it and there was more than 1 suit, presumably 2, but maybe more. Also, when the mask was taken off, normal skin is shown, so that covers all of the other possible travel and normality in public concerns.
The movie is also held under a short timeline, roughly a few weeks. Sourcing footage can take who knows how long in normal crime investigations.
Shut up and enjoy the movie. It's a movie, not a documentary.",The Invisible Man
1642,robynroper,Disappointed,5,27 June 2020,"There was a lot to like about this movie (Elizabeth Moss) and the premise was ingenious. But the creators squandered whatever benefits they had going for them. A lot of decisions the main protagonist made were just dumb and didn't make any sense. And there where plot holes big enough to drive a truck through. It was extremely frustrating finding myself yelling at the tv ""what the hell did you do that for?"" or ""why didn't she just... "". You get the drift. One example: Cecelia is laying on the floor of her room in James' house where she's staying, crying, when James' young daughter comes in to comfort her. She sits down on the floor at least 5 feet away from Cecelia. Cecelia sits up and smiles and tries to reassure the girl that she's ok. Earlier on, Cecelia had gifted the girl with $10,000 a month for a year to pay for her college tuition so these two were extremely close. Their conversation and their demeanour towards each other is friendly and comforting. Out of the blue, her invisible husband slaps the girl hard across the face. She screams out in shock and pain and James comes running in to see what's happening. His distraught crying daughter then tells her father, ""She attacked me! Keep her away from me!! Cecelia tries to tell James it wasn't her but he believes his daughter. This is what doesn't make sense. Cecelia was sitting on the floor leaning with her back against her bed at least 5 or 6 feet away from the girl. She wouldn't have been able to reach the girl to slap her from that distance away without moving considerably closer to her but Cecelia never moved from her position. The girl was sitting directly in front of her so would have seen if Cecelia had lunged towards her to slap her. Anyone in that situation would have said, it couldn't have been Cecelia that hit me because she was nowhere near me and never made any move towards me. But no, despite all evidence to the contrary the girl still believes it was Cecelia that hit her. Even though logistically it would have been impossible and the fact that Celelia had no motive nor showed even the slightest trace of aggression towards her. The way the daughter was carrying on was just a massive over reaction and seemed very disingenuous. Another time she finds her husbands' phone in the attic of James' house. He'd left a bunch of his and her stuff up there to taunt her. She checks his phone and finds photos he's taken of Cecelia and the daughter asleep in the bed they're sharing, proving that her husband is still around and up to no good. But does she take the phone to show to James that something fishy is going on? Nope. She leaves his phone in the attic. WTAF??? Another thing... In the scene in the hallway of the mental institution where the invisible man is attacking and killing all the guards while Cecelia looks on helplessly, there would have been CCTV cameras everywhere plus guards overseeing tv monitors of different parts of the hospital, proving that Cecelia had nothing to do with the demise of the guards and yet in the aftermath Cecelia is still under suspicion of perpetrating the attacks! It's just ridiculous. And the amount of times her husband let her get away from him when he had the ability to stop her any time he chose. Another time... in the restaurant, after her sister is killed by the husband by putting a knife in Cecelia's hand and forcing her to cut her sisters' throat, she stands up in the middle of a crowded resturant holding a blood covered butchers knife in her hand in the brandishing position. If she had just unwittingly killed her sister in such a shocking and brutal way she would have screamed and dropped the friggin' knife immediately. Not stand up and hold the knife in the air like she's about to stab someone else. It was just ludicrous. It was if the director wanted the characters to behave a certain way and do certain things just to move the plot along regardless if those actions made absolutely no sense. Overall it was a fairly entertaining movie but very sloppily and lazily put together. A waste of Elizabeth Moss' talent.",The Invisible Man

1649,thomassrhoj,Strange Film,5,2 October 2020,"The Invisible Man a film that takes on a story of Cecilia the protagonist who seems to be stalked by her husband 'Adrian' the antagonist. We see as she comes to live with her friend James and his daughters Cidney. The story develops into a psychological horror type story as people seem not to believe her attacks of an invisible man as it become visible to them. This film has many confusing storyline moments within it, especially the ending. This I admire as I enjoy endings where we as the audience have to depict what we think it is about. The themes that are also portrayed within this film aren't done the greatest. For example, the theme of horror is created in a way which a B-Grade horror uses score. The score used in drastic scenes of action seem way too dramatic. The suspense in this film is good though as it doesn't use score too much to support it but at times where it is, it's executed terribly and becomes too basic. One amazing thing this film provides is its beautiful and fantastic use of cinematography. The colour and lightning helps support this with the shots. There are some shots in this film which bring the atmosphere and emotion out very well and that definitely helped me enjoy the film to an extent. The use of animation within this film wasn't the best either. Once the invisibility suit was revealed, I felt as it was very boring and bland and the lead up to this reveal was too anticipated. The storyline is a very a good story. It is something very different and portrays a more psychological thriller to me with aspects of horror. An amazing thing they did well was take the comedy features out of ""horror"" & ""thriller"". This always ruins the mood for these types of films. I felt as Cecilia the character portrayed the best form of emotion & character development. We see as Adrian seems to distraught her mind psychologically and also other characters not understanding what she is experiencing. I felt all other characters in this film were very basic such as James, Emily, Adrian & Tom. None of these characters to me really brought any emotional response or showed any form of character development. Although this review seems quite harsh it's still an okay film.

The timing of scenes did not add up, such as when she threw paint on him and the paint dried up in less then 5 seconds and when Adrian got stabbed the holes were no where to be seen in the next scene. We also never got the explanation on who the invisible man really was. Did Tom take a hit for his brother or was it Tom the whole time. Over all this movie was not horror there was not even a cheesy jump scare.",The Invisible Man

1652,zacherymyers-26495,the unseen villain,6,15 September 2020,"In this movie, the main character Cecilla Kass, who is played by Elisabeth moss, is in an abusive relationship with Adrian Griffen. Griffen commits suicide after Kass's escape and leaves her 5 million dollars. Throughout the film she is terrorized by an invisible figure who is later revealed to be both Griffen and his brother in an invisibility suit. After this is revealed Kass uses the suit to fake her abusers' suicide.
The theme of the film is a classic battle between good vs. evil. This can be seen in the first scene in the move when Kass makes her daring escape from the abusive Griffen. Throughout the film she battles with the thought that her abuser is still alive and trying to convince others of the reality that griffen is not really dead while struggling with her own mental health. This can be seen when kass is committed to the hospital as a result of everyone around her believing that she is indeed insane, unable to cope with the torture that she endured under Griffen.
The film does a good job portraying the villain as present and unable to be seen. In the scene where Griffen attacks Sydney Lanier, the daughter of James Lanier, it is made to look as though Kass hit Sydney. James was letting Kass stay with him and his daughter at the time, and Kass and Sydney had up to this point created a strong bond. This is a key point in the film as everyone around her starts to turn on her and question her mental stability. Also, when griffen uses Kass's phone in order to drive a wedge between her sister, the film does an excellent job of using context and subtle actions in order to alienate Kass from the people that she loves.
Using good lighting and sound techniques the film does a good job of revealing the villain's presence, while at the same time concealing his character.",The Invisible Man

It is frightening for all the wrong reasons, I mean imagine if the security guards walked into the toilets with his suit around his ankles.I would also hate to see what his fluid intake is. How did he brush his teeth and wash, never mind seeing him, could tell where he is from body odour and bad breath.

I've read most of the spoilers that came to my mind while watching (i'll admit that I'm late as far as viewing this movies it's Dec 2020), however, there are a few that aren't mentioned or at least I didn't come across them.(1) Who found Adrian's body and did the police show up to his house? i would assume that Tom's DNA would have been used to verify Adrian's identity if the ME or police couldn't without fingerprints on file, or dental records.(2) Why would Cee's plan include dressing downstairs after escaping the bedroom? Couldn't she have dressed once she safely made it OUT of the house?(3) Why would her sister put the car in park to ask questions when she's driven in the middle of the night to pick up Cee? Wouldn't waiting until they were at an IHOP or Denny's or anywhere where it would have been safe to ask questions been better?(4) How did Adrian gain his wits so quickly after consuming the doage of pills that he'd been given? How did he not know that Cee was in the house tied up by robbers or behind the house nude because someone intended to break in, but was clumsy enough to hit his car and set off the alarm? He automatically knew what was going on after waking up and gave chase through the woods...(5) After Cee knew for a fact that Adrian was stalking her - why did she endagner James and Sydney by staying in their home? After all, they were kind enough to take her in and try to keep her safe.(6) Was Tom on the plan from the start? This was never explained. One could say that he wasn't because he stated that he hated Adrian and was glad that he died, or was he only complict after he found out Adrain was really alive and feared for his life?(7) How could Tom have stored Adrian in a basement and he lived 2 weeks without food or water? If one were to believe the story that Adrian tried to use to pin everything on Tom. Were the police that stupid?I'm not going to address the other plot holes/questions because they have been brought up quite frequently. However, some obviously did not pay attention to the movie. The fire extinguisher was used to put out the fire during the cooking fiasco. Cee said that she would never have peace unless Adrian was completely out of the picture. Would could James have done at the end other than what he did? He knew Cee was a victim, was pregnant, had the invisible suit plus access to Adrian's millions. He didn't have much to work with, did he? After all, there was footage of Adrian slicing his own throat.",The Invisible Man
1667,madishelley,The Invisible Man,8,17 December 2020,"The Invisible Man is about a woman named Cecilia who is trying to escape an abusive relationship with her rich, scientist boyfriend, Adrian. The film's opening scene is Cecilia planned escape, she spiked the boyfriend's water with a drug so that he would sleep heavily and be hard to wake up. With some complications, Cecilia manages to barely escape and was taken somewhere Adrian would not be able to find her. Adrian fakes his own suicide so that Cecilia thinks he is gone, and she is finally free and safe. However, this is not the case, Adrian created a suit that would make him invisible so he could stalk Cecilia and she would not even know it. Until he started leaving hints around for her to start to think he is in fact not actually dead, but no one would believe her.
The theme I picked up on while watching this film is, what goes around comes around. I feel this theme is appropriate because all the abuse and horrible things Adrian did while being the ""invisible man"" came back and bit him in the butt. The scenes that stand out the most to make me feel this is an appropriate theme is when Cecilia meets her sister Emily for dinner to try to explain all the weird things that have been happening to her and that she had proof; well Adrian was there in his invisible suit and before Cecilia could tell Emily everything she knew, Adrian grabbed the knife and cut Emily's throat with it and then placed the knife in Cecilia's hand to make it look like she killed her sister. Well, that is exactly how Adrian gets his life taken. At the end of the movie, Cecilia went over for dinner with Adrian as he wanted to make it up to her and he wants her to take him back. While she was there, she put an invisible suit on and cut Adrian's throat. In this scene they used the angle technique to make sure the security cameras would get this ""suicide"" on camera.
Another part of the movie that supports the stated theme is that Adrian's brother, Tom was in on the invisible man plan from the beginning. He was the one who helped sell the story that his brother committed suicide and he was the lawyer working with Cecilia to get her his life insurance. Later in the movie Cecilia figures out how to defeat the invisible suit so that she can see it and defend herself. She ends up shooting the invisible man multiple times in the chest until he is dead. When she removed the suit from the body it was Tom, not Adrian. Adrian set his brother up to get killed because Cecilia knew where he was going to be. Therefore, Adrian was responsible for two people's death and deserved everything he got that night Cecilia came over for dinner.",The Invisible Man
1668,smartasstoyosi,Like fine wine,8,7 January 2021,"THE INVISIBLE MAN10 times out of 10, the most satisfying movies are the ones you never see coming. This one a little publicised, hardly anticipated retelling of a well told story. Elizabeth Moss gives a deeply engaging performance in this psychological thriller that pleasantly evolves into Science Fiction, and what a journey getting there. Adapted based on the classic 1897 novel by H.G Wells which through several generations has seen iterations on both film and T.V (T.V Series: 1960, 1984, 2000); Film (1933, 1944, 1940, 1992, 2000, 2006 etc), which quite frankly wouldn't today attract much attention due to poorly received movies the last time out (Hollow Man l & II). This one however arrests you like an addict scampering for his next fix while jolting you to some legitimate scares along the way.
It starts off rather briskly, as the story of a woman getting away from a harmful relationship (physical or otherwise) and then slows down to pedestrian levels where we get properly introduced to our central character getting to understand her fears and inhibitions. It's an Elizabeth Moss show through and through and she pulls us into her world of trepidation with her body language and facial expressions without having to say much. The use of screen time for our major characters, and plot progression for this feature is quite efficient, and the acting is neither overplayed nor underplayed but builds anticipation for what we know is coming even though we have no idea how. Aldis Hodge who's character provides a safe haven for our protagonist exudes presence without having to do so much, our boyfriend villain who is the bone of contention in all the unfolding drama ""appearing"" only sparingly (full compliments of a pun intended on ""appear""). This movie works because of how it's told as a simple human drama dealing with sociological situations uniquely embellished with a mystic infusion of Science Fiction, so the emphasis here is on drama rather science. It's a refreshing turn from the usual escapist fare we see all too often and it earns bonus points for being totally unpredictable.
The Invisible Man, directed and screenplayed by Leigh Whannel is proof that studios could inject new life into well worn storys by taking a little step back to think outside the box (focus, simplify and twist) for well balanced, human stories to better, more appealing results and they wouldn't need to break the bank doing so in today's ever increasingly unpredictable market place. A refreshing thrill piece of drama and science fiction, well told, well acted and capped off with some heart pounding suspense.",The Invisible Man

It rolled along with completely unbelievable police actions for example what police agency would use a friend of an accused murderer to investigate and interview the murderer who was a friend staying at his house. These inaccuracy happened many times. When she is locked up in mental hospital and the Invisible man is discovered by security they run into scenes with totally timed accuracy that looks so false but i don't want to get into how bad the Invisible fight scenes looked .I'm pretty sure if an Invisible man was discovered in the way he was then there would be hard covering that up and unimaginable amount of government agencies would be swarming all over the place and anybody with any connection to it. The film just goes on and on in a stupid and ridiculous manner with so much unrealistic behaviour and action by people in jobs that would never act like this and the twist which I will not revile comes in at about 10 minutes to go which adds nothing to the film and looks like the writer or director thought ""I'll just tack that on to add a twist"" .He should have added the twist with more time left .The ending well I will leave that up to you but when you see it do you think The police would act in this way?

I like Elizabeth Moss as an actress, I like the idea this movie sets up: ""what if your psychotic ex became 'magically' invisible, and only you knew about it?"" Great premise; I haven't seen the original iteration so I don't know if a messed up relationship is part of its story, but I'm hooked so far... Then Cecilia turns into 'dumb horror chick' cliche for most of the movie and misses several opportunities to expose the antagonist (who has severely messed her life up without anyone being the wiser) by simply taking tooo long to move, or leaving clean evidence behind. I wanted to rip my hair out the whole way through.. But I had to finish it. The ending was satisfying enough, it just took frustratingly long to get to it. I'm giving it 6 stars because of the acting and effects. I like that the story is about a woman taking back her voice and freedom from an abusive partner but it could've definitely been condensed a bit (too many lingering still shots).Also c'mon... You had photos of you and your friend's daughter asleep that neither of you took, and you didn't immediately send them to your cop friend??? And how did no one hear the glitches and beeps coming from the suit the way she did?? He was in the room with other people at several points in the movie, where they're presumably moving around the space or it's quiet enough to hear him.. I'll entertain the idea though.",The Invisible Man

A couple of scenes are real shockers you would not have expected (without spoiling anything, there's a particular scene that takes place in a restaurant and you will not expect what happens) and an ending that is just awesome and well worth the wait.Clever, cool and worth a watch if you like jump scared and a brooding atmosphere.",The Invisible Man

The movie would have been great if she had ended it right there. Instead it goes on for another half hour, cramming in completely unnecessary plot twists one after another.In the end she kills him in the most predictable way possible and the villain, who is supposed to be a genius and who has been ahead of her every step of the way during the movie, just sits there and lets it happen.

1750,joshkesten710,The more you think about it the more flawed the plot becomes,6,9 March 2020,When leaving the theater I couldn't help but recognize the major flaws of the plot. The true initiating action is the supposed suicide of Adrian (the invisible man) which later is revealed to be not true. This in itself would be nearly impossible. The show a photo of his dead body which arguably could be staged but when it comes to that how could his death be verified without a body. The brother could not have possible controlled the process of proving his death when there was no body for the police to see. Or if there was a body are we supposed to believe cops would not be able to recognize if he was still alive or at least been in possession of is body. Though there are several other examples of flaws such as the insanely fast quick change ability of Cecilia at the end into the invisibility suit and back out of it all before he was able to bleed out all without making a noise. Also how could she have managed to get to the part of the house with the suit in that time. In the end although this movie does a great job at truly kicking off a dark universe it's plot holes are hard to ignore.,The Invisible Man

Most films these days have silly dialogue or the characters do stupid things that knock me out of the movie, but not here. Dialogue was sharp and realistic, and the movie kept up great suspense.
Universal studios had planned to do a Monsterverse with all the famous monsters, but when The Mummy under performed, they decided to change course and paired up with horror factory Blumhouse to make a real horror movie. Above all, it was unique. HIGHEST RECOMMENDATION.

I went in with pretty high expectations and they were exceeded. The story is really interesting, it's well paced, I can't think of any extraneous scene. It evokes a certain type of terror that you don't see often and it really succeeds. I felt so much of what Elizabeth Moss' character was feeling thanks to her acting but also the directing really plays up the fear of the unknown and empty spaces. My muscles were sore afterwards because I was so tense the entire movie. The trailers definitely tell a lot but there is still a lot you won't expect so it didn't really spoil too much. Probably one of the most suspenseful movies I've ever seen.

The first half of the movie was good and definitely suspenseful with the 'fear you can't see' vibe. Anxiety inducing for sure. Then came the second half.The jumping of the shark was the sister being killed, how could that go unseen? Among all the other massive continuity errors, the cellphone in the addict, the suit in closet, her bruises from him beating her up in the kitchen and explain to me how she hit the daughter while she was laying on the ground?I literally didn't even finish the movie because I couldn't keep watching. One hour in and I was looking to see how much longer it was on for because I was confused why it kept going. If this movie was 30 mins shorter with the excessive about of extra and over the top stuff taken out, it would have been better.I wanted to like this movie but it is just so ridiculous and outlandish that it is almost unwatchable to anyone who actually pays attention and watches the movie.

1758,user-8-37895,"A clever, unique and anxious horror",8,29 February 2020,"For a premise that can easily come off as cheesy and cheap, the Invisible Man steps in the right direction to take itself seriously. Leigh Whannel channels his inner horror to induce anxiety and fear with very little cheap jump scares which is effective for modern horror films today. The story deals with thematic abuse with the strong performance from Elizabeth Moss making you invested and sympathetic. She keeps you on the edge of your seat right from the very beginning. The great use of camera work and sound (or little thereof) keep your eyes glued to the screen. The only faults with the film would be some of the script choices, making you wonder ""would that actually happen?"", or ""would this person actually do that?"" But that only merits the serious tone of the film.Overall, great performances and production, keeping you invested from beginning to end with solid pacing",The Invisible Man

1762,zackari23,Must see for those who love plots propelled by characters making poor decisions,2,9 March 2020,"If you love seeing movies where the plots are 100% dependent on characters omitting huge chunks of critically important explanation from dialogues that any reasonable person would bring up as their first points of discussion in such situations then this could be the movie for you.""Go to his basement & you will see that he has a bunch of inventions & devices down there, i can work out the code to the locked doors down there"" (which she later proves) ""Down there you will find evidence that he is able to make himself invisible."" ... at about the 10 minute mark this piece of critical information is - for absolutely no explainable reason - omitted from a discussion in which Cecilia is desperately trying to prove that she is at enormous risk. This one sentence, which any idiot who was in such a position of terrifying risk would immediately say, would change the actions of everyone around her & result in none of the remaining actions of the film occurring.The film also features character attributes being developed - eg. intelligence, clarity of mind under pressure etc - & then arbitrarily abandoned at later points in the film to once again allow the plot to continue.Security cameras seen in shots which would have definitely captured footage of the titular character are not reviewed - or even mentioned - by people casting doubt around his existence. Yet later in the film a security camera is used as a pivotal plot device.10 or more men are beaten - some even killed - by the invisible man in a high security state hospital & still the cop who is wrapping this all up (who also was himself beaten by an invisible man who was then shot in his living room revealing the suit etc) is all like ""you shot the suit so it doesn't work now - there will still be doubts about your innocence"" etc.Also, as another reviewer wrote - in any film set in modern times that features smartphones (as this film does) if you don't explain why a smartphone was not used in any situation where it could be that is effectively a plot hole. She pours coffee all over the ground, even throws paint on him, but at no point thinks to use the phone that she has in her hand to film him?She also gets his phone in her hand, found in the house she is staying in after he is meant to be dead. She finds photographs on that phone of herself sleeping in that very house - which would unequivocally prove that someone had been there - & she just pops it back down on the floor & leaves it. Not in her pocket to show someone later.Etc etc.I know that it is a work of fiction & does ask that we suspend our disbelief but this shouldn't apply to how characters ought to behave. It felt like very lazy script writing. There were some good moments of tension & suspense but all in all i was honestly left wondering why Elizabeth Moss agreed to do it.",The Invisible Man

1769,derek-76145,The movie was its own worst enemy. It failed in execution of the details.,2,16 July 2020,"Over and over the characters made implausible choices, or the details had serious errors which detracted too much from being able to watch the movie and enjoy it.For instance, when Cecilia drops a can of paint on the invisible man: moments later Griffin has cleaned his whole suit in the kitchen sink and is invisible again. Apparently the writers have never had to clean wet paint off of anything because this was way too quick, especially that the suit is full of crevaces... it would have been better for Griffin to leave for the night and come back later...Cecilia's sister is overwhelmingly invested in helping Cecilia, but when she receives the email, she's completely turned on Cecilia. It's unbelievable that the sister would turn that quickly. Instead of that forceful of a turn and removing herself from Cecilia's life, the sister should have just said she needed space. This would have been a more believable response, still alienating Cecilia without making the reaction unbelievable.Cecilia escapes the mental ward of the detention center through an unlocked stairwell door... Again implausible. She should have grabbed keys and. Leaving out a 5 second spot ruined the scene. Then when she's running around the parking lot there's only two guards after her despite the multiple guards she passed exiting the movie. These guards too are so far behind her that she can walk casually between cars. These guards would have been hot on her tail. Then, the second guard is no where in sight when Griffin is firing at the first guard. They seem to have disappeared just like the invisible man himself.Wounds sustained by the invisible man don't seem to follow from scene to scene. He was stabbed by Cecilia, but those wounds never seem to follow into next scenes. Then in the last scene of the movie where she's sitting at the table, it would have been easy for her to touch him where she stabbed him, just to verify one of his many wounds he should have still been healing from.After Griffin's brother Tom is killed, and it's been revealed that Adrian Griffin is still alive, the police simply believe that Tom did it all himself... Despite it being apparent that Adrian is still alive. Everyone seems to forget that Adrian faked his own death. This would have been impossible for Tom to pull off on his own. Meanwhile the police don't seem at all interested in the fact that Adrian Griffin is still alive. Again, totally implausible choices on behalf of the characters made the movie unenjoyable.Things like this happened over and over again in the movie.",The Invisible Man

Although, the film dealt with a few logical issues, and inconsistencies in screenwriting, especially during the second half. But the brilliance in filmmaking and performances compensates for it. Am excited to see what Leigh Whannell does next.",The Invisible Man
1777,startcameracut,Tests your patience,4,10 April 2020,The movie starts with an amazing thriller headstart but falls flat very soon with so many logical compromises and a dull screenplay.,The Invisible Man
1778,KolbyToldMe,Best Horror of the Year!,9,29 February 2020,"Leigh Whannell has injected a shot of refreshing energy and smarts to the Horror Genre yet again like he did way back with James Wan's ""Saw"". ""Invisible Man"" is crazy smart! It employs a DOMESTIC TERROR that is truly horrifying not solely because of the impeccable sound design or the rising tension, but the gripping trauma a strong woman must endure to escape a vile predator. If you were a fan of Whannell's 2018 film, ""Upgrade"" you'll be equally as delighted with the SciFi action thrills to be had in this movie too. The production design is great. There's cool shots where the camera plays with space on screen that constantly puts you on edge. A legit STELLAR 10 min or so opening that will instantly hook you. And, what more can be said of the performance from Elizabeth Moss?
A WHOLE LOT.
This trend of GREAT contemporary Horror movie performances from incredible actresses is bolstered by a haunting take from Moss that's Award Worthy.",The Invisible Man
1779,Sarcastadox,Just watch Hollow Man instead.,4,7 March 2020,"I don't know what to say about this movie... people are raving about it, and it's Apparently #1 right now at the box office, but it seemed to me that there wasn't enough Kevin Bacon in this film.Seriously though...this movie is neither as good, nor as bad as the reviews are indicating.It's somewhat entertaining if you can suspend disbelief and just go with it, but it does have some serious flaws.I'd say go see it, but don't complain about wasting your time and money when it kinda sucks.I haven't seen Hollow Man in 19-20 years, and I remember very little about it, but I guarantee that it is superior in every way to this film.",The Invisible Man
1780,kostasskour-24878,Ridiculous,2,11 February 2021,The movie takes a good idea and ruins it. The plot convenience is irritating. Common sense is totally absent even for that kind of a story. A child's reason would be enough to ruin the plot. I do not recommend.,The Invisible Man
1781,aabut,borefest,1,22 June 2021,"After watching this movie with fastforwarding all through it, i can honestly say i will never trust metascore ratings. Hated almost every minute. Full of cliches and mistakes. This thing stole my 1 hour.",The Invisible Man
1782,williamesco,Plot holes upon plotholes,4,26 September 2020,"This movie feels like it was written by a 10 year old, not to mention the amateur special effects that went in to it. How this got such a good rating is beyond me",The Invisible Man

1784,markbeaudet,Entirely Predictable,3,6 August 2020,"This movie has a second grade cast. There is not a single ""scary/horror"" scene nor any suspense. Too bad Redbox doesn't give refunds. Universal should be embarrassed to have their name on this so called film.",The Invisible Man
1785,joelamp-01285,"Anxiety-ridden, on the edge of my seat, in a good way",9,14 March 2020,Constant terror for me throughout. It was very consistent with its thrills and never failed to make me jump in each scene. It was extremely frustrating to watch but overall a fantastic movie that I never want to see again.,The Invisible Man
1786,myheartbeats-55470,My Invisible Money,3,4 July 2020,"This was God-awful. Terrible acting, totally predictable storyline, and way too long. I want my $4.99 back from Netflix.
I saw spot-on recreations of parts of ""The Terminator,"" ""Hollow Man,"" ""Sleeping With The Enemy,"" and more. That's the only reason I gave it a 3; it was funny to suddenly be confronted with the memory of Sarah Connor in a completely different movie.
If you really want a suspense movie, go somewhere else. If you want a wanna-be scary with occasional laughable moments, wait till it's free, then give this POS a watch.",The Invisible Man
1787,yarrymanc,Scary,9,27 June 2020,Excellent up to date view of the invisible man. Kept me on the edge of my seat. Elisabeth Moss is perfect in this role,The Invisible Man

1793,stormin-41569,Great Movie!,10,1 March 2020,This is a well-made movie with great acting. It is an edge of your seat thriller in the vein of the old Alford Hitchcock movies. Loved it!,The Invisible Man

1799,hafizzaha,Outstanding!!,9,14 March 2020,I never watch neither heard about Elizabeth Moss.. But man.. She is so good. I always thought she is new Jodie Foster (watch panic room/flight plan). U will never want to take your eyes elsewhere.,The Invisible Man
1800,qhondaexe,Absolutely surprising!!,9,5 June 2020,One of the best thrillers I ever seen. At the beggining it's kind of predicting the Cecilia's supposition about the killer's true but that doesn't take the element of surprise at most of the movie.,The Invisible Man

1802,jimthaler,Just another bad horror/thriller film,2,26 April 2020,"Wow! Extremely predictable. There were too many badly played out situations and plot mistakes to make this film worth the time.
The only reason I did not give it a ""1"" is the acting was marginal.",The Invisible Man

1804,marymcconalogue,Connection with real life horror,10,1 March 2020,"My son hauled me out reluctantly to watch this movie.
As a woman in her 60s with much experience of life/ relationships and what can turn into a nightmare - l applaud everyone in the making of this film.
What a social commentary on domestic violence.
Many parts l hid behind my hand over my eyes!
I just couldn't bear to watch.
I worked in a safe refuge for women and their children.
This film delivers a palpable sense of looking behind you.
This film delivers the terror of being stalked by an ex partner.
This film delivers authentic reality of what it is like to be hunted by an ex partner/ husband.
Great connection with my adult son on drive home about care of women/ manipulative behaviour, domestic violence.
We talked about personal and cases of domestic violence in our country and world wide.
Safe houses are vital for women.",The Invisible Man
1805,vicmil-21972,Longest few hrs of my life,4,24 March 2020,This film is very dark and throughout and rambles . Odd bits of action I was constantly waiting for it to start. May trigger people who are in an abusive relationship such as this.,The Invisible Man
1806,mahichowdhuty,Not good,2,27 March 2020,Wastage of time. Nothing compared to the original invisible Man movie,The Invisible Man
1807,pandapowerz,Such an impressive movie... at first glance.,6,10 April 2020,"You watch the movie, you take a deep breath and say ""Wow, there was hard work in it."" Then you take another breath and the oxygen flows through your brain and you start questioning what you have just watched. There was no palpable plot. We have absolutely no clue that the guy was abusing the girl but her words. And the guy gets killed in the ending for nothing. You pity on that girl, everyone thinks she's crazy, but then you find out she really is. And you can talk about the characters like they're no one, because there's no character development. I didn't feel attached even very little to characters. You don't feel what they feel, you don't understand what their purposes are doing something. Yes, it's thrilling to see (actually not see) there's an invisible man there moving unpredictably trying to kill people and the sound effects are to good that they give you the feeling he is there, but everything happened in the movie becomes meaningless when you see the ending. It's like watching few short movies combined in one whole movie. Characters change their attitude so fast with no reason, they sometimes act like they don't have the ability to think, which means the writers thought we're stupid enough to overlook what does not make sense, which is one of the few things a writer should absolutely not do.I'm not going to go over every illogical scene but few things are prepossesing me. Like we see the weather forecast on the TV and we think it's something important. I personally waited for the girl to watch the ground to see where raindrops are not falling so she could find the invisible man but no, it's just nothing. It was just there to make their conversation dramatic (!). It wouldn't be a problem if it was just raining, like you may want the scene to look cinematic but if you show us something on purpose, like ""Hey, look at this, this will become important!"" we wait to see what it will affect. It's just the ""rifle hanging on the wall"" thing.And same goes for the card lawyer pulled out of his bag which said ""Don't draw on the table, use the paper."" I thought it was a message for Cesilia first, then I believed it was Adrian controlling his brother, but in the end I can't decide what it actually is. The final scene asked so many new questions and didn't answer any of them. It pretends to answer with a few ""clever"" lines but it actually doesn't, just confusing.So you can watch it, you can have fun but it's definitely not the best thriller of the year.",The Invisible Man
1808,investsuccess,"Great suspense, action, music, story",10,4 March 2020,"I enjoyed the movie so much, scary/nervous from beginning til end. Definitely best movie this year so far.It's sci-fi thriller not horror movie, so perfect for me.",The Invisible Man
1809,nickclarson,Not worth watching twice,3,14 September 2020,"Maybe okay watching one time, but has very little rewatchability. Went in with no expectations and the beginning wasn't too terrible, but the plot holes kept adding up. Lack of character development and too much telling instead of showing. Hardly evening scary for a horror film.",The Invisible Man
1810,sandibriggs,Wild Ride,8,29 February 2020,"I asked my husband if he liked it when we left the theater and he said ""I felt tense the whole time."" That's a good thing in this scenario...You have read enough reviews to know the story but, believe me, not every cast could have pulled this off...Elizabeth Moss is an incredible actress and her emotions and terror felt real. The supporting cast were amazing (and not at all hard on the eyes!) I didn't ""see"" the abusive ex until more than halfway through the film and although I also hadn't heard much about him, I found him terrifying. The score was excellent although a little loud for us (we're old! :)) It really helped to build the tension. I loved this movie and would see it again...I'm not a huge fan of violence but it was appropriate to progress the story...Just know that this is not for anyone under 18 in my opinion...It's quick, but it's graphic....All in all, highly recommend for thrill seekers and fans of psychological dramas....",The Invisible Man

And this movie is no different revealing the entirety of the movie from start to finish in 2 minutes. After watching the movie the trailer just reinforced what i already thought.

And everything changed.The opening few scenes and escape weren't bad. But, it only went downhill from there. Secondary characters that had nothing of importance to do in the film, forced conflict between character we know too little about to give a crap. And one incredibly stupid decision by the main character that could have brought the whole story to an end long before it did.The invisibility suit effects were pretty good however, and that is pretty much this films only redeeming quality, that and the dog (I love dogs) are the only reasons this film even gets the 2 stars I have given it.If you have a mind for logic, and any need for intelligent characters, give this one a miss.",The Invisible Man
