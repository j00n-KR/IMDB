0,MartinHafer,"Too much action, too many stunts...yet still an interesting story idea.",7,22 February 2018,"There are currently almost 2800 reviews on IMDB for this film....and so what I have to say about the movie really isn't all that important. It also is one of the highest rated films ever on IMDB. And, so much has been said about the film, I think I'll be rather brief.The plot involves a guy who learns that nothing be sees or does is real...and that the world is nothing like anyone thinks. This is because in the dystopian future, machines keep folks in pods and they live out their lives in a phony existence.The film's story is interesting...and very existential. I like that aspect of it very much. But the film has a weakness for me and I am sure some other folks might feel the same way...there is just too much action. The film is one scene after another after another--with lots of action, violence and CGI...so much that it boggles the mind. For me, that left me rather tired when the film was over. I liked it...but I also didn't want any more and can't see me watching any of the sequels.",The Matrix
1,TheLittleSongbird,A sci-fi action thriller milestone,9,20 February 2017,"'The Matrix' may not be one of the very greatest examples of its genre (like '2001', 'Metropolis', 'Blade Runner', 'Back to the Future', 'Star Wars Original Trilogy', 'Alien' and 'Aliens'), but that it is revolutionary in how its visuals and use of sound broke boundaries like had never been done before cannot be denied.It is not a film to be seen if people want character depth or relationship depth, with the forced and underdeveloped love subplot between Neo and Trinity being 'The Matrix's' sole weak spot. This ended up not being that huge a problem for me because everything else is so well executed.Particularly striking about 'The Matrix' is its production values. Simply put, the film looks amazing in its audacious production design, dazzling special effects that are some of the most ultra-cool and imaginative to exist, super slick editing and often jaw dropping cinematography. So much more than a film with ground-breaking special effects and use of camera work that broke boundaries.Use of sound was also striking, and how the pulsating and hypnotic music score was used. Andy and Larry Wachowski direct adeptly, while the script is an intelligent mix of complex and well-explored themes, mysticism, philosophy and even Lewis Carroll and the story is often invigorating and intensely taut with a smart concept brilliantly done.Action is superbly shot and edited, and the way it is choreographed is relentlessly intense and breathless in its energy, Kung Fu has rarely been more vertigo-inducing (despite how this sounds, this is not a bad thing as it added hugely to the intensity and paranoia of the story's atmosphere) on film.Keanu Reeves is in one of his best and most iconic roles and has never looked cooler, certainly has not looked this comfortable for a while before then. Carrie Anne Moss is strong. Even better are an imposingly charismatic Laurence Fishburne (also in one of his best roles), an amusing Joe Pantoliano and a deliciously wicked Hugo Weaving.Summing up, not one of the best of the genre but a mile-stone nonetheless and a great one. Followed by two sequels, both nowhere near in the same ball-park. 9/10 Bethany Cox",The Matrix
2,Leofwine_draca,Effects-fuelled sci-fi extravaganza,9,26 August 2016,"What is THE MATRIX? Well, let me tell you: it's a crowd-pleasing science fiction adventure, which took audiences by surprise as it came out of nowhere and totally destroyed the year's other big sci-fi epic, THE PHANTOM MENACE. The reason for its success is quite obvious when you look at it. The film isn't just about special effects, although they do play a big part; it also has a rather complex and classic sci-fi set up. While STAR WARS was all bad special effects and little else, THE MATRIX is all good special effects and a lot more besides.Okay, so there are some obvious flaws: a lack of originality for one; the real futuristic world looks like something out of BLADE RUNNER and there are bits out of DARK CITY thrown in too. The story, too, once it has been set up, is dropped in favour of some increasingly outlandish action sequences. But when these action scenes are fantastic, then you just don't care. After all, I watch a film to be entertained, and fighting and explosions are the simplest source of entertainment around.The actors and actresses in the film are all okay, although you have to wonder if Carrie-Anne Moss was picked simply because she looks good in PVC. No matter, as it's left to Keanu Reeves in his best role for some time, to carry the film. While he may not be much of an actor (the sheer awfulness of his performance in BRAM STOKER'S Dracula is hard to forget), he just about manages to make his role as a mild-mannered computer operator who becomes a heroic saviour believable. Thankfully, there is some heavyweight support from Laurence Fishburne as the imposing leader of the rebels, and a wonderfully villainous performance from Hugo Weaving as the slimy villain. The costumes are great too - stylish leather and sunglasses making up the main attire.The film is not really about acting, though, or story. It's the special effects which make this, well, special. Without them, it would just be another average tale, but these CGI effects are truly outstanding, even on the small screen. For once, they do fit into the context of the story as well, as they are computer effects in a computer generated world. THE MATRIX has brilliant CGI, and has to join the ranks of TERMINATOR 2, JURASSIC PARK, and INDEPENDENCE DAY as a film which really sets the ever-changing standard on which all other films are to be based.Bullets fly in slow-motion, leaving trails in the air; characters can spin in the air, climb walls and jump huge distances; computer-generated villains morph into other people at will, fights are impossibly fast. Indeed, it is the fight scenes which are the most memorable, as they come across as a hybrid of the classic kung fu genre and the very best of style master John Woo. The best moments are the Fishburne/Reeves training fight, the moment where Reeves takes on Agent Smith in a subway, and the lobby shootout where plaster literally flies everywhere. You also have to love the ending, where Reeves finally wins over the baddies and manages to stop bullets mid-flight with his bare hand. A great image, just one of loads in this great film which has to be one of my favourite sci-fi films of the decade.",The Matrix
3,SnoopyStyle,Ultra cool sci-fi,9,9 November 2013,"The Wachowski brothers have created one of the more interesting sci-fi world. Neo (Keanu Reeves) is a computer hacker who has a nagging intuition that the world is wrong. He is literally Alice who goes down the rabbit hole and finds his world is actually Wonderland. It marries Lewis Carroll with HongKong Kung Fu wirework and the back trenchcoat. They invent bullet time and amp up the cool factor in gun fights.The story borrows heavily from a lot of different sources. Machines have taken over. The world is a computer construct. People fight using computer avatars. These are all ideas that have been done before. The Wachowskis have weaved it all together into a functional tapestry.But it is ultimately the cool visuals that makes this movie unique. For a relatively lower big budget, the production value is incredible. They have squeezed every movie magic out of all the visual and computer effects.",The Matrix
4,Hitchcoc,Wow! I Finally Saw It!,9,20 August 2019,"This is one of those movies that ""everyone"" has seen, except me. I tried to watch it with some friends about fifteen years ago, but they had two kids under five years old and I was only able to ingest it in five minute increments. So a friend lent me the video and I finally got a chance to see it. It's a pretty remarkable film. The premise of an alternative reality works here where it often fails. Keanu Reeves is a sort of messiah, not by his own choosing originally. He has been attacked and abused by men in sunglasses whom, we find out later, are a part of a representation of Artificial Intelligence. The side Neo ends up on are the original humans whose ranks have been nearly driven to extinction. Laurence Fishburne is the leader of the rebels and he believes the the Reeves character is ""the One."" I thoroughly enjoyed it but would have like a little more creative final scene. Too many shell casings. Apparently, weaponry didn't advance much in twenty years. But, it keeps one on edge with its special effects and its non-stop action.",The Matrix
5,Horst_In_Translation,Good? Yes. Groundbreaking? Not really.,6,29 November 2014,"15 years ago, back in the 20th century, the first of so far three Matrix films was released. It runs for roughly 2 hours and 15 minutes and was directed by the Wachowski brothers Andy and Lana (still Larry back then). The film stars Keanu Reeves with supporting performances by Carrie Anne Moss, Laurence Fishburne and Hugo Weaving.I cannot say I didn't enjoy this film as I really liked it to some extent, but I was not wowed either, maybe because science fiction is not exactly my favorite genre. My biggest problem was possibly Reeves in the lead role. I just fail to see him as a guy who brings the necessary toughness for his character here and in any other action movie. All this praise about him being the chosen one made me cringe occasionally. The dialogs about him being so grand were sometimes downright cheesy and same goes for the explosions coming with the final kiss between Reeves' and Moss' characters. Another criticism I had was the Oracle being wrong. She was presented as a know-it-all authority and in the end her prediction is simply disregarded with the explanation, Neo has to find his way and then he is the chosen one if he chooses to be. Oh and the song during the closing credits did not match my taste at all.What I did like about the film were basically all the supporting players, especially Fishburne and Moss also. The helper-turned-villain was creepy in his big scene and Weaving was a revelation. His antagonist really makes the film and the film was at its best during the scenes he was in. The camera shot with Weaving before the subway train runs over him was certainly the best shot of the movie, maybe the whole trilogy. His parallel on humans being the real virus of the planet makes you wonder too if he is maybe right. Other than that, I liked the pill reference from ""Alice in Wonderland"" early on and the green code on black ground is certainly memorable and immediately associated with this film.Finally, I would like to say that I recommend this movie, especially to sci-fi lovers although they probably have seen it already anyway. It is not a film I really want to rewatch anytime soon, but it starts okay and gets better during the second half. I don't think the second and third Matrix films are much worse, but that is maybe because I don't consider the first a masterpiece. All three are solid. ""The Matrix"" won four technical Academy Awards, all four categories where it was nominated. It's no ""Return of the King"", but still an admirable achievement.",The Matrix
6,Prismark10,Life in reality,7,28 March 2016,"What made The Matrix special was the ground breaking visual effects such as 'Bullet Time' that have been often imitated in other films and video games. The Wachowski's simply knocked it out of the park.Keanu Reeves is Mr Anderson an ordinary computer programmer by day and secret hacker called Neo at night who is suddenly pursued by government agents led by a sinister Agent Smith (Hugo Weaving) after he is contacted by computer hacker Morpheus (Laurence Fishburne.) Morpheus believes Neo is the 'One.' Humans lives in a false reality that controls humans and Neo will lead the harvested humans to rebel against the machines creating the false reality.The film mixes cyberpunk science fiction with Hong Kong style martial arts and elements of Japanese manga type animation as inspiration.Keanu Reeves is in his element is a world where he does not understand the world around him. He looks cool and does well in the martial arts sequences. I guess revisiting this genre made up for the failure of Johnny Mnemonic.Laurence Fishburne is even more cooler as Morpheus guiding Neo in this hostile new reality and how to take down the system. Carrie-Ann Moss is kick ass sexy in black leather as Trinity who displays superhuman powers.The film has philosophical underpinnings as the Wachowski's ask us to thing about the world around us and our existence within it.The film is cool, it is hip but I felt slightly too long and little bit to po faced. However the Wachowski's did manage to catch lightning in a bottle which they did not manage to do with the sequels.",The Matrix
7,kosmasp,Blender,9,21 July 2009,"The Wachowsky Brothers took many elements, from different cultures, that they liked, put them in a blender and mixed them together. And the Matrix is what came out. A great sci-fi movie, that has many elements from other movies (and a theme we have also seen in horror movies), put well together.While I'm not a big Keanu Reeves fan, he does convince here (as he did in Speed). So while he is in action territory, there is always fun to be had with him. Carrie Ann Moss and Laurence Fishburne have a great supporting roles, although of course it is a more stylish adventure than anything else. And while the movie leaves open quite a few questions you might have, it works for the movie, being only told a minimum amount of plot. The Keanu Reeves character acts as the viewer as he is thrown in an unknown world. Being baffled and stunned by the whole thing, this might be the reason his casting works so good ...Apart from that, the action is amazing (Yuen Woo-Ping, very well known for his Asian/martial arts choreography's), the set pieces and the dystopia feel of the movie is pretty convincing ...",The Matrix
8,classicsoncall,"""...there's a difference between knowing the path... and walking the path"".",9,25 September 2011,"I saw this movie when it first came out, and can't really grasp the idea that an entire decade has gone by since then. Watching today, it still holds up as an exciting sci-fi action thriller, with effects that still look relatively new even though many of them have been copied and even parodied since. I have to admit, time travel, dream stories and virtual reality films can leave you with your head hurting a bit, but if you watch this one attentively, you'll find that it was cleverly written leaving very little wiggle room for plot holes to creep through.Essentially, 'The Matrix' is a computer generated dream world which replaced the 'real' world that was destroyed at some point during the twenty second century in a battle between humans and an artificial intelligence. The AI won, and subsequently created an entire race of machines feeding off the living energy of humans kept alive in a state of suspended animation. The very few humans still alive wait for the day that 'The One' will destroy the Matrix and free those under it's control. To protect itself, The Matrix has created a race of machines called Sentinels who track down humans, be it in the real world or in The Matrix itself. This can all get a little confusing, so it's best to take this all in with no distraction, because things move back and forth between the two realms rather quickly.If you really want to take the concept of the picture a step further, there's plenty here to dissect and analyze. For some, the religious and philosophical elements conveyed by The Matrix and The One are quite overt. One of the immediate thoughts that struck me was the parallel of The Matrix to The Force in ""Star Wars"", an eternal and universal life energy that unites all living creatures. The One can be interpreted as The Savior, the Redeemer of Mankind who will set all of humanity free from the curse of original sin, or in this case, the slavery of the pods. I guess if you're skeptical of this philosophic/religious connection, this will all be a lot of mumbo-jumbo, but to me it's a lot more interesting to look at it that way than just seeing a bunch of special effects involving insane martial arts moves and time stopping bullets in flight.What I didn't care for so much was the make up of the Sentinels, not the human ones but the machines. Personally, I thought Hugo Weaving was great as Agent Smith in his relentless pursuit of Neo. But the idea of those squid-like battle ships attacking the Nebuchadnezzar seemed to defy a certain logic. Wasn't Zion, the last human city located underground? The concept of The Oracle also catches one a bit off guard as well. I mean, my idea of an Oracle, who was supposed to know everything about The Resistance since the beginning, wasn't exactly that of an old woman who smokes cigarettes and bakes cookies. This introduction of a bit of whimsy might have been intriguing to the Wachowski Brothers, so if that's the case, I guess I can go along with it.Anyway, I like the idea of The Matrix and I like the movie. I can't say as much about the sequels, and it's been some time since I've seen those as well. I'll get around to them again eventually.",The Matrix
9,lee_eisenberg,"Watch the original, but not the sequels.",8,21 October 2005,"When ""The Matrix"" first came out, it looked like another cheap action flick, but turned out to be quite good. The premise suggests that everything that we see in life is false, and that we're all prisoners of something called the Matrix. So, software designer Thomas ""Neo"" Anderson (Keanu Reeves) is hired by rebel Dr. Morpheus (Laurence Fishburne) to break away from society. Lots of impressive things ensue.""The Matrix"" was overall a good movie, but would have been better without all the violence. Still, the movie's a classic, with great support from Carrie-Anne Moss, Hugo Weaving, and Joe Pantoliano. Avoid the ridiculous sequels.",The Matrix
10,jboothmillard,The Matrix,10,23 June 2005,"From writers, producers and director Andy and Larry Wachowski, aka The Wachowski Brothers (Bound) this was, and still is a milestone with imagination and digital effects technology. Basically Thomas Anderson (Speed's Keanu Reeves) lives an ordinary life as a computer programmer by day, and by night as a malevolent hacker known as Neo. Then one day he finds himself warned by Trinity (Memento's Carrie-Anne Moss) and chased by police and agents. Thomas has always questioned the reality he lives in, but when he eventually meets like-minded Rebel warrior Morpheus (Boyz n the Hood's Laurence Fishburne) the truth is revealed far beyond his imagination. Morpheus tells him he has been living in the artificial reality world of The Matrix, basically everything we see, hear, feel etc is a big program, and the human race are all slaves. Anyway, Thomas, now mainly known as Neo is woken into the real world, a ravaged wasteland with most of humanity captured by the race of machines that live off their body heat and imprison their minds in The Matrix. Neo is taught all about The Matrix, the real world and more importantly trains him to go back into The Matrix to battle with the agents, including leader Agent Smith (The Lord of the Rings' Hugo Weaving), who are super powerful computer programs dedicated to snuffing out Neo and the entire human rebellion. The Oracle (Gloria Foster) at one point in the film told Neo he was not ""The One"" like Morpheus says, but of course this was to boost his confidence to make him believe more, and confirm that he actually is. Also starring Memento's Joe Pantoliano as Cypher, Belinda McClory as Switch, Julian Arahanga as Apoc, Matt Doran as Mouse, Marcus Chong as Tank, Paul Goddard as Agent Brown, Robert Taylor as Agent Jones and Anthony Ray Parker as Dozer. The action and stunts are fantastic, the actors are all well cast, the use of colour (to remind you where you are particularly) is impressive, it is just an unmissable action thriller film for science-fiction fans. It won the Oscars for Best Editing, Best Sound Effects Editing, Best Visual Effects and Best Sound, and it won the BAFTAs for Best Special Visual Effects and Best Sound, and it was nominated for Best Cinematography, Best Editing and Best Production Design. It was number 66 on 100 Years, 100 Thrills, and it was number 15 on The 100 Greatest Films. Outstanding!",The Matrix
11,ccthemovieman-1,A Bit Confusing But A Big F/X Treat,8,18 October 2006,"Special-effects were the drawing card when this came out at the end of the 20th century, and those effects were spectacular. They lived up to their billing. Unfortunately, the story was a bit confusing for much of the two hours, a bit too secular-minded for me, although others have viewed this with Biblical analogies. I do think the script could have used some humor here and there. It took itself a little too seriously. That was especially true for the four main characters.Nonetheless, because of the stylish visuals and effects, it entertained. I liked the monotone-speaking Hugo Weaver the best, or at least found him the most interesting. Lawrence Fishburne's character came in a close second in that regard. Once again here's a movie that made you glad VHS tapes were being phased out in favor of sharper, widescreen transfers.",The Matrix
12,Tweekums,A cyberpunk classic,10,28 February 2012,"Like many people I was fairly awestruck by the special effects when I first saw this film but was unsure how I would feel watching the film again several years after I last saw it; after all special effects are advancing all the time and this is over ten years old... I needn't have worried; I enjoyed it just as much as I did first time.The story begins with computer hacker Neo receiving strange message telling him somebody was about to knock on his door and that he should 'follow the white rabbit'; his door is knocked and his friends invite him to come out with him; he is about to refuse when he sees a white rabbit tattooed on one of their shoulders so goes with them. While out he meets another hacker, a woman called Trinity, who tells him that the legendary hacker Morpheus wants to meet with him. The next day at work he receives a call telling him the authorities want to take him into custody and he must follow precise instructions if he wishes to escape; he fails to do this and is arrested. During the interview with Agent Smith a strange bug is implanted and in a nightmarish manner his mouth becomes fused closed! The next thing he knows he is waking up in his apartment assuming it was just a strange nightmare but it soon becomes apparent that is was real. Taken to Morpheus by Trinity he learns that the world is not as it seems; he isn't in 1999 but 2199 and none of his life so far has been real; his body is plugged into a giant machine and he is experiencing something called The Matrix.Once woken he finds himself in a dead mechanical world with Morpheus, Trinity and a few other free people; they mention the last human city; Zion, but we never see it. Now he is free he must prepare to return to The Matrix which means learning the skills he will need to survive and gaining an understanding of what The Matrix really is. Once inside they will have to avoid Agents, parts of the program that will hunt them down as well as assuring that they stay hidden in the real world; if they die in either place their life is over.This is a must see for all science fiction and action fans; it has a fine story and spectacular action sequences; many of them reminiscent of those in Chinese Wuxia films with characters running up walls and doing impossible leaps... of course within The Matrix nothing is impossible if you believe you can do it. Keanu Reaves might not have the greatest acting range but he is just right for the role of Neo, a man understandably a little confused at finding everything he had experienced so far was unreal. Hugo Weaving is great as Agent Smith bringing a sense of menace to the role. Other main actors Carrie Anne Moss and Laurence Fishburne also perform well. Writer/directors the Wachowski brothers did a great job; the film is incredibly stylish without lacking substance. I can't imagine many people haven't watched this but if you are one of those I strongly recommend checking it out.",The Matrix

14,BA_Harrison,Whoa!,10,14 November 2009,"With The Matrix having already received 3294 comments and 342,457 votes (with an average rating of 8.7), the last thing IMDb needs is another rambling review from an avid fan describing in precise detail why this film is such a revelation in terms of action and sci-fi cinema.What I will say is that the film is a stroke of genius that taps into the subconscious belief that our reality is not all it seems to be and mines it for all it's worth, developing a philosophical mythos of biblical proportions in the process, whilst introducing technical and directorial innovations that will be mimicked for years to come.It also features some kick-ass fight scenes (with jaw-dropping choreography by HK legend Yuen Woo Ping), a superb metal and techno soundtrack, and the awesome sight of Carrie Ann Moss almost completely clad in black PVC (or is it rubber?

Written and directed by the Wachowski brothers, who seem to enjoy a twisting story--though at the expense of logic (forget credibility).

17,Quinoa1984,One of the greatest achievements in Science-fiction film history,10,5 October 2000,"Andy and Larry Wachowski's The Matrix is an unbelieveable achievement. Not only in  the visual sense,  but in storytelling, the way society is, and much more.  And, Keanu Reeves is almost good here.Reeves playes 2 people in one- Thomas A. Anderson, a regular Joe who is just working it today's society.  The other is Neo, a comuter hacker who has broken every single known computer hacking law.  But, he soon meets Morpheus, played with great mysticism and wiseness by Laurence Fishburne, who brings Neo down the rabbit hole to tell him the truth about the world; we are living in a world called the Matrix, which uses out brain energy to trun us into batteries.  Unbelieveable to be sure, but it is incredibly original story wise, as it sprawls into something every average movie goer can appreciate- hard boiled, visually and bloody packed action, gore and violence.The best part though is that this film breaks many boundaries in technology and (with it's 4 Oscars for editing, sound, sound editing and visual effects) and deserves every bit of credit it gets.  True, some might find the plot confusing and boring and true it isn't for all tastes.  But if you can like the story and the action, you've got the key to a fantastic picture, otherwise it is another action flick (great action never-the-less).

Keanu Reeves is really good. Laurence Fishburne, Carrie-Anne Moss and Joe Pantoliano are equally important to watch. A bucket of popcorn, a Payday and two Pepsi Colas....and nerves of steel. What a flick!!!",The Matrix
20,sunwarrior13,An Apocalypse Of Kinetic Joy,10,26 February 2012,"The Matrix is a science fiction action film written and directed by Larry and Andy Wachowski. The film stars Keanu Reeves, Laurence Fishburne, Carrie-Anne Moss, Joe Pantoliano, and Hugo Weaving.The film depicts a future in which reality as perceived by most humans is actually a simulated reality created by sentient machines to pacify and subdue the human population, while their bodies' heat and electrical activity are used as an energy source. Upon learning this, computer programmer ""Neo"" is drawn into a rebellion against the machines, involving other people who have been freed from the ""dream world"" and into reality.Also,it contains many references to the cyberpunk and hacker subcultures; philosophical and religious ideas such as René Descartes' evil genius, the Allegory of the Cave, the brain in a vat thought experiment; and homages to Alice's Adventures in Wonderland, Hong Kong action cinema, spaghetti westerns, dystopian fiction, and Japanese animation.What if virtual reality wasn't just for fun, but was being used to imprison you? That's the dilemma that faces mild-mannered computer jockey Thomas Anderson in The Matrix. It's the year 1999, and Anderson (hacker alias: Neo) works in a cubicle, manning a computer and doing a little hacking on the side. It's through this latter activity that Thomas makes the acquaintance of Morpheus, who has some interesting news for Mr. Anderson -- none of what's going on around him is real. The year is actually closer to 2199, and it seems Thomas, like most people, is a victim of The Matrix, a massive artificial intelligence system that has tapped into people's minds and created the illusion of a real world, while using their brains and bodies for energy, tossing them away like spent batteries when they're through. Morpheus, however, is convinced Neo is ""The One"" who can crack open The Matrix and bring his people to both physical and psychological freedom.For those who have been waiting for movies to catch up with the graphic possibilities of comic books, wait no longer: The Matrix is among us.It is a must-see among genre fans, especially guys in their teens and 20s, for whom the script's pretentious mumbo-jumbo of undergraduate mythology, religious mysticism and technobabble could even be a plus rather than a dramatic liability.Aside from that,the balance between blockbuster-style action sequences and in-depth philosophical undertones that I've always admired about it.Overall,it is an ingenious combination of Hong Kong action, ground-breaking Hollywood FX, and an imaginative vision together with an apocalypse of kinetic joy that will truly describe watching this film.",The Matrix

22,Theo Robertson,Good First Time You See It,7,28 October 2003,"THE MATRIX is a good film , without doubt the greatest film featuring the sub genre of cyberpunk , but it`s film whose reputation is mainly built upon having a very clever premise more than anything else . I remember being absolutely stunned at the revelation of the plot , but  when I saw it for a second time at the weekend on channel 5 ( First time I saw it was about three years ago ) I was slightly bored by the film . It`s by no means a boring film , it`s just that once you know how the plot twists , turns and sometimes boggles the mind the revelations don`t have the same effect second time around . THE MATRIX hasn`t been helped either by the amount of spoofs/rip offs featuring the scenes where the action stops , the frame freezes , the camera turns 360 degrees and then the action starts again . These scenes were jaw dropping at the time but have now been done by countless ads , pop videos and other movies it`s become impossible now to remember the impact this cinematography technique had at the time . I also think the producers of THE MATRIX haven`t done themselves any favours by turning THE MATRIX into a franchise To sum up this is a good film . Like me you`ll certainly enjoy it first time you watch it but unlike say MEMENTO ( Note the cast connections between the two movies ? ) THE MATRIX doesn`t reward the audience with repeat viewings and at the end of the day the not too dissimilar TOTAL RECALL is probably a more enjoyable film",The Matrix
23,Hey_Sweden,"Which will it be, the red pill or the blue pill?",7,22 February 2020,"""The Matrix"" is a trend-setting, visually dazzling sci-fi / action picture that offers up some provocative ideas and entertaining concepts. Its various scenes of human acrobatics and bullet-dodging gimmickry immediately became iconic, lending themselves to parody as well as to imitation. Granted, there IS a lot of mumbo-jumbo in this script, and the film does go on a little too long, but it's hard to deny the amusement level of such colourful escapism.Keanu Reeves is front and centre as Thomas Anderson, alias ""Neo"", a software designer by day and computer hacker by night. Then he is informed by characters led by the charismatic Morpheus (Laurence Fishburne) that the world in which he lives is not reality. It is actually an illusion created by an omnipotent artificial intelligence. Morpheus believes that Neo is ""The One"", the person who will be the ultimate weapon for good in the war waged against this nefarious A.I. Pursuing our heroes are various relentless Agents, in particular the deadpan Smith (Hugo Weaving).""The Matrix"" is generally good fun, as it delivers a number of nicely executed set pieces. The martial arts fights, choreographed by Yuen Wo Ping, are highlights, but there is also one effective chase sequence near the end. John Gaeta supervised the visual FX, which are memorable all the way to the end.The cast is fine - Joe Pantoliano (co-star of The Wachowski siblings' breakthrough film, ""Bound""), Carrie-Anne Moss, Marcus Chong, Gloria Foster, Matt Doran, Anthony Ray Parker, etc. Keanu does alright as the hero who becomes more badass as the story plays out, steadily awakening to this new reality facing him. Fishburne again displays a solid screen presence, delivering exposition in such a way that one can't help but pay attention. Moss is an engaging heroine, and her athleticism in various action sequences is quite impressive. Weaving is a simply great villain.Well produced, well directed, and pounding ahead to a soundtrack including Rob Zombie, Prodigy, and Marilyn Manson, among others; this spawned a franchise that as of this writing is about to be revived.Seven out of 10.",The Matrix
24,LeonLouisRicci,"""Ignorance is Bliss""",10,13 November 2012,"Ultra-stylish Techno-Noir classic that is broad on concept and design and creates a novel realm of realism vs cerebral creation. This is groundbreaking visual stuff and is backed by extraordinary electronic/metal music and really cool sets.It is a visual and literal ""Rage Against the Machine"" that is fully realized in its display of a deadpan humor and dead-on violence. This was the ride of the decade and brought a new look to the new millennium.It's not without some flaws and faults, mainly that the matrix is so complex and complicated that its own concept had to be ""bent and broken"" to allow for some of the story to translate to an acceptable theatrical experience. At least to its targeted mainstream audience. In the hands of a quirky and edgy Director it could have been done with more ""in house logic"", but then it would be quite a different experience.The whole concept of a Messiah and ""The One"" is kind of elementary in an extreme exploitation such as this but that only drops it a notch from the best of Sci-Fi and does nothing to hold this exhilarating experience back from being quite entertaining, if on a lesser level.",The Matrix
25,CinemaSerf,Great sci-fi shoot 'em up that makes you think a bit...,7,9 August 2020,"""Thomas Anderson"" is a nerdy boy by day, and an enigmatic hacker ""Neo"" by night. His latter persona is constantly challenging his norms, his behaviour, his reality even - and when he is contacted by Carrie-Anne Moss ""Trinity"" his suspicions begin to pan out and he is introduced to a crew of rebels led by ""Morpheus"" (Laurence Fishburne) on a mission to expose the extent to which mankind is merely a plaything of the ""Matrix"" living entirely imagined lives. The system is onto them, though, and using Hugo Weaving's ""Agent Smith"" and a fifth columnist from within the group's own ranks, is bent on their destruction. This film has that scarce value of having exciting (rather than delicately choreographed) action scenes married together with an intelligent, at times quite thought-provoking dialogue mixing fact/fiction and religiosity on a clever premiss that once we start to question reality; the conspiracy theories can run wild - and right to the top! Is ""Neo"" the one to save humanity - some sort of resurrected ""one""? The Wachowski Brother remind us how to make a good sci-fi fantasy, but also that in his day Keanu Reeves was a one of the best, his boy-next-door good looks, agility and charisma working very well here. Of course the effects have dated, but one you've been subsumed into the plot - and if you are watching on a big screen - then that matters not; it's a gripping chunk of cinema depicting loyalty, determination and integrity that I really enjoyed.",The Matrix
26,zardoz-13,Cyberescapism Galore!!!,10,24 September 2013,"Co-directors Andy and Larry (now Lana) Wachowski fashioned one of the most revolutionary science fiction sagas of all time with the cyberspace thriller ""The Matrix"" with Keanu Reeves, Lawrence Fishburne, Carrie Ann Moss, and Hugo Weaving. The first of a trilogy, this 136-minute, allegorical actioneer pits a group of resistance fighters led by Neo and Trinity against the status quo villainy of 21st century henchmen who wear suits and ties with sunglasses. The pioneering ""bullet time"" cinematography is as incredible as the action is audacious. Nothing is what it appears to be in ""The Matrix."" The Wachowskis have appropriated a little bit of everything for their derivative but striking cyberescapism. They have incorporated philosophy, martial arts combat, Greek mythology, Biblical themes, and ideas from movies such as ""Strange Days"" and ""Dark City."" Legendary martial arts choreographer Woo-ping Yuen has staged some kinetic gravity-defying, close-quarters combat sequences. Carrie Ann-Moss never made another movie that matched ""The Matrix."" The first scene when she runs up walls to elude the police, bounds across rooftops, and hurls herself like Peter Pan over a street is sensational. This computer generated scene gets the action off to a dynamic start and the Wachowskis never let the pace lag even when things get a little convoluted. Laurence Fishburne behaves like John the Baptist from the Bible, and Hugo Weaving makes a diabolical villain. ""The Matrix"" belongs in the top 100 science fiction films of all time.",The Matrix

28,Boba_Fett1138,"The most influential and refreshing science-fiction movie since ""Star Wars"".",10,26 March 2006,"""The Matrix"" has redefined the science-fiction genre. Previous to this movie, most science-fiction movies consisted out of scene's in space with spacecrafts, aliens, all set in a futuristic world. Most movies that tried to be different from this, mostly failed. ""The Matrix"" does however does not fail and it redefined the science-fiction genre and has taken it to a whole different and more seriously taken level of movie-making. The movie has inspired many different movies ever since and showed that science-fiction and action elements are a great and spectacular combination. From that perspective ""The Matrix"" is one of the most important movies for film-making, from the '90's.This is a superb piece of movie-making. The Wachowski 'brothers' were obviously inspired by the Japanese anime style and they transform that style spectacularly into a life-action movie. Because of the style and flair of the movie, it makes the action look spectacular and even also look as something totally new. The fantastic bullet-time effects were something unseen before and are already alone reason enough why this movie is already almost a classic and certainly unforgettable movie. The style and new effects used in the movie make this movie to be also a refreshing one. It's an extremely original movie, both story-wise and technique-wise.Especially the action is what truly makes this movie a success. The fight and action sequences are beautifully choreographed. It also all is beautifully shot by cinematographer Bill Pope, who uses some fantastic lighting and camera-angles at times. The musical score from Don Davis is also quite good. Also the costumes and settings most certainly do not disappoint. The special effects are spectacular and also something totally new at times.The cast is not the strongest element of the movie. Keanu Reeves is fairly good as the main character but he lacks some charisma at times. Some goes for Carrie-Anne Moss to be honest. Actors who do not disappoint are Laurence Fishburne, Joe Pantoliano and the fantastic Hugo Weaving in his real big breakthrough role. He is an excellent 'villain' because of his look and way of acting.But what really makes and shapes the movie is its story. Yes, it's complex and believe, not everything makes sense or is explained in a satisfying way but it at least is something totally original and imaginative. The story really shapes the movie and its style and make the action and science-fiction elements of the movie work fantastically together.The movie is great non-stop spectacular action entertaining that doesn't even get slow or boring even when nothing is really happening. This is mainly due to the imaginative powerful story of the movie. If you don't understand and/or get the story the first time, just watch it a second or third time. The movie is worth it. The movie uses multiple layers, symbolism and elements from religions and other styles of movie-making. It makes you discover more new things, every time you watch the movie. One of the most original and influential movies from the '90's and therefor also an absolute must-see!10/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",The Matrix
29,Calicodreamin,Awesome sci-fi flick!,9,22 April 2020,"A great send off of the 90s, the matrix is a one of a kind sci-fi action movie.

The outfits are badass and really send this over the edge, who doesn't want to look like Carrie Ann moss?!",The Matrix
30,TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews,Could this possibly have been any better?,10,9 April 2009,"I base this on the Ultimate 10-Disc Set. An entire decade after this came out, it still holds up incredibly well. It simply has so much to offer... all that food for thought, different beliefs, tons of themes that are explored and such immense room for interpretation, with very little in this being certain or definite. The plot is excellent, develops well, and combines various interesting ideas(and no, they weren't original, they weren't meant to be... this puts a lot of fascinating concepts together, and presents them all for the mainstream audience). Granted, it spawned a ton of suddenly enlightened pocket philosophers with little doubt as to their own prowess, but with anything this influential, there are going to be some negative results. The pacing is spot-on, not a moment of this is too long or overly short. The action is astounding, exciting, fun, entertaining and awesome, and they manage to do amazing and memorable sequences. No, perhaps it does not dodge all of the clichés. The slow-motion(and bits clearly inspired by John Woo) and other tools appeared before this, yes, the point isn't that they were new... it's the way this uses them, and creates a unique style. Mixing Noir, Animé and countless allusions, and doing so with expert-like skill is an impressive feat. The Bullet-Time was invented for this, and it is fantastic. The martial arts, the choreography, the moves, magnificent. The effects are stunning and seamless, to this day. The cinematography and editing are perfect, and enormously well-planned. The mood and atmosphere is masterfully achieved. The acting is quite good, Reeves fits, Moss and Fishburne are marvelous, and Weaving is utterly impeccable. The dialog is almost completely invariably well-written, and well-delivered. There is no nudity or sexuality, at most hints thereof. There is language, moderately harsh, albeit not too bad in frequency. The DVD holds a text introduction(to the following) by the Wachowski's, that makes for a great read, as well as two commentary tracks, one of philosophers who enjoyed the film, Dr. Cornel West & Ken Wilder, and one of critics who did not care for it, Todd McCarthy, John Powers & David Thompson. These are worth listening to. I recommend this to any fan of science fiction, and anyone who wishes to be encouraged to think by what they watch. 10/10",The Matrix
31,view_and_review,And now introducing the Wachowski Brothers,9,21 January 2007,"Every so often a movie will come around to challenge the minds of the people; make people think, ""What if..."" ""The Matrix"" was such a movie. ""The Matrix"" took an idea that was not entirely original and took it to another level. The concept of machines rebelling against their human creators had already been explored in successful movies such as ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" and ""Terminator"", but never had a movie dabbled with the idea of machines being triumphant and eventually enslaving all of humankind.""The Matrix"" as a story alone was extraordinary. The Wachowski brothers obviously put a lot of thought, time, and energy into the story alone because it is without equal. The story itself triggered thoughts of ""What if we are plugged into a matrix? How would we know?"" And it also spawned many contemplative conversations all over the country if not the world. The Wachowski Brothers covered even the most minute detail with regards to the matrix: its origin, its function, its current state, and it flaws. Each scene and each conversation seemed to be carefully chosen and put together so as to convey the plausibility of the matrix.Then coupled with the great story was almost equally fantastic directing and special effects. Before ""The Matrix"" none had tried or adequately tried the still shot and pan. Almost immediately into the movie we get to see a shot of Trinity (Carrie-Ann Moss) jumping in the air, then being frozen perfectly still while the camera pans around her, before she proceeds to kick butt. This movie had no shortage of special effects and action blended it perfectly with critical and revealing dialogue.",The Matrix
32,neil-476,Credit where it's due,8,1 May 2008,"You've got to hand it (well, some of it) to The Matrix.The concept is great. That concept is translated into a decent screen adaptation. The film has a wholly original (and much copied) look to it. The action sequences are generally well choreographed, if a bit over-reliant on slow motion. The effects are simply brilliant and, in places, groundbreaking (there aren't many films which add something 100% new to the filmmaker's bag of tricks, but The Matrix is one of them). The principals mostly deliver excellent performances, and Keanu looks cool, as he is meant to.But there is a distinct element of The Emperor's New Clothes at work here. It's very evident in some of the fanboy gushing, and I suspect that the Emperor's tailors also believed that they had sewed a suit of clothes which was a lot more visible than it actually was. Apologies, I'm disappearing up my own metaphor here.I think The Matrix thinks it is very much cleverer than it actually is. There's no denying that it's a good yarn, told with a distinctive style and a great deal of panache, but that's all it is. Yet you'd think it was the 5th Gospel to listen to what some have to say.I accept it, with thanks, as a good movie.The sequels? Er...",The Matrix

""The Matrix"" is like ""Pulp Fiction"" -- in many ways, it defined the culture of its time and has had a major impact on everything since. And it's also in the same league as films like ""2001: A Space Odyssey,"" ""Terminator 2"" and ""Jurassic Park"" that redefined what movie special effects could do.The first sequel was incomprehensible and I haven't (and probably won't) see the third film, but I like this one.Grade: A",The Matrix

Anyway, rather than reveal any more of the plot and risk spoiling the film for those who haven't seen it I will just say that this was a pretty good science-fiction movie that incorporates good special effects and lots of action. Or perhaps its more accurate to say that this is a good action film that relies upon science-fiction and special effects. Either way it's a pretty good film and the only reason I didn't rate it higher was that I thought some of the dialogue was a bit weak and the action went a bit overboard.

Keanu Reeves is picked up by agents who force a mechanical object in through his navel and he awakens in his own bed. Laurence Fishburne informs him that the Matrix is everything around him. It is destined to keep people under control. Reeves is presented with two pills. One will allow him to awaken without memory of the incident, and the other one allows him to discover whether or not he is the Missing Link. Directed by Larry and Andy Wachowski showcasing distracting action scenes and interesting theories. This is certainly a departure from their earlier film, Bound. Reeves is appealing as someone thrusts out of ordinariness into the overwhelming unknown. Fishburne makes for a fine instructor as he allows Reeves the freedom of choice but cautions him on the consequences. In other roles are the electrifying Carrie-Anne Moss, and the double-crossing Joe Pantoliano as the villain. Hugo Weaving also plays a villain named Agent Smith who has an array of special powers that screws up more than one's brain.

I feel like we could of got to know the Neo character some before this, we have no idea what he's thinking at any point, all we know is that he was the greatest hacker and that's because he's the one. The trinity character's too butch, the other female crew member in a lesser role too, what's with this? Like Cypher, I would rather just go back into the Matrix.

A messiah of sorts, Morpheus presents Neo with the truth about his world by shedding light on the dark secrets that have troubled him for so long......After seeing this after so many years, the then groundbreaking movie just doesn't hold up for me.Back in 1999, the trailer was one of the most mysterious things ever to be seen at the cinema. It was refreshing to see a film not give away any of the plot, and just astound people with the wonderful effects for that time.And it comes to fruition that the reason why none of the plot is revealed on the trailer is simply because it's that mind-boggingly bonkers, that it probably would have deterred many form seeing it.Seeing it now with much older and wiser eyes, the films just a series of zen like exposition chapters tied together with very beautiful, awe-inspiring action, and Keanu going Whoa.The Wachowskis are geniuses, they have made some very experimental movies, some of them are good, some of them are complete cobblers, this is why the sequels are much maligned, because they were released when other, better movies were released.What summer blockbusters were released at the time of this?

What gets me is all the people who act like this movie is so original.  What is original about it?  It is basically a combination of the Terminator movies and any number of virtual reality movies that were released prior to this one including Johnny Mnemonic also starring Reeves.  Heck, it wasn't even the first movie to use bullet time as the movie Blade was the first time I had seen that done in a movie, granted on a much smaller scale.  Also, I think it was seen in a Korn music video as well before this movie ever came into being.  So this movie just borrows, for the most part, from a bunch of different movies and other entertainment.  Still it is good, though the parts that are the best take place in the matrix.  Some of the real world scenes are quite frankly boring.  The second time I watched this one I was basically thinking, ""Come on, capture Morpheus already so we can get to the good part of the flick"". The action at the end of this movie, more than makes up for the many dry spells in the flick.  Reeves and Fishburne are good as well, though I could have done without some of their talking scenes and their fight wasn't anything special either.  Like I said, I loved the movie when they were in the matrix and not as much when they weren't.  I hear the third installment will be entirely set in the real world too, so I don't have high hopes for it.  Carrie Ann Moss wasn't anything special in this either...if it wasn't for this movie who would ever of heard of her?  Let's face it, you could have put anyone in that role and they could have performed just as well are better.  She isn't very good looking either.

The casting is great and Carrie-Anne is stunning throughout (I usually don't like short hair on women, but she's an exception). For me, though, the Waschowskis made it too comic booky.

41,The_Void,"Overrated, but still excellent entertainment",8,8 December 2004,"I remember, back in 1999 (or it could have been the start of 2000), when I first saw The Matrix. It was big, bold, loud, exciting...it had guns, bullet time, Rage Against the Machine, plenty of action, a hot woman in a lead role....I remember thinking ""I should like this"". But I didn't. Like Kill Bill, it's hard to believe that a fan of extreme blood and gore like myself could possibly dislike a film that sees one lady pluck out another lady's eye, drop it on the floor and stand on it, but it's true. OK, it's a little easier to believe when you consider that every scene in Kill Bill, apart from that one and the Lucy Lui fight was rubbish, but I'm sure you can see what I'm getting at. Fast forward 4 or 5 years to today, and the rewatch. I have a theory that states that any film that I enjoy cannot possibly be bad, because I watch movies for enjoyment (nobody watches movies to be bored) and if a movie fulfils that need for enjoyment, then it has done it's job and therefore it can't be bad. And I enjoyed The Matrix. However, I maintain that it's not a great film. Now, if Pulp fiction has taught us anything; it's that it isn't what you take, it's what you do with it....but by god, the Wachowski Brothers should definitely consider changing their name to the Wachowski BanditsFor a start; the film is Star Wars reincarnated. Keanu Reeves is the one that brings balance to the force, and he even has everyone doubting him for a while(!), Princess Morpheus gets kidnapped and tortured and our hero's must go and save her...him, the bad guys have taken over the galaxy...I mean the world, and there's only a bunch of rebels to save it, they go and see Yoda...I mean the Oracle, who predicts the future and stuff, there's training sequences a la The Empire Strikes Back, Neo must become one with the force, whoops, i mean 'believe', Agent Smith is Neo's father...oh, OK I made that last one up, but you see what I'm getting at.And it's not only Star Wars that the Wachowski Bandits have ripped off, The Terminator and it's sequel aren't safe either. Of course, they couldn't have made Agent Smith actually be liquid metal, as they'd have a lawsuit on their hands, but he is just another version of liquid metal really...isn't he? Shown by the way he can transform from anyone. And what about the whole 'computers take over the world' thing, you didn't think I wouldn't spot that did you? And The Wachowski Bandits obviously aren't fascists, because even shitty movies aren't safe. What about the whole SN thing? The way that the hackers are made to look cool....Hackers anyone? But like I said, it isn't what you take; it's what you do with it. Just like Tarantino did, Bonnie and Clyde...I mean Andy and Larry have stolen all these elements, and mixed them up into one coherent, and trend setting piece of cinema. Also like Tarantino, The Doberman Gang haven't just stolen, they've made some stuff themselves as well. Bullet time, for a start. Of course, it's not much of an expansion on the slow motion in films like The Killer; but still. Also, the idea of the 'matrix' itself is an original one. (unless it's been ripped off a film I haven't seen/heard of)The soundtrack fits too, which is rare when it's mostly rave/heavy rock music. I think there's only Natural Born Killers and Lost Highway that I can think of when it has worked. Anyway, when Rage's ""Wake Up"" came on before the credit sequence, it fit very well. Also, the scene during the training with the woman in red and the agent worked well with it's music. In fact, that might even be my favourite scene in the movie. It's cool and it works. In fact, the film does ooze a sense of cool throughout, mostly because of the leather jackets. It's not a complete piece of cinema, however. I don't know if it's built upon in the sequels, but there isn't a lot of emotion in the movie. Sometimes, it doesn't matter, some of the best films of all time are very cold on that front; my top 2, The Good, The Bad and The Ugly and The Evil Dead both are; but then again, they didn't try and be soul searching or have a great depth like The Matrix does. For an example of what I'm talking about; the love between Trinity and Neo. I noticed her saying she is watching him at the start, but other than, the love seemed to be based on the fact that the Oracle said it would happen....so I'm supposed to care? In fact, none of the characters seemed to have any depth, or anything about them at all. What drives them? Why does Morpheus blindly believe that Neo is 'The One'? Why did Neo take the red pill? Is it his character? I don't know.Also of note is the way that people seem to refer to The Matrix as a confusing film. It uses a non-linear style of storytelling (it runs straight, but you don't find everything out all at once), and that's the only confusing thing about it. When you think about it, it's very simple.There isn't a great deal of depth, and the film doesn't pose any real thought-provoking questions either. Of course, there's the central theme; ""it's all an illusion"", but what does that mean? Of course, it's not all an illusion really...so what's the message? Don't build too many machines? There is a central question, though, which is ""would you take the blue or the red pill""...and that's not a bad question; but the film, through it's non-linear storytelling and imaginative premise, isn't as deep as it appears to be. Bit like Fight Club really. Of course, the premise in The Matrix does get you thinking in a ""what if..."" frame of mind, but so do lots of things, like on British TV show, Kenyan Confronts; when he exposes credit card scams etc...""what if mine was stolen"", so does that make Kenyan Confronts a deep and complex masterpiece? (By the way, did anyone think that Lawrence Fishbourne looked stupid during his 'believe' type moments?) Still, like I said; the film is entertaining. The action sequences are stunning and the film looks lovely throughout, so it gets itself high marks for that. It's well paced as well, and unlike a lot of action films; the non-action scenes in The Matrix aren't boring. But that's all; it's like Song 2 (""wuhoo!"") or the ""Belly's gonna get you"" advert; fun, but not overly brilliant. However, I'm 'down' with fun films, so I'm down with this.",The Matrix

What's really surprising is just how well this still holds up, fifteen years after the fact. It was easily the greatest movie of 1999, and a high point of the decade. It's not just an action movie with sweet kung fu and leather-clad gunfights, but also one hell of a sci-fi trip; an honest-to-god journey through the rabbit hole, seductive in its intriguing mystery and still riveting after many viewings. The Wachowskis showed an incredible eye for framing, shot composition and camera moves; this thing reeks of style.It's a classic any way you slice it, and a laundry list of memorable scenes (the opening rooftop chase, Neo's unplugging, the SWAT ambush in the apartment building, the lobby shootout, the helicopter crash, the subway fight and subsequent chase). The agents still make for striking imagery with their comically oversized Desert Eagles (I love Weaving's intonation and line delivery).And while it's probably the most cartoonishly parodied movie of the last half-century, those bullet-time effects and killer fight scenes haven't lost their luster. 8/10",The Matrix

There is practically no plot, crumie acting(except for Morphious), all effects, and just an excuse for computer nerds to get together for this crap.I mean, Spiderman I could deal somewhat, but man.

46,MovieAddict2016,"good, but over appreciated",6,3 August 2001,"Let me say that I do like this film, the acting was decent, the plot was good, and the special effects were amazing. But I've seen much better movies and I don't think The Matrix should have gotten 8.5 stars on IMDB. Maybe 6.5-7 stars...not 8, it should not be in the top 250. I'm sure there are those that disagree with me but if they really paid attention to this movie, and not be caught up in the craze, I think they'd realize it's just a decent sci-fi movie. It should not be given that many stars, and that there are other movies much better than this one.   The plot is Keanu Reeves plays Neo, a man that thinks something is wrong with the world, and is struggling to find out what it is. He eventually finds Morpheus, who explains to him, why the world seems fake..*minor spoilers revealing plot ahead*.The reason is because the world as we know it is not real, it is really a computer matrix made by machines in the REAL world. The machines create humans in the real world, and load them into the matrix. That way while humans are in the matrix the machines are feeding off their energy to fuel themselves. But Morpheus and his gang have been unpluggged, and they explain all this to Neo, and it results to the amazing special effects climax.  This movie is good, not great. I give it 3/5 stars, no more.

47,MovieAddict2016,"As Keanu Reeves might say, 'Whoa!'",6,27 October 2003,"Original Review Posted to IMDb 2001. Newer Review Submitted November 27th, 2003.--I watched ""The Matrix"" for the fourth or fifth time last night, and for the fourth or fifth time I wasn't able to fully comprehend its wild success. I understand that it is essentially a good film, with very impressive visual effects, and that it has some underlying themes and metaphors for our current world culture mixed with the kind of stuff people go to the movies for...but I can't bring myself to give it more than 4.5/5 stars. That may be a very good rating, but this is a movie that took me four or five viewings to even learn to really like it. The end seemed quite enthralling this time around, but the beginning of the movie, for me, just lacks a bit of something.The plot: Our world, as we know it, is a computer simulation called The Matrix. In ""the real world,"" we are all ""grown"" in long fields where machines of the future look over us and put us into little pods where we are hooked up into the simulation matrix and entertained until our death.As our minds believe we are in this alternate world, the machines use our bodies for sources of energy. A mysterious man named Morpheus holds up a Duracell battery at one point during the course of the film and states that we are merely another one of these. But the film starts with Neo, a man who lives an alternate life--one of honesty and one of crime. He is an Internet hacker and has been guilty of virtually every known hacker crime.But Neo feels that the world surrounding him is somehow wrong. He doesn't like the idea of fate because it means that he can't control his own destiny. An so an infamous criminal named Morpheus (Laurence Fishburne) picks up Neo, hoping that he may be The One, the man whose destiny is to free the minds of everyone living in The Matrix and bring an end to the machines' rule of the real world.Of course, this won't be easy, as Agent Smith (Hugo Weaving, who can now be seen in all three ""The Lord of the Rings"" films) is a computer program loaded into The Matrix--his mission is to stop the uprising and to capture Morpheus and his gang, which also includes Trinity (Carrie-Anne Moss) and Cypher (the always enjoyable Joe Pantoliano).Keanu Reeves may not be able to act, but his character is part of the new generation computer freaks and geeks. Needless to say, he fits the part. Laurence Fishburne (""Apocalypse Now"") is good as the mysterious and all-knowing Morpheus. His character's lasting image was a bit tarnished by the film's 2003 sequel, ""The Matrix Reloaded,"" as an element of him was lost when we found out that he isn't quite as respected back in Zion (the land of the free).But the real stand-outs are Joe Pantoliano and Carrie-Anne Moss as Trinity--he's the comedic relief, she's a strong leader who falls for Neo. And unlike the Charlies Angels gang, she actually looks as if she could knock out twenty guys and live to tell about it. She's tough, blunt and the ultimate on-screen tom boy. ""The Matrix"" currently holds the number 34 spot on the Internet Movie Database's list of the top 250 films ever made. I've certainly seen better films than ""The Matrix,"" and The Wachowski Brothers, who directed the film, seem to have borrowed a lot of past techinques in filming (the bleak look of ""Se7en,"" the metaphorical significances of ""Star Wars,"" etc.). But this last viewing proved to be a lot more fun than previous viewings--perhaps because for once I let my mind make its own decision and avoided it being influcenced by the standing of the film on lists and so on. Expectations were too high when I first saw this film. And they still are. But perhaps a few more viewings will make this movie really grow on me. I sure do hope so.""The Matrix"" is the type of film you should witness without prior expectations.4/5.",The Matrix
48,disdressed12,not sure what all the hype is about.,4,22 February 2008,"i'm not sure what the big deal is about this movie.i mean,it borrows heavily from other sources,such as the bible and Star Wars,among others.the gist of the story is that the world people see around them is isn't real.it's actually a construct made by machines.Humanity is actually enslaved by the machines.but there is one man who can free humanity.that man may be a hacker who goes by the name Neo.Neo is portrayed by Keanu Reeves.also playing prominent roles are Carrie Ann Moss and Laurence Fishburne.but in my mind,it is Hugo weaving who steals the show as the enigmatic agent Smith.i will admit the movie has some great special effects and some spectacular fight scenes.but some of the moves in the fights are really silly and are not what i would call practical.also,a lot of the movie is slow moving,and the characters don't behave in logical ways.still,the movie does have its good moments.there are some genuine moments of high tension.this is the first of three movie in The Matrix franchise.for me,the first movie in the series is a 6/10",The Matrix
49,KineticSeoul,A revolutionary movie,9,19 December 2012,"When I saw this movie for the fist time when it came out. I thought it was the coolest and most badass movie ever made. I wasn't entirely sure what was going on when it came to the story at that time. But all I knew was that is was really cool. It's a bit outdated now but it still left a mark in cinema and inspired a lot of movie and more to come. The story is actually very creative and has sci-fi philosophical elements that is well blended into the story and isn't forced. And the dialogue is even cool and interesting. I am not going to get in depth with the story but I will just say that it's pretty clever without it being overly complex. This is probably Keanu Reeves's trademark movie and I can't picture anyone else taking the role of Neo besides him. And glad that someone like Will Smith didn't end up with this role. Nothing against Will Smith but Keanu Reeves is just the better candidate. He was just perfect for a movie like this and fit the image of a average cool hacker that gets picked or chosen to do something much much greater. Even the mentor character Morpheus(Laurence Fishburne) and the main villain Agent Smith played by Hugo Weaving are excellent choices for the roles they were given. The action was super cool and even amazing when this movie first came out. In fact it's the first movie I seen that blends slow motion and bullet time in a effective manner in a movie. It tries to combine so many stuff into this one film but it does it right. One of it is the anime film ""Ghost in the Shell"" which obviously played a huge part in inspiring the Wachowski brothers. Overall this is a cool and entertaining movie with some wicked ideas that all sci-fi movie watchers shouldn't miss out on...Well it's been out for more than a decade. It's a shame the sequels will ruin this awesome mythology of ""The Matrix"". To the point I think this movie would have been even more legendary if the sequels didn't come out or if the sequels was at least good as ""Dark City"".9.8/10",The Matrix
50,OllieSuave-007,Philosophical and artistic sci-fi!,8,24 August 2014,"This is an iconic sci-fi movie starring Keanu Reeves as computer hacker Thomas Anderson/Neo, who is on a mission with the mysterious Trinity (Carrie-Anne Moss) and Morpheus (Lawrence Fishbourne) to confront an artificial cyber-world on Earth called the Matrix, whose malevolent cyber creators want to conquer the human race and take over the real world.The movie starts off a little slow, but steadily gains momentum as Keanu Reeves' character goes on his mission to confront the cyber-machines, show off his martial arts moves, elude the pursuing evil agents and take down the Matrix. There are plenty of sophisticated visual and special effects that really enhance the sci-fi elements of the film, and some plot twists that made the film more intriguing. In addition to the sci-fi action, there are also a lot of philosophical elements and themes in the story, particularly the ""free your mind"" and ""realize the truth"" statements.The artistry of the action, especially the slow-motion scenes showing Carrie-Anne Moss jumping up in the air and Keanu Reeves dodging bullets became some of the most iconic cinema moments in history and have been spoofed or referenced in other films.Some downsides to the movie, though, was that I thought all the action was a little on the short side (a lot of all-talk) and some of the acting, particularly that for Reeves, was too wooden and emotionless. I also thought the incognito-like and stoic performance of Hugo Weaving's Agent Smith character was overacted.Overall, though, this is a pretty good sci-fi movie and is worth a watch.Grade B",The Matrix
51,sddavis63,Great Special Effects Do Not Guarantee A Great Movie,2,15 July 2001,"People had told me two things about this movie. First, that it was difficult to understand. It isn't. The plot is very simple and understandable. Second, that this was a great movie. It isn't. The plot is so understandable that it's boring. Almost everything in this movie is a rehash of science fiction themes that have come up over and over again. It's somewhere around the year 2199. We know that because Morpheus (played - well played I concede - by Lawrence Fishburne) tells us. Machines have conquered humanity and taken over. OK. I can think of at least one original Star Trek episode and the entire series Battlestar Galactica that revolved around that. The whole thing takes place inside a series of computer programs. OK. The holodeck on the Starship Enterprise, or any number of movies about Virtual Reality spring to mind. One person (Neo, played by Keanu Reeves) will save the world. Hmmm. Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home: ""Captain Kirk, you and your crew have saved this planet."" In short, there just isn't anything original in this story. How it makes it to #31 on the all time list (at the time of writing) is beyond me.There are some good things in this movie. There must have been a massive special effects budget, because the special effects are superb. No argument there. But great special effects - and even some good performances by Fishburne and Reeves (and a drily humorous performance by Hugo Weaving as Agent Smith) don't make up for the basic weakness of this entirely unoriginal story.2/10 - solely for the special effects.",The Matrix
52,Buddy-51,uninvolving sci-fi thriller,6,30 October 1999,"As the world and the movies head into a brand new millenium, old narrative formats have been gilded with all the techno/cyber concepts and jargon that now inundate us in our daily lives.  In no areas of filmmaking is this more true than the action/adventure and sci-fi genres.  Probably the most popular example to date comes in the form of ""The Matrix"", a film that actually chooses as its setting a never-never land located somewhere between reality and the abstract plane of cybernetics.The plot of the film, though too complex to reiterate here, is actually put forward in a fairly straightforward, comprehensible manner.  What is missing from the film is the essential grounding in reality that makes the audience care if the main characters succeed in their mission (to rescue the world of course) or fail.  Unlike say ""Enemy of the State"", which managed to grapple with the potential dangers of an over-computerized and mechanized society in a world with which we are all familiar, ""The Matrix"" takes us to a sci-fi world that never fully engages the audience in even its own reality.  Part of the problem may be that the film's visual designers settle for the conventional sci-fi view of the future world as a series of dark, cramped, fog enshrouded rooms and corridors familiar to us from countless such movies.  We follow the obviously well thought-out and meticulously explained storyline but find ourselves never particularly engaged in the characters or feel any stake in the outcome of the final resolution. As to the film's much vaunted special effects, they are, admittedly at times, intriguing, but since computer graphics now make even the most preposterous situations possible on the screen, the audience craves more than simply scattered moments of jawdropping visuals to engage its full attention.  ""The Matrix""  borders on dullness quite often during its overlong 136 minute running time.  Perhaps a movie that takes place in a world that really isn't a world needs a more engaging central character to make the audience care.",The Matrix
53,thesar-2,Whoa! I think I just entered the Matrix.,9,14 June 2009,"'The Matrix' should be seriously considered an absolute classic and milestone. Is it perfect, though? No. But neither was 'Star Wars' (1977) and it's considered the same. Both had mediocre at best acting (Mark Hamill and Keanu Reeves must've applied at the same strip-mall acting schools,) yet both were before their times and started a brand new trend in movie-making. Actually, 'Matrix' takes the cake in too many numerous rip-offs/copy-cats, too many to print. However, back in 1999, it was refreshing to see a movie where the action leads the hero into running alongside a wall while shooting and actually gives a reason they can physically do that. Neo (Reeves) is a computer hacker who's being courted by digital heroes he worships while being investigated for cyber-crimes. After being convinced to follow his soon-to-be mentors into the ""rabbit hole"" he learns (or more accurately, takes the rest of the film to learn) that the world he was accustomed to is just a computer program, a la 'The Matrix' and the mainframe's using humans as batteries. Bring on the 'Terminator'-type save all humans from technology storyline. However, with strong performances from Fishburne, Moss, Foster and Weaving, incredible action/chases and state-of-the-art special effects (that still hold up today, 10 years later) we have a fresh, exciting, action packed adventure with smart dialogue even with the same ole ""Savior"" or ""The One"" storyline. The film's biggest weakness, or really only blemish, is Reeves, who once again proves he's the absolutely luckiest actor in history. Most of his big-budgeted movies are really good, aside from him. For example, 'Speed,' 'Bram Stoker's Dracula,' and 'The Devil's Advocate,' were all wonderful films and were all nearly brought down on the horrid (lack of) acting Reeves gives. Despite that, 'Matrix' is an absolute must watch.",The Matrix

55,ElMaruecan82,The Unbearable Artificiality of Being ...,8,29 September 2017,"It all comes down to the most central question of humanity: ""To be or not to be"". I've always asked myself whether reality was an absolute or a relative notion. I'm not a scientist but let me tell you something, if reality existed, there would never be marital arguments. You think I'm joking, I'm only channeling the main idea about ""The Matrix"", it relies on the combination of individual perceptions, reality depends on what we see, it's a subjective process. You can build countless interpretations out of it, one movie did it without being too complex and by kicking some ass on the field of action.That movie is the Wachowski's brothers (now sisters) ""The Matrix"". Released in 1999, definitely at the right time. Indeed, every decade, sometimes more, there comes one game changer especially in science fiction, ""2001"", ""Star Wars"", ""Blade Runner"", ""Terminator 2"" brought something fresh and new, technically and visually and in 1999, the year that changed the face of cinema, there was ""The Matrix"", ""Avatar"" would be the following phenomenon but let's stick to the pre-millennium period, perhaps one of sci-fi greatest momentum, forever immortalized with the iconic bullet-time effect. I don't need to describe it, the effect was used in three early 2000's comedies out of 5, establishing ""The Matrix"" as an instant classic, along with ""Saturday Night Fever"" or ""Jaws"".Now, ""What is ""The Matrix""?"" asks himself Thomas Anderson aka Neo, suspecting that there's something in his surrounding world that looks too artificial to be believable, as if we came to an age where machinery has spread to all the aspects of life, so we can't really tell where the virtual worlds ends and the real one begins. But I remembered a research I made a few years ago, where I discovered that the opposite of virtual wasn't real but ""actual"". Virtual never intended to mean something that doesn't exist in reality, but something that carries a certain potential of existence and can either happen or not happen, if it does happen, it becomes actual. The merit only starts to exist once you decide it to be in an actual form.In ""The Matrix"", the most heart-pounding and thought-provoking aspect relies on this simple equation, whatever happens might be a dream or might announce a form of reality that is yet to be discovered but it's a matter of choice whether the hero embraces it or not. It's all a matter of taking the blue or the red pill. There's something both corny and genius in the pills metaphor, the idea that it's all a matter of a simple binary choice, exactly as if human thinking adopted computer binary programming. Yet each choice leads to a totally different scenario, one establishes your surrendering to the convenient and reassuring power of computer (why not after all), another your position as an enemy whose duty is to free people.Which is rather contradictory, why would you give anyone a choice to live in one of the world you intend to destroy, in fact, it's even interesting, if we take the notion of choice as luxury, wouldn't be the most ethical thing to do, to give people the possibility to choose whether they want to be controlled by the Matrix or not, rebels are revolutionary, not reformists. Well, we see one of the members Trinity (Carrie Ann Moss) killing innocent policemen so we're never sure we're dealing with the good guys in any case. Maybe living an ordinary life without asking too much questions would be the wisest choice. But I'm digressingThe film ventures in the realm of an artificial reality that still looks real and convincing thanks to a great design and a greenish tone that conveys the whole computer imagery and rather grim and bleak look of the dystopian future, without overplaying them. It's on the technical special effects that the film elevates the term science fiction, reminding us the core of the genre, it's all about scientific achievement and a fiction, a story where we find our own truth behind, a story that echoes our own uncertainty. The film was made in 1999 along with other 'existential' films but unlike ""American Beauty"" and ""Fight Club"", the film shows a clear enemy and antagonists, which helps to deliver its complex message; leaving us enough intellectual material to think about. It's one of these films that challenge your intelligence even when you try to determine its flaws.Some critics pointed out the use of conventional themes, of faux spirituality, but let's call them universal, for the theme of the Chosen One is only one facet of the story. Keanu Reeves as Neo is once again playing a hero trying to conquer his secret force. Morpheus is the wise man who believes in him. And Hugo Weaving is the image of the cold and bureaucratic force. But just because the antagonism is clearly established, doesn't make the fight even more complex, it's not just about taking reality back but convincing yourself that it's worth fighting for, it's exactly like jumping on a building, and convincing yourself that you won't fall, one of the best things about the film is that the initial struggle is more internal, it's between Anderson and Neo, and his conviction that it's worth fighting for.The final showdown establishes his rise to awareness and provides the film's climactic showdown but it's the only third act that could have worked for the film, otherwise, it would have been some faux spiritualism clichés one after the other. The film came as a right moment, it had the relevance, the resonance and the idea that we were all heading up to a world where we don't have to trust what we see. It's ""V for Vendetta"", ""The Matrix"" and any other movies that inspired conspiracies theories.",The Matrix
56,Pjtaylor-96-138044,A stone-cold science-fiction classic.,8,17 April 2018,"'The Matrix (1999)' is a stone-cold classic for sure, a science-fiction action thriller that has seeped into pop-culture purely because it is so fantastically constructed. It somehow manages to make its incredibly out-there concept digestible for mass-audiences without dumbing it down or marring it with profuse amounts of heavy-handed exposition. It's just as fun when pondering its existential themes as when delivering its phenomenal action-set pieces, all of which push the boundaries of both visual and practical effects in almost every area of the field. Keanu Reeves always gets a lot of credit for the amazing effort he puts into his stunt work and fight choreography (and rightly so), but major props must also be given to Lawrence Fishburne, Carrie-Anne Moss and Hugo Weaving who all put in fantastically physical performances in some very demanding sequences and don't seem to be talked about nearly as much as the film's stoic star. This goes without mentioning the stunt crew, of course, as well as everyone else behind the camera. The piece is never solely defined by its stand-out action scenes, which is why it works so well as a whole. Though each sequence is breathtakingly entertaining, it's only because they are contained in such a competent and interesting production that they work as well as they do. The whole picture is energetic and engaging, even if it has a few pacing issues and some story elements which are a little contrived. It's actually one of the best action films of all time. 8/10",The Matrix
57,Cineanalyst,"Neo-Wonderland of Noir, Philosophizing and Spectacle",10,3 September 2020,"I probably haven't studied any other film from the end of the 20th century more than I have ""The Matrix:"" as a philosophical, political and religious text; as genre entry from cyberpunk, to noir (or ""neo"" noir), and even superhero flick; and as reflexive visual-effects spectacle, mainly, while recently reviewing it for its ""Alice in Wonderland"" allusions. One of the most influential films of its day and, indeed, ever, I also find it continually interesting and thrilling. One need only sample the numerous imitations of the visual effects, fashion of the characters and style of the picture in subsequent movies to understand what a cultural touchstone it became.References to Lewis Carroll's Alice books are plentiful. Trinity's first messages to Neo conclude with the order to ""Follow the white rabbit,"" which appears as a tattoo. From there, a psychedelic connection is made between the books and film, including a trip to a rave and talk of mescaline recalling Alice's adventures with consuming mushrooms and other substances that altered her size. Neo also transmogrifies after ingesting the red pill. As Wonderland was a dreamworld, Neo also repeatedly wakes up, as if from a dream, after such curious events. He even talks to himself like Alice did, and both have something of identity crises. Stylistically, there are all the shared mirror, doors and staircase motifs, and the zoom-ins through the Matrix code have the appearance of traveling through rabbit holes. A similar symbolic relationship could be made of Neo's rebirth from his womb-like pod, as he's flushed down another sort of rabbit hole. Upon first exiting the Matrix, Neo literally enters the looking-glass--or, rather, becomes one with it. Before this, Morpheus explicitly cites ""Alice in Wonderland"" in comparison to Neo's experience--in a room with checkerboard floor tiles no less. Another children's book is once referenced, too, with ""The Wonderful Wizard of Oz"" (or, surely more often thought of, the 1939 film), written as an Americanized and dumbed-down version of its Victorian counterpart. Also note that it's the ""ignorance is bliss"" character--whose own name, ""Cypher,"" suggests a lack of critical thinking, as well as computer code--who mentions Dorothy and Kansas.Of all the genres one could ascribe to ""The Matrix,"" I find noir the most compelling, including as it applies to the Carrollian dreamworld and ties into the issues of choice and fate and the rest of the philosophizing. Noir, or more specifically neon-noir, style is established from the opening of the Warner Bros. logo, which appears in neon green over a black-and-white background. Henceforth, dark colors dominate along with the standard low-key lighting, as well as the neon lights and greens. Even the office exit signs are green instead of red, as if giving the greenlight for Neo to exit the Matrix. We also get some variation in color correction to distinguish the dream and real worlds. One of the main ways noir and Wonderland are connected here are by the wake-up calls. In noir, such a metaphorical awakening to whatever mystery or murderous corruption oft begins with a literal phone call. Sam Spade in ""The Maltese Falcon"" (1941), for instance, wakes up to a ringing phone whereupon the police inform him of his partner's murder. Likewise, Neo receives literal wake up calls from phones and clocks, but also in the first scene in which we find him, where Trinity sends through his computer screen, ""Wake up, Neo."" Moreover, all of the inhabitants of the Nebuchadnezzar hovership are only able to be awakened from their adventures in the Matrix via land lines, and they also communicate with members back on the ship through their mobile flip phones. Another noir device exploited is the cleansing rain, employed here for Neo's extraction from the Matrix. And, we get at least a couple femme fatale candidates: mainly, Trinity and, more briefly, the woman in red. Meanwhile, Morpheus fills the mentor role, and his name recalls the god of dreams and sleep. The other important names here also tend to take on a religious significance, which fits rather well with the implications of awakening, as well as fate and whatever variation on fighting corruption or evil characteristic of noir.Neo is a messiah figure. He's the ""One"" (even ""Neo"" is an anagram of this). Although there are other sectarian references and, generally, the picture is pluralistic, more specific to the Christian conception, as a Christ figure, Neo is awakened by ""Trinity,"" as in the one from the Christian doctrine. Although not antithetical to the predestined disposition many noir gumshoes find themselves in, this blatant religious allegory seems to me more consistent with the superhero genre--especially with Neo's Superman-like flying and other supernatural abilities and saving of humanity. Heck, just consider the similarities in how phone booths are used or the alter egos. Since the Richard Donner films, at least, Superman has been a Christ figure--crucifixion poses and resurrections included, and the theme has only become only more entrenched with the versions directed by Bryan Singer and Zack Snyder.Philosophically, the film most explicitly references Jean Baudrillard's ""Simulacra and Simulation,"" the book featured in Neo's first scene and hollowed out to the chapter ""On Nihilism,"" alluding to the fiction and meaninglessness of his existence inside the Matrix, as well as Neo's similarities with the original popular Nietzsche Übermensch, or Superman. Later, Morpheus quotes the ""desert of the real"" from the same book and within a TV-enclosed simulation no less. My main criticism of ""The Matrix,"" however, would be that it's too simplistic and unambiguous in its dreamworld and real-world dichotomy, including to sustain any sort of Baudrillardian or otherwise sophisticated postmodern exploration. That said, I think it does better with its other major philosophical or spiritual allusion, which like Wonderland is initiated by another sort of tunnel, as well as other sort of chiaroscuro effects akin to those of noir, the cave allegory of Plato. Theologians have spent centuries, too, on making Platonism compatible with Christianity, which makes for a nice fit for ""The Matrix."" Central to this is the Oracle--the sort of prophet that Plato's Socrates visited at Delphi. Indeed, the one in the film points to the words above her kitchen door ""know thyself"" in Latin, but which is actually an Ancient Greek aphorism from that Temple of Apollo. It's also a maxim attributed to Socrates.What I like most about the cave allegory, though, is that with its illusory, flickering shadows, it's well suited to cinematic reflexivity, as are dreams. For all its Baudrillardian and hamfisted cyberpunk polemic of man-v-machines, railing against the illusion of the Matrix, this is a film that is based in fantasy and spectacle. It's not that this can't be read cleverly: as a geek fantasy of mind-over-matter, of hacking, hiding and surviving in reality but looking cool fighting in shades, leather and trench coats when plugged in (literally plugged in--love the puns, including the bug one); as struggle against authority and conformity of corporate cubicles (even their names suggest a dull orthodoxy: Anderson, Smith) or literal silencing by Agent Smith's ""gestapo tactics;"" or, in light of the Wachowskis subsequent transitions, as a transgender allegory (reportedly, studio cowardice prevented there being a trans character on screen). All of which fits well with the Wonderland transmogrification, noir awakening and philosophical illusions. Peer into the looking-glass, however, or the reflections in bending spoons, sunglasses and skyscraper windows, and the most apparent dreamworld is film itself.The closest here to a film-within-film is the old-fashioned television, which Morpheus rather ironically employs to introduce Neo to reality and to explain the Matrix. This film and the art form in general are fundamentally about dualities, doubles, déjà vu, ""living two lives."" This is the basis of acting, too, of someone pretending to be another, of changing appearance inside simulations, of agents body snatching, of wanting to be ""someone important, like an actor."" It's also telling that the best parts occur in the simulations. Befitting the now-retro tech of the film, what with the land lines, flip phones, monitors and all becoming almost as antiquated as that TV, this is a film when films were mostly still films, albeit digitally enhanced. We're introduced to Neo with the computer screen reflecting back upon his face, or rather vise versa, as well as kung-fu training seen through computer code and many other shots framed by screens--mise-en-abymes, a world inside computers. This stands next to the best capturing of motion from multiple cameras with the bullet-time photography since the chronophotography of the likes of Eadweard Muybridge. Trinity's entire opening sequence runs through homages to masters of filmic spectacle past, from Hitchcock's ""Vertigo"" (1958) and ""The Birds"" (1963) to Spielberg's ""Duel"" (1971). It's not without irony, too, that these wannabe saviors of humanity, in fact, slaughter a lot of humanity, including in the ultraviolent lobby shootout, complete with slow-motion and Neo's trench coat framed at his feet like a superhero cape, or every time they kill an agent inhabiting another's body, such as after that Western-style standoff in a subway. This is a picture of illusion--a visual-effects spectacle. In the end, with the ""One"" synthesizing the duality, it's we, the spectator, who wake up from the spectacular Wonderland, the flickering shadows of the simulated world inside a film, and exit the dream.",The Matrix
58,gbill-74877,Iconic,9,30 May 2020,"Lots of fun, with many iconic moments. The martial arts inspired moves, slow motion visual effects, and concept behind a dystopian world where humans have been subjected by Artificial Intelligence are all fantastic. The film doesn't stand up to a lot of detailed scrutiny and is more about action than it is about the deeper themes it could have explored, but for me it was easy to go along for the ride and enjoy it. It's a great combination of science-fiction and action, the pace of the film is excellent, and the journey Neo is on to discover his ability to overcome the 'reality' around him is a joy to watch. There is something transcendent and powerful about it, a fantasy maybe or something with philosophical overtones, even if it is grounded in a popcorn flick. I'm not usually a big Keanu Reeves fan but he's fine here, as is the rest of the cast, Laurence Fishburne and Hugo Weaving especially. Weaving is Agent Smith, and has perhaps the best lines of the film, condemning humanity with a snarl:""I'd like to share a revelation that I've had during my time here. It came to me when I tried to classify your species and I realized that you're not actually mammals. Every mammal on this planet instinctively develops a natural equilibrium with the surrounding environment, but you humans do not. You move to an area and you multiply and multiply until every natural resource is consumed, and the only way you can survive is to spread to another area. There is another organism on this planet that follows the same pattern. Do you know what it is? A virus. Human beings are a disease, a cancer of this planet.

Morpheus shows Neo what the world is really like and who is in charge of the planet. Now Morpheus, Neo, and the rest of the group must evade these alien-like droids that appear as human. The fighting is great in this film. I am surprised that there is plenty of kung-fu fighting. The special effects were even better. They made this movie win a few Oscars.

62,CuriosityKilledShawn,There's something very familiar about all this.,6,24 May 2004,"I've always called the first Matrix film a rip-off. It's a mix of many different films put together with component parts stolen from the Terminator (robots rule the future and have enslaved the remainder of humanity), Total Recall (futuristic 'Is it a dream or reality' sci-fi) and even Johnny Mnemonic (futuristic cyberpunk trash starring Keanu Reeves as a guy who can plug computers into his head and 'go into them'), plus various other works by William Gibson and a lot of Anime.Thomas 'Neo' Anderson, is a computer programmer/hacker who meets with the mythical cyber-terrorist Morpheous, who asks Neo if he wishes to know the truth about the world or live a lie forever. Neo chooses truth and soon wakes in a gel-filled pod in a techno-hell future. His body, and billions of others, is nothing more than a battery to power the machines that rule the future (exactly what they do with this world that they now rule is not explored).Convinced that Neo is 'The One', Morpheous trains him to be deadly digital warrior, but this set-up doesn't go beyond fighting a sentient program called Agent Smith. The war against the machines comes later.There's no denying that the film, unfortunately, was massively influential for virtually every action film that followed. Gone was the 'Die Hard' formula where action was gritty, somewhat realistic, and with practical stuntwork. In it's place they all went for excessive CGI, green-tinted photography, impossible cameras, and impossible physics. The Matrix is semi-stylish with it, but it doesn't ever entertain or excite me.It's the style of the Matrix that's more fondly cherished than the story. It won 4 technical Academy Awards, proving that all the Matrix is is eye-candy. Call that narrow-minded if you want but I believe this movie is no more than a very, very popular cult movie.

Probably nothing new - just another review that worships ""The Matrix"".Yes, the film is perfect, perfect in any way you prefer. I just like almost all of us have watched ""The Matrix"" for ~20 times, in 2-3 years after it's release and each time that was unforgettable tour de force. The timeless plot, characters, action. It created a new dimension in movie making. Almost 10 years have passed since i saw it last time, and last week i got the blue ray of it, and sat down for a re watch, on my new projector and sound system. ""The Matrix"", to my little surprise, hasn't aged a bit. Really. The visuals still look the same as it was in the year 2000. Still. The same. After 15 years! After ""Avatar"" and many more visuals feasts that i have witnessed, the look of this film in my eyes hasn't aged a bit - i won't lie - i was surprised. Maybe it's because the driving force behind this masterpiece was always a plot, the characters and action wasn't over forced - it always looked as a natural thing of events. So i won't go in to details, plot - you all know it very well. What i like to say, is that you should check this film again if you haven't see it for some time, it really looks stunning. Ye, i said ""if you haven't see it for some time"" - i don't believe that there is a living human who likes to watch movies that hasn't see and admire this film before.",The Matrix
67,tabuno,Setting News Standards,8,18 January 2019,"6 September 2010. There are few movies that establish a new set of boundaries or geometrical growth spurts in the development of movies and as such The Matrix is one of them. This otherwise standard, predictable sci fi movie, however, incorporates an out of the box premise along with a dazzling array of special effects, especially dealing with martial arts, along with a twist or double-cross that is layered within this compact, consistently, inconsistent sci fi action thriller that makes its mark in sci fi history and movies in general. The Matrix establishes itself among a list of movie standards such as: Jaws (1975), popular mainstream horror movie and was preceded by Psycho (1960) and The Birds (1963), and more recently 1408 (2007).Ghost Busters (1984), a mainstream fantasy, comedy, horror movie.Speed (1994), mainstream action thriller, comedy drama.Wait Until Dark (1967), mainstream psychologal thriller.Dances with Wolves (1990), historical docu-drama.Spirited Away (2001), fantasy.Moulin Rouge (2001), musical.",The Matrix

69,The-Sarkologist,The nature of reality and how we deceive ourselves,8,12 October 2013,"My friend commented on how the theme in this movie really appeals to him at this time. There a numerous ideas that come out of this movie, and most importantly, for me to describe it, I will have to give a lot away. As such, I shall warn those who are going to read this, if you don't want your enjoyment of this film ruined, then I suggest you cease reading now.The major theme in this movie is what is reality. As such it follows the themes of movies such as The Truman Show, News From the Good Lord and Dark City, all of which are movies that I love. The difference with The Matrix is that it is much more action orientated. As such it should appeal to those who love post-modern movies and want a lot to think about, and it should appeal to those who love special effects and huge amounts of action.The movie is based around a man named Neo. He is a computer hacker and is being sort out by Morpheus, an unknown person. Morpheus is also being pursued by agents of some organisation that seem to be able to remove peoples' mouths, though to Neo this becomes a dream. When Neo finally finds Morpheus, he learns that everything that he knows is a dream. Reality is in fact far different. Neo is one of billions of people plugged into a huge computer system. He is there because in the early 21st century, humanity lost a war with the machines, and during that war the earth was blocked off from the sun. To get the energy they needed, the machines began to use humans. As such, they created an artificial environment in which humans live, and as they live, the machines live off of the electricity that the human brain produces.Basically the world in which Neo lives is not real - it seems real, but in reality there are things that happen that suspend his disbelief. He asks somebody at the beginning of the movie if he ever feels like he lives in a dream. The reply is ""of course, all the time"" but this comes from the mouth of a drug induced person. Once Neo is out of the matrix, he learns that Morpheus considers him to be the reincarnation of a saviour, one who can manipulate the matrix to his will. He also learns that these agents are not humans but security programs created by the machine to stop the free humans from destroying their power. These security programs are incredibly powerful in the matrix, but have no power outside of it. In the matrix that can appear wherever they like, do whatever they like, and take whatever form they like. In fact they will possess other people (or personas - the person's computer image - their real existence is in a tube in the side of a huge machine).There are a number of Christian parallels in this movie (though they are not intentional considering the idea is more Buddhist than Christian). The major one is in regards to the matrix and the reality. The world is like the matrix - it is real but we refuse to look beyond it to the heavenly realms. To us the heavenly realms are a fantasy and the world we live in is solid reality and when it comes to miraculous things then we conveniently look for a way to disprove them and if we can't then we ignore them. The truth is that heaven is very much reality, and this world is only a temporary existence created by God for us to inhabit. Neo takes the form of a Christ figure. He was in the matrix once and began the plan to remove people from the matrix and give them back their freedom just as Christ came to Earth to die for our sins in preparation for judgement day when we face God and explain to him why he should not destroy us. Neo's return parallel's Jesus' return. At first he seems like nothing, but the oracle tells him that he will be the one perhaps in his next life. This prediction comes true as he is killed, but as he has died in the matrix, he comes back to life. The matrix is not reality, and though most people, when killed in the matrix, will die in reality, the most hardy and strong willed of people can survive - Neo is such a person - but when he returns to life it becomes evident that he has gained immense power over the matrix. The final thing that I must raise is the description of Zion - the place where everybody will party once the machine has been defeated. This is a very biblical reference, and I think this is made in the movie as well. Zion is the hill upon which Jerusalem is built, so wherever one reads the word Zion in the bible, one reads Jerusalem. The city of Jerusalem does not correspond to the geographical city but it symbolises the place where God will live with his people. The reason that Jerusalem is used in this way is because it was the city where God's temple was built in the time of the Old Testament, and where the temple was, that was where God lived. The reference to Zion in The Matrix is a reference to the fact that when Christ returns, all who trusted in him will be in paradise, all that is rotten and decayed having passed away.",The Matrix

If it wasn't for Fight Club this would my favorite; I've been on the fence about it. The Matrix along with They Live have the best metaphors about life/society, most of which a lot of the population aren't woke to!For example the entire speech Morpheus says ""The Matrix is everywhere. It is all around us. Even now, in this very room. You can see it when you look out your window or when you turn on your television. You can feel it when you go to work... when you go to church... when you pay your taxes. It is the world that has been pulled over your eyes to blind you from the truth. That you are a slave, Like everyone else you were born into bondage. Into a prison that you cannot taste or see or touch. A prison for your mind.""

75,Dr_Coulardeau,Human cattle enslaved as Duracell batteries,9,15 November 2006,"It is vain to retell these films, or this trilogy. But I would like to insist on the general structure of the world that is depicted in these movies.There are three worlds. First of all the normal human world we know, New York essentially, that is in fact only an illusion created by the matrix, a program or a vast set of programs invented by the Architect who does not have any other identity and who pretends he is not human at the end. This illusion of a normal human world in which billions of people live has been created to simply control humanity in their growth, development, everyday life, etc. In other words we have a total digital dictatorship of which no human is conscious, well nearly no human is conscious. To keep this world in place and in peace the Architect has invented a set of Agents all called Smith, all similar, dressed the same, physically the same, etc, who have special powers to transport themselves at will where they want and to penetrate and possess any human being.There is then Zion, the resisting human underground world in vast caves mostly artificial and with some kind of metallic skeleton. This world is human because the people living there are humans, but otherwise it is an artificial world, but it is managed by a council of representatives though we do not know how they are selected or appointed. Apart from this council the main institution is the armed forces since this underground world is under attack and in the midst of a war with the third world that seems to be in some kind of objective alliance with the matrix world. Note this human world is so cut off from the normal human, world, because of the matrix, that the only way is to jump from the underground world to the matrix world and the very few who can cross have to be plugged on some kind of digital program that transfers them, body and mind, to the over-ground world and yet keep their bodies underground, though they are then connected to the underground managing unit, though it seems this managing unit for that kind of transfer is on board of one vessel or ship that is some kind of space ship that can get out of the underground city and circulate outside though they cannot normally reach the matrix world and they believe they can't reach the third world.The third world is the world of machines. Apparently they raise human beings to get their energy and thus fuel their machines. Only at the end the main hero Neo will reach Machine City and cast a deal with the representative of this machine world. That deal will enable Neo to get some kind of truce in the war that is raging at the very moment, then an alliance between the two worlds, Neo's and the machine world, against the Matrix because the Smith program has gone out of hand and the original agent Smith has multiplied to millions and has been able to simply take over the matrix world with only one clandestine link between the matrix world and the underground human world entirely controlled by a Frenchman, the Merovingian, who uses the Trainman and his train to smuggle things from one world to the other. With this alliance Neo is able to be sent to the matrix world that has become Agent Smith's world and to have the final fight with the original Agent Smith that will decide of the end.The color of the matrix is green, like all the lines of codes on the computer screens, lines that work from top to bottom and then it is not clear if it is from left to right or from right to left. Green is the matrix color, though the Architect is dressed is some light creamy white suit. The illusion of a human world created by the matrix is multicolored like our own human world. The underground human world is highly dominated by brown and all brownish shades of brown, and there are quite a few: the people are vastly diverse in ethnic origins and heritage. They are dressed in all shades of brown, with an alternative light grey. Agent Smith is dressed in black and is white, a color intending to imply we are dealing with a very pure white world. He is dressed in black and wears black glasses more like some kind of blind man than sunglasses. Finally the machine world is all kinds of dark grey and black but with systematic red eyes because these machines have red eyes, have eyes. At the end it is revealed that blind Neo is able to see this machine world as pure light from white to bright yellow and bright orange. []Dr Jacques COULARDEAU",The Matrix
76,zkonedog,The Perfect Mix Of Aesthetic & Story,10,12 March 2017,"""Wake Up, Neo"". With those three seemingly simple words, perhaps the greatest science fiction film of all time was born. Part sci-fi, part philosophical, part action-adventure spectacle, ""The Matrix"" represents a perfect mix of aesthetic and story on the big screen.For a very basic overview, this movie focuses on Neo (Keanu Reeves), an everyday workman toiling away at a software company and doing some digital hacking on the side. One day, Neo is contacted by Trinity (Carrie Anne Moss) and Morpheus (Laurence Fishburne), who tell him that the world he is living in isn't exactly real. He is, in fact, living in a simulation which machine overlords--now rulers of the planet--put in place to control the human race and use humans like batteries. Neo must then decide what he believes and if he chooses reality or the construct.Some movies feature incredible visuals or cinematography but are devoid of much story depth. Others are very story-focus but lack the visual component that any film needs to truly be memorable. What makes ""The Matrix"" stand the test of time is its ability to expertly combine both of those approaches.On one hand, this is as visually stimulating a movie as you will ever see. From the film's various color hues to the sleek costumes to the fantastic computer simulations, there's always something to marvel at. The filmmakers invented the concept of ""Bullet Time"" (action slowed down to minuscule movements without losing any clarity), which was a game-changer at the end of the 20th century. Because the visuals and atmosphere are so ""on point"", ""The Matrix"" is a film that will always represent ""the future"" no matter how far humanity progresses.At the same time, the film is as deep in story as it is brimming with aesthetic. I feel like the whole ""are we all actually living in a simulation"" thought-piece was hardly a topic until this movie thrust it into the spotlight. Now it gets brought up with regularity. ""The Matrix"" is also peppered with a philosophical bend, musing over issues like AI creation (and its ultimate ends), the nature of reality within a simulation, and belief in a higher power. While from the outside looking in this could seem like a ""characters in cool costumes kicking ass"" movie, it is so much deeper than that description.Overall, I consider ""The Matrix"" to be on my short list of ""favorite movies of all-time"". It never fails to draw me into its universe, its deeper themes are timeless and universal, and it came along at a time when those of a certain age consider it to be the height of cinema spectacle. To quote the film's protagonist: ""Whoa"".",The Matrix
77,Floated2,Great Sci-Fi effects can create a classic,8,11 January 2016,"The Matrix (1999) is basically the idea of The Matrix, an ultra- computerized sci-fi film by Andy and Larry Wachowski that has an excellent concept but squanders it by falling back on the same old tired action movie conventions. The Wachowski siblings have given us an hour's worth of excellent cinema, filled with fascinating ideas. The film begins where We start with a woman named Trinity (Carrie- Anne Moss), who seems to be on the run from a gang of Men In Black- types led by Agent Smith (Hugo Weaving). Luckily, she can leap tall buildings in a single bound, run around on the walls, and so on. So she gets away, but not before contacting a computer hacker named Neo (Reeves) by sending him a cryptic message on his monitor. Following her directions, Neo meets up with Morpheus (Fishburne), who is in charge of a ragtag team of humans from the late 22nd century. And why did Morpheus seek out Neo and bring him up to speed? Because Neo is The One; he's the messiah. He's going to save us all.",The Matrix
78,filipemanuelneto,"A lot of style, but that was good.",9,17 January 2020,"This movie is one of those classics that even those who have never seen know to hear about. And I say it is a classic because I believe it has already achieved this status. I was young when it debuted, but I remember the impact it had and there is no doubt that it left marks.I will not dwell on describing the story. I just want to say that I find it interesting the way it was developed. It's a good story and it keeps our interest until the end. The weakest part is the romantic plot of Neo and Trinity because the two characters never have any chemistry in the movie. In fact, the movie did not ask for romance. That was the biggest mistake of this movie. The characters have no humanity and look like machines most of the time ... The outfit, with those dark glasses until night and wearing clothes in various shades of black (I loved the cassock they got for Reeves, he could think of being priest if he ever gets tired of being an actor) gives the final touch. It's called ""style"".Keanu Reeves is perfect for his character. He is one of those actors I hate because of his lack of dramatic expressiveness, here as in other films he has made. I've seen asses more expressive than his face, sorry for the words but it's the truth. In this movie, he hardly even moves facial muscles. And the other actors (Laurence Fishburne and Carrie-Anne Moss especially) follow the same path. It's called ""style""! Luckily for everyone involved, the movie asked for this and it works well on the screen. Fishburne, especially, looks amazing. This is one of his best movies to date, in my opinion.The production values are extraordinary. In addition to a great soundtrack, we have great special visual and sound effects. Cinematography is one of the best and best achieved I've ever seen in sci-fi movies, and that's no small feat. The camera and film work is excellent.Okay, I may look a little rough, but I actually liked the movie. The biggest problem (and also one of its most striking features) is having so much ""style"". Not being a perfect movie, it has cleverly invested in creating a style of its own. Very superlative, here there is permission, even advantage, in overcoming the barriers of credibility and logic. There is no problem in that guy looking like a dancer when he fights. If it looks amazing on the screen, the film allows it, the film wants it. It's not about reality, it's about looking cool. And the film seems cool all the time, to the point that it is sometimes funny. It is no coincidence that the film yielded so many internet memes and humorous parodies.",The Matrix
79,Tweetienator,The Perfect Matrix,10,9 November 2017,"1999 got some of my absolute favorite movies done: Fight Club and Matrix, American Beauty, Sleepy Hollow, Blair Witch, Girls Interrupted, Cruel Intentions and Sixth Sense. 1999, really a superb year for the cineaste. The first movie of the Matrix trilogy got not only a most imaginative story but also a style and cinematography that was at that time (and imo still is) most innovative. And of course unforgotten are Keanu Reeves as Neo, Carrie-Anne Moss as Trinity and Laurence Fishburne as Morpheus, and last but not least, Hugo Weaving as Agent Smith.Lana Wachowski and Lilly Wachowski achieved nothing more than one of the modern classics with this movie. The following two movies of the Matrix universe are not that good, and I understand that some people argue that Matrix does not need additional parts or an expansion of the story told, but I like Reloaded and Revolutions anyway. Fight Club, Matrix, and Inception - for me some of the best fantasy/sci-fi movies ever made, like the first Alien movie and Blade Runner - modern movie-making at its best.",The Matrix

82,digitalbeachbum,There isn't enough weed you could smoke to make this worth your time,1,7 August 2016,"I have so many fatal flaws to discuss that it is difficult to imagine that this movie was ever produced. It just goes to show you that Hollywood is all about whores and money. That is what this movie is, a whore mongering, greedy, money making of BS and horrible writing.Hey, I'm like so many others and love the music and various individual scenes. However, the fight scenes become boring and a yawn fest. Once you realize that Neo is the One then all fight scenes are boring. He won't ever lose. He always wins. So what is the purpose of these elaborate fight scenes? Several fatal flaws in the movie are 1) the title: A matrix by definition has been used and abused by Hollywood for years.1) the need for land-line phones in the matrix is ridiculous. The creator of the matrix made the land-line phones. They are the matrix along with all the buildings, all the people, etc etc etc.2) the hackers go in and out of the matrix using land-line phones. They need someone to get them in and out, so how do they get in? No one is there to answer the phone.3) When Cypher sneaks in to speak with an agent then someone must have helped him jack in and out. So how does he #1 go in without someone knowing he is speaking with an agent and #2 how does he get out without someone knowing? 5) The premise that you control any aspect of your life other than the emotional response to the experience is all life is about; yet this movie wants to project the idea that if your life is a simulation then you have some kind of control over it. However, if your life is a simulation then I'm sorry to tell you that you have no control over it.4) the entire idea of the skies being scorched is interesting but it doesn't change the need to use humans for energy. Did you see the lighting in the clouds? The machines could tap in to the lighting and power a billion cities for decades with just a few lightning bolts. Why use humans? Just kill them all off and be done with it.5) the idea of a machine and AI (artificial intelligence) is a fun story but why are the machines bothering to do this and since they already know that they are created by humans then why stay on Earth? Why not go in to outer space? Why not explore the Universe? If so, then why go in to the Universe? The machine would already calculate that there is no god and there for existence is futile. They would become Buddha and thus peaceful.6) Why does Neo bother to fly. If he has control over the matrix and he is a simulation, why doesn't he just teleport to various areas. Why be limited by flight? 9) Why are the machines human like? Where is the precision? Why emotions? The movie contradicts itself on this part.7) If Neo can leap in to an agent and bust them open why not do it again rather than fight them? Why doesn't he hack them? Make them his own. Why bother to fight with fists?I'd love to see a Robot Chicken where the machines vs the humans is just a video game being played by some kid on a PlayStation. That would be freaking hilarious.Look the entire movie is fun to watch but as a whole it completely sucks 100%. It is a really terrible, entirely crap fest filled with so many fatal flaws that I rank it as one of the worst movies of all times with one of the largest budgets ever to be wasted.1/10 stars because of poor execution. The writers smoked way too much weed and were high when they wrote this movie. They also didn't understand anything about computers or the hacking or the logic of programming.(edit)
So in the beginning when Neo is learning about The Matrix, he does the jump program and his fall to the ground causes him to bleed in real life. This is a major flaw in the idea of the plot because Neo asks ""what if you die in the matrix"" and the response from Morpheus ""the body can not live with out the mind"". This would lead one to believe that the matrix extracts the mind from the body and captures it, separating it from the human body. If that was true, then there would be no body damage because their would be no connection between body and mind.I also do not like the idea of human bodies being used for batteries because it is highly inefficient. Geothermal or Fusion would be far better for making energy needed that trying to maintain billions of humans.",The Matrix
83,Anonymous_Maxine,HELL YEAH!!!,10,1 June 2000,"Finally a science fiction film that cannot be immediately dismissed as either unreal or impossible. How can anyone say that this isn't exactly the way that reality is? To try and disprove this view of reality would be like trying to disprove the existence of God. Maybe he's there, maybe he isn't, but no one can possibly prove it either way. It works the same way for The Matrix. It is possible that everything that we see is fed into our minds by machines and that we would never know it. Probably the only remotely convincing argument the other way would be that if that were true, why would the machines give us a movie like this to watch? It would expose them! But then again, maybe they just want to get us thinking, maybe to see how we'll react to the possibility of their existence. Maybe they are getting ready to present themselves to us. Robot rapture! Who can say that the Wachowski brothers are not messengers?
This is by far the best science fiction film that I have ever seen. Aside from the relatively plausible story, every other element of the film was spectacular! The special effects (which, in my opinion, usually take more away from a film than they add) were awesome, the fight scenes were incredibly intense, and the pace of the film itself was breathtaking. Every hole is covered up brilliantly, even down to a definition of deja-vu and a possible reason for why so many different foods taste like chicken. These little ties to reality are one of the best ways that this film was able to come off so realistically. The Matrix is absolutely not to be missed. Even people who don't like science fiction or even action films will more than likely enjoy this film. It is well presented, it is not unnecessarily excessive, and it presents the most innovative camera work in years. It has something for everyone, and will become a science fiction classic without a doubt.",The Matrix
84,JohnSeal,Massively overrated remake of Tron,4,16 April 2000,"Here's one film the hype of which I simply don't get. The special effects aren't that good, and the martial arts are junior grade HK stuff. Keanu is terrible as usual and Carrie-Anne Moss isn't much better. The premise itself has some promise, but we spend too much time in The Matrix, where the rules seem to apply only when the Wachowski Brothers want them too. Example: why do our heroes have to be transported through a particular phone wire? Why can't they use their ubiquitous cell phones? Could it be to set up some chase scenes? Why, in fact, does The Matrix include all these old fashioned wired phones, when the bad guys know well and good that the good guys use them as a means of transportation? Judging from the Reality that Fishburne and company live in, I'll take The Matrix any day over the metaphysical bollocks that apparently passes for real life.",The Matrix
85,GOWBTW,The one that started it all!,10,3 March 2005,"This is the ultimate of ultimate scifi movies! Here you got the hero named Neo, a computer hacker who is tracked down by a relentless villain named Smith. The scary part when Smith put this ""bug"" that entered Neo's navel, and the team had to track it and flush him out. Then you have this leader named Morpheus(Fishburne) who teaches Neo the ways of the warrior. I liked the training scene where Morpheus and Neo learn Wing-chun and the way they defy gravity was just awesome. And the speed, it's just phenomenal, I'm at complete loss of words for that. I liked the part where Neo evades the bullets being fired by Smith. And the way Smith moved was just unbelievable.The fighting scene is the best part of the movie, and the reason why I liked it is because it's not your typical scifi movie you'll ever see.

88,freemantle_uk,Rage against the Machine,10,26 June 2008,"The Matrix is a modern classic, a great sci-fi film that is bound in its approach in a number of ways. It is intelligent and thought, but also great on an action/adventure level, giving us the famous bullet time sequence.The film focuses on a computer programme, Thomas Anderson/Neo(Keanu Reeves), who is interested in illegal activities and wants to find out about the Matrix. He meets up with a group of people led by Morphus (Laurence Fishbourne). It is then that he finds out that the world he knows is not real and that it was really a computer programme to keep the human population in subjugation. He learns that during the 21th century man and machine went to war with each other, which the machines won and kept humans alive as a power sorts. Neo was taken out of the Matrix because it was believe that he was the one to save humanity.The film asks questions about fate and reality. It is influenced by philosophical ideas from people like Plato. It also reminds me of 1984 during the torture scene when O'Brien tells Winston that the party can alter history and reality with ease. I think as long as you are fairly clever and read a little then you would understand it easily enough. The Matrix is also influenced by Postmodernism where reality and images can be alter and are very influential, but if you know this then you yourself and change the world. It can also be seen as a criticism of science and machinery going too far. The film is also very popular with the cyberpunk sub-culture.This is a great film, but avoid the sequels like the plague, especially the Matrix Revolutions.",The Matrix
89,dee.reid,Can Special Effects Really Make A Movie?,10,9 November 2001,"Well obviously so because that really seems to be the only reason people like this movie.  From the sound of this you may think I hated this movie, but I didn't.  The special effects are truly breathtaking.  Don't get me wrong, I love this movie!  Thomas A. Anderson/Neo(Keanu Reeves) makes a horrifying discovery; that life as he knows it, is just a dream.  A cover-up for the real world.  The real world is basically nothing but endless and endless fields of comatose humans that are used by killer machines as a source of energy.  He is rescued by Morpheus(the great Laurence Fishburne) and Trinity(Carrie-Anne Moss).  Neo is later introduced to the ""real world"" and is informed of his role in the rebellion against the controllers of it.    Keanu Reeves is awesome in this movie.  It's glad to see that his stoner image is starting to fade away.  He was awesome in Point Break and Speed. The great Laurence Fishburne is just what he always is, great!  His role as Morpheus was probably the most important role in this movie.The main problem that I have with this movie is it's story.  It's basically the Terminator all over again except with better special effects.  Numerous influences from many other science-fiction films are everywhere in this movie.  Most notably The Terminator, Blade Runner, the Star Wars Trilogy, and even Jacob's Ladder(cuz it deals with issues of what's real and what's fantasy). Aside from it's flaws, The Matrix is still an excellent sci-fi adventure with some truly amazing stuntwork and breathtaking special effects.10/10",The Matrix

I can still remember purchasing my ticket back in '99, that clever marketing slogan at the front of my mind, and strapping in for what would prove to be an unforgettable ride. At the time, I thought it was a stunning accomplishment. An instant favorite. Seen in a modern light, a few of The Matrix's tricks and eccentricities have lost their sheen, but the overall package still works quite well.I can see why my college-aged self thought so highly of it, twenty-plus years ago. It's intelligent without being snooty, accessible without pandering, hip and slick with only a few whiffs of generational fade. A functionally smart summer blockbuster with hints (and occasional brow-beatings) of philosophical wisdom. It manages a tough balance between an innate grace and the constant risk of overstepping its own reach, brushing past edginess and into the trite. Ultimately, it's too cool to suck, even as its wardrobe has gone out of fashion and its plot has been stripped by imposters.The action scenes and special effects are largely to thank for that, still sharp and crisp despite so many years. The Wachowskis were wise to insist upon Yuen Woo-ping for the film's frequent fight sequences, given their essential reality-bending nature and Woo-ping's history with the Hong Kong scene. His touch gives those brawls, both armed and unarmed, an unfamiliar air that makes the impossible seem plausible and still sets them apart. The script is generally very good, too, although it sometimes, obviously, thinks a little too highly of itself. Everyone is SO GRIM all the time, which can feel smothering after two hours. Still, its ability to convey and explore some very tricky conceptual terrain, in a way that's both coherent and dynamic, is downright remarkable.Now into its third decade, The Matrix remains a great time, even if I might roll my eyes at a line here or there. Still an all-timer, though? Well, that's tricky. As a standalone, the movie itself probably deserves an eight out of ten, but its style, ambition and lasting influence merits a little extra credit.",The Matrix

This film made the loudest noise and propagated cell phone knockoffs, two sequels, and a very long-lived online Virtual Environment/Game. And of course, it put Keanu Reeves, Carrie Anne Moss, and Hugo Weaving on the map.I saw this film in Anaheim during it's first run, this film was released during the Dot-Com blitz and was an Anthem for Pirates and Hackers alike. Whole Usenet groups spring up overnight, and ""There Is No Spoon"" was being painted in Subway Tunnels just like ""Frodo Lives"" in the early 60's when Lord Of The Rings inspired cult-like activity.""What if I give you the Finger --- And you give me my phone call""This portrayal of open defiance against ""The System"" and it's ""Agents"" rallied people around the world to take up arms against corporate idiocy everywhere, I was very pleased to identify with it.""How can you talk when you have no mouth?"" -The Corporate response to any attacks by ""Little People"" is to basically cheat - In this film by literally removing Neo's Mouth.But Neo was the one who would be able to use the same Methods Matrix Agents used, to beat the main Agent ""Smith"" who was a program that developed an Ironically Human Hatred of Humans.There is so much in there, a lot of religion and philosophy is explored in this short film. But so much has already been said about this film, being a landmark event, there is nothing really much to add to what has been said about it.But the idea that what we can see, hear, feel, smell, and taste might just be fabricated for us by ""God"" or whatever, this was new to the year these films came out. Like The Thirteenth Floor which was released exactly one month after this was, this film presented the idea that we are not really here at all, we could be somewhere else altogether... And the idea of Virtual Reality is not really a concept of the 90's computer age, it was conceived in the book ""Simulacron 3"" by Daniel F. Galouye... I am not sure when this was written, back when he thought it up, computers were comprised of huge vacuum tubes and were the size of buildings, but somehow, Galoye saw into the future and that a kind of Virtual Reality was possible using computers.Even today, as we are on the brink of having 3D HDTV's in our houses, the reality of The Matrrix is not far away - If we are not already caught in it, if we are not already living in a Matrix type environment.And that is the question, isn't it? Because, it is all in our minds anyway...""I know that this steak isn't real""But we can still eat it. So, even without spoons, I can still enjoy this film 12 years after it was made.

Yes, and then some.'The Matrix' is a triumph. Yes, it remains a visually dazzlingly film, with its bullet-time moves and fast-paced kung-fu choreography, but what makes it a classic is its ability to move us emotionally. Too often in this post-Michael Bay world movies seem to think that action is enough to entertain, but what they seem to forget is that we must first care about the characters and the stakes before the action can do its job.Like any such film, there are holes in its logic should you choose to look for them, but this is a very well conceived and thoughtfully crafted world that the Wachowski's have built. It's totally immersive to the point that you don't even question it. Every single thing has been meticulously crafted.

him as a good actor or screen presence. In my opinion Reeves is very stiff & emotionless in nearly all his films but here he's kinda suited to this role because it's all very robotic, cold & techno. This film was ahead of it's time in it's look at a word completely advanced, reliant & controlled by technology, just look at 2021 now!!!! Yes this is a fantasy piece but it's nearer the truth than most would believe.Lawrence Fishburne is excellent as the Cool & serious as Morphius & Sexy Carrie-Anne Moss as Trinity is kickass & ulta cool & Joe Pantoliano is great & Hugo Weaving as great too in this top class cast.Hugo Weaving is scarily menacing as Mr. Smith & made such an unstoppable Villain & very memorable.Joe Pantoliano is funny & sly as Cyther & has some really great & memorable moments such as ""The Steak Scene"" that always stuck with me.Story: The everyday world is not real, enter Neo a man who enters the techno world of Cyber space where machines control everything & it's up to Neo as the chosen one to fight back with the help of some ultra-cool friends of the rebellion (Fishburne & Moss) & are at battle with the brutal Mr. Smith (Weaving) who is trying to stop them at any cost. There's alot more details & surprises that happen but it's best to just watch it & enjoy it.The Matrix is a total wild ride of a Cyber Thriller & has some of the most exciting action scenes ever, such as the lobby shootout sequence, this is a Classic & was on first impact. Explosive action & super stylish fighting & a dark techno Noir atmosphere all helped shape this into an instant Cult film.",The Matrix

Also surprisingly for a Sci-Fi movie, it not only goes for the plot, it also goes for action and holy crap the action is really awesome, just amazing in this movie.

But also, I knew this film would be successful, especially after seeing the original trailer.Even by the time Star Wars came out, I still felt this was the best sci-fi film to come out that year. The cinematography was edgy, and once again established a maxim which all sci-fi films should accept. It mixed in so many different elements: visionary special effects, sound dialogue, a little mystery, a little action, great kung-fu scenes, and plenty of cool production designs. All in all, a strong film, but it revealed too much of the mystery too early, which seemed to be the film's only downside. Carrie-Ann Moss, Laurence Fishburne, Hugo Weaving, and Joe Pantoliano were all good. But who would have guessed Keanu Reeves could carry a film like this!",The Matrix

Whether people understood it or not, people seemed to recognize the greatness of the existential cyberpunk kung fu mind bender.I loved it then and now watching it again for the first time in years that love changed but not waned. The layers, the metaphors, the symbolism, everything in this is spot on. The action is beyond reproach. So much so that it heavily impacted countless other films that followed it. It was a game changer, no denying it.Over twenty years later and this still absolutely holds up. There were a couple brief CGI moments that don't really look all that great today, but they don't detract from the movie and I'm not about to hold that against this.This is a huge recommend to anyone that managed to not see it. I'm not as down on the sequels as a lot of people are, but they definitely aren't on the same level and you could really just watch the first one on its own if you wanted to.",The Matrix
103,ShootingShark,"Flashy, Exciting, Punch-Packing, Visually Charged Sci-Fi Conspiracy Movie",7,7 August 2009,"Neo is a computer hacker searching for truths; he gets one bigger than he imagined. A group of rebels, led by Morpheus, reveal that the entire world is a simulation created by AI systems, and in the real world humans are farmed purely for the energy they produce. What's more, Morpheus believes Neo is a prophecied hero, the only man who can defeat the machines. Scared and disoriented, what does fate have in store for Neo ?The Matrix is a great action/sci-fi hybrid movie, with terrific fights (choreographed by martial arts legend Woo-Ping Yuen), great special effects and oodles of clever ideas, all mixed up into a thrill-a-minute action blockbuster of the kind Hollywood does so well. It leaves you breathless; the crazy ideas come so thick and fast, you're still absorbing the plot before you're into the next eye-popping action sequence. Having said that though, I must register a couple of criticisms about this film, and specifically the way the publicity machine marketed it as a revolutionary story with landmark visual effects. I don't think the story is really that original - plenty of movies have dealt with computer worlds (e.g. Tron, eXistenZ), the conceptual ideas appear in lots of sf writing (notably Douglas Adams and William Gibson), the structure comes from Alice In Wonderland and a lot of the plot from Masamune Shirow's manga Ghost In The Shell. The thing it reminds me of most is a 1976 Dr Who story called The Deadly Assassin, which features an extended fight in a neural-network virtual battleground called, you guessed it, The Matrix. So not so original then. The story is also inconsistent - we never really know what powers anyone has in the virtual world. Why does Neo survive death when we've been explicitly told (and shown) you can't ? Why does everyone use kung-fu - why not just mind-zap people ? Why does Agent Smith (a terrific restrained snarling performance by Weaving) get emotional when he's a computer program ? Having said that, I'd much rather watch a film like this, filled with interesting quasi-religious/philosophical ideas (the explanation for deja-vu, Smith's comparison of mankind to a virus) but which leaves them all hanging, any day. My other bugbear is the bullet-time shots, using multiple still cameras and computer interpolation to track round a slow-mo or frozen image - these are kinda cool I guess, but the movie has so much else going on, it doesn't really need a gimmick. Undeniably, the technique has been hugely influential though, particularly in videogames. What really scores for me in this instead is the good old-fashioned basics of film-making - good storytelling, great photography and music, a terrific sense of undiluted escapism and fine performances - how does Fishburne keep those sunglasses on ? Produced by Joel Silver, and followed by two sequels, The Matrix Reloaded and The Matrix Revolutions.",The Matrix
104,adamjohns-42575,Is this the real life? Is it just fantasy?,3,2 July 2021,"Much like 'The Truman Show' I have always thought that what I call life can't possibly be real. I think I might consider being watched by millions or billions of people a more enjoyable alternative than being taken out of the matrix though. However, I would question anyone who wanted to watch my life unfolding, especially the bits where I pick my nose or scratch my bum!The actual concept of the Matrix story isn't bad, as I've said, I can believe that this flimsy reality we live in isn't real, but I might be content to carry on regardless, rather than be taken out of it as Neo is. I, of course could never be considered special or necessary to change the future of the world, so perhaps it's best that they went after Neo instead.It's almost as if the aliens from 'The War Of The World's' succeeded in taking over the planet and then used the human race to fuel a need. And then Laurence Fishburne came along to disrupt their plans.Neo's adventures aren't too boring, but I'm not sure that Keanu was the best man for the job. He's still very much playing Ted ""Theodore"" Logan, if Ted finally gave up on The Wyld Stallyions and realised that he was actually quite good with computers. Perhaps Bill was holding him back? Although they may still be sharing the same brain cell?It almost seems to be a vehicle for Keanu to show off his martial arts abilities and show off his skills at talking techno babble. He does stand out quite badly against the other actors who are all very good.I have to say that I don't think that my brain works on all the levels necessary to follow this story fully. I like the Star Trek philosophy of having them explain everything as if the viewer is a complete and utter idiot, so that we can at least understand it. And slowly too.This is only the second time that I have seen this one though, so perhaps the third time will be the charm when it comes around again. Maybe 'Reloaded' and 'Revolutuons' will provide me with information that brings more relevance to things from this film?To be stereotypical, it is quite a ""blokey"" film, there are a lot of bullets used and lots of fighting scenes. I think this is to make it seem cool, but it just feels unnecessary to me, especially as the idea is that they're not even real? It also drags the film out quite a bit too.That might be why it somehow manages to be fast paced and slow at the same time. Honestly, I don't think I'm that keen on it, but I couldn't say for sure. I feel a bit like I'm stuck in some sort of matrix myself?346.55/1000.",The Matrix

The Joy Luck Club figured prominently in the course. I like the idea of combining movies and theory.I am now studying metaphysics, and any study of reality begins with René Descartes, the father of modern philosophy. Descartes began his intellectual odyssey with this question: How do we know that there is a reality outside our own minds? We each know that we have experiences, and we can be sure of these experiences; therefore, each of us can be sure that we exist. But how do we know that the internal experiences we have corresponds to objects outside our minds?This is the whole theme of The Matrix. Watching this film is like studying metaphysics.",The Matrix
106,davidmvining,A solidly good action adventure,7,22 September 2020,"I'm gonna be honest. The Matrix is overrated. It's good, a solid adventure story with great action, but it's pretty far from one of the greatest movies ever made. It has a bunch of pluses, and I understand why people fall all over themselves because of those pluses. However, at the same time, the third act doesn't really follow from the first two and I find pretty much every dive into philosophy the movie takes both unconvincing and unengaging, breaking from the film.Now, the first thirty minutes of this film are, well, they're fantastic. The steady build to the reveal of the world is so expertly doled out and handled. We get two real reveals, the first in the very first scene and the second thirty minutes in. The first is that we're in a world where certain people can bend the rules of physics manifested in impossible jumps. It's intriguing and an introduction to Trinity the character as well the rules of the world around her. We then get Neo, asleep at his computer, with a few lines of text mysteriously coming onto his screen, waking him up, and bidding him to follow the white rabbit. One meeting leads to another which ends up getting Neo in a room with three agents who place a weird, leggy, machine bug into his navel. This is weird stuff, and it's all just clues about what's coming. We, as the audience, still only know as much as Neo even though we've seen Trinity's ability to jump. Meeting Morpheus, Neo gets his red pill, his choice, and he ends up finally waking up to one of the great reveals in popular film. The change in aesthetics from the grounded reality in the Matrix to the hyper-stylized future tech and body horror that is Neo waking up in the gooey pod on the side of a giant building with flying machines and tubes connecting all over his body is amazingly effective.And then the movie loses a step. Neo has to recover and the movie takes some time to slowly get us and Neo up to date with the new reality. We get re-introductions to the crew of the Nebuchadnezzar, the ship itself, and the technical side of hacking into the Matrix as well as the instant learning mechanic that allows Neo to become adept at Kung Fu without years of training. Now, we probably did need a bit of a break from the ramping up of the first half hour, but there's something about this section that feels circular, like it's mostly treading water. There's some cool stuff in here like the fight between Neo and Morpheus to test Neo's newfound abilities, but there's also a lot of talking and explaining. The Wachowskis did their best to vary it up visually, but it's still a lot of exposition in a short amount of time. And some of it ends up feeling really wrong when you think about it like when Morpheus justifies killing anyone in the Matrix to further their ends (when you realize that the entire film is a manifestation of the Wachowskis' political philosophy it feels even worse).Now, the third act. The third act has some absolutely fantastic action, and I love the textual feel of fights. The dust that collects on everyone, the cramped quarters, and the rather brutal feel of it all is just great spectacle, but the fights revolve around actions that don't really seem to follow that well from what came before. We get so much talk about the bigger conflict, and it would feel like the third act should be that bigger conflict between humanity and the machines coming into play somehow. Instead, the conflict actually contracts with Morpheus getting kidnapped and Neo and Trinity needing to rescue him after one of the crew betrays everyone to get back into the Matrix (with some darn good reasons, I'd say). There's more action, but the stakes actually seem to contract with fewer players and an almost myopic focus on the saving of one man in the face of the larger conflict.Now, there's a problem through all the Matrix movies where the subtext is way too prevalent in the text and that it also ends up interfering with the actual story. The subtext of all three is choice within a system of control and free will, so that's where the source of the third act conflict comes from. It's not a story decision but an effort to force a story to fit the subtext, and I feel like that's handled rather inelegantly. The Wachowskis were treating the first film like they wouldn't have any other (a good idea in general), but their focus wasn't on making the story flow from beginning to end it was on getting their philosophical ideas in. It feels like they sacrificed a more natural third act to fit the story that came before so that they could make sure that this movie said what they wanted about choice. And I don't think they end up saying anything particularly interesting about choice through it all.Anyway, that's enough carping on my account. For all of my problems with the film's ability to manage subtext and text, it really is consistently entertaining. The action is just simply great, tactile, and almost painful to watch (my favorite probably being the Morpheus and Agent Smith fight in the bathroom). Actors are fine with Keanu Reeves firmly within his limited range, Carrie Ann Moss blankly falling in love (in a love story I never found convincing), and Lawrence Fishburne saying everything with great importance. Hugo Weaving is the only one as Agent Smith who seems to be having any fun with his part.It's a solidly good action film with one of the great first acts in popular film over the last few decades, a surprisingly slowly ponderous second act, and then an entertaining third act that feels like it could have been more. I kind of get the love, but I definitely don't share it.",The Matrix
107,Spleen,The most intelligent science fiction blockbuster in ...,8,5 September 1999,"... I don't know how long.  Probably that's why it didn't do as well as big, dumb, lumbering things like ""Independence Day"" and ""The Phantom Menace"", and a dozen or so films I didn't bother to watch.Much of what you will have heard about this film is false.  You will have heard that the premise is that we're all prisoners in a virtual reality world; but the premise is not that WE are prisoners in a virtual reality world - it's a good deal more interesting than that.  You will have heard that it's hip and cynical; but thankfully, it's neither.  You will have heard the word ""cyberpunk"" being used, with the odd allusion to films like ""The Ghost in the Shell"" and ""Blade Runner""; but it's NOT pretentious, deep-breathing, tawdry angst of that kind at all.  It's really quite charming once you get to know it.  Beneath all the up-to-the-minute computer gimcracks lies a gentle and trusting heart.The central character is played by Keanu Reeves, and I retract my claim that there's no use for the man.  Indeed he acts rather well.  Admittedly he plays a character who spends most of the film, and indeed most of his life, with the air of someone who (in the words of another character) isn't worried because he expects to wake up soon; but being able to do this well is being able to do something well.  Besides, we spend the opening half being at least half as bewildered as he is - even if we've read the plot synopsis.  When the set-up is revealed in all its glory I admit that one or two details are a bit far fetched.  But I never felt that my intelligence was insulted in the way things had been revealed to me.Special effects are marvellous.  I don't think I've ever seen computer-generated images look this convincing - usually they disfigure a movie - and there are several reasons why they work so well.  A dark (but attractively dark) style of lighting shows them at their best. Psychological tricks - well-chosen camera angles, misdirection - are used to make us believe in what we see: no-one makes the assumption that George Lucas made in ""The Phantom Menace"", that software alone will do the trick. And more to the point, a story has been chosen where the kind of technology favoured by Hollywood these days is not out of place.  The air of vague phoniness that computer effects impart, the sense that something is deeply wrong, is exactly what we want in a story where something really IS deeply wrong.Only two things let the film down: the last couple of minutes (and after two fantastic hours I can forgive a little fumble at the end), and a HORRIBLY synthetic musical score, which seems to be there only to make us glad when it stops.  Luckily it stops often enough and it only succeeds in ruining one or two scenes.  I don't know - maybe this kind of musical pollution has been around for a while, and I only noticed it now because ""The Matrix"", unlike the brainless action movies surrounding us on all sides, deserves better.",The Matrix

112,eric262003,The Movie That Made Stars Out of the Wachowski's,9,9 October 2018,"When it comes to the making of ""The Matrix"", this truly made the Wachowski's a household name. The only other film I could recall the Wachowski's direct before was the 1996 lesbian based film noir ""Bound"". So though they've been around the block before, 'The Matrix"" solidified their place in the Hollywood industry with fans always anticipating what their next film is going to be.It comes to no surprise that these siblings have been to movies goers since they were youths and studied the craft very seriously, even if it means recycling ideas from their predecessors but to good effect. The Wachowskis took bits of elements from various film genres to create an incredible masterpiece they can truly call their own here. Along with some butt-kicking from Carrie-Ann Moss and a new direction in his acting career as an action star from Keanu Reeves, we get an exciting action film that's second to none. There's no Shakespeare or Oscars in terms of acting (on the technical level the movie won 4 Oscars).""The Matrix"" is just an endless array of energetic, exciting science-fiction action adventure that's both over-the-top in its delivery an engaging story that's both surreal and riveting and has a climax that will keep you invested. The film depends heavily not on the acting or the story but very rich in terms of special effects that set the tone for action film that rely heavily in special effects to get their audiences motivated regardless if the film makes any sense or logic.Set in the year 2099, (though through the Matrix universe, the film looks almost the present) due to a virtual-reality brought on by evil overlords who want to gather human beings and enslave them for their own advantage in a quest for domination. It's much more complex than how I explained it. It's another epic battle between humankind and machinery. We all know who's the heroes and the villains right?So after our hero Thomas ""Neo"" Anderson (Reeves) swallows a red-pill by a charming rebel named Morpheus (Laurence Fishburne) has successfully unleashed a barrage of warriors who take to the skies by hovercraft as they venture to the real world and virtual reality world as they are up against an Agent Smith (Hugo Weaving) and his slick-dressed goons who are just computer enhanced holograms. Morpheus is depending on Neo to take down these villains and unplug the world back to reality.The chemistry between Reeves and Fishburne is wonderful in teacher/student format with fists of fury Trinity (Moss) thrown in for good measure. with Smith's ability to shape-shift, we can see bits of traces from Robert Patrick's performance of the T-1000 villain from ""Terminator 2: Judgment Day"" when he morphs into metal-liquid.As I've mentioned before, the technical team were the masterminds behind this film. Production designer Owen Paterson and comic artist Geof Darrow contributed in making this movie as stylistic as possible with the characters sporting their dark leather apparel and their sunglasses at night. The fight scenes were nearly flawless thanks to fight coordinator Yuen Wo Ping where the performers use tricks with the help of wiring which makes these characters fly like human marionettes.But it's the direction from the Wachowski siblings who created an atmosphere that closes the end of the 21st century on a dark and cynical note. With the Y2K fear that was buzzing around at the time, this film created and unbiased point of view of the computer industry and the social media platforms it has created. Like everything else the age of the Internet can be both a companion and a monster at the same time.",The Matrix

114,philip_vanderveken,"This will remain a classic, even in 20 years time.",8,4 April 2005,"I've never been a fan of Sci-Fi movies. It just isn't my kind of film and yet, I'm glad to make an exception for this movie. Somehow ""The Matrix"" was able to change my opinion about the genre. So what is it that makes this movie so good? Well, one thing is the story.The humans believe they live in a normal world in 1999, but in reality it is 200 years later. The world as we know it, was destroyed in a war between robots and humans. While the humans believed they could stop the robots by cutting off their power supply, the robots outsmarted them and made slaves of the humans, who produce more than enough energy to sustain the robot society. But to keep the humans happy and unaware of their actual situation, the robots have created a virtual world, a false version of 20th-century life. This virtual world is called 'the Matrix'. Neo has always been looking for the truth behind the Matrix and one day he gets the opportunity to find it out, thanks to Morpheus. Morpheus is one of the few humans who once managed to escape and he has been searching for the 'chosen one', the only human who will be capable of defeating the robots. He believes Neo is the one he has always been looking for...Next to the story, it is the special effects that have made this movie legendary. I guess everybody already knows this, but this was the first movie in which they have used the super slow-motion, called bullet time. Of course this was a revelation at the time, but even after all these years it's incredibly nice to watch. And there are more interesting things to be found. The makers have used computer animation to its full extend and have done that in an outstanding way. But next to the well developed story and the amazing special effects, there are still the actors. Sometimes, you might almost forget about them, but they still play an important role in this movie and have done that in a very good way.As a conclusion I just want to say that this is probably the very best Sci-Fi movie ever. It's full of action, it has a good story, a lot of interesting special effects and some nice acting. What could you possibly want more from a movie? I reward it with an 8/10. I'm sure this will remain a classic, even in 20 years time.",The Matrix
115,vengeance20,"Good, But Very Complex",6,7 April 2021,"Watched this film for the first time last weekend after getting the original trilogy on DVD. I've recently been watching films I've never seen before (big hyped/over-hyped ones) & given I've heard much about this film & how popular it is (even after 20 years) I thought to give it a watch. Now, I'm not big on Sci-Fi Films, so for me to even understand a gist of this film is something, well if Tenet is anything to go by this film is a piece of p!$$ to follow. But anyway, after watching, the film I think it pretty overrated for what it is.The plot is Keanu Reeves plays Neo, a man that thinks something is wrong with the world, and is struggling to find out what it is. He eventually finds Morpheus, who explains to him, why the world seems fake. He then tells him why the alternate reality, The Matrix was created & that Neo must fight an underground war against powerful computers who have constructed The Matrix.The plot of the film is simple enough, but how it is executed, is quite another level of confusing in itself. Now, like I said, I'm not big on Sci-Fi Films so maybe my understanding of the film from the beginning will be too casual & grounded for a complex film. The film has great effects for its time, not to mention how they haven't aged a bit since the release, however, the characters were dull & uninteresting, that or they didn't exactly seem engaging to me. The films plot wasn't at all engaging & I found it hard to understand what was going on by the time the film got to around the 2 hour mark. Which then brings me to my next issue with the film, it was too long, yes, the film was 2 hours & 4 minutes long & really did start to drag after the 100 minute mark.Like I said before, the effects are great (even for a film of its time), but the plot wasn't all that despite being simple, the execution of the plot, the pacing, the characters & the scenes were a little dull (not bad) but some what dull, bland & un-engaging to the point where you got lost in the final act & didn't know what was what or who was who. You just found it hard to get invested in the film never mind interested. Maybe its one of those films I need to watch a couple more times to understand it better, I don't know, but it may just be the case that I will never get it, just like I'll never get the over hype this film has.6/10.",The Matrix
116,screenman,Something For The Nerds,7,20 August 2009,"'The Matrix' contains some of the most spectacular special effects and action sequences of any movie. Judged by those alone, it would definitely qualify 10 stars. There's an excellent cast who make a sterling effort on sets that must - for the most part be virtual. All of the other standards of sound, lighting, directing are right on the money.As to the script - well it's little more than an endless stream of flatulent gobbledegook. Applaud or yawn, as you will. And as to the science fiction element; well that's plain bonkers. Machines breeding humans to exploit their brain energy? Those machines must be daft as brushes. There are far more efficient ways to create power. We should know; we breed the other domesticated species for just that purpose.Marvel at the technical elements but don't be taken in by them. This is a very simple movie when the Gothic grandeur, computer junk, and action sequences are set aside.I suspect that the strength of its appeal derives from the fact that it is basically the time-honoured 'rite of passage story' which is probably older than our own species. Basically; a young man must advance and prove himself as leader, gain the respect of a loyal band, then confront and defeat a powerful enemy.

The acting by Keanu Reeves, Laurence Fishburne, and Carrie-Anne Moss are all good.If you're expecting a big masterpiece, you might (or you might be a fan), but for me, it wasn't all that great as people said it was. Great plot, great action, great visual effects, but its plot falls short.",The Matrix
118,bkrauser-81-311064,Knocks on the Door of Greatness,9,2 June 2017,"There is a connection to be made between The Wachowski sibling's stylishly heady Matrix Trilogy (1999-2003) and Monty Python and the Holy Grail (1975). Hear me out; the silly jokes and outlandish scenarios of Holy Grail has been repeated, referenced or emulated in multiple movies, television shows and among the viewing public for well over a generation. So much so that when I first watched Holy Grail in college I was not as amused as I should have been simply because everything looked and felt old hat to me.The spirited youth of today probably get the same woebegone sense of déjà vu when sitting back to watch The Matrix (1999), a film so revolutionary for the sci-fi action genre that it's techniques have been repeated ad nauseam. Bullet time, view morphing, digital rain, all used and popularized by The Matrix. the effects were so revolutionary in-fact that they won the film four technical awards at the year 2000 Oscar ceremony beating out the likes of Star Wars: Episode I – The Phantom Menace (1999) which believe it or not was the odds on favorite.The story of Neo (Keanu Reeves) is a pretty straightforward hero's tale. An office drone of little importance discovers a group of rebel hackers who think he's their salvation against their enemy. Simple right? Their enemy*spoilers*is killer A.I. which has destroyed the world and cloned humans as part of an organic battery farm to power complex machines and robots. Those cloned sleep in a stasis, dreaming the same dream creating the world Neo thinks he knows, also known as the Matrix.The Matrix isn't just known for its special-effects and blockbuster sensibilities, its also known for contemplating theories about human consciousness and philosophical theory. These are weighty themes that the Wachowskis would return to in Cloud Atlas (2012) yet here the thought process is more cogent and even frightening to contemplate. Is the world truly what we perceive, taste and feel? Or is there something outside of ourselves, controlling us to serve sinister ends.Heaven, hell, allegory of the cave, it's all in there in a diluted format and packaged for easy consumption. Yet even for all its kung fu and bullet dodging the movie didn't make as big a splash as one would have hoped. It wasn't until after it was released on VHS and the burgeoning DVD market that the film became a full-blown success worthy of lesser sequels. And once people actually saw it; watch out! Not since the criminally underrated Dark City (1998) had people been exposed to such radical ideas in films. College courses started studying the film, fanboys raved and discussed the film at length, even a cottage industry of animes based on the films sprouted up (there is much contention as to whether The Matrix was a blatant rip-off or homage to Mamoru Oshii's Ghost in the Shell (1995)).Today The Matrix is considered a benchmark of science fiction films taking its place among Blade Runner (1982) and Star Wars (1977) as a flick worthy of intense analysis and debate and passionate fandom by those who enjoy such things. Will following generations continue to pay homage to it? Keep it in the pristine echelons of sci-fi greatness? Or will The Matrix and its sequels be relegated to almost-classics like Logan's Run (1976) and Soylent Green (1973)? My sincere hope is people won't decide to tune into something completely different.",The Matrix
119,Lady_Targaryen,Welcome to the Real World,10,14 July 2006,"''Unfortunately, no one can be told what the Matrix is. You have to see it for yourself''. This is one of the great sentences of this awesome movie, and also when the real adventure starts; with a great cast,special effects that made a revolution and an excellent story, ''Matrix'' really is one of my favorite movies of all! I am very happy that neither Ewan McGregor and Leonardo Di Caprio were cast to be ''Neo'', because I cannot imagine a better Neo then the one Keanu played.One of the things I love about this movie, is all the discussions and the ideas said through metaphors that are applied to our present society as well as many references to famous literary like ''Alice's Adventures in Wonderland'', Things like the government controlling us, the manipulation that almost all people suffer and even values like the world's pollution,religions, and big population that will eventually bring problems or even the destruction of the human race, is discussed in a covered way in the film. (And I need to say, that the debate about what we define as being real or not, is another good thing to make people think about, as well as the information about human behavior, destroying all the living things and multiplying everywhere we go without ''balance''.)The Computer hacker Thomas Anderson, well known in the web as ''Neo'', lives an ordinary life working in a respected Software Company. The problem is that he has doubts about the life he is living, and sometimes he doesn't know if he is dreaming or awake. When he contacts Morpheus, considered by the authorities as one of the most dangerous man alive and joins his rebel army, Neo finally sees the reality that happened in the world:More then 150 years in the future,the world has been devastated and controlled by very intelligent machines, who created a fake version of 20th-century life-the ""Matrix""-to keep the human slaves satisfied, while the AI machines draw power from them. Neo is considered by Morpheus ''The One'', the guy who will lead the humans to overthrow the machines and reclaim the Earth. But Neo needs to learn a lot of things first, and being haunted by the Matrix 's''agents'' (a computer program that take on human form and infiltrate the Matrix to control everything and kill the rebels) will give him a very hard time.",The Matrix
120,TedStixonAKAMaximumMadness,"""The Matrix""- An excellent and often-clever Sci-Fi adventure. Though not quite the classic it has been idolized as.",9,20 January 2017,"Even nearly twenty years after it was unleashed onto the masses, ""The Matrix"" has remained one of the most beloved and cherished Sci-Fi feature films of all time. For its time, it was a revelation... not only in its incredible achievements in cutting-edge visual effects, but in another unique way: it made a lot of people realize just how awe- inspiring and thrilling the science fiction genre could be. For many people, it is a modern cinematic classic. A benchmark in movie-going history against which many other movies are judged.Me? I think it's a darned good film. Even a great film. But I was never quite as in love with it as many others. I don't necessarily think it's quite the classic it's been built up as. Though it is definitely one of the best action-extravaganzas of the 90's. That is something I can say for sure.We follow Thomas Anderson (Keanu Reeves), a computer programmer who lives a double-life as an infamous hacker known by the moniker ""Neo."" Troubled be feelings that the world is not what it seems, he soon encounters a group of freedom fighters including another hacker called ""Trinity"" (Carrie-Anne Moss) and a mysterious man known as ""Morpheus."" (Laurence Fishburne) Neo eventually discovers that he is living a lie- the world as he knows it is actually an advanced computer simulation known as ""the Matrix"", where humans are ""plugged in"" and live normal day-to-day lives while their flesh-and-blood bodies serve as sort-of organic batteries to power an advanced artificially intelligent legion of machines. Freed from the Matrix, Neo joins the other freedom fighters in a post-apocalyptic world, where they lead a brave resistance against their machine overlords and attempt to free more and more people from their grasp. Whenever they ""jack in"" to the Matrix, their knowledge that it is merely a computer program allows them to perform superhuman feats, which is a key in their battle against the program's dreaded line of defense known as ""the Agents""- lead by the nefarious Agent Smith. (Hugo Weaving)The film is renowned for it's high-end and cutting-edge action and visual effects, in addition to it's often philosophical and metaphorical storytelling. And I do very much think these aspects remain strong and vibrant even to this day. The film was written and directed by the Wachowski siblings, and they are definitely incredibly gifted visual storytellers. The weave wickedly exciting sequences of action and suspense with ease, and are able to craft identifiable and enjoyable characters to populate their tale. Their keen ideas in pushing the bounds of Computer Generate Imagery are also just magical, and the film's sequences of what is now known as ""bullet time"" were absolutely spellbinding when the film was initially released. There's also plenty of symbolism and references in the writing that are a lot of fun to analyze and look into, which adds another layer to the proceedings. In a weird way, it is an oddly religious film, though not in that it is trying to push an agenda so much as it tries to draw parallels with biblical figures to hammer home the story being told.The cast is also phenomenal in their performances. Reeves might have started out in humorous roles early on in his career, but here he proves himself to be a capable and enjoyable action hero with just enough pathos and self-doubt to keep him grounded in reality despite the broad and intricate concepts of the story. Moss makes for a good supporting lead, and is able to kick butt with the best. Fishburne is phenomenal as a sort-of prophet for the freedom fighters, and his booming voice and imposing figure make him a worthwhile and powerful leader. Supporting roles by the likes of Joe Pantoliano and Gloria Foster are also exceptionally well cast and played. But the breakout star is definitely Hugo Weaving's wonderful mustache-twirling villain Agent Smith. Weaving is just such a delightfully vile presence, and he's ideal in the role. He's the sort-of character you just adore hating. Wonderful work on his part.So, with an excellent cast, first-rate direction and clever symbolic storytelling, what can there be to dislike in the film? How can I deny that it is a masterpiece of modern filmmaking? Well, it's the fact that the movie isn't nearly as clever as it likes to think it is, and the fact that as a result of this, it comes off as a bit forced and pretentious a bit too often. As complex as it can be, and as clever as certain sequences are, it unfortunately tries a bit too hard and comes across with all the subtlety of a brick to the face. Subtle religious imagery can add a lot to the film as it does in some sequences here... but it isn't exactly subtle when our heroes' name is literally an anagram of ""one"" and he's literally called someone's ""personal Jesus"" at one point. A bit on the nose, don't you think? One scene, you'll have a very tasteful reference to a philosophical concept or a piece of religious iconography... but in the next scene, it'll get spelled out for you all too clearly. And it makes the film seem a bit shallow. As though the Wachowski siblings didn't trust the viewers to be smart enough to understand what they were doing. Which then makes it feel like you're being talked down to. It really bugs me, because so many people are so in love with the symbolism and philosophy on display... but they don't seem to realize that it's actually pretty basic and being force-fed to us. It's clever, sure. But it's not that clever. Still, I cannot deny that outside of this issue, everything else functions perfectly. ""The Matrix"" is a thrilling, entertaining and exciting adventure with quite a bit going for it. It just isn't quite perfect. And so, I give it an excellent 9 out of 10.",The Matrix

122,bandw,"Much glitz, little content. [spoilers]",3,6 November 2001,"You cannot help but be impressed with the tremendous amount of work that went into the making of this movie, but the result is much flash and dazzle with very little content.  I would have hoped for more.The plot is so confused and confusing that I gave up trying to make any sense out of it after about 20 minutes.  The plot line ultimately reverts to a classic good-guys vs. bad-guys shoot-em-up.  The movie is kind of a ""Karate Kid"" on steroids, except that the characters in ""The Karate Kid"" are much more involving.The subtheme concerning the nature of reality adds no new insight in trying to answer this eternal question.  Any child who stops to think about the artificial reality created strictly by the mind in the dream state has gotten as far as this movie makes you go.  ""The Forbidden Planet"" examines this question in a much more interesting and thoughtful way.The subtheme concerning finding ""The Chosen One"" seemed to be thrown in as an attempt at trying to give the hopelessly misguided script some heft.  Some ""meaning.""  If you want to see a beautiful and sensitive treatment of this, see Scorsesse's ""Kundun.""Except for Fishburn, the acting was uniformly wooden. Keanu Reeves seems to have the emotional range of a potato.  I wound up not caring for any of the people in this movie - whether they lived or died made no difference to me. I found the love interest unbelievable.The intro to the DVD made me think that I was going to like the music at least.  But I cannot even remember this movie as having a soundtrack, it was so unmemorable.The agents for the Matrix were stereotypical, in a movie that seemed to want to break stereotypical images - like the supreme Mother being an aging and unattractive lower middle class woman.  If you are really thinking about how to be innovative in portraying evil, think of the devil in ""The Last Temptation of Christ.""I think about this movie in comparison to ""2001"" in trying to figure why I liked ""2001,"" but disliked this movie so much. Both movies have memorable images, but ""2001"" creates a sense of beauty and mystery, whereas ""The Matrix"" creates a sense of anxiety and dread.Ultimately I found ""The Matrix"" to be drab, depressing and cold. I found its glorification of violence repellent.",The Matrix

124,OJT,The ultimate sci-fi movie!?,10,13 August 1999,"Just seen the Matrix for the 3rd time, and I can't help still being astonished! The first time was compelling - a shock. Knew I had to see it again before the film was even over. The second time it was quite different. Now EVERYTHING got clear, also what I couldn't figure out the first time. This third time I'm convinced! The plot has no holes. It's a fantastic story, the script is unpresidented in the story of sci-fi movies! It's all so logical, and when was a sci-fi just all logical!? The story is so good that the 2nd and 3rd coming from the Wachowski's can't simply fail. Everyone need to know more about the Matrix, and how the ""neo Christ"" in the 3rd episode will save the world - that is IF he does! The special effects are awesome, and not ridiculous as in most sci-fi movies. The players are great, the agents are great ""machines"". The fun with all the mysterious links and references are the spice of the film, and the copying of lots of known movie scenes are so delicately done! My earlier sci-fi-best ""Bladerunner"" has not only been thrown second, it's almost been demolished!!! The Wachowski's for president and vice president. Neo for God! Matrix for 20 - let us just start believe enough - let's start knowing it!This film is just too good to be true - genius!",The Matrix
125,DeeNine-2,An action/adventure future?,6,12 October 2002,"What can I possibly say about this movie that hasn't already been said? There are over twenty-six hundred comments at IMDb and another twenty-five hundred at Amazon. There even seems to be some block ""reviewing"" from young Christian groups enthusiastically pointing out all the parallels to Christ's life: Neo, ""The One,"" ""Trinity,"" saving humankind, and being lifted up to heaven, etc. I would add that directors Andy and Larry Wachowski touched some other religious bases as well. Note that Gloria Foster is ""Oracle"" (Greek mythology), that Lawrence Fishburne is Morpheus (of the Underworld) and that Joe Pantoliano is ""Mr. Reagan"" (a little secular allusion here). The band of heroes are also referred to as ""freedom fighters"" to recall our ex-prez's words. (But never mind.)The main thing to understand is that this is one very popular and very arresting movie, the sort of thing Hollywood producers love; in fact all of Hollywood loves The Matrix because it gave work to so many. Scrolling the credits takes longer than your mother's phone good-bye. The Matrix is an industry in itself, something like Star Wars and Rambo.But is the movie any good?Well, it's not much on video. The DVD is undoubtedly an improvement, and on the silver screen it might lean you back in your seat. The cinematography, sound and special effects are first rate.But I mean philosophically speaking?I think we can get a hint from a review that began (and I quote) ""Why can't all movies be this good? -A 12-year-old viewer."" Indeed, this is the question all those marketing minds in Hollywood are asking. The true blockbuster action/adventure/sci-fi movie aims at a male viewer of about 18. Ideally the range would include 12-year-olds to thirtysomethings. Any philosophy beyond that mental age is burdensome.So you don't think it is a philosophically interesting movie?Actually I do. I just don't think it's original. I mean Plato's cave allegory is over two thousand years old. And let's not forget The Wizard of Oz (1939) or even The Truman Show (1998). Any science fiction buff can point to half a dozen precursors.Isn't that stretching it a bit?Okay, how about this short story from half a century or so ago called something like ""The Perm-Machine."" Everybody in the future society is working their nine-to-five tails off for a TEMP--that is, for a few hours in the box hooked up to the feelie machine complete with 3D screen, surround sound and electrodes attached to your every neuron so that the complete, thrilling, all senses experience of the greatest adventures in life are theirs, including sex, drugs, heart-pounding action and other sensual pleasures. But what everybody really wanted was a PERM, which would place them in the box permanently hooked up to the electrodes and intravenous drips, etc. for the rest of their lives, a kind of virtual reality heaven on earth.What about the acting?Forget the acting. It was okay. Consider this instead: we are going to become software. There isn't going to be any ""warfare"" between man and machine with the human spirit triumphant. Instead, we are going to become more and more attached to our machines, our computers, our chips, until at some point (see Ray Kurzweil's The Age of Spiritual Machines: When Computers Exceed Human Intelligence or Pierre Baldi's The Shattered Self: The End of Natural Evolution) the line between us and machine will be completely blurred. And then, molecule by molecule, we will DISAPPEAR, and at no time will we even realize it happened!The Matrix is a vision of the future, but it is a hopelessly anthropomorphic vision, a kind of action/adventure director's scan, extrapolated from the present. Where artificial intelligence, virtual reality and the prospect of quantum computers is taking us cannot be envisioned at all. Some people call this the ""singularity"" factor. The future (and by the way, most of the audience of The Matrix will live to see this) is like the horizon of a black hole that we accelerate toward, never able to see beyond that horizon until we are IN.(Note: Over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book ""Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote!""

126,sme_no_densetsu,"""Unfortunately, no one can be told what the Matrix is. You have to see it for yourself.""",8,14 December 2008,"""The Matrix"" is among the best sci-fi films ever to come out of Hollywood. In it, a hacker learns the truth about the nature of reality and joins the fight for the freedom of the human race.On the surface, the cast might seem slightly underwhelming. I wouldn't say that any of them are great actors, more like good actors who can nail certain types of roles. Luckily, they all seem to have been cast in precisely the type of role for which they are best suited. So, I have to give the actors credit but also the casting directors.The action is undeniably the main selling point here. It was breathtaking at the time and while some of the effects work doesn't look quite as polished as the films that have followed (including the sequels) it still retains a sense of wonder. This is definitely a film designed with a unique style in mind.All of which is not to say that the script is merely an excuse to get from one set-piece to the next. The underlying idea of the Matrix is an interesting one and the film-makers get most of the exposition out of the way early on so as not to slow down the later stages.The Wachowski's direction is solid throughout though not quite as slick as it would become later on. Their style suits the film well and delivers the goods in a film that's all about 'the look'. The music is also well-handled with some fitting soundtrack choices and a better than average score.All of this makes for an essential sci-fi/action hybrid. It may be a stylish film but that doesn't mean that it falls into the trap of emphasizing style over substance. Definitely recommended as a film to put your high-def system to the test.",The Matrix

I disagree.  Keanu Reeves brings little more to the role than the ability to look cool dressed all in black.  Not that he gives a bad performance, just that there is little empathy there.In this case, though, that hardly matters.

130,Screen_Blitz,"Innovative and exhilarating in both an epic and visual scale, The Matrix is a groundbreaking thrill ride",9,7 February 2017,"What if our world is just an illusion and our reality lies inside high-tech computer system? This thought-provoking and reasonably complicated concept is the premise in this exhilarating sci-fi action thriller directed by The Wachowksis who debuted in their career with the neo-noir thriller 'Bound' in 1996. Breaking numerous grounds of both the science-fiction and action genre, this cyberpunk thriller sees the duo filmmaking team operating on a solid balance of complex, innovative storytelling and groundbreaking visual effects that no one before the late 1990s had seen before. The Wachowskis bravely accomplish this feat by introducing a highly cerebral concept that not only strikes the human pulse but feels entirely original, tackling on themes of philosophy, religion, and gripping social commentary of how technology plays a vital role in our society. With almost two decades past, this film has established many elements that have become highly influential to the science-fiction genre today. This film follows Thomas ""Neo"" Anderson (played by Keanu Reeves), a software engineer during the day and computer hacker by night who finds himself chased by a sentient Agent Smith (played by Hugo Weaving) who are set to kill him. He crosses paths with a black suit agent named Morpheus (played by Laurence Fishburne), he learns that all of mankind is a simulated reality known as the Matrix, operated by cyber intelligence, and the real world lies in a futuristic universe where lives are operated by a series of computer systems. When an army of malware machines begin taking over the Matrix. Neo must join forces with Morpheus and fellow computer hacker Trinity (played by Carrie-Anne Moss) to lead a rebellion against these entities lead by Agent Smith who's causing it.Although the plot is not an easy one to follow, it does almost nothing to takeaway from the absorbing beauty of both The Wachowskis' thoughtful direction and mind-bending script which energized the story in a shiny, cerebral fashion. In further words, the Wachowskis intend not to plunge you into a psychological mind-rape of convoluted storytelling but to stroll you through cutting-edge journey of discovery. Paying homages to classic stories such as Lewis Carroll's 'Alice in Wonderland' while revitalizing the innovative dystopian genre, this film operates with tour-de-force storytelling that takes viewers on a pulse-pounding, frenetically paced adventure through a mind-bending world of simulated reality and psychological deception. And the plot unfolds in a complex balance of exhilarating action sequences including the newly introduced bullet-time slow motion sequences, and a cerebral narrative that tackles on philosophical and religious themes. The action consists a blend of martial arts action and frenetic shootout sequences complete with eye-feasting visual effects and slow-motion editing. Arguably the most pulse-pounding action sequences comes during a hyperkinetic lobby shootout scene. The scenes are all shot with innovative cinematography. As for the narrative which is also written by the Wachowskis, the plot follows the lead character Neo as he must learn the truth behind the fake reality he's been living all his life and fight against the evil forces who carry convoluted plans turning the real world he thought as a parallel universe into a world of hell. What transpires is not only a mind-bending journey through a series of hyperkinetic action set pieces and sassy, cyberpunk imagery, but also the lead character who's reveal to be a God-like figure who's chosen as the savior of humanity in a plot intended to pay homage to a biblical epic (with Alice in Wonderland slapped into the mix). And with strong efforts, the Wachowskis take just enough time to flesh out most of the characters.Following the decline of Will Smith, the Wachowskis were able set their eyes on a charismatic actor who happened to be no one other Keanu Reeves. Cashing in on the lead role, Keanu Reeves delivers an incredible portrayal as the reluctant action hero Thomas ""Neo"" Anderson who evolves from a struggling white-collar worker into a biblical-like hero with a highly train set of skills in both hand-to-hand and armed combat. Thus, he is granted an opportunity to demonstrate his adrenaline action testosterone in a series of frenetic action set pieces. Alongside, he also demonstrates an engaging camaraderie with Laurence Fishburne who gives a riveting portrayal as Morpheus, the man who takes Neo under his wing into the imaginative alternate reality that Neo was never aware of. Fighting along their side in battle is Carrie-Anne Moss as Trinity who shows her incredible badass persona in which we are greatly introduced during the action-heavy scenes. Then there is the main villain Agent Smith behind the evil scheme, and he is played by Hugo Weaving who delivers a stern, heart-stopping portrayal as the devious man suited in a tuxedo and shades. In shorts, Weaving pulls no punches when letting out in the dubious attitude in his character. The rest of cast is consists of Joe Pantoliano, Gloria Foster, Marcus Chong along with many others who left cashing in on smaller-sized roles but nonetheless play fair roles in the plot.The Matrix is an exhilarating science-fiction action piece that stands strong on both an epic and visual scale, and sets home to some of the most influential elements of the sci-fi genre today. In outstanding efforts, it is an explosively entertaining sci-fi flick with the driving force of the Wachowskis who spring the film to life. The film is a pulse-pounding and equally complex tale that is more fun to enjoy without beating your brain to a pulp trying to follow the complicated plot, at least for the first viewing.",The Matrix

Weaving is awesome anyways. As V from V for Vendetta or Agent Smith from The Matrix, Weaving is great.The Matrix is probably the first films to ever show us such awesome special effects. It's a shame what happened to the Wachowski's once the trilogy ended. At least two out of three of the films were good. The other one... well, it wasn't art but it was pretty entertaining. The Matrix is a sci-fi extravaganza that you will never forget. I hope so at least. It's one film never to miss. I wouldn't say it's in my top 20 but it's awesome.

The special effects take this film to a level of its own and have become almost a cliché in some action films, the 'bullet time'; the synchronised fight scenes....Keanu Reeves who has been panned by critics for years, finally silences them by providing the greatest performance in his career as the confused chosen one; Lawrence Fishburne who is endearing as the man who has searched his whole life for Neo while Moss is the love interest and Hugo Weaving as the baddie, a baddie like no other; he redefines scary with his cold, steel like tone of voice.",The Matrix
135,RNMorton,Did I see a different movie?,4,23 April 2000,"Nearly unwatchable clap-trap about ""common man"" Reeves caught up in secret struggle between computer-enhanced good and bad guys.  The special effects are great, but c'mon, there should be a coherent or compelling plot somewhere.  It's ridiculous that this movie is voted (at this writing) as the 30th best film of all time;  I must have seen some other movie coincidentally called The Matrix.",The Matrix
136,miguelneto-74936,Revolutionary,9,10 May 2016,"Matrix changed the cinema, there is film before and after Matrix , the film is amazing , the special effects are excellent for the time, the film also created (I think) the scenes in slow motion, the Snyder used a lot in 300 , the cast is great , Keanu Reeves , Carrie Anne- Moss, Laurence Fishburne , Hugh Weaving and etc , the Wachowski makes an excellent direction, makes good camera games , especially when it has the slow motion , the story is great , and means complicated to understand, the film is full of philosophical messages, and is based on Plato's theory , unfortunately Matrix sequels do not even come close to the great film that is this , Matrix has a good soundtrack , great action scenes , is an amazing film that revolutionized cinema.

137,TheUnknown837-1,"good movie, but way overrated",7,19 January 2006,"I don't see why people like The Matrix so much. I'm not saying that it's a bad movie or anything like that, but it is nowhere near as good as a lot of people say it is. And personally, I don't think it even belongs on IMDb's top 250 list, let alone so high on it.The Matrix just didn't strike me as a masterpiece of a movie. I just thought of it as a decent motion picture with good action and an okay plot. But the fact was, in between the action sequences, thankfully there were many of them, the rest of the movie just got dull.But however, when the action sequences did commence, this movie reached my demands. It has a lot of good martial arts combat fights and plenty of gunfire. And I did like those agents that we see throughout the movie.Overall, The Matrix is a good movie definitely worth seeing a few times, but it is not as good as many claim it to be. Not even close.",The Matrix
138,baumer,A movie that makes you question reality,10,2 July 1999,"I'll be honest here, I had no interest in seeing The Matrix.  It was my opinion that this was going to be a convoluted mumble jumble film.  I had pre-conceived notions going into the film and I tried hard to stick with them.  It is a strange thing really, because I try to like a film more than dislike, but I had such ( at the time ) an anti computer film attitude.  I have always thought that computer films were the same.  But I am happy to say that I was so wrong.  Man was I wrong.First let's get the comparisons out of the way.  The 13th Floor and The Matrix have similar themes, but that is where the similarity stops.  I don't think the makers makers of either film copied each other.  After all, with this subject matter, there is enough to easily make two different films. Both films are excellent in their own right and as I said when I reviewed The 13th Floor, the only reason that The Matrix did better business is because it was marketed better.  And don't forget they seemed to copy a previous film that came out earlier called Dark City.Keanu Reeves plays Neo.  In his other life, he is a computer hacker with a seemingly normal job.  But he has inner demons.  There is a part of him that believes something is wrong with the world.  And then finally one day, he is given an ultimatum by a stranger.  He can learn all the secrets that he believes are out there or he can stay in his drab life and never know the truth.  What do you think he does?  Hmmm.He is taken into a world by a bunch of renegade freedom fighters led by Lawrence Fishburne, who plays Morpheus.  And this is where I think the strength of the film lies.  It is here that we learn what the Matrix is. And of course I don't think anyone reviewing this film is going to give away what that is, but just saffice it to say that it will stay with you for a while, especially if you are like me and occassionally question reality every now and then.The true strength of this film is not just Reeves, but Fishburne.  I remember seeing Fishburne in a little known film called Deep Cover.  I thought he was outstanding in that film and I was convinced that was his best work.  That is until the Matrix came out.  Here, he has a similar job as Michael Biehn had in the original Terminator.  It was his job to explain to us, the audience, what was going on and how it was all possible.  And a script like this is a delicate thing to handle.  There is so much information that it would be easy for another writer and another director ( fortunately they are the same here ) to give us a condensed version of what is in the film.  But they are brave enough and have confidence in their material to tell it the way it should be told.  And for that I am so thankful because it is really an intelligent story.So much has been made of the visuals in this film and I guess I would be remiss if I didn't at least comment on them here as well.  They are outstanding.  You will never see better stunts in any movie.  The choreography is so perfect it really is like watching a perfectly executed martial arts routine.  It flows so well that it makes you feel like you are there experiencing what is happening.  I don't think I will ever forget some of the fight scenes in this film.  They are sheer brilliance.But mostly what is enjoyable about The Matrix is the questions that it asks and how it answers them.  What is the Matrix?  Well, well I'm not going to give it away.  As I said it is one of the parts of the movie that will keep you intrigued and will astonish you at the same time.  This is a very good film and it's visionary outbursts are worth the price of a rental alone. But it has a great story to it as well and that should be enough for anyone to want to see it.",The Matrix
139,DunnDeeDaGreat,Highly overrated film,8,1 November 2002,The Matrix is one of the most overrated films that I can think of. The film does have good action and some of the most amazing special effects ever put on a film. But the film is also drawn out and confusing. Keanu Reeves is the only one who could play a chacrter as flat as Neo and the rest of the cast expect for Laurence Fishburne and Joe Panotilano all give paper thin performances. I give the action and effects a 10 the plot a 3 which equals about 6.4.,The Matrix
140,vithiet,A classic that defined action sci-fi for the next century,10,29 December 2018,It is difficult to explain to those too young to remember the impact this movie had when it came out. It was unlike anything at the time and its influence is still present on a lot of sci-fi today. I happily watch it every time I get a chance to.,The Matrix
141,NijazBaBs,lots of tricks,8,4 June 2021,"I am most amazed by the tricks and ideas such as dream like or fairy tale like story, superpowers, agents, similar to real life, philosophical, spiritual, lots of action. This is definitely one of most famous and most remembered movies and characters from them, and they are unique. But like most sci fi movies this still lacks reality, clarity, complete story. So not the best. Maybe if this lasted less would be more worth watching. Only worth watching for sci fi lovers, all movie watchers, and philosophy and spirituality lovers.",The Matrix
142,kevin c,KEANU THE ACTOR (NEVER),5,5 March 2001,"Perhaps not as clever as it thinks, but ""The Matrix"" totally surprised me. Am innovative, entertaining action film. The last 30 minutes reverts to normal violent shoot-outs, but up until then the film holds it's own. I won't mention the acting. It's all about the spectacle really.I note some of the other reviewers took it seriously. Well calm down chaps, it's only a film.",The Matrix
143,PatrynXX,Been there Done that movie.,9,1 October 1999,"As I rewatch this movie I begin to realize how unoriginal this movie is. While it is a good movie, it isn't original.

145,mentalcritic,Tries so hard... misses the mark so badly...,2,4 November 2000,"I actually enjoyed this film the first time I saw it, but then I saw it a second time after listening to all the comments about how brilliant this film must be and how we must all worship it. I've never walked out on a film before, and that even includes Battlefield Earth and Wing Commander, but I walked out in the middle of trying to watch this one again. I've never seen a film that people try so hard to make out to be so much more than it really is. The worst part is the obssessive cult that has formed up around the film, telling us how great and visionary the directors are and how we should all worship them and blah blah blah...Well gang, like the Region Coding Enhancement scheme, time and people's patience is going to catch up with this dreary film, and the results are going to leave the makers very red-faced. Just about every concept in this film is stolen, poorly executed, or both. I still laugh my guts out when Morpheus tries to tell us how human bodies produce so much energy when they consume at least that much in a day. Any nutritionist worth their salt could tell you that. The division of a digital future between evil robots and kind-hearted human beings was also done far better in Tron. And the sloppy use of the Christ Theme as a plot device doesn't even bear thinking about. When I first saw the film, I had never laughed so hard in my life. When I saw it on DVD, I'd never felt so insulted. Never have I seen a production crew with such over-inflated ideas about their achievements.The characters are just plain boring, too. Keanu Reeves has all the acting ability of a stuffed toy, and yet he is the most interesting thing in the film. That's a worrying sign. Morpheus was all poses and zero credibility, Agent Smith was just an insult, and Trinity had to be one of the least watchable romantic interests since Teri Hatcher's awful performance in Tomorrow Never Dies. And was this film trying hard for some kind of record in speaking ****? Well, guess what? Their efforts succeeded big-time. Every man and his dog seems to be going on about how much better this film was than the last episode of Star Wars, but it is really more on a level with Star Trek.Frankly, if this is the future of science fiction films, then I will happily stick with my copy of Plan 9 From Outer Space. At least Ed Wood had sincere intentions of a variety other than ripping off an army of suckers when he made that piece of ****! Zero stars. And don't blame anyone other than yourselves, Matrix fans, because this film is now the celluoid answer to MTV through your efforts.",The Matrix
146,thekarmicnomad,Revisit 2020,9,24 August 2020,"Twenty years after having my mind blown I decided to revisit this movies during lock down.I loved the original one but remember being really underwhelmed by the two sequels - barely paying attention to the end of the third film.The Matrix
On revisit I was pleasantly surprised to discover that the first one still holds up.
The effects, sound, action, plot, acting were all great.
If you have not seen the Matrix for a while but you are afraid that your memory is rose tinted - watch it again. It really is as good as you remember.Reloaded
We return to the world of the Matrix with Neo and his new found powers.
At first there is so much good stuff here.
We get some post apocalyptic real world and some new interesting characters.
Except the real world stuff is boring and the new characters are stupid.
This was a struggle to watch, despite the amount of action, it was very boring and I cared little about what happened.Revolutions
We are back again. Are we in the Matrix are we in the real world? Does it even mater?
It turns out not.
Time to take the horse-sized-pretentious-suppository.
What is reality? what is self determination? what is.. yawn
The main purpose of this film is to dump over the first two and make you realise it was all pointless on most levels.
This was much easier to watch than the second as about a third of the way in I was happily playing on my phone only glancing up at the screen to see if Neo had caught his train yet.",The Matrix

148,jhclues,Transcends Genre Or Category,10,19 November 2000,"(What is the Matrix).  In 1977, George Lucas changed the landscape of cinematic Science Fiction forever with `Star Wars,' taking the genre light years ahead of all that preceded it.  Such a momentous advancement would not be seen again for over twenty years, when, in 1999, the Wachowski Brothers raised the bar again, taking the genre at warp speed  to an unprecedented level with their astoundingly innovative film, `The Matrix.'  Co-directed, written and produced by Larry and Andy Wachowski, it is an allegory of salvation and redemption filled with symbolism and metaphor (the Biblical references alone should keep theology students debating this one for years to come); a thinking man's action film, accentuated with moments that are no less than profound.  In a world of the future, things are literally not what they seem, where it's Man versus Machine, Reality versus Fantasy, and few who know the truth; among those who do, is Morpheus (Laurence Fishburne), who has long awaited the arrival of `The One,' who it has been prophesied will be the salvation of the world.  Enter Neo (Keanu Reeves), a computer programmer with an innate sense of discrepancy as to the state of things around him; he has questions, most of which are still in the process of being formulated in his own mind.  (What is the Matrix).  Morpheus has answers.  And when they meet, it's Alice down the rabbit hole, and Neo's life is changed forever. 	Reeves is perfectly cast as Neo, the enigmatic young man who may or may not be `The One,' and it's one of the best roles of his career.  He conveys a sense of removed, distracted urgency that defines his character, infusing him with both a strength and vulnerability that coalesces as the story progresses into determination and confidence.  The underplayed, subtle character development (largely unacknowledged and under appreciated) is a nice piece of work by Reeves.  As Morpheus, Fishburne is dynamic; he endows him with a quiet intensity that fairly roils beneath the surface, effectively restrained while leaving no doubt as to the character's power and purpose.  You understand his resolution completely by his countenance alone; by the way he speaks and carries himself.  It's a memorable performance by one of the truly gifted actors of our times.  (What is the Matrix).  Other notable performances include those by Hugo Weaving (Agent Smith), who brings a formidable, white-collar sinisterness to his character that is chilling; Carrie-Anne Moss (Trinity), a strong, vital presence throughout the film; and Joe Pantoliano (Cypher), who is entirely convincing in his role of a Cyber-age Judas. 	Rounding out the terrific supporting cast are Gloria Foster (Oracle), Marcus Chong (Tank), Julian Arahanga (Apoc), Matt Doran (Mouse), Belinda McClory (Switch) and Ray Anthony Parker (Dozer).  A visually stunning, thought provoking, captivating film, `The matrix' is a triumph of movie-making that assures the Wachowski's a permanent place in cinematic history.  The special effects are cutting-edge, state-of-the-art; the choreography of the action sequences is top rate and delivered with a style and effectiveness worthy of comparison to John Woo's best; and, most importantly, the story itself is complex, intelligent, and deftly takes you into regions beyond the known.  This is Science Fiction at it's best, but beyond that, it's a great movie that transcends genre or category; a landmark film that must be experienced more than once, for new meaning is gleaned with every viewing.  Enhanced by a driving soundtrack that completes the package, highlighted by incredible action,outstanding performances and memorable scenes to numerous to mention, this is a movie that absolutely must not be missed.  (What is the...).  I rate this one 10/10.",The Matrix
149,Stampsfightclub,Wonderful depiction of reality,9,1 January 2009,"Tom Anderson (Reeves) believes he lives a normal life until he is found by Morpheus (Fishburne) who shows him he has been living in a dream world and now they must join forces in a battle against the machine world.The question of reality, the complexity of life and the dismal mechanical futuristic view is the Wachowski brothers The Matrix.Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odyssey and Lucas' Star Wars take a look at outer space in a hard hitting entertaining manner and this 1999 depiction of reality is equally visually stunning with a wonderful puzzling narrative and high intellectual entertainment.Opening with a rooftop chase and a strange life risking dash to a telephone box, The Matrix then unfolds into mystery after mystery as Neo, along with the viewers, tries to decode the strangeness of what is the Matrix.This film is more than a 2 hour Sci-Fi masterpiece. It is a picturesque puzzle that leaves the viewer with many questions that are a joy to discuss.The effects help cement the feel of the futuristic world and the differences between the Matrix and the machine world. Bright and smart, the directors have created a visionary film through the use of some of the finest effects you will see. The green letter encoding sequences are now legendary and the slowing down sequences is a target for spoofs despite the brilliance of them.The performances are secondary next to the bizarrely beautiful narrative. Hugo Weaving's Agent Smith is a stand out, a fantastic villain that is the only thing that gets better as the trilogy progresses.The ending puts a damper on the narrative by being too over the top and diving into last gasp convention, However overall this is a fine sophisticated Sci-Fi drama that questions reality in a deep and meaningful manner.Sadly the originality and imagination of this film was ruined by two over the top gung ho action sequels.For quality entertainment watch this film and stay clear of the sequels which will leave you with an open mind and plenty of questions to ponder and discuss.",The Matrix
150,Mister-6,The Computer Wore Ray-Bans....,5,19 June 2000,"What is ""The Matrix""?  Lemme tell ya: ""The Matrix"" is a vast computer network designed to kick butt and take names...oh, and to imprison all humanity - almost forgot that.  Did I mention what Keanu Reeves has to do with any of this?  No?  We'll get to him later, then.Well, conspiracy theorists, here's your ultimate sci-fi flick.  Seems we're all living a virtual reality lie and that this is really the future and we're all slaves to the Pentium gods.  In fact, the only thing that stands between us and total oblivion are a pack of rebel freedom fighters and a lone man who will one day destroy the evil....  Hmmm, does that sound familiar to anyone else?DUH!  ""The Matrix"" cobbles together a story-line from not only ""Star Wars"" but also ""Alice in Wonderland"", ""The Wizard of Oz"", Zen philosophy, Kung-Fu chop-socky flicks, your choice of shoot-em-ups and one of any Oliver Stone movies where we're all living in a daze and there's sinister plots working to undermine our lives and make us all live a live (or in this case, a ""techno-lie"").Reeves is Neo, the ""Chosen One"" as he is sometimes called and must be brought from the ""real world"" to help an underground resistance in a desolate world of the ""future"" to train, re-learn and re-think himself in order to defeat the bad guys, save the good guys and (GASP!) find true love in the form of Trinity (Moss).Okay, plot mechanics aside, this is a movie you'll only be interested in for the FX and let me tell you, there are some good ones here.  You know those Gap commercials where people jump, freeze in mid-air then the camera rotates around them 180 degrees until they land?  That's what you'll see here, and those scenes are well-done.  In fact, a lot of the action here is invigorating and, truth be told, exciting.BUT, the Wachowski brothers tell a thin plot line that is just an excuse for their speical FX loop. And in it are some talented actors trying to stand out from the swirling and swooping scenery about them.  Of the group, Fishburne does best as Morpheus, the Obi-Wan to Reeves' Luke Skywalker. Fishburne teaches, philosophizes and drop-kicks with the best of them and is one of the more memorable characters in modern day film-making.
Reeves is pretty much ineffectual and (understandingly) bewildered by the goings-on, so doesn't have much of a chance to do any acting.  Moss plays tough all the way through (even when kissing Reeves!) and Pantoliano seems to be here as a token gesture, since he was in the Wachowski's ""Bound"".
The bad guys, though, are pretty effective, wearing dark glasses, neat business suits and locked jaws.  The main baddie, Agent Smith (Weaving), does most of the talking and threatening and suggests what Darth Vader would have been like in business wear.In the end, though, once all is said and done, you'll remember FX and gunfire and fight scenes and, maybe, think twice about touching a mirror again.  But not much else.  But if all you want is cool FX, look no further.Five stars for ""The Matrix"", in terms of FX and story.
There are supposed to be sequels coming out for this movie later on.  I'll bet Oliver Stone will be first in line.",The Matrix

152,MuviFan73,what a movie!,10,28 September 2015,"Before going any further, let me tell you that my review is going to be a general review about matrix trilogy.Set in future with a very stylish approach, Matrix consist of movies consisting of alternate world ruled by the machines. Humans are harvested here in huge fields. Machines create a world for them which is meant to be error free. This is achieved with help of programs. Example of such programs are agents. There are programs , there are anti-programs doing there work for which they have been constructed, thus trying to maintain balance.Zion is a free city situated underground, for they know their exposure will bring their end via machines. Although underground these people are advanced, they have ships which travel through severs to guarantee well being of Zion. A man from Zion is believed to get to someone who would be their savior(conveyed as 'He is the one'). Do they find him? Does he fulfills his destiny movie is all about that.An alternate view of an artist can be consider spiritual in nature where this world is a matrix and salvation is way of getting freed.

Set is the distant future, machines have taken over a devastated Earth. Humans have long-since been enslaved, spending their entire lives suspended in liquid pods providing energy to the machines.  For their part the machines have created an artificial reality in which the collective consciousnesses of Earth's inhabitants reside, The Matrix.  Guess what? It's patterned after 1999 Earth, and the humans are clueless as to what's happened to them.But not everybody's in The Matrix.  A rebel band led by Fishburn dash in and out of it, rescuing humans and searching for their promised Messiah.  One whom they target is computer programmer Reeves who begins to receive some very odd communications at his terminal...and thus begins the story.The Matrix is both a thrill-a-second roller coaster ride, and a skillfully presented science fiction story.  The story unfolds slowly, as Reeves goes from complete ignorance of his and humankind's fate, to his destiny revealed.  The journey's a trip.If you enjoy films like the Terminator, T2, RoboCop, Face/Off, and Blade Runner definitely go see this film.

The film contains many references to the cyberpunk and hacker subcultures.The Matrix was a hugely successful and influential science-fiction blockbuster - a nerd's wet dream, essentially, though less profound and original than it thinks, particularly in its representation of a dystopian futurescape. It deserves credit for at least attempting to blend state-of-the-art thrills, each set-piece insistent on topping the one before, with a more existential line of inquiry (or a line of inquiry as existential as a Joel Silver film will allow).",The Matrix
156,ivo-cobra8,The Matrix Is one of the best Classic Sci-Fi Action Film ever,10,30 July 2015,"My review of the best epic Science Fiction Action film, The Matrix (1999) starring Keanu Reeves, Laurence Fishburne, Carrie-Anne Moss, Hugo Weaving, Joe Pantoliano, Marcus Chong and Gloria Foster.This was be the first movie I went to see in the movie theater with my mom when I was 15.years old, when I read in the magazines about The Matrix I was blown away and I wanted to see it right away. The Matrix is the best action sci-fi films that Keanu Reeves made in the 90's. It is one of my personal favorite movies. The Matrix is a (1999) American science fiction action film written and directed by The Wachowskis, starring Keanu Reeves, Laurence Fishburne, Carrie-Anne Moss, Hugo Weaving, and Joe Pantoliano. It depicts a dystopia future in which reality as perceived by most humans is actually a simulated reality called ""the Matrix"", created by sentient machines to subdue the human population, while their bodies' heat and electrical activity are used as an energy source. Computer programmer ""Neo"" learns this truth and is drawn into a rebellion against the machines, which involves other people who have been freed from the ""dream world"".Written and directed by the Wachowski brothers, this classic sci-fi action film stars Keanu Reeves as a lowly computer programmer who discovers his entire existence, and that of all mankind, is nothing but a simulation in a computer. The reality within a reality is a concept that's done before... but never like this - The Matrix requires absolute attention from his audience, least you'll be completely lost in a few minutes. With the help of supporting cast members Laurence Fishburne and Carrie-Anne-Moss, Reeves discovers that inside this simulation environment known as The Matrix, he can control, bend, and manipulate space-time... resulting in some of the most incredibly iconic images to ever grace the silver screen. The slow-motion ""bullet-time"" effects as they're known today were groundbreaking and revolutionary when we first saw them 12 years ago. Although Reeves is notorious for his inability to really convey much emotional range, his character here lends itself well to him as an actor. This is a movie that makes you think, makes you gasp, and makes totally forget where the 136-minutes went after finishing it. It's no wonder this film spawned two very successful sequels, and dozens of copy-cats. The Matrix, ""Visually revolutionary, and mind-blowing."" Keanu Reeves plays the main character, Neo, or Thomas A. Anderson and while he is not the perfect actor I think he does a pretty good job in The Matrix. He doesn't have the longest of lines which was probably a deliberate choice from the directors and it works because this gives him a better opportunity to work on posture and facial expressions and I must say that overall his body language is very good. Very clear and well defined. Laurence Fishbourne plays Neo's mentor Morpheus and he does an excellent job of it. His lines flow with a certain confidence and style that makes his character somewhat unique and interesting. Carrie-Anne Moss does a good job as well and succeeds in looking both cool and sexy in her leather outfit. Joe Pantoliano, a critically underrated actor does a brilliant job of bringing his character, Cypher, to life. He also played the roles in Underrated Daredevil (2003)and Bad Boys I & II. I can't say much about him because his character is pretty essential to the plot. Gloria Foster appears in a relatively small role that will have greater significance in the following films and she does a very good job. The best acting is provided by Hugo Weaving, however, in his portrayal of Agent Smith. It is really something to watch him act out the changes in his character. Agent Smith gains some human traits like anger, sense of dread, hate and eventually even a sly sense of humor. Two thumbs way up to Weaving who has created one of the finest screen villains of all time.Effects wise the film is simply stunning and it deservedly was awarded the Oscar for best effects (and was regrettably cheated out of a nomination in the Best Film category) ahead of even Star Wars. The reason that I think The Matrix deserves the Oscar for best effects is simply that the effects in The Matrix are more innovative than the ones in Star Wars. Just take a look at how many times the effects have been spoofed and you'll probably agree. The effects also help in the symbolism of the film and in creating a very dystopia atmosphere not unlike the one seen in Blade Runner and this works brilliantly. The film looks beautiful at all times and today 16 years later (my God has it already been 16 years?) the effects still hold their ground against new science fiction films. Add the effects to the brilliant editing and you have a visual masterpiece on your hands. Very well done.The film also won 4 Academy Awards including for best visual effects. 
10/10 for one of the best epic American science fiction action film's in the history movies like this and Aliens (1986) don't exist anymore.

157,petra_ste,Keanu versus Philip K. Dick,7,17 September 2008,"Action set pieces in this movie have already become iconic: brilliantly choreographed, inventive and gloriously over the top, they represent a fine mix of science fiction and martial arts. The ""bullet-time"" effect, in particular, has been ripped off dozens of times since.Unfortunately, that's the only real achievement of the Matrix series; everything else reeks of Philip K. Dick for dummies. Not only the stuff about alternative realities and cyberspace, but also pretty much every other idea seems to have been discreetly borrowed from other sources (aside from Dick, major inspirations are Alex Proyas' Dark City and William Gibson's Count Zero). Even the famous set piece where Neo (Reeves) infiltrates an enemy base to rescue his mentor/guru Morpheus (Fishburne) has its precedent in Dick, bullet-time included (read Counter-clockwise if you don't believe me). The result is an admittedly pretty collage.Human element is weak, which makes emotional involvement faint; characters are bland, showing little personality. Reeves' Neo is just a blank. Fishburne and Moss fare a little better, but the stand-outs are Pantoliano as traitorous Cypher and an icy, smug Hugo Weaving as Agent Smith: every time he is on screen the movie shift gears. It's one of the Matrix' ironies that its cybernetic villain is a lot more lively than the human hero. Kubrick did the same in 2001, but that was a deliberate choice.While Dick's works are rich with irony and melancholy, the Wachowskis go for kung fu and head shots. Still, better an overdose of action than the portentous posturing which they tried to pass off as philosophy in the two sequels.7/10",The Matrix
158,The_Movie_Cat,The Deadly Assassin,7,3 July 1999,"In 1976 the English tv series ""Doctor Who"" featured a collective of unconscious thought as part of a computerised reality called ""The Matrix"" in a story called ""The Deadly Assassin"". I just thought I'd mention it. Because that, like the BLATANT product placement for Nokia (including the slow-motion falling mobile phone)is one of the detracting elements from the movie. But, of course, the biggest detraction is, ironically, the praise. For, when you're about to watch a movie that has five-star reviews in every publication, and has entered the IMDb top 20, then actually seeing it is bound to be an anti-climax. Even Citizen Kane didn't grab me the first time round due to this effect. Yet having said all that, The Matrix IS a good movie - I gave it seven out of ten. Maybe I'm weird, but the film contained no concept or twist that I haven't already thought of, no surprise twist, nothing I didn't expect. Why do all Hollywood films need to contain at least one scene where characters do a ""humourous"" double-take? Lastly, the moral at the end was forcing it down the viewer's throat and a slight to the intelligence, but these were the only truly jarring points. The characters were refreshing three, or at least two-dimensional, with only a couple of the cast there as the ""destined to be cannon fodder"" variety. Direction and lighting is excellent throughout, if a little showy, and the structure is maintained well. For a film that is roughly one hour exposition, one hour pure action, it holds together very well. But does this really deserve to dent the top twenty when Twelve Monkeys is (at date of writing) outside the top 250?",The Matrix
159,harry-76,A Mindless Mess,1,19 April 1999,"""The Matrix"" is utter nonsense and total stupidity.

And yes, it is fairly entertaining. But the actual story? Meh.This is like something an over-imaginative 13 year-old could have come up with for a school project. There is nothing mind-blowing or even original about the plot and it ends up being washed out by rather excessive and predictable action scenes anyway.The movie plays out like a gushy homage to Terminator, Blade Runner and Total Recall, with very little charisma of it's own to shout about. The self-importance and pretentiousness smothers the plot from start to finish and the constant need for Morpheus to narrate everything for the audience goes to show how unnecessarily convoluted the story is.Compared to the big-hitters in its genre, The Matrix is childish and derivative. Its high ratings are merely an indicator of how easily pleased audiences are watching pretty people with high cheekbones and unnecessary sunglasses chase and shoot each other.",The Matrix
162,fernandoschiavi,"""Matrix"" is a dystopia, that is, a narrative set in an oppressive, totalitarian universe, where the individual has neither freedom nor control over himself",9,6 June 2020,"It is no exaggeration to claim that ""Matrix"" is a major game changer in the science fiction genre. The Wachowski sisters innovate in the genre by bringing interesting science fiction concepts, innovative visual effects and breathtaking sequences. Is the world around us real or just a mental construction of our brain? Can Descartes' maxim, cogito, ergo sum, really prove our existence? Or is it not just reflections, shadows on the wall of a dark cave? On top of that doubt, inspired directly by science-fiction works such as Ghost in the Shell, the Wachowski sisters established their cinematographic masterpiece, Matrix.The Wachowski throw us in the middle of their universe. A chase scene, with Trinity (Carrie-Anne Moss) fleeing from police and agents, introduces a narrative where anything is possible: running through walls, dodging bullets and jumping impossible distances. The viewer is unprepared and the initial shock is sure, whether you are a first-timer or a sci-fi fan. Then we see Thomas Anderson, a programmer and hacker in his spare time who adopts the nickname Neo in his virtual adventures. The darkness of his room reveals not only possible antisociality but an escape from the standards of society - here we have a man clearly tired of the world around him. Summoned by the last fighters in the name of human freedom, he hesitates to risk a new one. You have nothing to lose. Neo hesitates very little to take the place of the saving leader for those who lived in isolation and unbelief. From the risk, from the new, from a new world view, the protagonist and hero experiences power. Your life becomes meaningful.We want to see the new and original gathering of heroes, totally human and completely super powered, defeat the machines that imprisoned the rest of our species in our alienation and imbecility. The Matrix teaches that thinking is essential. Neo had to reflect to accept knowing the truth. Make your choice and learn to pay the price. The Matrix phenomenon can be partially understood if we take into account the profusion of influences and themes that appear, directly or indirectly, in the script and in the images of the film. Here are some examples: dystopia, hope, philosophy, 1984 by George Orwell, martial arts, cyberculture, secret agents and conspiracy theories, romance, Alice in Wonderland by Lewis Carroll, messianism (belief in the coming of the Savior: Jesus, Messiah, Buddha, King Arthur), Greek and Celtic mythology, Brave new world by Aldous Huxley, revolutionary special effects, new superheroic aesthetics (sunglasses, black leather clothes and overcoats replace, respectively, masks, colorful sticky uniforms and capes), science fiction, anime and so on.
The surrealist feature by sisters Lana and Lilly Wachowski was released in 1999 and reinvented the action genre a year before the debut of X-Men, considered a landmark of the genre, and featured choreographies of martial arts-inspired fights a year before ""O Tiger and The Dragon "". His special effects in which characters dodge bullets have been copied by several other films since then, and his concepts of virtual reality and artificial intelligence have been imitated just as often. Despite all this, in some crucial ways, Matrix has aged poorly in some ways. It is a fantastic premise, but one that has flaws. Anderson / Neo is a hero of the type who does almost nothing to earn his hero status. He becomes an unbeatable martial arts expert not by training for years, but by being connected to a computer for a few hours. And he becomes omnipotent in the matrix not because he is particularly brave, noble or intelligent, but because, as Morpheus says, he is willing to ""believe"". Even though you have the necessary gift, you need to know your powers and believe in yourself, so that something can happen. Neo can only be ""the Chosen One"" if he really wants it and has faith in his abilities. To do this, you first have to convince yourself that you are capable of fulfilling the task that was assigned to you.The dismay with Anderson's life seems trivial after the 9/11 attacks, the many extremist acts that followed, the wars in the Middle East, the 2008 financial crisis and the continuing environmental catastrophes. For the post-Matrix generation, getting bored with regular, well-paid jobs has become the dream, not the nightmare. In 1999, Matrix was more interested in how boring it would be to sit comfortably in front of a computer all day. And that is why, despite all its technical and stylistic innovations, it now looks like a monument to generation X's self-pity: a time capsule from a more innocent and accommodating era. In Matrix, the machines chose the late 1990s as the setting for their simulation of reality, explains Agent Smith, because that period was ""the height of civilization"". There's not much chance that a sci-fi villain will say that in 2019.Hugo Weaving (excellent) plays Agent Smith. It is through Agent Smith that we can get to know the impression machines have on the human race, their enemy. More than hatred, he feels contempt for humanity, for believing that he is dependent on ""misery and suffering"". In the scene in which he interrogates Morpheus, after kidnapping him, he says that the first simulation failed due to the absence of pain. The first Matrix was created to be a perfect human world where no one suffered and everyone could be happy. It was a disaster. Nobody accepted the program. Reflecting on evolution, he compares the human being to a ""dinosaur"" because he is about to be extinct, announcing that ""the future is our world"". Bet also that humans caused the ruin of their species and, worse, the devastation of the planet.One of the interesting aspects of the film is that it leads us to reflect on our conduct as a species. Although the resistance appears to symbolize the good, the liberation of the human species, Smith's speech points to the devastating effects that our species has left on Earth. Thus, the narrative helps to relativize this positivist division between good and evil that does not seem to apply here. After all, despite everything they are suffering now, they have also oppressed and made them suffer in the past. This also becomes apparent in some moments of the interrogation, when Smith expresses emotions similar to those of humans, conveying feelings such as anger, frustration and tiredness. In this passage, the line that separates humanity from the artificial intelligences that it itself created, in its image, seems tenuous. At the same time, the behavior of individuals trapped in the simulation is comparable to that of robots that perform their function without even realizing that they are being exploited.
Bill Pope's director of photography knows very well how to differentiate the two worlds that are shown in the film, with different color filters that help the viewer to understand where the scenes take place. While the real world appears with a bluish tint, what happens in the Matrix is always green. This is the color of the computer codes that appeared on computers, of the characters that make up the simulation. Blue and green, being cold colors, seem to refer to the lack of sunlight, clarity and heat. The film's visual effects are exquisite. I am not talking about CGI, but about a credible construction of the world presented, techniques that make us believe that a man can dodge bullets or jump between buildings. The Wachowski, for this, rely on practical effects and only use computer graphics when really necessary (see sentries) or bullets in slow motion. The exaggeration that we would see in the second film is not yet present and everything is so well fitted and disguised that the work remains current many years after its release - impossible not to vibrate in the emblematic scene of Neo dodging bullets. To mask each of these effects, we have the montage, worthy of the Oscar that he received, from Zach Staenberg, who knows exactly when to start from close-up to the more open planes, in order to transmit more naturally to the impossible movements that we see in screen. The use of slow motion, although constant, is also well controlled and works in conjunction with the movement and great choreography of the action scenes.""Matrix"" is a dystopia, that is, a narrative set in an oppressive, totalitarian universe, where the individual has neither freedom nor control over himself. In the style of diatopic narratives, the film has a component of criticism and satire in contemporary society, exacerbating its defects as a magnifying glass. Launched in 1999, on the eve of the so feared ""millennium bug"" that never happened, Matrix expresses the concerns and anxieties of a society in full transformation. The entry into this new world, combined with rampant technological progress, opened questions about the future of humanity. In the film, humans became so dependent on machines that they ended up being overwhelmed by them, becoming mere ""batteries"" that generate energy to feed them. Worse still: their alienation is so great that they do not notice that they live in prison.It is this harmonic mixture of well-thought out elements that make the Matrix a timeless film, which brings millennial questions to today in a dystopia that holds us from the opening seconds to the unforgettable climax of the fourth act. A well-built, complex film, but well explained and closed in on itself, it did not need continuations, especially the two that came, that do not live up to the great work of the Wachowski here. Certainly a sci-fi that deserves to be seen and reviewed over the years. At the box office, Matrix managed to make many millions around the globe, but its influence in the world of cinema was enormous. With the success, the Wachowski sisters got carte blanche to develop two new films, which were shot together and released in 2003: ""Matrix Reloaded"" and ""Matrix Revolutions"".",The Matrix
163,Rogue-32,Getting beyond The Hype,8,15 June 2003,"Before the movie came out, the What-Is-The-Matrix hype was everywhere, permeating everything.  I went in to the film expecting some great revelatory experience and I was very disappointed with what The Matrix turned out to be (the idea of the world we think is real being actually a computer simulation wasn't that original or earthshaking to me).  But in re-watching it on dvd (after having seen the sequel as well), I now appreciate the movie for what it is rather than for what I expected it to be, based on the over-powering hype.  Andy and Larry W. are brilliant, no question about it, and the inspired purity of their vision is definitely evident on the screen. The three leads are fantastic - Keanu Reeves' particular quirkiness has never been better utilized, Laurence Fishburne is stunning as Morpheus, and nobody could have brought Trinity to life with any more clarity and controlled passion than Carrie-Anne Moss.  Hugo Weaving looms large as well, as the contemptuous, non-human Agent Smith.

But his rather one dimensional style is perfectly suited for the role of Neo. The rest of the cast are in fine form and it leads to a very enjoyable couple of hours of escapism.

And the story is very interesting - it involves an apocalyptic future where most people are ""jacked in"" to the Matrix, a ""real"" world virtual reality representation of the late 20th century. There are those who realize it isn't real and would stop at nothing to destroy the Matrix from the machines that have enslaved most of the human populace - and they would accomplish this in a belief that Neo, The One, will bring about this revolution.

166,BroadswordCallinDannyBoy,A rarity: an intelligent and re-watchable Hollywood blockbuster,9,2 April 2008,"***SPOILERS for those who have never seen or heard about the movie*** A good movie can be many things, but one thing that good movies always have is that they don't get get boring after repeated viewings. Going back and re-watching it not only gives you the same enjoyable experience of seeing a great film, but also the opportunity to notice things you didn't quite catch before or see the same things in a slightly (or totally) different way.""The Matrix"" is that type of movie. A cleverly designed story that speaks about many things on many levels. The most obvious thing here are the spectacular effects that won an Oscar and even spawned the phrase ""Matrix-like action."" They took slow motion and action choreography to a whole new level. But even so, they wouldn't be so great if they weren't part of an innovative story structure that can be seen in a great number of ways. The story can be seen as a heroic quest that the lead character Neo embarks on. A religious and/or historical allegory due to all the classical names of the characters. Or, even that of a totalitarian police state.The last viewpoint I found particularly interesting as the Matrix is the ultimate Orwellian-nightmare prison. It has full control of your body to the point that it fuels itself with the inmates' body heat. The inmates are kept down by living in a time that is the peak of human civilization and if they defer in anyway, the forces that control the system go after them with police and military forces. The kicker, of course, is that all this is an all illusion and escape, without serious outside help, is an impossibility and even then it's difficult. But how can there be outside help if everyone is asleep in pods? Naturally the story sidesteps this by proving our character with a safe (well, sort of) way out into the real world, but it is hardly a flaw in logic. The story has to start somehow in order for it to go somewhere. Though it remains a fact that trying to imagine how the very first person ""woke up"" and then proceeded to ""wake"" others remains perplexing.This is a solid smart science fiction film with depth that few blockbusters can ever hope to achieve. So watch it as an action movie. Watch it as a thinking man's movie. But in the end, just watch it. --- 9/10Rated R for violence. Ages 13+",The Matrix

This is a very deep film, and it is one that will make you think about life and reality. It's also a film that can be watched multiple times.

This is THE Matrix.If you had me choose one movie from the late 90s that best defined the Sci-Fi genre of its era, I would choose this movie. Period. No debate.The amount of original storytelling and worldbuilding in this movie is insane. This movie also incorporated new techniques such as CGI & special FX that added to the futuristic dystopia that the movie takes place in.Normally with a high budget film like this, sometimes the plot or themes would get lost in the amount of CGI & VFX. The Matrix did not compromise on anything. This is one of those films that will have you talking about it once you leave the theatre. Its effects on the wider culture are noticeable has this film has been parodied and referenced time and time again.And don't get me started on the action.

The combination of then state of the art special effects (I think it beat out Star Wars for the Oscar), spectacular Hong Kong martial arts, technophobia, and philosophical discussion over the nature of reality replete with quasi-religious overtones left an indelible mark on moviegoers. Though his performance is quite serviceable, the film wasn't dependent on Keanu Reeves to carry it. The rest of the cast is also efficient.

It's simple why the Matrix is considered among the best sci-fi films ever made. It defies the ordinary science fiction film, turning it into something out of this world. It is a combination of kung fu (martial arts) styled fighting, shootouts, future controversy of Artificial Intelligence, and amazing visual effects. With this combination, the film is impenetrable.It is loaded with non-stop action, contains a great storyline, and has some of the best and highly unusual camera angles ever used in modern cinema. the casting was well chosen, particularly with Keanu Reeves as the hero Neo and Laurence Fishburne as the wise mentor Morpheus whom are both underrated.

178,AhmedSpielberg99,Creativity At Its Peak!,8,21 September 2018,"Mostly remembered for its distinctive use of slo-mo style and physics-defying action, but what makes The Matrix really stand out, at least for me, is its extremely innovative exploration of some philosophical questions and ideas. These themes are discussed through the movie's layered story premise, but they are explored by The Wachowskis' directorial vision.There are many great Sci-Fi/Action movies that earned their place among the best of their kind because how profound the thoughts and how interesting theories they are explore, but this is not the case here. The Matrix is one of the best thought-provoking Sci-fi movies simply because of the direction. There is no doubt that the fact we get information bit by bit made the movie so intriguing, but the main reason this movie is so exciting is because how little it offers by showing us, not by telling us. And here is the best thing about The Wachowskis' direction, that it created a world that, for the lack of a better word, broke the limits and pushed the boundaries for its story. The result is what seems to be implausible and nonsensical, made all the sense in the world.Unfortunately, I hoped the movie relies on its creative visuals even more to explain its ideas. Because the rest explanations are displayed in a very unsubtle and direct way. For example, some of the intellectual concepts Morpheus attempts to explain to Neo often feel like they have been lifted from a philosophy essay or something like this. So there are a lot of exposition that could have been easily ignored, and replaced by some visual explanations, the very thing that happened a couple of times in the movie.In Addition, sometimes I felt that the philosophical themes are a bit repetitive, and they didn't have any right to be so. In my opinion, this happened because the direction, for all its advantages, is occasionally ostentatious. I've also the same issue with Marvel's Dr. Strange.It goes without saying that The Matrix has some of the most dazzling and imaginative action set-pieces ever put to film. Although, it's not the most thing I was impressed by, and therefore not what made me love this movie, I have to admit that the groundbreaking action in The Matrix is what made the movie timeless. As it's as creative as it's unprecedented. That's also due to the unlimited world that has been created by The Wachowskis' revolutionary vision. What we got is some of the most memorable scenes in cinema history that deserve every bit of the expression ""often imitated, never duplicated"".Surprisingly, the movie's wonderfulness doesn't stop at its philosophy or the exploration of it, neither stop at its breathtaking action. The movie also reutilized some of the clichés and tropes that are often found in action movies, and sometimes also in classic fantasy movies! And I can't describe how exceptionally clever they are utilized in the movie, particularly in the astonishing final act.There is no need to talk about the acting. For all the cast gave great hammy, yet charismatic performances that perfectly matches the movie's distinguish tone. Keanu Reeves played Neo, the role that was the turning point in his career. Both Laurence Fishburne and Carrie-Anne Moss have some of the most intense and emotional moments in the movie that showed some of their terrific acting abilities. Hugo Weaving portrayed one of the most popular villains in cinema, Agent Smith. The rest of the cast who played less important roles are very good, especially Marcus Chong as Tank. I loved his acting so much, and he made me somehow feel I was watching an Alien movie. I don't know why, but that's what I felt!Another great thing about The Matrix, and one of the factors that made it stands the test of time, is the ageless special effects. The visual effects are utterly stunning. In large part because of how intelligent they are used not just because how stellar they look. The sound effects are equally brilliant and game-changing.More intelligent and creative than the vast majority of modern big-budget science fiction films, and more impressive and enjoyable than the vast majority of modern big-budget action films. The Matrix is an outstanding achievement in almost every aspect. And an immortal classic that deserves every bit of recognition it got.(8/10)",The Matrix

I've seen this too much, but a chance on 4k was always well worth another viewing. Reeves was the ideal choice for the lead. I've heard others were offered the role, but he brings something I don't believe other actors could, and that's restraint. He knew this film was beyond him and allowing the filmmakers to showcase the film and his character was the best choice. All actors excel at their roles. The Matrix was a film for that decade and pushed films to be more daring and incredible. You won't find many films like this. The sequels may have lacked the originals ambitions, but with number 4 coming, it's a great time to revisit the series.",The Matrix
180,Geeky Randy,Geeky Randy's summary,9,17 August 2010,"The Wachowski brothers deliver a tasty sci-fi thriller that everyone from bully to nerd can't resist. Reeves, who makes his one dimensional acting work here, plays a computer hacker who is believed to be the coming savior of a futuristic simulated reality controlled by artificial intelligence—Hugo Weaving almost steals the film as one of these sentient machines. Chong, Fishburne, Moss and Pantoliano all do an excellent job as the supporting cast of this classic joyride. However, the remainder of the rebellion is extremely underdeveloped, but the pros of the film are so great that they overshadow such a flaw.***½ (out of four)",The Matrix
181,JohnRayPeterson,How a classic was born,9,10 July 2011,"I remember how blown away my friends and I were, when we went to see this movie the week it came out. The city, hell the whole country, was abuzz with excitement and amazement at the special effects and the daring surreal theme of this movie. We witnessed firsthand a movie's launch to the realm of global movie classics. Nothing like it had been attempted with the possible exception of Steven Spielberg's works. So many have since copied in one form or another the groundbreaking special effects. No movie and less so no collection of movies (trilogies and the likes) have tackled the religious metaphor that is ""The Matrix"" with as much calculating foresight and contemporary high-tech intuition as the Wachowskis.With productions like that of Inception, 2012, Avatar and others, which escape me now, we would be almost blasé to special effects and theme of the Matrix if it was released today, eleven years later. I just happen to be scrolling a list of movie bests when I realized that it was not in my movie collection (humble as it might be) and so I quickly corrected this oversight. I then perused countless reviews of this movie, out of curiosity; I could not help but notice how often the same type of interest and passion was written in those other reviews. Eager to add my two cents worth I jotted down this quickie review.The two sequels, as good as they were, but ratings do not match the initial Matrix, did not deliver the same wowing response. In fairness, the third Jurassic Park movie fared much better as groundbreaker sequel, all things being equal. Also quite exceptional was Star Wars Episodes I II and III produced over twenty years after the original. If I keep writing, more readers may come to the conclusion that I'm an old fart. I'm neither; I'm just a fan of movies.",The Matrix
182,tomimt,Redefinition of action,8,7 May 2005,"I remember seeing ""The Matrix"" for the first time. I knew it was going to be some kind of sci-fi flick, which of all the people I knew raved about. I had my doubts; it's rare, that movies live up to their hype.The first action scene with Carrie-Ann Moss (Trinity) defines the whole film: expect unexpected. Actually the very first action scene did redefine action movie genre all together with slick camera movement and freeze time shots. It all is visual eye candy, which has been designed to make you as the viewer gasp your breath.The story goes, that hacker Neo (Keanu Reeves) is seeking for truth. He want's to know what is the Matrix. Soon he is taken for a drive by Morpheus (Laurence Fishburne) and Trinity and he learns that the world is not what it seems. Then there are the bad guys, lead by Agent Smith (Hugo Weaving) and his troop of men in black. In the mix there are thrown pits and pieces from various existential philosophy courses and Jesus and Judas theme is strongly present. A kind of modern semi religious/philosophical mix. Not meant to be taken too seriously, even tough some people seem to do so.I am actually very interested of seeing, how this movie will last the time. Will it be taken as a new ""Star Wars"" or will it just fade away and become a cult classic. There is no knowing that.But, my recommendation: Lean back and kick your feet up. Munch some popcorn and enjoy, it's easy with this film.",The Matrix
183,Darkside-Reviewer,"""It's the question that drives us Neo""",8,1 February 2020,The Matrix was released in Cinema's back in 1999 and while the idea of AI computers and the world being destroyed by robots in the future is nothing new The Matrix essentially rebooted the idea and gave it a new twist and with the technology of CGI being much better than most science fiction movies that came before it we got something that looked stunning had a brilliant cast and the fighting was beautifully choreographed and with a cool looking Steampunk/Cyberpunk look to the movie and it's characters dressed in black leather the movie looks cool as hell some of the characters on screen presences command your attention and have you hanging on their every word.The story follows a hacker named Neo (Keanu Reeves) who spends his nights at his computer digging up information on an unknown legendary hacker who calls himself Morpheus (Lawrence Fishburne) who has the answers to a question only whispered about by those who dare dig deep enough in cyberspace what is the matrix? After years of searching he wakes up one night with instructions on his computer that will lead him towards the answers and to Morpheus but little does he know that Morpheus knows everything about him and now Neo is the next target for a group of agents who want to find Morpheus and neutralise him and they intend on using Neo to lure him out into the open but now Neo must decide what path to walk the one that leads to the truth about the Matrix and the world he lives in or go back to his regular routine life and live in ignorance of the truth two paths lay before him and there's no turning back from either one.If by some miracle you haven't already seen The Matrix do yourself a favour and give it a watch put aside the memes the jokes and the sequels and enjoy a movie that upon release blew everyones mind and paved the way for future science fiction movies you will see why this is considered a science fiction classic filled with kick ass fight scene's a great and thought provoking story and stunning visuals.,The Matrix
184,Movie-12,Challenges your ability to follow a storyline. *** out of ****,7,11 May 1999,"Sometimes when a movie makes you  think, I miss the factor and send a negative review across.Does the movie make you think? Absolutely. It is a vary challenging feature. As a matter of fact, this is a good test for your movie understanding ability. It is not quite as confusing and plotless as ""Dark City,"" but a lot more high tech then ""Johnny Mnemonic."" It is about the same as in the sense of lots happening on scene at one time as ""Blade"", but does not make you dizzy.I Hesitate to recommend the film, however, and in reality, the day I screened the film my star rating was lower than it is today. In other words, my thumb would be jolted down on Friday, April 2, 1999, but today, it is pointed up, with a crutch helping it from plummeting down again.Why did I change my mind to disliking ""The Matrix"" to liking it? Well, I thought about it, and BINGO, I thought about it. This movie is very tricky. Hard to follow? Certainly, if you get up to go to the bathroom for five minutes, you'll be lost for all the rest. Movies that threaten for you to pay attention are something to see. Making a thought-provoking film isn't easy, you know.Irrelevant ""The Matrix"" is. I won't even get into explaining the film's plot, for it would be a mix-up, only to turn you off. There isn't  a real story here, but there is a base to the movie. See the movie and you'll understand.I liked the dazzling visual effects, which were about as good as ""Dark City."" The filmmakers do suffer from showing the audience a little too much on screen instead of letting us imagine things a bit, but they also make up for that by putting in sub-plots and bizarre camera effects.Also to my liking is the performance by Fishburne and Pantoliano, hard to explain why, however. Laurence Fishburne acts that he is once again on a horror ride in the ""Event Horizon,"" Joe Pantoliano provides some comic relief when the film gets too deep. Keanu Reeves is a bit too lost in his dialog and trying to understand what's going on to do much damage on screen.""The Matrix"" is not for anyone other than hard core science fiction movie fans. It is simply another addition to the mind numbing array of special effects movies that don't carry along a story with themselves. This is not a great movie, and when I think about it, I have a hard time calling it ""good."" But for an addition to this failing genre, it's a turning point.",The Matrix
185,anselmdaniel,A grand classic,9,12 October 2019,"This review contains spoilers.The Matrix is a science fiction movie that premiered in 1999. The movie is directed by The Wachowskis, produced by Joel Silver, written by The Wachowskis and stars Keanu Reeves, and Laurence Fishburne. The movie features a dystopian future where humanity has lost the war against artificial intelligence. A hacker awakens to this reality and joins the rebellion against the machines.The Matrix is a classic movie. This movie features many effects that were ahead of its time and has proven influential to any movies that feature martial arts. This is a great movie in its action, effects, and even set pieces. There are so many great parts of this movie that the audience can appreciate on a technical level. The movie succeeds in entertaining its audience on a purely technical level. Even the effects still hold up today.The story in this movie follows a pattern of the hero's journey. It is a classic tale that has the main character of Neo come to revelation of the domination of the machines. Eventually through work and sacrifice he ascends to the prophecy of the one. This journey is exciting to watch and it is made more interesting by the world of The Matrix. The movie features themes of sacrifice, truth, and utopia. The movie embodies these themes in both its main character and villain of Agent Smith.Agent Smith is played by Hugo Weaving and is one of the grand pillars in The Matrix. The Matrix is a great movie due to both Agent Smith's lines and Hugo Weaving's delivery. This villain has much to say about the human condition that both sums up his disgust of humanity and also the reason for the creation of The Matrix. Everytime Hugo Weaving was on the screen it made for an exciting moment as the audience would be getting a great action moment or a grand speech by the Agent of the system.I highly recommend 'The Matrix'.Grade: A",The Matrix

The tension pulling in both directions is so strong even if you know which choice is demanded by the plot for the Hollywood movie to continue.Most sci-fi movies feel like horse westerns in latex drag. This one pulls you into a high tension alternate universe where you scarcely dare breathe.The truth of what is going on is too complex to be explained in a few pat sentences.

188,movieguy1021,The Matrix: 7/10,7,15 December 2002,"Thomas A. Anderson is in trouble. Words appear on his computer screen, telling him to ""follow the white rabbit"". He does, and a mysterious woman named Trinity (Carrie-Anne Moss) tells him that ""they have been looking for him"" and says something about the Matrix, leaving Thomas very confused. In his work the next day, Thomas is chased by some guys. Not exactly ""good guys"". He meets Morpheus (Laurence Fishburne), and Morpheus tells him that once he goes into the real world, he can never go back. Thomas, who becomes Neo, does. And he finds out about the Matrix and everything.That may not make sense, but it does in the movie. Thomas A. Anderson/Neo is played by Keanus Reeves, keeping his status as ""cool action dude"" real. He originally is skeptical, but soon learns the truth, and he begins, shall I say, enjoy it.The Matrix draws you in with special effects gadgets and weird things, but soon teeters away from that, making you glued to your seat because you're wating for the next one. While there are tremondous special effects (some were under-utilized, I'm assuming they'll be in the sequels), some of the characters came and went, and the script (by the directors, the Wachowski brothers) didn't really introduce them to us. Maybe if a little less of the fighting (which was very cool) and more of the basics had been there, it would have been easier.Of course, movies like this can't be without mumbo-jumbo. The mystical Morpheus does most of it-talking philosophically and not making sense at times. I got the rudimentary idea behind most of it (like that they actually didn't go the Matrix, etc.), but it tried to get oo in-depth.The Matrix was fun and enjoyable, with some heartpounding scenes and cool special effects (love that bullet-stopping). The acting was all very good-Reeves, as I've said before, was good and might be coming back. Fishburne is good as the guy who knows everything but cannot speak it (i.e. Dobby?), and I love Moss-she's great and a rising action star. I didn't really notice that Joe Pantoliano was there, but his voice sounded familiar. He looks a lot different than from Memento.The Matrix is a fun FX ridden piece that doesn't waste time on ""trivial"" aspects such as characters.My rating: 7/10Rated R for sci-fi violence and brief language.",The Matrix
189,Min111,I hate The Matrix,1,3 August 2020,"I decided to see the movie, and I couldn't believe how 'boring' The Matrix actually was. I can't believe I actually seen it in the first place. It's something I regret. I, initially, thought I will like it since I always hear people talking about it, and the high rating it has received on here. It turns out I didn't like it. I tried to, but just couldn't in the end. I wasted more than two hours of my time. The Matrix makes zero sense. What reality? Is there something I missed? Did people see something I didn't? How on earth can that be considered a great movie. I can't believe how high the rating is for this movie on IMDb. Are you kidding me? I think it's a one. If I could give it a zero, I actually would've done. The cast was fine. I don't think there were any problems with that. Keanu Reeves was a good choice. He played the character named Neo. His actual name is Thomas Anderson. He happens to be a computer programmer by the way. A hacker. Let's not forget the other characters such as Agent Smith, Cypher, Morpheus and Trinity. The characters look cool though - I admit that. I like how they wear their sunglasses. It's very stylish. You can see it on the front cover. I know there were two sequels afterwards, but I can assure you that I 'definitely' won't be watching them after seeing the original one. The sequels are 'The Matrix Reloaded' and 'The Matrix Revolutions'. I don't know nothing about those movies except that both came out in the same year. Please, save yourself the time. The Matrix is a joke! One of the worst movies I've ever seen on screen. What is The Matrix exactly? Can you answer that? I don't think you can. It's a shame because I really wanted to like this movie. I found it a hard time to understand the story. I couldn't make sense of it. The Matrix is a poor movie.

190,mfellipecampos,Masterpiece,10,21 August 2021,"One of the most creative films and also one of the best I've ever seen. The film has a huge philosophical character, it makes you think all the time. Keanu Reeves is a great actor and here he's better than ever playing Neo, the Chosen One. The film takes place in a future where the world is dominated by machines but nobody knows that, because they created a virtual world, where people live normally and don't suspect anything, the Matrix. Neo is apparently just another one of those people but he has something special, and since the beginning of the movie he already suspects something. Morpheus is inserted into the plot and starts talking to Neo, whom he believes is the chosen one. It's amazing how the film develops, the two meet and Neo starts to discover everything he didn't know. He discovers that the real world is very different from the world he lived in. The film brings us philosophical reflections all the time, such as ""the body does not live without the mind"", in this case, if you die in the Matrix you also die in the real world, even if that is not real, because your mind is there. The slow motion action scenes are awesome too. And the ending then is completely surprising, there Neo chooses is the chosen one.Film viewed on August 21, 2021.",The Matrix

192,dr_foreman,"mildly entertaining, yet fundamentally wretched",4,10 June 2004,"I'm waiting, like a vulture, for this movie to become dated. And it will. The club scene, the sunglasses, the fashions, the cell phones - oh yes, one day it will all look and sound unbearably corny. And then, we'll have to actually pay attention to the script and the acting (or lack thereof). And we will realize that this movie reeks.For an action film, it's remarkably dull, with the first half basically consisting of a looong string of complex explanations. It doesn't help that Neo is a totally flat character. If I'm to care that he's trapped in the Matrix, I need to see more of his life there. Sadly, one scene of Neo at work, being berated by the boss, does not a fascinating character make. I also think it was a terrible mistake to make him a programmer, since he already understands the nature of computers and should, therefore, be more receptive to the idea of the Matrix instead of consistently incredulous. And am I supposed to believe that this master hacker doesn't know what an EMP is?The film is also terribly derivative. Morpheus is an even more gaseous version of Yoda, and Neo is clearly based on Luke (promising young man discovers super-powers and helps rebels overthrow their nasty oppressors). The visual style is ripped off from the Alien movies, as is the snake-like parasite that somehow manages to burst through Neo's bellybutton without leaving a mark. The evil agents clearly evoke The X-Files, the notion that mankind is enslaved by robots in an apocalyptic future comes straight out of The Terminator, and - most damningly of all - the concept of a virtual reality environment called the Matrix had featured some 23 years earlier in an episode of Doctor Who (""The Deadly Assassin""). Maybe the Matrix didn't consciously rip off all of these sources, but it's certainly worth noting that this movie is utterly unoriginal in every respect but its action photography (and that will, like all the rest, probably date badly).Needless to say, Reeves is pretty bland, and Fishbourne is just plain embarrassing in his first scene (it doesn't help that his every dire line is punctuated by a melodramatic bolt of lightning). Only Carrie-Anne Moss's Trinity comes up smelling like a rose, and it's good to see such a strong role for a female character - though I think she should've been the hero, as she's got more charisma than everyone else put together.I was quite disturbed by the metal detector scene, as it appears to be nothing more than a particularly violent video game sequence that's meant to inspire future generations of random crazy shooting maniacs. It's worth mentioning that the security guards who are so callously slaughtered by Neo and Trinity are not evil, just thralls of the Matrix, like Neo had been merely days before. Why, therefore, does he have no qualms about blowing them all to bits? Tacky, man - really tacky.I enjoyed Joe Pantoliano's character, probably because he was allowed to have an actual set of motivations and opinions, whereas the other characters are just filler. And you know, a few segments were effective; the Oracle has real presence. But the film is basically a dog, and while it pretends to cast all kinds of light on the problems with modern society, at the end of the day it's a stupid action movie that raises interesting issues, then resolves them with ridiculously OTT karate battles.As a movie, The Matrix is decent entertainment. As sci-fi, it's derivative and sloppy. As philosophy, it's risible, misleading, and poorly informed junk.",The Matrix

I'd seen it on TV a few weeks back so I thought it was time to commit my thoughts to cyberspace. Take Thomas Anderson, AKA Hacker Neo. He is contacted by an underground resistance whose leader Morpheus he has been looking for.Exactly why Neo is looking for him is never explained, we are thrown into a different story because Morpheus had been looking for him. When he finally gets to meet Morpheus he is offered the choice to join them and awakes in a tank of goo connected to dozens of hoses before being ejected from the comfort of his pod.He discovers The Matrix and what he thought was his real life are nothing but computer illusions with computers running The Earth and using humans as a source of power. Basically this film is about the ideas of reality, what is real? Using a lot of imagery and references from Alice In Wonderland the film still looks impressive, has plenty of action (maybe a little bit too much fighting) and a sound enough plot and cast.Even if Keanu Reeves wasn't 1st pick to be Neo he still did a great job. Carrie Ann Moss as Trinity looks incredible and Laurence Fishburne plays his role brilliantly. Hugo Weaving is almost always overlooked as Agent Smith but he is so deadpan its unreal.Despite being almost a decade old now the film is still more than watchable even if it's ending is a little weak being left open for it's sequel to explore.",The Matrix
197,johnnymonsarrat,Jon Monsarrat review: intelligent thriller with a soul,10,1 April 2002,"""The Matrix"" doesn't exactly have ""something to say that changed my life"", but it definitely has a powerful theme and lots of deep thinking mojo. In a way, that makes it like ""Star Wars (1977)"", where ""The Force"" is basically silliness but it's sculpted in a way and presented so elegantly that just knocks you over and makes you want to laugh and cry both.Laurence Fishburne carries the film. I'm not ashamed to say that Keanu Reeves has grown on me a lot since the early days.Don't worry, if you're turned off by intellectual-ism, you can still enjoy it as a straight action movie. Lots and lots of stuff blows up, some of it in a stop-motion crescendo that won The Matrix the Oscar for visuals.And if you're the arty type who's turned off by action movies, you can appreciate the amazing visuals, acting, and directing, and themes.The Matrix is rated R but I would say it's basically PG except that it's got a dark and scary edge to it. So definitely not for young-ish kids but safe for your mature-ish teens.Who should see this film:-- Everyone who doesn't mind if the film has a bit of an ""edge"",I mean this is not exactly ""On Golden Pond"", but it'sdefinitely not as nightmarish as ""Brazil"". More like ""Alien 2""than ""Alien"".-- Action fans -- a must-see. What, you missed it when it cameout? Stupido! Stupido!

198,policy134,A whole new way of movie-making,10,22 September 2005,"There was not a single film that I can remember that was like this back in '99 and to say that the experience was totally awesome is an understatement.Before I saw this, I usually thought that sci-fi movies were dull. I was one of the few people who thought Blade Runner felt like an eternity to sit through. This was exciting from start to finish and if you have ridiculed Keanu Reeves in the past, the performance he gives here makes up for it in spades.The genius of the movie is of course that we don't know what is real or not and that include people. The men in suits and sunglasses are shown as ghost-like creatures who control what the commoners' environment but you are not really sure if they themselves are not controlled by another entity. The character of Morpheus (Laurence Fishburne) seems to know all the answers but even his wisdom is questioned by his complete blind faith in Neo as the chosen one.There is of course obstruction from opposing sides in the form of Cypher (Joe Pantoliano) who thinks that it is better being in a make-believe world than to endure the rather meager existence the rebels are leading and he has a point.Millions of dollars were probably spent making this movie but except at the end all the money were well spent. The shoot-out is exciting up to a point but it is dragged out a little too long. That is such a minor quibble, though that you can easily gloss over it. So how can you top such a movie. My opinion is you can't as witnessed by the rather inferior sequels but there was a time when this all felt new and you should applaud the Wachowski Bros. for that and not gag because you just saw a spoof on the Simpsons for the 1 millionth time last night.",The Matrix

Script, acting, settings, scene transition and sequencing, music are simply paradigmatic for this style of dark, cyberpunk epic and cinema in general.Crescendos/build-ups are chilling to the bone, fighting/acting scenes unique (not only is this film ahead of all others conceptually, but it is also supremely brilliant visually - bullet time, a huge cinematic technical innovation) + superb camera angles.Classic myths/ideologies/religious transfiguration/philosophy:Man vs Machine; a post-apocalyptic dystopian future; Plato's cavern allegory; Kant's phenomenon/noumenon (things as we see them/things as they are); Jesus Christ and his super-human abilities/prophetic fulfillment- myth and concept of the Oracle, Resurrection and salutatory function; Judas, Betrayer; the Choice (blue and red pill scene); Man mechanizing (think Neo's metamorphosis and holes); and the magnificent ""Sleeping Beauty"" theme, when in all hope fading, Love and Destiny collide and bring the One to the Matrix. Also: the names, Morpheus (Greek God of Sleep), Neo (anagram of ""One""), Trinity...Roughly all main genres in literature/cinema/art/story telling: drama, action, humor, horror, psychological thriller, conceptual piece....yes, all those, think deep.Personal note: all plots, sub-plots are easy to follow and digest, yet the multi-layered nature of this opus will have you benefiting from a few re-watches.

Yes it does have some fabulous action sequences but they come thinly in once in a blue moon with no plot to actively engage in.That's a good place to start actually. The plot. WHAT PLOT?! I think i must've gone down the rabbit hole whilst watching this because absolutely nothing made sense. Talk about style over substance! Right from the opening I didn't have a clue what was going on. So a man gets sucked down some gooey alien bladder and is told he's the next Jesus or something like that and that everything in the world we know is completely fake and is a computer programme called ""The Matrix"" and this ""Neo"" character is now in the real world that looks more like a rip-off of a ""Terminator"" set! Can we get real here please? Then there are some bad guys who i don't really get why are bad, but that they just go around wearing big wavy coats and stupid sunglasses indoors. Is this meant to be cool? Stick me in jeans and a T-Shirt any day of the week.So we've covered the complete mess of a plot, I literally didn't know where anything was going next! Where are now? Who's he? Why is that happening? Are popular phrases I would use on the ""Audio Commentary"" for this load of... What shall I pan next? I don't have to think too hard because there are so many faults it's hard to pick. Kenau Reeves was rubbish as the main character and was far too moody to be likable. Then we've got some black man who acts like a prat 24/7 making ""Neo"" do stupid and pointless things like fight kung-fu and prat about in white rooms to add to some more confusion.The action and special effects are really good but they need a plot to engage in to find them entertaining. I didn't know why they were fighting each other or why a certain thing was happening at all! Besides, the action sequences were very few and underwhelming to say the least.Visually stunning? Not really, the cinematography on Coronation Street is more stunning and as were the special effects for the crazy tram crash. So maybe I'm being a bit harsh there but it's merely to outline the disgust I felt from this film, the ending left me thinking how anyone could like this ""Terminator"" wannabee.It's unengaging, virtually unwatchable and with a plot more tangled than Hayley Croppers styled wig. Don't you tell how great ""The Matrix"" is.",The Matrix

202,saru2020,Spiritually engaging,10,4 October 2020,"Watching it again after 20 years and only now I realise why so many people have lauded this gem. When I watched this movie while I was a kid, I did so for the sake of its mystical/magical stunt sequences but only now I realise that the movie had something more spiritually. I was in fact blown away by the fact of its linkage to our real-world now, in 2020.
The most satisfying or convincing thing about this movie is that even the villain's character is also justifiable. Most of the humans try to be in a comfort zone and wants to be ignorant all their lives, which is a natural human tendency, I believe.
Everything, every single thing about this movie was deep & convincing, there was just no flaw that could be said about it except the fight sequences, although they're not so bad to watch even after 2 decades, which is a fabulous achievement in itself.",The Matrix
203,braddugg,A great looking film that has less substance than the expectation.,6,8 September 2014,"A great looking film that has less substance than the expectation.It's a movie that looks great and even the premise is outstanding but is made comical i action ruining the point to an extent. Surely, when I saw it in theaters when I was very young I loved it and went gaga and saw the whole trilogy in theaters and liked t to an extent But now, when I revisited it after several years, the 'wow' factor has gone and now it seems like any other action film.Surely, in terms of action and the whole production design, this was the first of it's kind that had the greenish tinge to frames and setting up infinite space in a room, in that complete white background scene where ""Neo"" and Morpheus talk.Keanu Reeves as Neo/Thomas Anderson was good ad so was Carrie Ann Moss as Trinity but I loved Morpheus played y Laurence Fishburne the most as his character was the epitome of setting men free from bondage and in his own way.The writer-directors Wachowskis must be appreciated and credited a lot for having taken the Hollywood action sequences to a new level. Be it the ""Bullet movement"" or the ""walking on the walls"" they were stunningly and with an ease.We know, that none of it is possible, this is a science fantasy film that takes the premise from the myths of ""being free from world"". It takes from the Buddhism concept of ""Nirvana"" I think that means liberation of the soul. Yet, we are engaged in a way much better than many sci-fi films that this makes us believe in the theory at least.I might not like this whole picture being seen again, but I am going with a 3/5 that means the film is surely good. I might not watch this again just that I am not much into action.",The Matrix
204,PIST-OFF,"layered, textured, somewhat intelligent future of sci fi",10,19 October 2003,"i love this movie for the manny many themes that come up repeatedly. The story's arch is quite good in that it doesn't feel as though much of anything else could be added. The central philosophy is admirably brought to a movie that a mainstream audience can digest, along with metaphorical and allegorical strains of the bible, alice in wonderland, drug use, the life cycle, cartesian dualism, buddhist one consciousness, giger style enemies, artificial intelligence, newtonian physics, orwellian nightmares, and euclidean view of the world as a series of numbers and probabilities. Sci fi need not be the same old, evil monster chase humans without rhyme or reason. The movie dooes sidestep charecter development by making it's charecters not know who they are, and also by killing most of them off as soon as they are met. while this isn't the arty pretentious greatness of citizen kane or waking life, it is a movie that is likely to be long remembered and worshipped like Star Wars",The Matrix

Some of the clichéd dialog tells you that the plot and characters are just background music to show off some really huge and grossly ugly special effects. I especially dislike the scene where Reeves and his female partner break into the high security skyscraper to defeat the forces that have imprisoned Morpheus (Lawrence Fishburne}. He is armed the neck with weapons and ammunition to blast hundreds of people away. I cannot help but think how this might have inspired James Holmes when he went to a Batman movie in a costume concealing a similar arsenal around his chest to shoot twenty or thirty people. People who produce these ultra violent shows are mechanics who never think about what the end results of their work might be.",The Matrix
208,ruby_fff,Dazzling computer special effects and surreal delivery of martialart movements plus underlying save-the-human species storystructure,8,11 April 1999,"Without a doubt, the presentation of this film with its myriad of computerized special effects is spectacular. It's a feast for the eye. A fantastic journey -- though mostly in tones of dark colors -- for the very computer literate. It works very well as a comic book style storytelling in the company of Keanu Reeves, Laurence Fishburne, Carrie-Anne Moss, Hugo Weaving and Joe Pantoliano. From the pen and direction of the Wachowski brothers, Andy and Larry (sharply delivered the previous intriguing ""Bound"" with Jennifer Tilly, Gina Gershon and Joe Pantoliano.) ""The Matrix"" is imaginative. It's fantasy, yet the undertones can be real.We've had films with similar storyline, Terry Gilliam has two prominent ones: ""Brazil"" 1985 and ""12 Monkeys"" 1995 -- more concentrated on the plot and message vs. dazzling computerized effects, hence more time in deeper delivery of the acting performances along with the story intrigue. Also comes to mind is Alex Proyas' ""Dark City"" 1998, especially when we see the long black trench coats! The virtual reality aspect has traces of ""Star Trek"" (the out of body simultaneous existence, the beaming back to the ship), and of course, ""Star Wars"" (fighting off the bugs/viruses from the ship's steering control platform).The chase scenes, action-explosive scenes, and martial art scenes we've seen/experienced these before. A lot of other film tracks spring to mind: Barry Sonnenfeld's ""Men In Black"" 1997 (chases and alien monsters); Stephen Norrington's ""Blade"" 1998 (cool martial art movements); John Badham's ""Blue Thunder"" 1983 (helicopter in action); John McTiernan's ""Die Hard"" 1988 (the shattering glass by non-stop flying bullets); and John Woo's trademark rain of bullet ballet styles. The computer-intensive plot has a trace of the situation in ""Mercury Rising"" 1998 with Bruce Willis; reminders of the insightful paranoiac B/W independent film of Darren Aronofsky's ""Pi"" 1998; yes, Keanu in ""Johnny Mnemonic"" 1995 -- Is this part 2? Keanu's character here is a human with doubts and feelings of his own vs. a go-between android type. (Ah, ""Android"" 1982, directed by Aaron Lipstadt is an interesting sci-fi piece with Klaus Kinski as an avid scientist, and Don Opper who plays Max 404 co-wrote the screenplay.)There are steady quiet moments/brief scenes for pause and emotional exchanges, especially the meeting with Oracle, seemingly a surreal scene yet so down-to-earth with human warmth -- for a moment I felt we're in a calm reality with no hurriedness or impending threat. There's also the scene when Morpheus explains to Neo What Is the Matrix -- come to think of it, kinda have tones of George Lucas' 1970 classic ""THX 1138"" bland background -- esoterically surreal? Jean-Luc Godard's ""Alphaville"" 1965 is a cool French sci-fi fantasy in B/W with no particular special effects but great story that is familiar.The idea of the bureaucratic society in The Matrix reminds me of John Carpenter's ""They Live"" 1988.By the way, Hugo Weaving has worn dark shades before in another movie: Jocelyn Moorehouse's ""Proof"" 1991 -- he portrayed a blind photographer (no kidding) with Russell Crowe (who was the robotic nightmare SID 6.7 in ""Virtuosity"" 1995 opposite Denzel Washington.)Performances are fine all round: Laurence Fishburne always dependable delivery, Hugo Weaving's Agent Smith is as good as it gets, Carrie-Anne Moss is cool moves, and Keanu, his was a decent delivery -- can't ask for more, his presence IS the center of The Matrix. Liquefaction chrome effect is maximized manifold since its introduction in James Cameron's ""The Abyss"" 1989. All in all, the Wachowski brothers and co. delivered ""The Matrix"" successfully as an opening weekend box office #1 hit. Warner Brothers should be all smiles!Keanu did a pretty good job in Taylor Hackford's ""The Devil's Advocate"" 1997, opposite Al Pacino and Charlize Theron. To see him in a more romantic role and hear him sing with Anthony Quinn, try (""Like Water for Chocolate"" 1993 director) Alfonso Arau's ""A Walk in the Clouds"" 1995.",The Matrix
209,departed07,Breathtaking!,10,22 February 2008,"What would you do if you found out that the real world you lived in wasn't what it seemed? In the spring of 1999, ""The Matrix"" popped into theaters where prior to showing how computers can play a role in people's lives, the movie introduced fans dazzling special effects that would change the film-making industry with dozens of directors and hundreds of inspiring young artists wanting a piece of the action.Keanu Reeves plays Anderson, who goes by the name of Neo on the Internet, a computer hacker who's trying to find out about a character named Morpheus (Laurence Fishburne). He digs deeper before he realizes that a group of agents led by Smith (Hugo Weaving) capture him and use him to see if he can spill any information about Morpheus. Anderson refuses before being set up by the agents in one horrifying scene that I can't even describe as we speak.Later Anderson is telephoned by Morpheus to meet with his crew where the hacker meets with his idol face to face.Neo gets more than he bargains for while hearing Morpheus explaining that a war was going in the world between freedom fighters like themselves to those opposing (the agents). He later sees that the way they work is through computers where they're hooked behind a plug and like a computer, information gets put into them from action, weapon and vehicle handling and more.""The Matrix"" is not only a grand special effects extravaganza, but it uses everything both old and new from philosophy, western spaghetti (cowboy movies), Kung-Fu, and breaking time dimension where scenes run in slow motion.

210,dragokin,a movie that changed SF,10,30 April 2013,"At the time of it's creation, The Matrix was a real breakthrough. Combining superior special effect with kung-fu action and a groundbreaking plot, it managed to become a milestone in movie making, not necessarily limited to it's genre.If you're into SF, you've recognized the influence of William Gibson's Neuromancer and, to a lesser extent, Blade Runner (1982). And both would have led to Philip K. Dick's questioning the reality. More than that, there was almost a philosophical background to the story.At any rate, The Matrix was released in the time when internet has still been explored, rather than an everyday tool. It showcased everything we've craved for while playing games on PC and game consoles.

215,harryplinkett14,Unbearable,1,21 October 2014,"This is unbearable nonsense combined with irritating action scenes. The film is a continuous insult to the audience's intelligence. We see it makes no sense, but the film insists that YOU are just being stupid for not seeing the sense in it. And then it proceeds to throw even more nonsense at you until you give up trying to make sense out of it. But here's the problem: if I give up caring, why am I watching? Well, some get up and leave the theater. Others wait for the action scenes and the CGI display. Then again, these scenes make no sense either. As time goes by they become longer and longer. Endless fist fighting in scenes where everyone seems almost indestructible. Why do I care that a character is being thrown at the wall if I know it won't hurt him? And why do they use fists? Why not detonate a bomb? Who knows... And who cares?The sequels, however, get even worse. Now that the novelty has worn off, they give you more of the same old nonsense, but they turn up the volume to 11. More fight scenes, more CGI, more nonsense... They keep introducing new characters in order to maintain the illusion that there is a plot here. But there is no plot. These are silly diversions. And can anyone endure the pseudo-philosophical talk? It's unbearable. But let's get to the political message. No, I'm kidding. I'm not going there. But if you haven't understood it, what's the point of me telling you anything?I will say though, that I do not wish to be a part of the kind of humanity the film depicts, even if we never get to fight evil machines.

216,CinematicInceptions,Only good the first time.,7,26 December 2017,"When I first saw this movie at fifteen I remember it being a thrill ride for the first half-hour or so, despite the fact that the graphics and special effects looked a bit dated. Going back and watching it for a second time a few years later, I found it to be pretty flat. Neo is the one character who actually has any depth and his normal personality is a breath of fresh air among all of the caricatures surrounding him. All of the other characters had potential to be good, but all they really ended up doing was providing exposition for the world of the movie to Neo and the audience.There is something to be said for how involved the world of the Matrix is. As I said, I found very little to complain about upon my first viewing and was enthralled by the stylized distortion of the real world that the movie takes place in. The nature of the Matrix also served as a precursor to my favorite movie Inception, so I at least owe it that much praise. There was obviously a lot of work put into the action sequences too, so I can understand how people went crazy over this upon its release even though it didn't have the same effect on me. The idea that the rules of reality are not as strict as they appear to be is also used in a way that is somewhat empowering to the audience. And even though I've never been a big fan of the ""chosen one"" concept, I thought it was used better here than usual because it was not clear whether Neo actually was the One. He was able to make more active choices instead of being a slave to his destiny or something like that.Everything else was incredibly stock to the point of being annoying. Cypher was a cookie-cutter rat character, stupidly explaining his whole plan long enough to be stopped. Not exactly the greatest trait for a villain, but one that is seen all too often. Agent Smith is a little better, but Hugo Weaving gives a far to dramatic performance in the role. Morpheus barely seems like a human being between his glassy stares and monotone declarations. Trinity hardly delivers at all on her very good potential as a character, making only one active choice in the movie that doesn't even have any impact on the plot. The rest of the crew almost might as well not have been in the movie. There was good diversity in gender and race among them, but the roles themselves were little more than extras with poor attempts at personality.I would assume that most people who care to read this review almost 19 years after the movie's release have already seen it. But on the off chance that you haven't, I'll say that it probably won't live up to the hype. Great for the time? Sure. But it doesn't age well and, having not seen the sequels, it's not hard to imagine where they might have fallen off. Overall Rating: 7/10.",The Matrix

220,SKG-2,Entertaining for a Joel Silver movie,9,5 April 1999,"There are two names behind THE MATRIX, one which made me interested, and one which gave me pause.  The one that made me interested is the Wachowski brothers, who made the highly entertaining 1996 thriller BOUND.  The one which gave me pause is Joel Silver, whose movies seem to function primarily as a way to pound people into submission.  Happily, THE MATRIX represents the sensibilities of the former more than the latter.  The ideas it throws out in this film are similar to last year's DARK CITY, and this is more or less a high-octane version of that, but it's entertaining, and the philosophy doesn't get in the way of the story.  The only time it gets to be like a Joel Silver movie is at the climax, when it becomes overkill.  Still, this is the most fun I've had at the movies this year so far.",The Matrix
221,dfle3,A cool fantasy,10,3 June 2008,"This is a movie that combines style with substance. It's basically a riff on the age old philosophy of Scepticism-a philosophy that holds that we can know nothing of the world we live in as it is all an illusion. The hero of this movie, Neo, finds himself in just such a predicament. He is told that the world he lives in is just an illusion, controlled by inhuman monsters. He is given a choice: accept the illusion, or break out of the illusion.You can't really say that the events in the movie are philosophically coherent or satisfying, but on a visceral and emotional level, it gives a tremendous thrill ride.The movie plays like every small boy,s fantasy-a chance to play a god-like being against other all powerful beings. The music adds to this macho, gun-toting, martial art practising fantasy. For example, a variation on Led Zeppelin's classic guitar riff song ""Kashmir"" is used to great effect later on in the movie.This is a marvellously executed boys' own adventure. It was one of several entertaining movies from Hollywood in this period which dealt engagingly with profound philosophical issues. Rest assured, this is not a movie for the intellect only-it uses this old philosophical chest-nut in order to create an exciting, but scary world where apocalyptic battles are fought.Other movies of extreme interest from around this period include Dark City and The Thirteenth Floor. The latter is like The Matrix, but more so, if you get what my mean. The former deals with profound philosophical issues, but of a different sort.In a different vein, is Gattaca. All of these movies could be described as science-fiction/fantasy movies. See them to see a different world imagined.Lastly, The Matrix was so good, you would have hoped that it would have had sequels made. No such luck. Of course, it would have been so easy to make nothing sequels that reviewers would not want to acknowledge. Yup, the makers of The Matrix knew when to quit-after one movie. A monument.",The Matrix
222,Al_The_Strange,"""No one can be told what the Matrix is...you have to see it for yourself.""",10,6 August 2011,"There's a certain mystique to computer hacking, which is either reflected or caused by this film, showcasing hackers as a group of unruly punks in grungy places fighting the powers that be. There's also a certain coolness to cyberpunk stories (which have never really been translated to film that much, sadly enough), underscoring the symbiotic relationship between man and machine. If you've ever read (much less understand) William Gibson's novel ""The Neuromancer,"" or seen the anime film ""Ghost in the Shell,"" you'll see strong themes regarding the dangers and benefits of such a relationship.Put these elements together, and you'll get the foundations for this film. It starts off as a thriller, with occasional surreal moments that help keep a sense of mystery. In the second act, the movie spends its time explaining its premise, and laying down the rules for the environments the movie introduces (there is a dense universe to this film, on the same level as ""The Terminator""). Then, in the final act, we are treated to a massive helping of glorious action sequences. There are plenty of solid thrills throughout the film's middle, which keep the pacing tight and even. But toward the end, we get some of the coolest fight scenes ever filmed, one of the coolest gunfights ever filmed, and some of the most original and imaginative special effects ever developed. The action alone makes this film a must-see.But it's also the story that counts. It is as deep as it is original (well, original for a film anyway). The characters show decent depth, and by the end of the movie you really come to enjoy them. The story has a solid structure and it is well-developed. Just about every moment of it explores the main premise and all of its philosophical implications; hardly a moment passes that won't make you wonder about the nature of reality, and the nature of the human mind. There are many nuances in the characters, story, writing, and even shot composition that underscore all the movie's themes. On every viewing, the movie presents something new to discover and contemplate.The film also shows apt quality. Its photography and editing are top-notch and highly distinctive. Acting is swell all around; this is probably Keanu Reeve's best performance in his career; Lawrence Fishburne, Carrie-Ann Moss, Joe Pantiliano, and Hugo Weaving all inhabit their characters very well. Writing is exceptionally strong. Production value is strong and highly detailed; some sets look a little fake and some of the special effects show their age, but they are decent overall. Most sets, props, and costumes are cool. Music is very cool too.Highly recommended! 5/5 (entertainment: 5/5, story: 5/5, film: 5/5)",The Matrix
223,AKS-6,Cool enough for a thousand films,8,15 July 1999,"First of all, I firmly believe that ""The Matrix"" is a movie that demands multiple viewings to be fully appreciated. I have only seen it once, on July 14.Having said that, though, I must say that I thoroughly enjoyed watching ""The Matrix"". The special effects are superb and the production design is great. I even enjoyed the fight scenes and the shoot-outs which I normally think are just a waste of time. The movie is almost unbearably cool. And the scene in which Neo (Keanu Reeves) comes walking with a black trench coat, shades, and enough guns for an entire platoon, is so cool that it almost hurts to see it. And the shoot-out following that. Wow!Some people complain about the story, I say that the story is fascinating and interesting. Sure, there are some holes in it, but overall it's good. However, the first 45 to 60 minutes are, I'm sorry to say, mediocre and not good at all. I was, at times, bored during that first hour.The acting is, well... not that good. Keanu Reeves has never been a convincing actor, but for being Keanu, though, he does a good job. Laurence Fishburne is the only actor in the movie that is really convincing.It must also be said that ""The Matrix"" is certainly not a movie suited for the ""small screen"". If you think you want to see ""The Matrix"" I think you should rush to the nearest cinema immediately as you will not appreciate it fully renting it on video, or DVD for that matter.In short: fascinating story, great special effects, and great fight and shoot-out scenes. I would give this movie a 7 or 8 out of 10. Too bad about the mediocre beginning.

The story was original, the special effects were great, and for the first time I can remember, Keanu wasn't annoying.
Keanu Reeves is Neo, a software technician/hacker. He feels something is wrong with the world, but can't put a finger on it. When he meets the mythical Morpheus (Lawrence Fishburne) he realizes that the life he is leading isn't real. It's all just a game inside the Matrix. I don't want to give away too much, but it's safe to say, nothing is what it seems in the Matrix. Let's start with Keanu. Personally I think he's one of the most annoying actors I've ever seen. As a person I like him, he seems nice enough in interviews and the rest, but as an actor I think he's horrible. But here, he doesn't have to speak much, and when he does, it's full of wonderment and amazement, which is what he does best. He's mainly there to be a pretty face and an action hero, and I think he pulls it off. Carrie Ann Moss is the female of the film. If memory serves, she was in the ill-fated tv show, Models Inc. She's come a long way since then. She handles herself well in the middle of all this testosterone. And Fishburne is cool as always. He wears these very cool shades and just has an aura about him. The rest of the cast, lead by bad guy Hugo Weaving as Agent Smith does very well also. The story line was actually well built. At first I was afraid this would be another one of those sci-fi films that looked good but didn't make any sense (on a side note, am I the only person who didn't like Blade Runner?). But here, the story starts off hard to follow, but it makes itself understandable without making it obvious. The special effects were very cool. You've seen a lot of them in previews and commercials, but they look even better in context. Some of the battle scenes were amazing. And the look of the film was done well. The world looked normal, but you could see that something just wasn't right. The audience figured things out the same time Neo did, which made it more interesting. The soundtrack was also good and loud. Any movie that puts Rob Zombie into their soundtrack is tops in my book. So while I realize that the grade I gave may be out of whack for true sci-fi flicks, I really enjoyed The Matrix. I really didn't find much I didn't like about it. There are several, and I mean several, mistakes such as visible equipment and crew, and continuous errors, but upon first and even second viewing they really weren't noticeable. Anyway, this was a very good, cool movie, so watch it.",The Matrix

So we left and he sat through it a second time. This movie is splendidly done. The mystery about what the Matrix is, unravels and you see a dystopian future unlike any we as a race would want. I have watched this over and over and never tire of it. Everyone does a great job acting in this, the special effects are above par and the story is engaging.",The Matrix

230,AvidClimber,"The Matrix — The domination of the machine, the enslavement of the humans",10,11 February 2013,"The Matrix, the first installment of the trilogy, is a master piece, not so much in terms of movie mechanics, but in terms of story telling. The ideas it brings, not the concept of the domination of the machines, but how that domination is achieved, are stupendous. They are mind breaking.The first time I saw that film, I didn't know what I was going to see, and it felt like a punch in the guts. I consider myself lucky, because that is a rare thing. Still, it is a piece to catch anyone's breath.The soundtrack is one of the best ever, bar only The Crow (review upcoming). The costume are perfectly tailored and adapted to the tone of each environments. The mood is excellent, at all time. They even applied a greenish tinge when they are in the matrix, a blueish one in the cold real world, and you'll see only normal colors when they are in the training programs.The action and suspense will keep you wanting more, the story will light up your mind, and the fight scenes will push you to the edge of your seat.Some special effects, mainly the CGI, are not aging very well, but the work is still acceptable today.This is probably one of Keanu Reeves' best performance. He's not a great actor, but the role fits him well. His performance as well as Carrie-Anne Moss' are not as good in the following installments. Those two movies are barely good enough to tell the rest of the story, and are not even close to the quality of the first one. I will not be reviewing them.",The Matrix
231,Flagrant-Baronessa,A gorgeous film that demands subsequent discussion,9,18 August 2006,"I've put off writing this review for ages because I feel as though I could never do a classic like The Matrix (1999) justice. I happily panned Matrix: Revolutions as a disappointing end to a fantastic trilogy, but I dare not touch the original film. There is no way I could capture its innovative brilliance on paper, because the film is a visual experience. So I'll just throw out as much rambling, semi-coherent praise as I can muster.I imagine that when the Wachowski brothers approached the film studio with a storyline that went something like this: ""a hacker in the near future discovers that the universe and the world he is living in is nothing more than a dream--and elaborate computer programme called the Matrix controlled by machines as a means to dominate humanity"" all they got were raised eyebrows from executives. Yet, somehow, they must have convinced them to finance the project, because The Matrix is 65 million dollar production, sparing no expense at glorious visual effects and science fiction elements.It puts forward totalitarian ideas like many dystopian films, but it adds more depth to them, more philosophy and more relevant notions. What's more is that it approaches and treats these in a much more effective way. It is difficult to pinpoint exactly how, but most of its content is communicated through dialogue (Morpheus telling Neo about the Matrix and what it means) and stunning visuals. Just like Terminator, it tells us that A.I. will grow stronger and eventually spiral into thinking minds of its own, leading to the demise of mankind. Unlike Terminator however, The Matrix tells us the machines are hiding this fact, creating an illusion. We are living in a dream world. That is enough to make you question a few things.The Matrix catalyzed a whole new style of film-making and it is referenced to, spoofed and homaged in literally hundreds of films just a couple of years after its release in 1999. Even children's animations like Shrek features Matrix segments (Fiona rising in the air Trinity-style, battling forest rangers). So it is safe to say this film has had considerable influence on contemporary films.As the trilogy drags on, the novelty of the fresh science fiction mixture and special effects has worn off; the ideas are no longer as riveting; the story itself becomes too widely-scoped to grasp and with an opening films of such flair, it is setting itself up for disappointment. But The Matrix alone is a near-perfect film.9 out of 10",The Matrix
232,lagudafuad,One of the best Sci-Fi classic there is,7,31 March 2013,"The Matrix is a movie made to last the time barrier and always be relevant whenever the Sci-Fi genre is mentioned. The movie is a classic and it is known majorly for its use of the visual effect known as bullet time. It went ahead to win four Academy Awards for its Visual Effect, Editing, Sound Mixing and Sound Editing. The story arc is one that leaves you wondering and its ending is like beginning to many open possibilities.The Wachowski brothers took the best of the best of the Sci-Fi genre and an idea that never seems to stop plaguing the mind of many that one day computers will be taking over. The movie is directed by the brothers and produced by Joel Silver (who also produced Die Hard 1 & 2, Lethal Weapon 1 – 4, V for Vendetta (2005) and Bullet to the Head (2013)).The story arc is about a post apocalyptic future where humans were now used as fuel to drive machines. The human race developed ""THE A.I."" program, which in turn raged a war between it and its makers. In the end the human race lost and there are being grown for fuel, their brains are feed with ideas of a real life, while their minds live in a world called The Matrix.There the human race is living their lives like they normally do not knowing that the life they live is not real. The twist in this tale is, some figured out and the last collection of humans most are those taken out of The Matrix control live in a place called Zion. But there is a prophesy that a certain man will come and save the humans from the machines, and that man has been found by a man named Morpheus (Laurence Fishburne) and his crew which include Trinity (Carrie-Anne Moss). The name of that man is Neo (Keanu Reeves) or as Agent Smith (Hugo Weaving) calls him Mr. Anderson.The 1982 Disney movie Tron, was to me the main inspiration for the movie, as it features lives in the grid, that is lives in a computer system. Also The Matrix can be said to have drawn ideas from other movies in the 90s like The Truman Show (1998) where Jim Carey's life was being controlled by an external source and he was not the wiser, also I believe they got inspiration from Alex Proyas Dark City (1998) which like The Truman Show was done a year earlier . Also the fight scenes can be said to have been drawn from Japanese animation (Anime) which the Wachowski brothers took a likening into.After the huge success of this movie, the Wachowski brothers went ahead to make two sequels (The Matrix Reloaded and The Matrix Revolutions), which were both released four years after in 2003. The Wachowski brothers also further expanded the story with comic books, cartoons and video games. The Matrix is a good movie; in fact it is a great movie ranking high in any Sci-Fi list, the later Lord of the Rings trilogy and then the Star Wars prequel trilogy, started the whole trilogy phase that is now popular in Hollywood now a day.So it is best to get the above listed 3 trilogies.www.lagsreviews.com",The Matrix
233,willcundallreview,A Sci-fi classic,9,8 March 2014,"Rating-9/10The Matrix is a legendary Sci-Fi film with big effects, action and adventure and serves up a superb film that can thoroughly be enjoyed. With it's story with a thousand pieces, watching it is like a jigsaw with pieces added in over and over making for a plot which is well done and thought out. Some consider it a classic and it is easy to see why, the effects are well done and the cast do an OK job too and coupled with the plot and just even little things the creators have put in, it turns out to be Brilliant and pretty flawless, and here is why I think so below this.The story is fast, explaining all the things going on well and letting the viewer take things in gently but by the end the story accelerates and the action and adventure kicks in, a beautiful balance. As I said the plot is smart and slick and for us the viewer predicting what is next cannot be guessed, even if you know the basic plot, too much happens to know at all what is happening. Within the story we have all the famous slow motion fight scenes and they do wonders for the film which succeeds with a perfect mix of violence but drama, thrilling yet witty, it all goes well and I couldn't tell you to watch this more, if you haven't already.I felt the cast aren't the best in this and Keanu Reeves in the lead role is kind of stale and dull, very emotionless, but he doesn't do his job that badly that the film is also Poor. Laurence Fishburne is OK in his role and even if you think he is being emotionless that is just what Morpheus is like anyway so his role is fine. Everyone else is fine but no one excels in the entire cast and if anything the acting is this movies weakest part, but it isn't bad though. Finally on the characters they are fun, dark thinking and always serious but with a good mix of Neo(he is oblivious) we see a fun start but by the end everything everyone needs to know is already taken down.The Wachowski brothers do a great job with this, and to say this is there biggest hit, well it really is and by far as it is well directed by them and also written by them in a great way too. It serves up to be fun but dramatic and although the fun side isn't expressed greatly, the drama is good enough for it to be superb and the brothers knew what they were doing here. I loved the effects, and to say they are in 1999 it is even better with some fantastic things on show and great choreographed fight scenes(with a little effect added in) which are just great to see with the eye, even if a little violent at times, and maybe comic book style.The film can be too violent so maybe not for those who dislike that kind of thing, the story I guess for some could be confusing and if you don't listen to the entire story then you will lose what the whole point of what there doing is about. Overall not too many criticisms but I said about the acting and maybe the film is slow, but for those who watch I think it is up to you to see any criticism, I am sure some will dislike this movie so just have a watch and see what you think.People who enjoy a good action film wrapped in a smart plot will love this and I couldn't tell them to see this more. Sci-Fi movie fans will also love it and with such a rich Sci-Fi script and special effects it could be some peoples favourite movie by the end of the film, also in that mix the fight scenes could gain fans by themselves as little movies before or since have implemented such an interesting and fast Sci-Fi action film, dabbled with a little mystery.I give it a 9/10 meaning I thought it was just about a wonderful film, and it is just stunning, if you attempt to rate this you get thrown up with the acting and then the story, the special effects but is it too confusing, but by the end you just feel you have seen a superb movie that you enjoyed to the fullest. With the sequels regarded as some of the worst sequels ever you can just sit back and savour the first one and who knows, maybe you will enjoy the other instalments too.",The Matrix
234,PyrolyticCarbon,"Stunning special effects, and surprisingly, plot laden story",10,10 December 1999,"A modern masterpiece, to coin a well overused phrase, but not out of place with this movie.This film has one of those unique qualities that so few films have, it makes you leave the cinema with a feeling of sheer excitement, you feel ready to take on anything and you could, if only the Matrix were real!With amazing special effects, created months prior to scenes being shot, and looking extremely stylish, it delivers everything that you'd expect, and more, an interesting plot. Yes, there is a plot, and although it's way out there, I couldn't help but overlook the far fetched ideas and leap headlong into the Matrix. It challenges all our beliefs about our way of life, and by the end of the film you can almost argue yourself into thinking it could all be true!Laurence Fishburne and Carrie-Anne Moss are fantastic, whereas Keanu Reeves is just his usual bewildered character - although in this film it works perfectly. Hugo Weaving, as Agent Smith, is superb, a fantastic love-to-hate character. The way he and Fishburne talk and act throughout this film is just pure cool - I found myself imitating them continuously afterwards.Go see this film, or rent it on DVD. Only word of advice though is make sure you watch it with Digital soundtrack and surround speakers - it'll blow you away.",The Matrix
235,TaylorYee94,Still hip as heck even after 20 years,10,1 October 2020,"You name it. Technology, CGI, flow of the story, the concept, action, romance, style, music,... everything you want is realized in this movie to the level of perfection. The scene where Neo and Trinity go to the virtual reality to save Morpheus is so fashionable that I screamed. The camera angle, costume, music, and the gunfights.. all these qualities shine the heroes. The entertainment value of this movie should not be overlooked because of its high quality and philosophy.I can see how much research Wachowski sisters put in to make their imaginations and concepts realized in the two-hour movie in plausible ways. How is dystopian future and present is connected? How does dream within a dream work? All the questions about their imaginary world is answered because they pay attention to details and they explain every existence and terms with logic one step at a time. There is no leap of logic, very tightly well-woven script.Their concept is not just future or imaginary anymore. In 2020, we see AI taking over many of works and jobs that humans used to do and invading privacy. Virtual reality games gain popularity over time, and you see Neo everywhere who adapts quickly in the Internet world and learn the combat game so fast and naturally.The impact of 'The Matrix' in the movie industry is more than imaginable. Of course, revolutionary visual effects with elaborated CGI techniques created iconic bullet-dodging scene of Neo. Because the Matrix system in the movie is kindly well-explained, it widens a scale of sci-fi genre. Hunger Games, Inception, Eagle Eye, Wall-E, and so many other movies that followed benefited from this epic work.",The Matrix
236,stevenrotherforth,The Matrix: Revisited. Twenty years on and still an all time great,10,13 July 2019,"The Matrix (4K Blu-ray review)The summer of 1999 belonged to 'Star Wars Episode 1 The Phantom Menace'.
Or so we thought!
Twenty years on and its is another science fiction movie that is better remembered.
'The Matrix' lived in George Lucas's movies shadow at the time of release but fans and critics alike hailed the Wachowski brothers film as the true summer blockbuster champion.
A game changer in terms of visual effects and a story that was boldly smart and refreshing.'The Matrix' tells the story of computer hacker Neo played by the always likeable Keanu Reeves.
The world in which we live in is a lie. Nothing more than a computer simulation designed to trick humankind.
We are fuel for a race of highly advanced artificial intelligence.
When Neo meets Trinity played by Carrie Ann Moss she introduces him to Morpheus played with supreme gusto by Laurence Fishburne, Neo is freed from his dream like prison and shown that the real world is an apocalyptic wasteland.
Awakened humans hide from murderous machines known as Sentinals and back inside the Matrix Superhuman agents hunt down those who rebel against the system.
It's all a bit complex but supremely entertaining and really rather clever.Twenty years on 'The Matrix' is still fresh.
At time of release the visual effects were state of the art and wowed audiences the world over.
The 90's really was a decade of brilliance in terms of special effects.
1991 gave us 'Terminator 2 Judgement Day' and 1993 brought us 'Jurassic Park'. The Matrix' finished off the decade by giving us 'Bullet time'.
The revolutionary use of multiple cameras to capture a three dimensional image as the shot panned seamlessly around whatever was happening onscreen.In 2019 'The Matrix is returning to theatres fully restored in 4K.
I do recommend that if you never had the chance to see this movie on the big screen you should definitely book a ticket.
However for as little as £20 in the United Kingdom the UHD HDR Blu-ray can be yours.
If you have a Home Cinema set up then I also highly recommend you purchase this disc.Originally shot on 35mm, Warner Brothers have released a very good transfer. Ok there's still that layer of grain to the image but in my opinion this only adds to the cinematic look.
The original green tint has been refrained to allow HDR to shine through.
Unlike the recent 4K restoration of the aforementioned 'Terminator 2' the transfer of 'The Matrix hasn't been given the Digital Noise Reduction treatment.
So grain remains but there's still an image that's packed full of detail.
Skin looks natural with every pore on Morpheus's face clearly visible.
Costume design has real sparkle. The shiny texture of Trinity's clothing is vibrant with contrast levels becoming retina piercing.
Blacks are inky and HDR allows shadow detail to be nicely graded.
Whilst the picture isn't perfect, there's some overblown image quality in some scenes.
Neo's face when he mans the gun in the helicopter springs to mind.
Sound quality on the other hand can be considered to be almost demo worthy.
The newly remastered Dolby Atmos mix is a belter.
Every speaker in your Home Cinema system will be working overtime.
There's excellent separation throughout all channels and bass gets really deep.
Sometimes gunfire lacked impact but overall this mix is mightily impressive.
Well worth the price of the Blu-ray alone.Revisiting 'The Matrix' was a supremely enjoyable experience.
The 4K Blu-ray is the best way to view the film if you can't manage a trip to your local multiplex when the movie gets a brief re-release.
This film is and always will be one of the greatest Science Fiction movies of all time.",The Matrix

238,david-meldrum,"20 years on from release, some random thoughts on revisiting The Matrix. Spoiler: It's still brilliant.",10,22 February 2019,"20 years after its release, and several years since I last saw it, some reflections on the experience of rewatching The Matrix. In no particular order ...1) It still look great. I mean, this is one amazing, stylish looking phone. Very little about the look of the film has dated - the mobile phones, obviously, Neo's computer, and very briefly a couple of visual effects creak. But otherwise, this looks as amazing at it did on release. It's sumptuous.2) I think I was one of the many who misjudged Keanu Reeves all those yeas ago. I made easy jokes about his vacant stare and apparent intelligent. From this vantage point we can see he's been in a good number of successful, intelligent films. It's also become clear that within the industry he as a reputation as decent, hardworking man who is a pleasure to work with.3) It's apparent again how literate and cine-literate the film is. I knew this 20 years ago, but since then I've seen a lot more films and read a lot more books, and this time around I especially loved the way the film nods its head to other film genres and influences. I noticed a lot of Peckinpah, and did I see a nod to Kurosawa there too? And I was reminded that for an English Literature graduate like me, this is a goldmine of quotes, allusions and references.4) Seen 20 years on, its influence on cinema since is clear. There's a lot we could talk about here, but I was especially struck by how indebted a director like Christopher Nolan is (keeper of the flame of intelligent blockbusters), especially with Inception.5) I'd forgotten that the narrative ostensibly maintains uncertainty about Neo's identity until just before the end. I'm not sure this really works - anyone who's read many books or ever done an anagram will not find that the most suspenseful part of the narrative.6) Despite a run time of 2 and a quarter hours, it never flags and attention never wonders. The film fizzes with kinetic energy and the time flies by. It's a lean film, without a wasted moment.7) The film is, of course, packed with religious allusions. When I wrote a chapter on this for my BA Theology dissertation, I said I thought the film was neo-Bhuddist (forgive the pun, please), and I stand by that on rewatching. Of course, there's lots of allusions to Christian and other theology, and The Matrix spawned some really bad reading of film by Christians which has never really stopped. When will some Christians learn to read a film/book etc with integrity and understanding of what the film is trying to do? It's a spiritually confused mish-mash of a film - but still a gloriously entertaining one.8) All these years later, it turns out The Matrix was somewhat prophetic about the role technology would play in our lives. Humans permanently plugged in to networks? Different layers of reality that are somehow more real than what we think of as real? The Wachowskis saw all that and more coming 20 years ago. Artists are the weather vane of society; we really should learn to pay attention to them.9) Bottom line. I still bloody love this film. I'm trying to work out if I have the requisite strength to revisit the sequels....",The Matrix
239,malkane316,Quick Reviews!!,8,6 December 2004,"POSSIBLE SPOILERS!!Many people on this site have this as either their favourite film, or claim that it is the best movie ever made, while others completely loath it. The simple answer is that it is a superior action movie combining great effects with a plot which left the opportunity for so much more. Easily one of the most influential movies of recent times, at least when dealing with effects, but it takes most of its ideas from past films such as The Terminator films. What matters is not the basic philosophy speeches, destined to be repeated by fans, but that it is an enjoyable movie in many ways, looks awesome, and has lots of memorable moments and set pieces. Perhaps if the sequels had been better, this could rightfully be seen as one of the best movies ever. Either way, it is still one of my favourites.The film tells of Thomas Anderson, a man with two lives- his day job, and his life as a hacker known as Neo. He is caught by a group of agents who tell him he can live his normal life, or die. As time passes he meets Morpheus who explains that the world Neo has been living in is a false world created by machines to keep humans in order. The real world has all but been destroyed in a human and machine war. Morpheus believes that Neo is the chosen one, the one who will free mankind from slavery. At first it seems that this is not true, but as the film progresses, we see that Neo is not like the other humans- he can do things they cannot do.The Matrix is one of the most clever action films ever, the philosophising can become extremely annoying till the point that you realize a world of philosophers would not be very difficult to conquer. However, it all sounds cool, and there is truth in it, but then again, what is truth? Sigh. The effects are genuinely revolutionary, the performances are all good, especially from Weaving as Agent Smith whose monologue on the pointlessness of the human race is perfectly understandable, but at the same time pinpoints the exact reason for our existence. But that's not for me to say. The film has a good soundtrack, excellent fight scenes, and there is at least one memorable or iconic image every ten minutes. Not the greatest movie ever, but easily one of the best of its kind, and has its rightful place in cinematic history.8 out of 10",The Matrix

""You are like everyone, born a slave, you were born in a prison you can't perceive""
This conjecture is shocking enough, but the depth of ""The Matrix"" does not stop there, it also raises new questions on this basis:
Will you choose blue pills or red pills?
Is it to choose a beautiful illusion or a cruel reality?
On the surface, it seems to be a good choice, but it is actually much more difficult than we thought.
On one side is the future world of apocalypse, torn by hunger and cold, and the danger of being chased by robots
On one side is a warm and peaceful era, with blue sky and white clouds, beautiful scenery, and even the opportunity to become a successful person.
Indeed, everyone knows that no matter how beautiful the dream is, it is just a dream.
But Sever is willing to sell everyone for a dream.
If we really escape the matrix and experience the cruelty of reality, maybe we will make the same choice as Sever.

The grainy green hue employed during scenes in the ""dream world"" only added to the mystique that The Brothers Wachowski wrote and directed. The plot is disguised but relatively simple from early on as we learn reality through the eyes of Neo (Reeves), setting up the clash of the superheroes. Led by Morpheus (Lawrence Fishburne) and Trinity(Carrie-Ann Moss) and their collective of real world misfits, can Neo save humankind from being harnessed like Eveready batteries? Is Neo ""the one""?

I thought, ""Yeah, it may be good, but the effects are probably outated and the story will be really hard to follow."" Not to mention, I had seen so many spoofs of this movie, especially the bullet time sequence so how could this movie live up to the ten years of hype.Well, it did, this movie was not only a smart sci-fi film, it was also a hugely entertaining film as well.It's not 100% original, OK, I get it, that's seems to be the only reason people dislike this movie.But you know what, just because it isn't one hundred percent original doesn't mean it still can't be great. I loved the plot of this film, it wasn't overly confusing, it's was smart, but easy to follow. The effects are still amazing, I love the scene where he is being shot by Mr. Smith and doges the bullets. Now I know why everyone wants to parody it, because it looks freakin awesome. The characters are likable, and there's a feeling of suspense.A lot of people hate the Matrix because it was called original.

246,bh_tafe3,Took risks and proved a game changer,6,21 February 2015,"I was one of the many people who went and saw this at the cinemas when it first came out. Unlike many of those people, I wasn't particularly blown away. While I found the ideas in the story interesting, I didn't find the way they were explored to be especially engaging. I really liked some of the effects, but thought mainly of how much I would like to see them used in a better movie. Then I left the theatre with my two friends, one a homosexual artist, the other a theology student, and they both talked and talked and talked about the impressive visuals, philosophical symbolism and deep ideas present in the film. After around 30 minutes in conversation I was asked for my opinion. Not wanting to lie, I was frank. ""Guys, 90% of that movie was as cliché as hell (may not have been the exact word I used)"" Silence is golden.And cliché as hell is exactly what 90% of this film is. The long leather jackets date this instantly. The hero is a Jesus allegory and he is saved by the power of love. A very poorly fleshed out and unconvincing love at that. There are one liners in the middle of gun fights, clichéd fighting scenes, and truly boring colours and characters. This was every action movie you've ever seen, with some nice new tricks.There are plenty of positives too. After watching Hugo Weaving give excellent performances in Aussie dramas like Bodyline and The Interview, it was great to see him given a big role in a Hollywood blockbuster, and nail it. Man being imprisoned by machines is not a new idea, but I thought they did a reasonable mash-up of the various popular apocalyptic futuristic sci-fi stories. The ideas in the film were interesting, I just didn't think they explored them very well. Like I said, I didn't hate it, I was just really surprised by the OMGZ!!!!11!!! reaction it received.My feelings on the movie have mellowed since then, now that I have only seen it once or twice in the last decade, now that every church group doesn't have a weekly bible study looking at the philosophy and spiritual messages in the Matrix, and now that its impact can be fully measured. The Matrix was innovative, but inoffensive, and unquestionably, a game changer. It changed the way action films were made and it changed the way action films were written. Bullet time was a tremendous innovation that every action film used for a long time afterward. A technology that was built on and improved to the point that the effects used here barely look like a big deal. It was possible to make an intelligent action film with interesting ideas and have people pay money to watch it. Not that this one is especially endowed with intelligence. And while I've never heard someone give a testimony in church starting with (I'm imagining this being read with a deep southern accent) ""I was a sinner, until one day a friend invited me to a bible study where they used The Matrix to lead me to Jesus..."" the church certainly did get excited that this (admittedly unintentionally)had give them a mainstream evangelism tool, before they worked out in about 2007 that this wasn't all that mainstream any more.I encourage anyone to watch this and also Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon, two movies that came out within a couple of years of each other and changed the way action films were made. I really hope younger audiences will be blown away by this and have a great cinematic viewing experience, appreciating just how big an impact this had. But I'm not going to lie, it just didn't do it for me. Feel free to disagree with me.",The Matrix
247,nobbytatoes,an sci-fi action classic,10,29 November 2005,"Thomas Anderson; or Neo, is a computer hacker. Currently he is looking for a man called Morpheus. One night he is contacted by a woman called trinity, telling him everything he knew about his existence is about to change. Soon the man Neo was looking for finds him. He brings upon Neo a startling revelation about the existence of all humans. The artificial intelligence created by man have enslaved the human race; using us as a form of power source. To keep us alive they have built a computer generated reality call the matrix. There are rebels of the matrix, people who try to release as many people they can, to tell them the truth that they have been living in a dream world. Inside the matrix are deadly, super fast sentinels call agents, that stop at nothing to stop the rebels and their cause.The Matrix is a mind blowing, sci-fi action extravaganza that has become an instant classic. The Wachowski brothers have created a wonderfully detailed world that does have much to say about modern life and the dependence of technology. They have made a future that in a sense can be very close to us and holds a startling truth that in essence could happen. They have put a lot of philosophy into the story, giving it a lot of depth and detail so you can pick new information over many watches.The special effect are nothing short of amazing. They haven't lost any of their impact over the years. The fight scenes are the best fights in any movie to date. They're fast, high energy and have been influenced by many martial art films, but they do have been given that western feel; having that rigid style than being really gracefully. The slow motion and camera work they made just exploded the rules of fight sequences and created a revelation in cinema. Not long after nearly every action film was copying The Matrix, but they never came close to The Matrix. The lobby shoot out is just a visually amazing sight, with all the debris flying everywhere, and the fight between Neo and Agent Smith is so intense and brutal. The green wash of the matrix adds a sense of alienation; being a non-reality. The blue and white colours of the real world add a haunted ghost feel of the dead earth.Keanu Reeves, Carrie-Anne Moss and Laurence Fishburne all give great performances. All exerting strength in their character yet giving them emotional depth too, making them multi-dimensional, instead of flat 2-D characters that you can't link yourself to. Hugo Weaving gave a brilliant performance as the menacing Agent Smith. He suited the role perfectly, not over doing the tough persona. Joe Pantoliano also gave a great performance as Cypher.The Matrix has raised the standard of action films so high that it will be a long time before any other film can jump over it. A classic film that must been seen.",The Matrix

The Matrix is complex and deep. Could this really happen?Mr. Anderson (Keuna Reeves) is the best computer hacker in The City. He is odd yet skilled with computers, and he has come upon something strange. Something called the Matrix. After being confronted by a woman named Trinity (Carrie-Anne Moss) he meets an alleged leader named Morpheus (Laurence Fishbourne) and is transported out of his world. He is dropped, cold and naked into a underground lake with no town and people in sight. Everything is of machines.He is picked up by a hovercraft and slips out of conscious. He awakens to find himself aboard Morpheus' ship and learns that a war is raging between the humans and the machines in the real world. The world Neo is from is an illusion, not real. Now Neo is the last hope for the people as he is the Chosen One against the corrupt machines and a agent of the machines called Agent Smith (Hugo Weaving). The Matrix is the best Sci-Fi film since the 1st Star Wars Film (1977) and does not disappoint at any level. The story is deep, complex and overall ingenious the way it is crafted. The dark, cold world, under the control of the machines is haunting and dark. The acting is near perfect, Reeves is tough and naive in his training. Fishbourne is perfect as the mentor of the troubled Chosen One. The film begins a story for what the life of Christ is like and is simply explained in the second and third film.

250,nickmesafilms,The Matrix (1999) - Do You Want the Red Pill or the Blue Pill?,10,11 January 2012,"Written and directed by the Wachowski Brothers, ""The Matrix"" is a high-tech, edge-of-your-seat, heart-pounding sci-fi action thriller, that will make you want to see it the second time to understand what the heck is going on. The film talks about a future like no other, so technologically advanced that we don't know if it's real or not. Everyone is in the middle of a simulated reality to subdue the human population. A computer hacker, under the name of ""Neo"", portrayed by Keanu Reeves, is drawn into this rebellion, and fight off against the machines. I'm obviously a fan of big sci-fi action thrillers that make you pay attention throughout. This movie is one of the best examples. The casting is golden, from Keanu Reeves' performance that left his signature as an actor, to Lawrence Fishburne as the mysterious leader of the Matrix, Morpheus. Hugo Weaving and Carrie-Annie Moss round up the supporting cast, and they perform just fine. But, my favorite thing about this movie, was all the incredible technological advantages that were added. This movie is filled with groundbreaking editing, fast-paced cinematography, astounding sound effects, and the jaw-dropping visual effects that are still memorable to this day. That slow-motion gun bullet scene is still quite memorable, you know! From the sharp well-written script, the incredible acting, the groundbreaking visual effects, to the smart directing of the Wachowskis, ""The Matrix"" is truly a favorite for all cinema lovers. It's a fun, non-stop, and exciting motion picture that will take away the 136-minute run time quickly. No wonder movies always go ""copy-cat"" on this movie! ""The Matrix"", in my review, ""a non-stop exciting motion picture, with groundbreaking visuals"".",The Matrix

The Matrix is about a guy named Neo who is a computer-hacker who gets chosen by a group of rebellious freedom fighters led by Morpheus (Laurence Fishburne) who wants Neo to help him and the Freedom Fighters battle the machines to overthrow them and save the Earth from technology disaster! What I thought was weird was the part when Neo was with those agent bad guys his mouth grows shut.I thought to myself how do all these people in this movie know exactly every next move that the enemy is pulling on the good guys? Part favorite part was when Neo and Trinity (Carie-Ann Moss) were on the roof battle scene and one of the bad guys is shooting Neo and it shows in slow-motion how Neo is dodging all those bullets without even a scratch on him! Can you believe that? I know I can. But this was just the beginning with Neo and the Freedom Fighters! But that is the sequel and then the sequel after that. I thought it was just cool on how they really made this movie!TO BE CONTINUED......... (In the other two Matrix movies that is)BOTTOM LINE: VERY INTERESTING!",The Matrix
252,Li_85,Highly overrated..Very very slow film..BORING,7,23 June 2006,"I know many people will not agree with this, but read this. Matrix is a hugely overrated movie and is so slow. The whole movie is about Neo trying to discover what the Matrix is. It can be explained in 5-10 minutes, but it is explained in almost 2 hours. The only good thing about this movie is 3 or 4 scenes of amazing graphics. If you like the film only because of these scenes, then you might as well just download the trailer. I saw the trailer and went to see the film, the good bits were in the trailer only. The movie is ever so slow, when does it end is what i was thinking.

253,Puroo,Best in class,10,20 June 2021,"It is a no brainer that The Matrix is one of the most popular action movies in the world to this date, even though it was released a month before I was born. The movie is something of a pop culture icon. All the ideas that it spawned are being explored upon today with little to no success (I will talk about all those ideas in detail ahead). I had heard a lot about it so I decided to give it a watch on Prime Video along with its sequels. This movie is phenomenal. The sequels, well, I'll write about them in their reviews. This one is only going to be about the OG movie.The Matrix asks a question that is being pondered about by 14 year olds to this date - what if the world we live in is just a simulation, and that there was some way to break out of it? Once out of the world, we can go back into it whenever we want, and we can learn everything we possibly can by the use of external storages and practices. The story follows Neo, a hacker who manages to break out of this simulation that we call life and lives outside the Matrix. He was extracted by Morpheus who had given him an option whether he wanted to take the red pill or the blue pill.Another thing The Matrix is famous for is the action. The heroes - Neo, Trinity, Morpheus and Cypher have learnt all kinds of martial arts, have superpowers and can ask their Nebuchadnezzar programmers to spawn weapons or situations for them. Depending on those they are able to choose how to fight Agent Smith's men, who are something of an equal match for them. There are martial arts fights, gunfights and the iconic bullet dodge scene. The action is the selling point of these movies. And the movie offers them even better than what everyone else explains them to be.The Matrix is one of, if not my favourite non-superhero action movie. I like its sequel also, but since it's a two part series alongside Revolutions, it's not as good. So I'd recommend you should only watch this one. Skip the other two. This is one of the most iconic action movies ever created and will continue to live on the hype unless someone outdoes them which is actually very difficult. Because it's not common for action movies to have futuristic imagination of action and philosophy at the same time.",The Matrix
254,Med-Jasta,Truly incredible,10,18 February 2020,"I have a long history with this movie of hating it. It came out at a time when Kung Fu was taking over action movies which I didn't like. I wasn't a fan of the slow mo and the style of this movie. So when this changed movies my hatred was only reinforced.Fast forward twenty years where I've learned to love Kung fu and tolerate slow mo. The Matrix was added to Netflix and since it was free I decided to give it another shot and absolutely loved it. Still not a fan of the style but it doesn't ruin the movie. I of course see how it's cool, it's just not my thing.This is one of the best written movies ever. The way the story unfolds is genius. Because you are getting a lot of information from what is the matrix to it's origin and it all flows very naturally. Very hard to do. The concept is genius and brilliantly executed. They really explore every aspect of this world and utilize it well.Keanu... I used to think he was awful. Watching this now I don't think that. Sure he has a few not great lines, enough to pounce on for a hater. But he is really good. He is very subtle. Something only a confident actor can do. Which the teenage me couldn't pick up on.I have gone on to watch the other two and loved them and now am a huge matrix fan and have watched them many times since. Reload took me two watches to realize what the brothers were doing, one movie split in two.It's fun to discover this movie now because they don't make them anymore. Big budget, ambitious movies. I miss them and hope their return is around the corner. Hopefully Matrix 4 will remind everyone what a good movie really is.",The Matrix

The sequels came and went, but they didn't compare to the first. And this was one of the few Keanu Reeves movies I liked, along with Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure. But this was even better. We also get Laurence Fishburne and Carrie-Ann Moss along with Hugo Weaving as the villain (whom I first knew from Babe where he voiced Rex the dog). The special effects really blew me away and the cyberpunk themes really resonated. While The Matrix is not my absolute-favorite cyberpunk film (the original Tron is), it did well for what it set out to become. Do yourself a favor and watch this. Avoid the sequels. This was the crown jewel of the Wachowskis. Let's hope that Keanu Reeves returns for an even better Matrix film soon.

256,zeekwunlau,Life choices in the Matrix,9,19 April 2020,"For 1999, such a movie is undoubtedly extremely avant-garde. Even if it is put into the present, it is a masterpiece that is impeccable in content and shooting style.The thing that strikes me the most is actually their clothes. The theme of hacking, sunglasses and reflective leather jackets give people a shock from the inside out. It is completely beyond my knowledge. There are only three words_too much. The image of the man in black is the first in the era. As long as these three words are mentioned, my mind will automatically emerge.Back to topic life choice.
This is a very important point for me, let me understand why Thoreau said that the pursuit of truth is painful and happy. There is a character in the Matrix (I forgot the name). He lives every day after being chased by the enemy. He can't find the direction. He can't see the so-called real hope. So he decided to compromise with that virtual world, and with things that at least he could hear and feel and enjoy. He would rather give in than live too tired ...I think this is the same as our current situation. We know what happiness is most satisfying for us, but moths surrender voluntarily at the feet of those short-lived happiness. We clearly know what is the best, but we can't stand loneliness and loneliness, and the mentality of holding a broken jar is completely sinking. If you do n't have a firm heart and blindly follow your most current desires, then your life may be very happy, but there are very few things that can be recalled before you die.Is that really happy? We need to ask ourselves.Is this enough?Are we here to enjoy it?Clearly knowing that the juicy perception is false, why should we choose that fake beef?can not be like this.This is the reason for delayed happiness.What is happiness? Probably the pursuit of truth, the pursuit of refinement.",The Matrix
257,TheHonestCritic,"Is this a breakthrough in science-fiction and action films? Or, is it yet another overrated pile of trash?",4,29 May 2021,"""The Matrix"" (1999), people go insane over this ""movie"". I just have one thing to say about that; ""WHY?!"" I'm serious, some people obsess over this ""film"" to the point of paranoia. Granted, the first time I watched it, I thought it was kind of interesting. Then, when I watched it again, the problems and flaws just became more and more noticeable. ""The Matrix"" has a stupid and poorly executed story, the acting is all over the place and most of the special effects have not aged well. The concept for the storyline is, a computer programmer named Neo discovers the truth about the Matrix, he ends up drawn into a rebellion against the machines, along with people who have been freed from the Matrix itself. At first glance, the plot sounds like a lot of fun, with plenty of potential and room for clever storytelling. But, what we get is a boring and cliched mess. Seriously, did anyone proof-read the screenplay? One of the biggest issues right off the bat, is the overuse of stylized imagery, especially slow motion. Look, I'm all for stylized action and violence along with slow motion moments. But, there is so much exaggerated stylization and slow motion that it was almost at the level of cringe-worthy! Film Making 101: for those who want to write scripts, make sure the plot holds together and is able to carry through the entire runtime. Just adding excessive slow motion shots to pad out the runtime is no substitute for poor screenplay writing. It just shows how lazy the execution of the story is A perfect example of a ""movie"" that has this exact same issue, is ""Mission: Impossible 2"" (2000). That ""film"" also has an overabundance of stylized action and slow motion. Honestly, if you take out the slow motion, then these movies would be, maybe, five or ten minutes! The other glaring issue with the story in ""The Matrix"", is that the story is a jumbled and confused mess. It's stupid, a total bore and the plot doesn't hold together at all. How does such a poorly conceived storyline come to a person's mind? Even if you took away the stylized action and slow motion, it would be just as stupid and dull to watch. As for the acting, it's just as big a letdown as the plot itself. The only ones who appear to be trying are: Keanu Reeves and Laurence Fishburne. Everyone else in the cast just looks bored and their lackluster acting doesn't help matters either! As far as special effects go, some of them are good. But, a lot of them have not aged well. You can really see how bad they are whenever there's a slow motion shot, or when there's an over exaggerated stylized action segment. In my mind, the best way to describe the bad special effects here, is that they have aged as well as rotten milk! The sets/locations are great and they give the movie a decent atmosphere. Finally, the soundtrack is composed nicely and it really sets the tone for untold storyline that had so much room for improvement. However, I truly think that the music is trying harder than every other element in this movie! Sadly, those two factors do not help this movie. Overall, ""The Matrix"" is just a very dull and uninteresting action and science fiction romp where hardly anything of substance happens. I'm struggling to give this ""film"" a 2 out of 5 star rating, which equates to 4 out of 10 stars. Do I really have to tell you to stay away from this waste of cinema? Here's a message to all of those who obsess over this ""movie"". Take a good look at yourself and check out a real action film, science-fiction film, or any other film in general. Maybe your movie standards will improve!",The Matrix

As the movie goes on, and the series in general, the writing and action scenes get out of control, with Smith warping to one person to the next. It just lost its consistency and it got hard to take the film seriously.The film is great, even a classic, but it all went sideways after the first movie.

259,GeorgeRoots,"For Its Time, Utter fantastic.",10,12 September 2014,"Again this is another film that was made at the same time ""Star Wars Episode 1"" (1999) was around, and the CGI looks definitively better. ""The Matrix"" was a welcoming edition to the Sci-Fi genre, Inspired by the Wachowski siblings love of cyberpunk, Japanese martial arts and Lewis Carroll. It has an extremely interesting synopsis about reality, considering the dawn of the information age.Reality (Seen by most humans) is actually a simulation defined as ""The Matrix"", created by sentient machines to wipe out the human population by farming and using their bodies as an energy source. A computer programmer ""Neo"" (Keanu Reeves) learns this truth and is drawn into a rebellion against the machines, involving other people who have been freed from this ""dream world"". All are being chased by ""Agents"" led by the more ruthless ""Agent Smith"" (Hugo Weaving), who wants to stop them from leaving the mainframe. Keanu Reeves is as wonderfully bland as ever, but turns in a decent performance. Carrie-Anne Moss's character ""Trinity"" became more likable over sequels, and of course Laurence Fishburne as ""Morpheus"" definitely remained the most respectable character throughout the franchise. Either way you look at it the show stealer's is a balance between Laurence Fishburne & Hugo Weaving, their performances are either way over the top or just spot on.Other than that, it's a spectacle in set pieces, choreography and directing. So many scenes are almost dream like in their fabricated quality, along with the ""reality"" sequences that look really dirty and trashed. ""Bullet Time"" became much more prominently used after the movie, and everyone would start dressing like the characters as parodies were spawned and the comic book reader in me felt that it was heavily similar to Grant Morrison's ""The Invisibles"" (1994-2000).Final Verdict: If you want A+ action and CGI, mixed with superb Martial Arts in a western landscape. Then I cannot recommend ""The Matrix"" enough. 10/10.",The Matrix

261,renegadeviking-271-528568,The Matrix review,10,25 January 2020,"Well, here it is! Yay, after being forced to sit through the boring parts of Transformers, I get to watch one of my favorite films of all time! WHOO!Trinity meets up with Neo, and we see some fantastic acting from our two leads. Sorry for the sarcasm, it's just true. But the acting's not too terrible, and it doesn't really bother me. We are left wondering what the Matrix really is when Trinity leaves. Neo wakes up late for work the next day, and gets into trouble. We learn that his real name is Mr. Thomas Anderson, something that Agent Smith will never ever let us forget.Neo is contacted my Morpheus at his job, and is warned that people (Agents) are coming for him. He is told when and where to go in order to avoid detection. The problem with this scene is that we learn that those outside the Matrix (where Morpheus is) can only view it in code, as the image renderers work for the Matrix. So...how can Morpheus see such specific images from looking at code?Neo tries to escape by climbing on the outside of the building, but gives up quickly, letting himself be taken by the Agents. Next comes a great interrogation scene, where our hero (Neo) and villain (Smith) meet for the very first time. Smith refers to Morpheus, the mysterious man Neo's been looking for as ""the most dangerous man alive."" Neo resists Smith's questions by asking for his phone call, but Smith asks what use that is if he is unable to speak, and removes his mouth.Sorry, that's horrifying, I know. Also, it's probably Keanu's best acting moment. But, anyways, Neo wakes up, believing it all to be a dream. He's contacted by Morpheus on a tapped line and told where to meet. The movie should've ended right there, with Agents capturing them. But it doesn't.He almost leaves, but Trinity tells him that he knows what's down that road. What, the sequels?
Anyways, they remove a tracking device from his navel which was inserted during the interrogation scene. They reach the building Morpheus is in, and Neo and him meet face-to-face. You could say it's a Face/Off... sorry for bringing up such an awful movie.So, Neo is told that the Matrix is everywhere. That he was born into a prison, into slavery. But, no one can be told what The Matrix is, they have to see it themselves, so Neo is given the classic choice, red pill or blue pill.
(To clarify: Red pill=leaving the Matrix, blue pill=staying) Obviously, Neo takes the red pill, and is then taken to a room where he is shown the cracks in reality and ejected from the Matrix into this nightmare:But, the Machines don't do that, and Neo is flushed down what is basically a toilet and rescued by Morpheus and his crew aboard the Nebuchadnezzar, an interesting name, but one that I'm not sure what the meaning of is. If someone knows why they chose this name, please let me know. (By the way, I already know about the biblical Nebuchadnezzar, I just don't know how the story connects.)Neo's muscles have atrophied, so they have to electrically stimulate them to repair them. The Wachowskis have covered all the bases of his body having decayed from non-use. (As far as I know, not being a doctor.) We are introduced to the vibrant colors of this film: grays, browns, and greens. We learn that, instead of 1999, it's closer to 2199. Really interesting, fish-out-of-water angle. We're introduced to the superfluous other crew members, who nobody cares about.
Who's your favorite Matrix character, little Timmy? Apoc! Shut up.Neo flips out, and Morpheus tells him that they normally recruit young, as older minds can't handle the strain. Neo is told the legend of The One, a man born in the Matrix who could change anything within it, and that the Oracle prophesied he would be reborn.Next, we learn that one of the memorable crew members, Tank, and his unmemorable brother, Dozer, were born outside the Matrix. Then, Neo has martial arts downloaded into his brain, prompting this iconic Keanu moment:Then, they enter a sparring program, where Neo is taught that those who know about the Matrix can bend or break the laws of physics in order to perform impossible stunts, and that they can't get tired inside the Matrix, because they're not really exercising. The kung fu (which Keanu, of course, knows) in this movie is incredibly well-choreographed and thought out, delivering a tension-filled fight which utilizes slow motion in some of the best ways I've ever seen it used in all of cinema.Neo moves incredibly fast, and he still doesn't believe Morpheus, somehow. He's loaded into the jump program, where he fails miserably, resulting in a clip somewhat like a Wile E. Coyote cartoon.Everyone's disappointed, but not surprised, because nobody makes the first jump. Neo finds that he's bleeding in the real world, because his mind ""made it real."" So, his mind caused his lip to bleed? Okay. And if you die in the Matrix, you die in the real world. Morpheus and Neo enter another training program, where Morpheus explains that the people inside the Matrix are dangerous because they will fight to protect the system. In other words, they will ""Stick to the Status Quo.""This whole exercise was showcasing that anyone in the Matrix can be your enemy. Keep your focus sharp. Eyes on the prize. Getcha head in the game. No, I won't stick that video in here, I wouldn't put two HSM songs on one post.We learn that the Agents are the guards of the Matrix, and that no one has survived a fight with them. But Neo can become faster and stronger than them, because he doesn't have to follow the rules of the Matrix.In the real world, we are introduced to the Sentinels, or Squiddies, which are a killing machine designed for one thing: search and destroy. The ships take them out using an EMP, but have to power down all systems first, in order to remain operational.Next, we get a scene between Cypher (the bald one) and Neo, and Cypher explains that they have to view the Matrix in code. This scene actually makes Cypher a relatable character, and quite possibly the only one (other than Morpheus and Trinity) to really connect with Neo. This makes it all the more effective when he turns evil and betrays the crew to the Agents in the next scene so he'll be allowed back into the Matrix with his memories wiped, and as someone rich and important, like an actor. They ask him for access codes to the Zion mainframe in return, which he doesn't know, but he promises them Morpheus, who does know.",The Matrix

Laden with astonishing visual and sound effects, it became an instant hit worldwide. While the plot may be on the complex side, this film scores in the area of entertainment. It is a dark film, toying with the idea that humans are like batteries, acting as slaves to fuel power for the 'machines'. No one has ever developed a concept so abstract at first thought, only to surprise people with the ingenuity of it.The Matrix is technically impressive, bagging four Oscars. There are moments of great editing, e.g. the 'rushy and tense' sequence at the end of the film when Neo (Keanu Reeves) is running away from the agents. You could almost feel yourself shouting for Neo to run faster. Though the soundtrack gets way too 'pop' at times, it is still effective, especially the instrumentals. The signature sound of the trumpet and horns blowing coupling to the slow-motion bullet time sequences are the hallmarks of the Matrix.Acting is sub-standard though, but the script demands little expressiveness from the cast. The Matrix is one of the best sci-fi films to come out in the 1990s, bringing instant gratification to viewers and critics alike.

I guess especially younger people was/is fascinated, much more than some older, who read, seen something of/about alternate reality, forged reality.For me, most interesting and moving part was early scene with Morpheus, when he introduced Neo with reality. I would rate it more than 8 if there was more such scene instead for my taste too much fight scenes. Even if they were pretty much innovative.Now, some days ago, I was shocked seeing that authors of this movie are Wachowski sisters - and I knew that Larry went thru gender change somewhere in 2003. But other one ... Now it is little corrected, but still - what matters: their names and gender when movie was made, or what is today ? Yeah, this is probably something new, but I really tend to keep record with original names, condition. Imagine now that instead John Houston and his pic. we see now something like 'former John Houston' and picture of his grave. But maybe I'm just an old fashioned old grumpy man, who can not accept new things, habits in society. Or this new, pushed by some circles PC behavior, even if it resulted already in lot of nonsense and absurdness. I guess, they really are in some kind of alternate reality. And when realize how wrong it is, it will be to late. Worst thing is that there is already lot of it, seen in Matrix present - tracking, watching, hearing people via computers, smart phones (GPS) etc.And unlike in movie Matrix, good fighting skills, slow motion (time freeze) will not help in this. I was on that will watch it again from time to time, but sorry, things in our reality are more shocking and scary. As say: life writes best stories. Pardon, wrong word. Not best, most interesting. Not good. Where is Neo, when we need him ?",The Matrix
264,patches89,FREE YOUR MIND!!,9,22 April 2021,"The Matrix at its time of release was one of the most hyped up films ever and even over 20 years since its still beloved by the movie public. The first time I saw it I absolutely didnt get on with it but as time has gone on and the more I understood what they were doing I have grown to love it, albeit its a bit overrated. Mopheus (Laurence Fishburne) and Trinity (Carrie-Ann Moss) track down Neo (Keanu Reeves) before Agent Smith (Hugo Weaving) gets to him and unplugs his mind to join the fight against the Matrix. It was a film that changed the way sci-fi stories were told and paved the way forward.",The Matrix
265,Emerenciano,Amazing!!!!,10,16 April 2002,"""Matrix"" is certainly different from anything else you have ever seen before. Full of surprises and action, the plot gets your attention from the beginning to the end of the film. Wachowski Brothers greatly directed this movie with an enchanting creativity that made ""Matrix"" an innovating film, full of incredible sounds and visual effects. Keanu Reeves is Neo, a hacker who is invited by Morpheus (Laurence Fishburne) to discover what Matrix is. Curious about it, he accepts the invitation and enters a world of pure action and adventure. Beautiful Carrie-Ann Moss plays Trinity, who helps Neo out in his discovery.

266,macpherr,The issue is whether or not there is a Messianic message beneath the surface?,7,13 April 2000,"Some people believe that there is a Messianic message in this movie because of the fight between Matrix's campaign of domination in the ""real"" world and ""Thomas A. Anderson / Neo,"" Keanu Reeves (A Walk in the Clouds, Much Ado About Nothing) the man who is to save the world.  He joins warriors ""Morpheus "" Laurence Fishburne (Searching for Bobby Fischer),  and ""Trinity"" Carrie Ann Moss (Lethal Tender)  in their warfare against the Matrix.Neo does die and comes back to life and at one point he believes that ""He is the One"" to save the world. If that was the intent of the writer, the message is not clear as far as I am concerned. There are Messianic elements in many of the super-heros such as Superman, with his powerful vision, Batman who fights the evil and forces of darkness of Gotham City and I just think that Neo is another super-hero with some type of god like' characteristics. To characterize the movie as a Christian movie is really stretching it. There is an element of deception such as the woman in red, is she real or is she a deceiver?  There is deception  in Batman when all the enemies come wearing a camouflage such as Mr. Freeze, The Riddler,   etc. I believe that there is an element of deception or even mistaken identity, if you will, in many movies. I really enjoyed the movie for its special effects and so did the members of the Academy of Motion Pictures as the movie won an Oscar for Special Effects among many other Oscars. I am not much into science fiction but I bought the tape because it was recommended by a bunch of Christian friends. The movie is fine, but I found that the movies such as ""The Sixth Sense"" also have a religious side to them as the boy seeks peace and shelter in a church. There is definitely a struggle between good and evil, but everyone is dead already.  In ""The Sixth Sense"" nobody gets that there is no big mystery about the movie except that they are all dead and are talking. Does the dead talk? The Bible indicates that they do. Look at Lazarus. And that was the catch, in The Matrix, that many are led to believe: whether or not there is a Messianic message beneath the surface. Perhaps, there is,  but I do not see that as a Christian movie, just a     science-fiction movie which you can analyze anyway you want to. I had a hard time identifying scenes that were thoughts and scenes that were part of the ""realm of reality in the movie."" Anyway, I thought that The Truman Show had a big element of the ""eternal"" versus the ""temporary""  in the realm of reality. Favorite Scenes: Trinity jumping from one building to another. Obviously no human can do that without some type of super power. But I don't think that it would be fair to compare her to the Trinity known by Christians. Favorite Quotes: Trinity: "" You're looking for him. I know because I was once looking for the same thing. And when he found me, he told me I wasn't really looking for him. I was  looking for an answer. It's the question that drives us. It's the question that brought you here.""  Morpheus:"" I'm trying to free your mind, Neo. But I can only show you the door. You're the one that has to walk through it."" This type language sounds really Messianic. I guess one could watch the movie from that perspective. Perhaps it should be fun to have a discussion on the topic of the Christian message in ""The Matrix."" We will have to wait until the sequel to see if that was indeed a much larger Messianic side to the story.  I am not sure! Just watch and make your own analysis now and of any future Matrix. Actually I could argue both sides of the issue.",The Matrix

It is way too long and the acting is stiff, especially Keanu ""get me a new facial expression"" Reeves.  Who cares about the special effects when the story is incoherent and uninteresting?  I certanly don't.  It disturbs me that many people consider this not only a great movie, but a classic!!!!  Did these people see the same movie I did.  I saw a dumb action movie with delusions of grandeur.  I say watch Star Wars again and see what real storytelling is all about.",The Matrix
270,Jacques98,"Decent story, but it lacked so much quality.",3,19 September 2008,"The Matrix isn't the mind trip that everyone says it is. The story is pretty standard, even a tad cliché. It pretty much takes Alice In Wonderland and makes it slightly more mature, and that is really it. Our world isn't real, but the matrix is real. Okay, so how is that original? The idea has been toyed around with in every single fantasy story since about the time The Chronicles of Narnia was written. I simply do not understand why so many people think that is so originalit's not even close. In essence, it was pretty predictable to me.But my major problem was it was dull. Most of the movie was nothing but your standard fantasy lingo that I've heard so many times I was about to fast forward through it all. ""Our world is real, not yours."" Then, ""But, wait, how can that be?"" And so on. I can tell you exactly what was going on in this movie from the first trailer, much less halfway through.Action is minimal. Violence is non-existent. I don't understand why this was rated R, at all, unless the produces paid the MPAA to give it an R-rating so it looked more ""hardcore"" than it really is. The few action scenes that did take place were okay, but nothing to phone home about, even when the movie was released.Acting is cheesy. Enough said. A lot of this movie I couldn't even take seriously because the acting was so cheesy. Whoever was in charge of casting for this film really had no idea how to pick solid actors to fill the roles.Overall, I guess it was okay. Pretty average and predictable, just like all the Wachowski brother's movies. It was fun, and better than sitting at home with nothing to do, but I can't say much more than that.3/10",The Matrix
271,nicolechan916,Intricate story with great action and effects.,9,12 April 2015,"This is honestly my first time watching this film, unless I saw it when I was really young in which case I don't remember anything about it. It's very interesting to note that the definition of 'the matrix' from the film has nothing to do with the bending of the back into that limbo position, and yet it has become known as that in the world. Even to people who have never really seen the film (like me), still refer to that action as matrix.I actually really like this film, I don't know if I love it, but I definitely will watch the sequels and probably even need to watch this one again soon. The reason being that I did not totally understand what was going on in respect to the transition between worlds, until my friend clarified it for me and it made so much more sense after. However, I didn't realize I hadn't understood until I talked about it, as the film really engages you with its actions, effects, dialogue - basically everything. There is so much going on in the film at one time, that even if you do not fully understand what is happening, you are invested in that moment there and then.The acting was good too, though the speech did feel a little dry at times. Hugo Weaving portrays the villain character very well and his expressions speak volumes. Keanu Reeves, Laurence Fishburne and Carrie-Anne Moss are also very badass in this, I like it! Though I do have to comment on the fact that Trinity is the only prominent female character in this and she is reduced to emotion, once again promoting the male = active, female = passive, binaries.Speaking of badass, the action scenes were really on point. It was very fast-paced and has that glitch feel to it which emphasizes the concept of the world. It does feel odd sometimes and I know this is part of the concept, but I really hate (can't stand it ever) when there is flying involved in fights. I just cannot deal.The effects were phenomenal, and seems really progressive of its time. I mean this was before the turn of the century, and yet we are still getting movies with not so great visual effects today.Also, it is great how the film covers almost all aspects of life: action, romance, friendships, violence, society, digital age and whatnot. I've read reviews that attribute philosophical and religious meanings to this, but I personally prefer not to go along those lines. A really great film, and I can't help but wonder if Inception was influenced by this. The Wachowski Brothers really have a trademark in the stories they tell; I was not surprised when I found out they directed Cloud Atlas as well, it has a similar style to The Matrix. Plus they even created V for Vendetta, one of my favourites, but they didn't direct it which shows because it doesn't really have their style in it.Read more movie reviews at: championangels.wordpress.com",The Matrix

273,akash_sebastian,An Incredible and Revolutionary Sci-Fi Thriller; An Exceptional Addition to the Cyberpunk Genre.,9,10 August 2014,"After their remarkable debut movie 'Bound' in 1996, the Wachowski Siblings come up with their incredible and revolutionary sci-fi thriller 'The Matrix'. These siblings always know how to enthrall both the mind and the heart. With such a brilliant concept, spectacular and innovative action sequences, and a gripping story, they keep you hooked and in awe throughout the movie. The characters, the dialogues and the scenes have become legendary now. No matter how many times you watch it, it thrills you every single time.The movie can be seen as a stand-alone one or the first part of the trilogy; no matter how you watch it, it's simply brilliant. It is a metaphor and allegory for so many things. Mainly, it tries to tell how our urban lives are so commercialized and media-driven that we're almost blinded by it. The film blurs the lines between fate and reality; ultimately, it depends on us as to how we take our life forward. A life of ignorance or a life based on knowledge - though happiness/satisfaction is possible either way, only one of them can keep a particular person happy; sometimes, it's our choice what we choose to go forward with, and we should have the strength to go forward with the choice we've made.An average living-day-to-day guy waking up one day to find himself to be different, important, and many people depending on him - Who hasn't had that dream? This would be one of the most full-fledged and elaborate execution of that fantasy.Bill Pope's cinematography and Zach Staenberg's editing make the action sequences seem out of this world (pun intended); it takes you to a completely different level of cinematic action. I remember, when I first saw the movie (back in 2000 or something), I was completely blown away.Keanu Reeves is perfect for the role of Neo, and he slides in perfectly into the character of the young naive programmer trying to understand and grasp the limits (or should I say, no limits) of the new reality presented before him. Carrie-Anne Moss, Laurence Fishburne, and Hugo Weaving perform commendably, and form outstanding and memorable supporting characters of Trinity, Morpheus and Agent Smith respectively. Each one of them has their own unique part to play.From the prophecy of 'The One' to self doubt, there are many Christian references in the film, and there are influences from other religions as well. Influence doesn't matter, as long as it leads to the creation of something unique and exceptional. Japanese anime and Asian martial arts films had great influence on the Wachowski Siblings, but it was Mamoru Oshii's 1995 animated film 'Ghost in the Shell' that pushed them to delve into the cyberpunk genre. And as we all know it now, the result was one-of-a-kind.",The Matrix

I'd rather just tell you why, as much as I enjoyed it, I don't recommend this.I bought The Matrix on VHS in 12th grade to see it since my cousin suggested it and it's in the book 1001 Movies You Must See Before You Die, a dare I am trying to accomplish.Visually, this movie is astonishing. A fun fact I heard was that the movie was filmed to look like you were viewing it on a computer, which I could kind of see. The acting's fine, the stunts are cool, aspects like that are good or at least decent. However, I often found the story to be a bore.At the point I saw it, I found may live action movies to be uninteresting and mainly stuck to animated movies. I was breaking out of it, so I just thought: see it for what it is. Find what you like about this. You can't watch animated movies forever!Even with that mindset, I couldn't like The Matrix. 1999 had better movies to offer: American Beauty, The Green Mile, Magnolia, Toy Story 2, Tarzan, The Blair Witch Project, Office Space, etc. Heck, I'll throw Larry Boy and the Rumor Weed in there!If you enjoy The Matrix, good for you. But it wasn't for me and I can't recommend to others.Note: I almost gave this a 6 when I saw it, but an action segment with a train bumped it up one star.",The Matrix

278,tburke85,The Matrix An Excellent Sci-Fi Adventure With Great Action,9,11 June 2009,"The Matrix is an excellent sci-fi adventure with great action from the Wachowski brothers who are admirable in making this movie about a computer hacker who discovers that the world and the life he's been living is an illusion. A computer generated dream world that was created a long time ago to keep the humans in a prison from which only a few can escape who are brave enough to fight the deadly machines that have taken over the real world. I preferred this one over the two disappointing sequels that followed. Reoladed was okay but could've been better and Revolutions was the worst of the trilogy mainly because the story lost focus on the main characters, the finale felt rushed, and the ending that does leave the door open for another possible sequel was a major letdown. The Matrix however is one of the best sci-fi films out there because of the compelling story, complex characters, a menacing villain, some humor, a little romance, and with just enough intense action. Keanu Reeves stars as Neo the computer hacker who discovers he has a greater destiny than he could have ever imagine. He is the chosen One a man gifted with amazing abilities who may be the only one powerful enough to stop the machines and free his people. Reeves makes for a solid hero who may not win any awards for his performance but he still does a good job in the role. The same can go for Laurence Fishburne as Morpheus a man who believes in The One and wants to free Neo in order to show him the truth about their world. Fishburne is convincing as Morpheus and his fight sequences are impressive especially his sparring match with Reeves. Carrie Anne Moss is believable as the tough freedom fighter Trinity who begins to grow feelings for Neo but she doesn't want to admit it. Moss also does a great job in her fight sequences portraying a woman you definitely wouldn't want to mess with. Hugo Weaving is an imposing villain as Agent Smith a sentinel program who makes it his mission to stop Neo from fulfilling his destiny. Weaving chews the scenery with menace and does a terrific job with his part in the movie. The rest of the supporting cast are admirable in their roles but none of them really stand out. The action/fight sequences are well executed the ones that left an impression being the first one that opens the movie, the sparring match with Reeves and Fishburne, the lobby shootout, and the fierce showdown between Neo and Agent Smith in a subway. The special effects to create the machines and the ruins of the real world where the machines have taken over which is shown a few times are magnificently done. Also worth mentioning is the music by Don Davis which seems to match perfect whats happening on the screen and the tone of the film. The pacing of the movie was a little slow but once the action kicks into high gear it moves at a steady pace from there. The movie does leave a lot of questions unanswered but other than those few flaws this is still an amazing sci-film that definitely impressed me when I first saw it. So overall The Matrix is a great experience with the state of the art special effects, a compelling story, intense action, suspense, some humor, a little romance, and impressive performances by the cast who make this an enjoyable sci-fi movie to watch.",The Matrix

But h**l, its not THAT good!I mean come on! I used to had no problems with this movie the first time I saw it, but I have learned to hate it, since its so EXTREMELY overrated (just having it 29 on the best movies ever is a proof).THE MATRIX is although trying really hard, but I can't even seem to be impressed by one single actionscene. In my opinion. Go see FACE/OFF or some other John Woo-movie to be stunned by action (it won't happen a lot). And it starts up with being (er, sorry trying to be) a smart sci-fi-movie, but suddenly Morpheus gets kidnapped by a team of wooden-acting-agents and it ends up like ANY OTHER bye-bye-brain actionmovie! Am I wrong? Climbing on walls, bounching off bullets, oohh... Give me a break! To be clear, I'd say like this: ''After 25 minutes we know what the matrix is, the rest of the movie is a long hyped up, action-standard, with a lot of glamour. Ehh... intelligent? NOT!I'm still confused how this movie got to be such a hit (yeah, go ahead mindless matrix-fans, laugh it all off), because the entire movie is old stuff, in a new package. The acting, with the exception of Laurence Fishbourne and perhaps little Joe too, is awful. Keanu seems tired and his entire face shines with that ''I should have listened to my mommy, and become a lawyer''-face. The rest of the cast is on the edge of average, many below.Oh, yeah, lets not forget all the martial arts.

Why don't you guys check out THE MATRIX after about 33 years, it will probably be so boring that it won't be watchable, and people will wonder: How the h**l did this win 4 academy awards?Just thinking about Matrix 2, and 3 makes my blood chill.

282,The_Core,What a lot of people miss...,9,4 February 2001,"Dear Matrix Viewer,With every highly successful film (especially a film involving the Academy Awards(tm)), there is a backlash some time after release.  There are several reasons for this backlash, one being that people generally don't like what they perceive to be ""too much success,"" whatever that may be for a person. Some people seem to feel personally diminished when they witness a great success -- or they compare a film to a personal favorite, rather than viewing it 'in isolation' -- for what it is AS IS, not for what it's judged against.Another reason is that many don't realize a film is *more than the sum of its parts*.  When a movie is first released, this fact is generally recognized, and a movie is enjoyed as a whole.  Later, people tend to pick the film apart, viewing it as *the sum of its parts*, and concluding that because of the perceived faults in various parts, the movie itself can't be so great.  The sense of a film as *the whole banana* gets lost when people pick it apart.Yet another is that people generally get tired of hype.  Many are bothered by commercial hype, and feel that when individuals hype (enjoy/love) a movie, some sort of unforgivable sin has been committed.The psychology of a successful film could fill a book.  Notice how well ""Titanic"" was received when it appeared on the big screen -- people were seeing it then as a movie, a whole -- and AS a whole, it's a great film. Later, people saw it as the sum of many different scenes, and so it seemed like a poor film.  It's just too easy to lose the ability to watch a movie AS a movie after it's been around for awhile, and people pick and pick at it, until even the greatest film can appears flawed and generally worthless.Anyway, if you understand some of the psychology behind how films are seen by people due to various factors, it all starts to make sense.  And (perhaps unfortunately) it gets to be quite dull watching the (at first) intelligent comments on a forum like IMDB turn to black and white -- either it's ""the greatest movie ever made"" or it's a piece of... well, you get the idea.THINK, people.  And please, try to see how the effects of *time* upon a motion picture operate.  Why a film that was initially perceived as a stunning achievement by both the public and the critics can later be viewed by many as ""lousy,"" or alternately become canonized in people's minds as ""the greatest movie of all time.""I still rate The Matrix 10/10.  I still know how to see it as more than the sum of its parts.  I hope you do, too (or will, someday).",The Matrix
283,zac-04879,"A Clever, Entertaining and Popcorn-Worthy Classic",7,5 August 2021,"This film is clever, complex and excellent science fiction cinematography. Although it's not very fast and briefly lacks a fair amount of enthusiasm, the Wachowskis have intelligently structured an entertaining and engaging treasure. If you can't live through science fiction action movies, it's probably a smart choice to avoid this one.Despite a fairly entertaining and gripping plot, there are unfortunately several elements that, just briefly, ruin The Matrix. This includes the irritatingly-loud movement and music. The film's soundtrack sits perfectly in the background, leaving the impressively exciting up the front. However, it's annoying to have to constantly reach for the remote in order to increase or decrease the volume. That's because the discussions between the characters can get very quiet.Talking about the action again, the visual effects are eye-taking and the noise will bring most audiences even closer. Other than the very eager action sequences, the story is quite appealing as well. But most movies usually never lack some tediousness. The Matrix certainly joins them.However, Keanu Reeves owns a mastered performance in this movie. The rest of the cast is also fabulous! It's also another one of those sci-fi movies that's highly likely to have many teens and adults feeling puzzled, but it's very difficult to not enjoy this great story.

Part of the Mass Indoctrination Machine that educates us to worship shadows and not to probe beyond the surfaces of what we see for the inner workings of it all. Now this is a film with meat on its bones both thematically and technically. What is not touched upon here? There is the interface between 'reality' and 'illusion', a very cinematic take on Plato's Allegory of the Cave, a consideration of reification versus abstraction aided by CGI imagery to nail down all the particulars.Here you have the process that must be undergone to conquer every prejudice, every narrow-minded POV that precludes the unleashing of true potential and beingness. What must be renounced and destroyed in our illusionary constructs to seize upon a new and more salutary truth? What must be accepted and embraced to be newly constructed as the rebirth of Truth? We have in this film presented in a very entertaining way a means of exploring these concepts from a fresh perspective.THE MATRIX is a perfect paradigm for the Computer and Information Age, where the energy of machines becomes a surrogate for passion and data itself is the substance of a Hell masquerading as Heaven. Keanu Reeves as the Computer Programmer/Computer Hacker Neo is a secret rebel against the Status Quo without realizing that what he is rebelling against is beyond even the range of his understanding. The legendary Morpheus comes into his life to pull his coat about what's really going on, but first must send him into the abyss of his own unreality turned inside out and back again.Because of the limitations of Cinema, no plausible utopian worlds are postulated realistically; only the idea of a universe at constant war with itself involving citizens awake and citizens still slumbering. This is all very artfully and dramatically explored, with beleaguered humanity fighting in a wasteland to reclaim a vision that long ago was co-opted by their data spewing machines.The beauty of THE MATRIX is that it fully rests on Cinema's strengths; its ability to create artifice and circus like magic tricks in a spellbinding way. It also serves up and reveals its primary weakness; its inability to pierce the skin of the apple and go to the core of experiences and ideas even when to all the world that appears to be precisely what it is doing.There is not much more I can add about this ground breaking work, rooted as it is in this new cultural mileau of ever advancing data assimilation towards a global awareness of what it takes to run a planet or even a universe populated with slaves operating as the servo-mechanisms for those sentient entities forging their chains with the stuff that dreams are made of, but it looks good and it rides good and who knows but that it might somehow lead you to read a book and create your own abstractions to reify?",The Matrix
286,hasosch,When virtual reality turns into real imagination,8,8 September 2009,"Adding another comment of ""The Matrix"" (1999) in addition to the over 2'000 almost published ones may seem pretentious. However, as it appears, most people have not understood that the ""matrix"" is that what we, according to the movie, mistakenly take for ""the"" reality. It is our ontology and our metaphysics, the space of the objects which we can meet during the trip of our life. But again according to the movie, this reality-matrix is nothing but an artificial construct produced by a computer program, so that it is this ""virtual"" reality which produces our ""real reality"". In addition, also the programmers which have written these omnipotent programs, are nothing else but functions of the program itself. So, the program is operated by its programmers, but it also operates on the programmers. Such logical circularity is excluded from any science which is based on two-valued Aristotelian logic - and this all kind of science we are able to technically realize by now. Insofar, this movie is ""Science Fiction"", but in a good sense of the term.However, there is one of these long monologues of Laurence Fishburn-Morpheus where he gives for Keanu Reeve's character - and the audience - detailed metaphysical commentaries about the relationship of the two levels of reality, the seemingly real reality produced by the matrix and the indeed ""real"" virtual reality. Here, one has to say that at least for Morpheus, the ""real"" (i.e. non-virtual) reality must actually exist, because it serves him as a reference-basis for his explications of the virtual reality which produced the ""real"" matrix-reality. If it would not, then even Morpheus could not differentiate, let's say, if the ""virtual hull"" of a crew-member of his or his actual ""realy body"" has died. Multiplying the traditional one-reality-ontology and metaphysics does not let dissolve this latter concepts, in the opposite, the more realities are constructed, the more important the ""real"" reality gets as a basis of reference. The reason is that we cannot perceive a priori objects of any reality without ""filtering"" them with our senses, so we perceive them as signs - and those are, by their very nature, always interpreted. Thus, any reality is already interpreted reality and therefore needs a Tertium Comparationis for the sake of comparison and thus reference. Everything else would be a nightmare which would dissolve the human brain long before being able to create such fantasy worlds.",The Matrix

Nothing but the little-bit-stupid ending.  It was good but just a little stupid.  the acting is very good and Keanu Reeves and Laurence Fishburne are really cool.  Carrie Anne-Moss is really cool in this, too.Overall the entire movie was great and the special effects amazed me.  I can not wait for The Matrix sequels to come out.

They cast such an abominable shadow upon the original film that one just cannot give ""The Matrix"" the highest mark. If they were shot by different persons, with different cast, etc. it could have been neglected. Alas, the same persons are doing it in. That is why ""The Lawnmower Man"" is better and deserves a definite 10 out of 10.If you want to see how a brilliant movie can be destroyed by clumsy sequels - this is a sheer example.As to the movie itself, it is properly done and is captivating. In ""The Matrix"" everything is slick...9 out of 10. Thank you for attention.",The Matrix
289,Jerique,The Matrix Has You! - The Review,9,8 January 2008,"In the dusk of the millennium, The Matrix was released to screens worldwide, dazzling audiences around with it's kung-fu martial arts, rapid-fast punches, impossible leaps, intense story and gripping heroes and villains.Keanu Reeves plays the protagonist Thomas A Anderson, a program writer for a software company, who also lives a double life hacking as ""Neo"" while he searches for a man named Morpheus (Lawrence Fishburne). Carrie-Anne Moss plays Trinity, a gravity-avoiding woman who has so much skill and precision who make anyone think she is a guy. You throw in the rest of the cast and you've got a pretty good crew of resistance against the machines.It sorta plays off as a Terminator-esquire type movie doesn't it? With fictitious Neo as the Connor -prophetic, we will win because of him- character. Even with that, I enjoy The Matrix for everything that it is. It's a science-fiction action movie with tons of laughs and heart-felt moments. I especially like the effects that were never used before.Actors that do the kungfu moves are actually doing the moves and not using stunt doubles. I hate when an actor is ""believed"" to be doing the moves and they don't even know how even ""pretend"" to know the moves. People will give grief for the romance subplot, but it's really not a subplot since it's hinted at during the entire movie, it's just that until the end, Trinity couldn't speak about it because she was afraid.I love how complex the plot gets near the end and I love the story itself because it makes you question yourself, the world, and wonder really - am I a program? It's one of the -- if not the -- greatest films ever created and that's something to say because it's science fiction fantasy. I am not alone in that statement, considering it won 4 Oscars, one in the category of special/visual effects. If you hate it, I'd really like to know why.",The Matrix
290,TheCorniestLemur,The Matrix is everywhere...unfortunately,9,16 August 2021,"So...I'm reviewing The Matrix. I'm sure no one's ever said anything I'm about to say.Well, I'll bring up all the obvious stuff in a bit, but first I want to stress that this is a pretty important film to me. I first saw it when I was 13, and I think I owe a lot of my love for film to that initial experience.Somehow, I had managed to avoid knowing what the titular Matrix was, and I won't be spoiling that in this review just in case any of you have also managed to avoid that particular piece of knowledge...somehow. If you have no idea what I'm talking about though, Do. Not. Read. This. Review. Just go and watch it now, because that experience I had when watching this for the first time is such a...well, experience that it really saddens me knowing that this film is so ingrained in the collective consciousness that it's virtually impossible to go into it knowing nothing.So if you do know what I'm referring to, you can probably imagine that as a stupid 13 year old who hadn't ventured much outside the realm of family-friendly classics and stupid action films, sitting down to watch this just because it was on TV and I had heard its name mentioned a few times, by the 35 minute mark or so, my mind had absolutely exploded. Sure, you can chalk some of that up to me having not heard of any of the philosophical concepts this film has under its belt, but there were plenty of grown adults similarly mind-blown back in 1999.Quite fittingly, this film opened my eyes in a sense, and made me want to check out deeper stuff instead of just the other stuff I mentioned, and I don't think that would have happened in the same way if I had watched any other film at that time.Because while there is certainly philosophical and allegorical stuff, ranging from the nature of reality, to reincarnation, to the fact that the Wachowskis had created a film partially about the experience of being transgender years before they were out as such, and years before anyone who wasn't trans even knew about or cared about trans people (seriously how is all this happening all at once), there is also robots, kung fu, jumping 50 feet in the air, badass gunfights, and people looking really cool. In short, everything that appeals to stupid 13 year olds like I was.In my mind, it's an absolutely perfect bridge between mindless fun action, and things that challenge your brain a bit more, because it definitely served as a kind of bridge for me. And while I'm not going to talk about the story anymore than I already have, rest assured it is amazing, and that all the main cast is interesting and really damn cool. Even though I'd never call this an especially character-driven film, what is there is more than enough to make them all memorable.And holy crap are they perfectly cast. This is most definitely one of those roles that fits Keanu (you know what happens when he's playing a role that doesn't fit him), Carrie-Anne Moss is badass as all hell, Laurence Fishburne exudes such a thick mysterious air, Hugo Weaving took a potentially bland as hell villain and turned him into one of the best in sci-fi history, do I need to go on?It's perfectly paced, amazingly directed and shot, the soundtrack is fantastic, and you all already know how perfect the action scenes in this are. That does bring me to a small complaint though...some of the effects haven't held up all that well. Not all of them, but certainly enough that it's noticeable. There is also a small amount of pretty bad line delivery, and I bloody hate something that happens towards the end that is never explained and makes absolutely zero sense, but other than that, well...you probably know how great this is already, and if you haven't seen it yet, and especially if you don't know what it's about, please go and watch it before some genius just tells you what it's about. Because more than any other film that almost everyone knows the twist of (The Empire Strikes Back, The Sixth Sense, Planet Of The Apes, etc), I think this is the one that would be best experienced knowing nothing about it, and the one for which it sucks the most that that is nearly impossible these days.So...why are you still here? Go watch it, like, now.",The Matrix
291,akhil027,One of the Best Sci-Fi Action Movie Ever Made.,9,7 December 2020,"I only knew about that slow-mo scene until today. Finally decided to watch this masterpiece today. And boy, did it blew my mind!
The first half an hour I was like ""meh! this is not that great"". Then came the action scenes. The matrix has one the coolest action sequence and background score ever in the history of cinema. It's probably one of the most original movies ever made.

292,illbebackreviews,The Matrix is the most mindblowing and groundbreaking achievement since the time of its release,10,17 October 2012,"Apart from 'The Lord of the Rings' and 'The Dark Knight' trilogy, 'The Matrix' is perhaps the greatest cinematic achievement since its release year, 1999. I've seen the Matrix a few times and mainly seen the action dozens of times. Today, I re-watched the movie and was more than blown away by the movie. The Matrix is just groundbreaking and jaw dropping in pretty much every aspect. The acting is fantastic, even Keanue Reeves did a splendid job in this movie, the visual effects are revolutionary, the plot behind it is so unique and nothing but masterfully directed, written in amazing style with brilliant dialogue and action, containing great stunt work. A mix of CGI with practical effects certainly makes this movie all the more realistic and groundbreakingThe Matrix is about a young man who experiences that he lives in two different worlds; one he is a computer hacker, the other he is an employee at a computer software company. He is taken by a mysterious man named Morpheus and is shown the truth about humanity and that something called the 'matrix' is concealing the truth away from ordinary citizens. The world, in the present year of 2099, is covered in ruins after incidents that happened long before. This movie is pretty much all about Neo becoming the One to fulfill the prophecy and becoming the One.The plot in this movie can be so confusing at times if you do not pay attention, much like Inception. When the comparison does come, I always will say that the Matrix is a more amazing piece of art and is actually regarded as amazing by some and the most overrated movie by others. Calling this the most overrated movie ever is like calling Avatar the greatest. It doesn't work like that. No movie in my Top 10 of all time do I have a single issue with expect this movie, which turns out to be a minor issue under great directing, writing, acting, characters, story and action as well as breathtaking visuals. That is the music which could've been done better. That is easily forgotten when an action scene I've seen dozens of times before still intensifies me so all is forgiven. 'The Matrix' is easily one of the most memorable movies of all time and those who trash this movie should go back to watching Batman and Robin. Truly one of the best movies ever made: Groundbreaking, Epic, Visually Stunning, Masterpiece. Belongs in my Top 10 list.

293,mirosuionitsaki2,Wake Up And See,9,5 June 2012,"I've been meaning to watch the Matrix series from beginning to end, instead of various clips of it when someone in my family were watching it. I do not regret spending seven hours watching the series. The first Matrix film is sure to be a hit, especially if you enjoy Anime. Some of the fighting techniques and scenes seem based on the fighting you would see in Japanese animation. 9/10 is this movie. I took off a point for the cheesy ""I love you but I'm not going to tell you but I'm going to start a sentence that makes the viewers think I'm about to tell you but I'm not"". Maybe it was common in the past, but it's cheesy for my view.Imagine finding out your whole life was a life. Imagine finding out you were actually in a computer, and that in reality, civilization was destroyed years ago? Imagine trying to fight the machines that destroyed civilization.. a civilization of billions. I just summed up the entire movie.One irritating plot event that I won't really mark off for was the fact that Neo was pretty quick to getting ready to save Morphius. Maybe it was because he had new information downloaded into his brain, which is another reason this is 9 and not 8 out of 10, but after being inexperienced and untrained, he's pretty quick to risk his life. But it makes for an exciting and action-filled ending..",The Matrix

The story does, however, offer a plausible explanation as to why all the exorbitant action sequences (people stalling in mid-air, running against walls, dodging bullets etc) are possible, and in the end it's those action sequences that make it all worthwile: they are simply very cool.It doesn't happen often, but in this case I'd say that the ""coolness"" of the action sequences more then makes up for any plot holes.

296,meathookcinema,A very deep film- if you only watch films at your local multiplex,5,21 January 2018,"I missed this when it was first released. However, at the time I saw clips of the fights scenes and the slow mo bullet sequences and was duly impressed. What would i think of the film on first viewing almost 20 years later?I never lost interest during this film and I can see why it was such a huge hit in 1999. Its heartening when any highly stylised film which isn't utter base level bilge to take megabucks at the box office.But heres where The Matrix succeeds brilliantly. It offers mind blowing concepts- but isn't too deep. It offers striking visuals- which unfortunately quickly became de rigueur as many other films, commercials and pop videos copied this visual style. Not the fault of the filmmakers and as they say, imitation is the sincerest form of flattery.Certain parts of the film feel like a comic book fans fapfest. The costumes assumed by the main protagonists would only be thought cool by basement dwelling geeks. Black PVC, long coats and clumpy boots- a cyberpunk's wet dream. Soo late 90s.But this film did dare to take to the masses something original and daring. It succeeded. Fair play especially in these times of stale remakes and turgid reboots. But don't try to interpret things too deeply. Beneath the surface isn't a whole lot of depth or substance. Precisely why it was so massive.The scene need the end where we learn that Neo really is 'the one' is one of the most bombastic, unintentionally hilarious sequences in modern cinema. I don't know if its pure cheese, genius or both. Which is noteworthy in itself.But for a film that tries to show us what the modern world is really like and what it revolves around I'll still stick with They Live. A film that accomplishes its mission statement with less gloss, has infinitely more depth, substance and charm and does so on a substantially smaller budget than The Matrix.",The Matrix
297,TheHande,An Intriguing Film,8,15 February 2007,"Watching 'The Matrix' for the first time is one of those occasions that really makes you go WTF! An intriguing and a rarely used concept is translated successfully to the screen. Far from being a brainless action- and effects-fest the film has a deep psychology behind it and the result is simply astonishing.The only problem with the film is that it is at its best when watched for the first time. After that the film kinda loses the intrigue it originally had and this may explain the rather lukewarm response of the film's sequels.As a cinematographic experiment the film is absolutely fantastic, keeping the viewer glued to their seat with an interesting but not at all complicated idea.

298,theinaniloquent,"""Free your mind""",10,15 November 2011,"A computer hacker learns from mysterious rebels about the true nature of his reality and his role in the war against its controllers.Sci-fi movies differ in nature. Mostly, nowadays, they are filled with glorified special effects but nothing else to even it out. I'm looking at you Transformers! Some have surprised us all, with their intelligent uses and creating something for all of us. They combine the special effects and acting, directing, and philosophies. I'm looking at you Inception! But in 1999, something was different was the Matrix. Although not as good as Inception, something was obscured behind it's slo-mo action sequences. It deals with Buddhist philosophies. We are living in a lie and their are two different realities. The other reality is secreted but yet to be found; this sounding so much like the Matrix. And it is. The brothers debut deals with everything you can imagine; with possibly the best action scenes of all time. I've read the bad reviews and all what people are complaining about is the acting or the cheesiness. Please, this movie DOES have a little of both and at times it has it's flaws; but if you look deep within (free your mind) you might well see the most controversial movie of all time. Now listen, I probably re-watched this film at least 10 times; each time was a different experience. But just this last one I realized how much of this movie deals with the outside. The first time was glorifying the action scenes. The second time was glorifying it's intelligent plot. You need to see the Matrix to find out what it is, it's power to suck your soul into this parallel universe where everything is different. The film questions life itself, varying the things we deal with at all times. You need to ask yourself this question throughout the film: what is life? What is it's breaking point? The answer will be reveled through the movies course... Everything will seem a bit different than what you shall see more clearly. I am praising this movie, for one, as it is much different than others. It doesn't rely on it's best pal SPECIAL EFFECTS. The Matrix will rely on you, yourself, and your mind which leads me to the final question... Will you take the blue pill? Or the red pill? 10/10.",The Matrix
299,Shiva-11,Best fresh action/plot combination since Face Off,8,1 April 1999,"After all the trailers, interviews, and general hype, I stood in line, special preview pass in hand, ready for the action film of the season. Subconsciously, the question Can they deliver or will TM join Johnny Mnemonic on the Keanu scrap heap dogged me as the lights went out.The first twenty minutes of the film seemed to confirm the worst:  it was choppy, cryptic and I found my mind wandering.  Luckily the pace picked up and never slowed down again. As Neo, Reeves gives a fairly wooden performance (something we've come to expect of him), but surprisingly it actually helps his character.  Carrie-Anne Moss as Trinity is wonderful: alluring and deadly, a leather clad black widow.  Fishburne's softspoken, almost monastic Mephisto is riveting.  And, finally, there is Joe Pantoliano's Cypher, as devious and slimy as we've come to expect him (Bound, Risky Business,etc).The nightmarish real earth landscape was truly hellish.  The setting and atmosphere will obviously be compared with T2, Blade Runner, and Dark City, not to mention shades of Demolition Man, and Brazil.  Thankfully TM does  an excellent job of this and will not be seen as merely a copycat.  I was also thankful of the fact that TM does not follow the simple linear plot line common in most Hollywood films these days and makes you pay attention and, god forbid, think.  Setting and plot aside, the question on many people's mind, is does the action live up to the hype.   Yes.The action sequences were simply breathtaking and beautifully choreographed, worthy of John Woo .  On these merits alone I would strongly recommend the movie.  The fact that the actors did all their own stunts and spent several months in intensive martial arts training only gives it that much more oomph.   Combine this with the effective utilization of the new freeze photography (popping up in everything from the Gap commercials to Wing Commander),  and you have some of the best scenes ever filmed.This movie will be a welcome addition to my film collection when it hits the video stores next year (hopefully I'll have my DVD player by then so I can enjoy it even more).",The Matrix

And while hordes of gullible fans talked about how great Lucas' latest space opera was, many more had discovered what they feared the most: that Matrix was everything ""Phantom"" should have been, and then more.The film has so many high points is difficult to start. The visual effects are simply stunning; there is no eye candy, ala Star Wars I; every single one is used as a way to get you deeper into the movie. The ""Bullet time"" technique is used throughout the picture, and it makes it seem as slick as the best piece of japanimation out there. The storyline is perfectly written: it manages to convince you that somehow it could all be possible. Neo/Thomas Anderson (Keanu Reeves) tells the whole story with his facial expressions of disbelief on the first 3/4 of the film, and then with self assurance. The rest of the cast makes you actually care for their fate (specially Carrie-Ann Moss and Lawrence Fishborne). And before the first half of the movie is over, you will hate the bad guys. Believe me.I, as incredible as it might seem, am not waiting for ""Matrix 2"". The first installment is so good I fear they won't be able to live up to its reputation (again, like Lucas did with ""Phantom Menace"").

I think there is not much to talk about, it's worth even more an addendum inside the fight scenes: Keanu Reeves is fantastic. It's so beautiful to see a fight scene without lots of cuts and blurs, it makes all the difference and makes it as close to the real as possible, and besides the director's merit this is definitely the actor's merit too, and everyone here knows that Reeves does almost all his fight scenes, trying his hardest, and that's not for now (John Wick), The Matrix is ​​here to prove it.My only problem with the movie is the ""Snow White Moment"" in the end, they would have had thousands of better ways of solving that scene and for me it spoiled the impact.In summary, it's a fantastic movie.",The Matrix

303,rparham,"The Matrix, unparalleled",9,27 March 2006,"When it first premiered in the spring of 1999, I believe few individuals could predict the impact that The Matrix would have, not just on cinema, but on pop culture in general. What began as a modestly budgeted action-science fiction film starring an actor with little thespian acclaim quickly became a touchstone for the popular zeitgeist, and arguably cut into the popularity and impact of the soon to be released Star Wars Episode I. Time has not been kind to the franchise that was The Matrix: the two back to back produced sequels, The Matrix Reloaded and The Matrix Revolutions, were met with critical derision and public indifference, especially Revolutions, which did not live up to the box-office success of Reloaded. However, looking back at the original film, it's easy to be reminded of why The Matrix was such a hit in the first place.For those unaware of the basics, The Matrix focuses on Thomas Anderson, aka Neo (Keanu Reeves), a computer hacker who is searching out a fellow hacker, Morpheus (Laurence Fishburne), whom Neo believes will give him answers to several questions he is holding, most specifically the question ""What is The Matrix?"" Neo eventually meets Morpheus through an associate of his, Trinity (Carrie-Ann Moss), and Neo is finally told what he may not have truly been ready to hear: The Matrix is an interactive software program that the entire human population is connected to and through which they appear to live out normal lives. In reality, humans are connected to a giant power plant and are held here by a race of sentient machines that have conquered the world and use humans as a power source. To keep them under control, they are attached to The Matrix, but some humans have managed to break free from the machine's control and are now building a resistance, with the eventual intention of destroying the machines and the Matrix and freeing all humans from bondage. Morpheus believes that one of the keys to accomplishing this goal is Neo, whom he believes is ""The One"", an individual with the power to control and reshape the Matrix at will, and who will lead the humans to victory.To be completely honest, much of the Matrix is not tremendously new. Many elements are lifted from countless science-fiction novels and stories, and the film's writers-directors, The Wachowski Brothers, Larry and Andy, were unabashed in their love of particular types of cinema that they liberally ape here: martial arts and action movies, as well as a hint of Japanese Anime. However, as a package deal, The Matrix works stunningly well. While those who have read science fiction, or are fans of the genres of film that the Wachowski Brothers used as their inspiration for The Matrix, may be able to recognize some aspects of the film, most viewers of mainstream cinema would not have seen most of the components in The Matrix, therefore making it a unique experience. Even for those that can pick out the source elements, The Matrix is an entertaining blend of much of the familiar in fresh packaging. It's difficult to remember now, with all the knockoffs and ""homages"" in the years since, what a new look and feel The Matrix had at the time. The fetishistic use of black leather costumes, the impressive martial-arts sequences, the elaborate visual effects, most specifically the ""bullet-time"" super-slow-motion shots and the film's rather understated religious undertones were not worn out and overused by countless other films picking at The Matrix's bones. Everything here was new to the mass audience, and that alone could account for a large chunk of the film's success.Now, with the hindsight of seeing the two sequels, it's easy to see what a pared-down film The Matrix truly was. While it is obvious that the film has to take time to set up it's characters and situations, it is a very fast paced film, with very little fat on it. The Matrix glides along, never overstaying it's welcome in a particular scene and sequence. Many accused Reloaded of being a overstuffed film, but none of that is in The Matrix.One of the film's greatest strengths is it's character development. Neo, Morpheus and Trinity are not the most fleshed out characters in film history, but at the same time, they are not shallow. Each is developed enough to give us some insight into them, becoming individuals that we come to be invested in. Neo especially, being the focus of the film, is given the most screen time, and he acts as a surrogate for the audience, taking us slowly into the world of the film, allowing the new environs and situations to unfold in a natural, unforced way.Visually, The Matrix is stunning. It's production design and visual effects are both noteworthy (the film won the Academy Award for best visual effects for that year), with the ever popular ""bullet-time"" sequences, as mentioned previously, being the standout. The Matrix also benefits from the decision made by the filmmakers to have the main actors train to perform most of the fighting sequences themselves, giving them all the more verisimilitude, as opposed to stunt doubles.Despite the bad taste left in many viewers and fans mouths by the two sequels, The Matrix is still a powerful and memorable piece of film that is as influential and pivotal as the Star Wars franchise, and deserves it's place in history.",The Matrix
304,harrylosborne,"Proper nerd p*rn, slightly withered by time",7,17 February 2021,"The Matrix has established itself as a piece of cultural history: not just for the insanely memeable lines of dialogue, but for some of the most iconic scenes of recent cinema, particularly in establishing the flexibility of CGI.It is true that some of the visuals haven't quite stood the test of time (the robots don't always fit, nor do the world-warping graphics), but the fight scene choreography more than makes up. The vision behind some of the major clashes (complemented by the score) is exemplary, and credit must go to the Wachowskis for having the gall to make this.What deserves appreciation the most, I would argue, is the story. It is stupidly ambitious, but does ask real questions of the human experience (albeit in a slightly heightened sense), whilst still being a fun watch for those wanting an action flick. At points the story falls victim to its own convolutions, but for the most part holds together.The acting is hard to critique: a film centred around robotics requires robotic performances, so they are suited exactly to the roles. The rest of the trilogy might not have ticked everyone's boxes, but the original has achieved immortal status for a reason.

You have to watch it to know and have to watch it again to find the details that make it such an epic movie. Even by today's standards of special effects, it stands out and holds its own.
I have heard they are doing a new matrix movie. I hope if they do that they don't stray away from the movie to much. I hope they don't forget about the generation that grew up with it.. We see alot of new movies that target the young blood and forget those who loved them from the 90s.

This is perhaps the most gripping sci-fi film ever made, with a rich, original plot that will not ever make you turn away from the screen. The acting is good, and while there are no life-changing performances, it is still believable and not wooden. But the main premise of the film lies in its superb effects, which have inspired many spoofs and budding sci-fi fans. The ""bullet time"" sequence, which happens exactly two hours into the film, is easily the most famous, and just shows the level of technical expertise that went into this film, expertise that has still not been equalled to this day. This film can be a little bit odd in parts (the young boy who bends spoons with his mind at the Oracle's place is definitely a bit strange), but which good sci-fi film isn't? The screenplay is also good - many memorable lines and scenes are delivered, and Morpheus always sees it right to hammer home a memorable quote every few minutes. Even the ""blue pill/red pill"" scene beats off competition from epic fight scenes in higher-budgeted sci-fi flicks. Though most films of The Matrix's calibre may not be Oscar winning material, this one sure is, and won four very well deserved Academy Awards that are entirely justifiable. Even though the Wachowski brothers may not be names you hear so often, their achievements shall never be forgotten in this film that is more than a cult classic - it's an all-round classic.First rate effects, one of the brainiest scripts ever transferred to paper, good direction, and many classic moments - the Matrix is the undisputed king of sci-fi movies, and must be seen to be believed!

It's better than Jurassic Park, Star Wars, Jaws, The Truman Show, Blade Runner, Return of the Jedi, Jumanji, etc. (i know these movies don't have really much to do with each other, but this just a list of my favorite films). The only film that is better, to me, than the Matrix, is Raiders of the Lost Ark. I love Morpheus' voice and also the things he says about the world how it will in two centuries, are very interesting AND scary. That's what i liked about this film, it was really frightening. The kung fu scenes are really entertaining and fast, and Keanu's acting is at its best. Trinity is really cool, it's unusual to see a woman shooting all the bad guys. Agent Smith is a really cool villain, he's one of the meanest guys in film history (especially the voice is very creepy). This film actually doesn't have one dull moment in it.

Sometimes i even put it on pause to glare at the special effects shots, like when Neo wakes up in the real world. You should try do that too, only then you can truly observe the visual excellence of these scenes. This movie totally deserved the oscar for visual effects (sorry phantom menace!).

In any case this kind of story isn't a million miles away from Douglas Adams' Hitchhiker's Guide To the Galaxy, a book far more interesting than this rubbish.For the sake of a good story the Wachoowski Brothers (writers & directors) went all gooey for lots of cgi to distract the viewer with the many plotholes and poor character development. The story simply gets in the way of a good sfx. And on and on it goes, each cgi trying to out ""wow"" the previous effect to the point where you wonder whether this is nothing more than an expensive computer game.People went wild when we saw our heroes climb up walls, jump huge rooftops & dodge speeding bullets in slowmo. But so what? I feel we have become so blaise about cgi that only our imagination limits us to what we think is possible. And the cgi in this film no longer had the same kind of ""jaw dropping"" effect as one witnessed in Star Wars, Terminator 2 or even 2001:Space Odyssey.Our superheroes, Keanu Reeves, Laurence Fishbourne & Carrie Annie Moss, looked like bit players compared to the computer bits making up the over indulgent CGIs. Fishbourne tries to come over all cool & hip, but looks fairly average when asked to do anything remotely interesting; Reeves acts just like...well...Reeves, with that usual ""no one's home"" expression & designer jackets. While Moss hops in & out of the movie when it looks as if the going's getting a bit tough for Reeves, resulting in an ending ripped straight from Luc Besson's 5th Element!This film lives off its own hype & marketing, and already looks dated. Once you've viewed the film more than a couple of times and got used to the sfx you then want to look for more depth only to find that its only the sfx that holds the film together.BAD!**/*****",The Matrix

With school-shootings and ""Y2K"" bugs baring down on the masses, it was only appropriate that a sleeper-hit such as this one came along to truly capture and define the end of the century. Whether it was fate or chance, the brothers Wachowski managed to create a film that not only captured the imaginations of its audience as well as played off its fears, but a film that -- ten years later -- holds up and marks a high point in American film-making. Simultaneously matching and surpassing the groundbreaking special effects and outlandish action-sequences of 1991's ""Terminator 2: Judgment Day,"" ""The Matrix"" set a precedent that no modern film has yet to live up to, despite the mixed feelings that stem from its two sequels.Imagine everything you know is not real. A fabrication, as a matter of fact. Your whole life, you've been asleep, dreaming that you're living out your rote, uneventful existence. You constantly search for answers, for the meaning of your own existence, to no avail. That is, until somebody opens your eyes, waking you to a new reality, a new world. A world where you are an unknowing slave to technology (subtle social commentary, eh?) and the world you thought you knew is nothing more than a computer program fed to you while you sleep. Such is the premise of ""The Matrix."" Keanu Reeves plays Thomas Andersen, a computer hacker who lives at his computer and could care less to socialize, let alone get up and go to work each day. He lives in cyberspace under the codename ""Neo,"" not realizing that he himself is being pursued. Soon, he is extracted from the fabricated world  The Matrix  and faces a harsh reality through the assistance of a philosophical leader by the name of ""Morpheus"" (Laurence Fishburne) and a fellow hacker, ""Trinity"" (Carrie-Anne Moss), where he comes to learn his purpose is astronomical, Christ-like, even. He does battle against the agents  led by the sinister Agent Smith (Hugo Weaving) -- who keep The Matrix in check, all in an effort to salvage what remains of the free-thinking human race.Notorious for its mind-bending special effects as much as it is for its philosophical and religious undertones, ""The Matrix"" is a film that, as it nears its tenth anniversary, remains relevant today. With repeated viewings, the film still looks fresh and feels brand new. Despite the fact that the ""Man vs. Machine"" theme present has been done to death in other films, it is tackled by the script in a way that is both unconventional and definitive. Its impact was immediately felt on pop-culture, and still resonates today. It's more than just loud, shoot-em-up fun with stunning visuals. It's also a timeless portrait of where society currently sits and where its unknown future is heading. Social commentary aside, though, it's still incredible entertainment. A well-rounded, well-made film that will stretch the imagination for years and whose impact should hold up as a benchmark for future classics to live up to.",The Matrix

It IS a visually stunning AND entertaining movie. Actors are good at what they do but please...there is NOT one iota of anything original in this movie! Computer programs as humans or humans in the 'mind' or 'midst' of a computer program? Have you watched 1982 TRON ( http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0084827/)? Synopsis from this site ""A hacker is literally abducted into the world of a computer and forced to participate in gladiatorial games where his only chance of escape is with the help of a heroic security program"". Sounds familiar? What about people jumping 50 meters high exchanging kung-fu blows? Well, Hong Kong has been milling that kind of cinematic visuals for decades. I really laugh out loud when I read people going ecstatic over Matrix's philosophy... Proper philosophers coined the 'brain in a vat' dilemma (http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/brain-vat/) ages ago (the 1980s?), asking whether we can say anything is real and how can we be sure of anything. Troubled teenagers will probably find the movie philosophical appeal irresistible...religious fundamentalists may all find their piece of cake (is Cypher like encryption or Lou...cifer? Trinity? Weird none's called Holy Ghost in there). It's a SFX action extravaganza, not gospel. What about Men in Black? There are people who think they are henchmen of an underground government run by aliens from outer space... It's entertaining and visually stunning and are not Carrie Ann Moss and McClory hot? But just that... Movies about prophecies sell a dime a dozen...oh, and waking up the dead with a kiss: THAT is original and not copied from some fairy tale.

I understand the world created represents the ones and zeroes that surround the computer world and that the computer world has become a competitor with the real world. I appreciate the Wachowski brothers' attempt to create a new ground-breaking approach to action sequences and story-telling, no matter how snobbish it looks. A pomposity that says, they expect the audience to believe what is going on in the film and to embrace it, but when it also gushes from the screen with cerebral gibberish and drawn out sequences, it slows the pace down and makes it difficult to enjoy fully.Again, the action sequences, with the slow-motion wire techniques, are top notch. The acting works, even Keanu, but unfortunately the dialogue reminds me of Stan Lee in the 60s. What saves this film, along with the action and Carrie-Anne Moss' leather pants, is the approach to political extremes and what people would do if we had to adopt a neo-world/pseudo-world philosophy and what the dangers that could occur when technology and evil are mixed.8.1 (B MyGrade) = 8 IMDBP",The Matrix

322,robsta23,Just Awesome,9,29 April 2015,"The Matrix is the type of gem that only comes around once a decade. It is a great film that combines top-notch philosophy (Plato's allegory of the cave) with the coolest action scenes in a long time. It was awesome to learn that some of the coolest effects in the film were achieved by having hundreds of cameras set up to take pictures simultaneously to get the same image from different angles, simulating camera movement when edited together.On surface level, this film is simply really cool to watch. The shootout before Neo and Trinity enter the elevator is one of the most iconic action scenes in film history. We get all the fun of a lot of bullet fire, one-handed cartwheels, walking up a person's body just to kick them in the face, and a lot more fun choreography to go along with all of this.I love that this film makes ideas from Plato interesting and relevant via sci-fi motifs. There is also the notion of ""the one"" in the film. I have to admit, this motif gets somewhat annoying at times; everyone seems to say ""he is the one"" at one point or another in this film. People see it as a Christ story, but just because somebody is resurrected doesn't make them Jesus. I mean does he die for sins? There is also no clear connection to a god in this story, which goes against the ideas Christianity. I think Plato is more relevant here.What is on and off for me is my opinion on Keanu Reeves' performance. I used to think his performance in this film is terrible, but I've realized his playing dumb/ignorant is spot-on. The scene where he questions if he should save Morpheus seems to lack some emotion, but I now realize this is one of the few instances of ""poor"" acting coming from Reeves in the film.This film would be perfect with a slightly better lead than Keanu Reeves, but this movie is still f***ing awesome.",The Matrix
323,gogoschka-1,A watershed moment in film-making – and what a kick-ass masterpiece,10,26 July 2014,"** May contain spoilers **There aren't many movies I watched in the theatre twice  let alone on the same day - but immediately after the credits had rolled (and still pumped up by 'Rage against the Machine'), I queued up for the next screening of 'The Matrix'. I was so blown away by that film, I feared - and probably rightly so - that I hadn't caught every detail of what I'd just seen. I later found out that many of my friends had had a similar reaction to the film, and I know virtually no one who liked the film and didn't watch it at least twice. It's simply one of those rare films that are so rich you just have to watch them several times.In structure, style and concept, 'The Matrix' was ground-breaking; it marked the first time the visual style of Manga comic books and Anime such as 'Akira' or 'Ghost in the Shell' had been successfully translated to a live-action film. Apart from 'Blade Runner', which has a totally different mood and pace (but is also a masterpiece and visionary film-making), there simply hadn't been anything even remotely like it. The jaw-dropping action sequences have such a raw, gripping energy they feel like an adrenalin overdose, but unlike most action films, they never overshadow the story; on the contrary - they enhance it and make complete sense within that universe.As for the story itself, I think this is one of the most original, fascinating Sci-Fi tales you'll likely ever see on screen. Clearly inspired by Japanese Anime and Manga yet also by authors like Isaac Asimov or Philip K. Dick, the story about humanity's war against its own creation, machines of an artificial intelligence that have evolved to the point where they have become the dominant 'species' and vastly superior to their creators, could take place in the same world as 'Blade Runner' or 'The Terminator' - albeit several hundred years later. But there is also a mythical, even religious undercurrent to the story; the themes of a prophecy, a ""liberator"" or even a ""messiah"" make 'The Matrix' transcend the Science-Fiction genre and become even more unique.'The Matrix' was a watershed moment in filmmaking  in every respect  and even though two inferior sequels have left a bit of a stain on the film, they can't distract from what an uncompromising and hugely influential masterpiece this is. Sci-Fi movies that were released after 'The Matrix' have tried very hard to achieve a similar look and tone, but the original still owns them all. 10 stars out of 10.Favorite films: http://www.IMDb.com/list/mkjOKvqlSBs/Lesser-known Masterpieces: http://www.imdb.com/list/ls070242495/Favorite TV-Shows reviewed: http://www.imdb.com/list/ls075552387/",The Matrix
324,TheOny13,Am I the only one who thinks this movie is overrated?(Major Spoilers),5,16 March 2017,"I see that on this site only the positive reviews for this film are promoted to be on the first pages, which is at least one-sided if not preferential. This makes me think I won't even get read by other users yet alone supported by them(since they all find this movie awesome)... but whatever let me tell you what I think about this movie:The Story: Is probably the most important part of this movie and simultaneously the one which this movie gets so awfully wrong. 1. The concept of machines imprisoning humans was exploited so many times(Stargate for example had a similar concept driven episode) by so many TV Shows and movies, so I expected this movie to go deep in why would machines imprison humans and have authenticity in its core. I got 0 of that, in fact what did I got? Some stupid explanation saying the machines imprisoned humans because humans loose energy as heat through their skin. OK, it might seem plausible at first sight, but if you know a little about human or about chemistry you will find this concept ridiculous and impossible. Humans lose through heat about 30% of the energy they consume. So that would mean the machines would have to supply the humans with so much energy and then consume the 30% they lose through heat(basically 100% energy used to keep humans alive to 30% energy remained for machines. That means the machines would lose about 70% of the energy they have or invest into sustaining humans alive) why? Because the script says so. If they have that much energy to sustain humans and their necessities for so long why not kill the humans and stick to maybe consume lightning energy which this movie shows to be very satisfying. 2. The explanations Morpheus gives Neo are so thin, maybe thinner than a balloon inflated to its maximum. The Matrix was weaker at the beginning so that they escaped? Why hasn't anyone else escaped? How was the Matrix weaker? Does this movie or the next one in the trilogy explain this? No... But yeah because there's a bad-ass character saying these we all should believe this and then say that this movie is a benchmark for all sci-fi to come? I cannot believe that I'm living on this planet where people are fooled so easily by ridiculous explanations that are so thin and they think that they are smart by watching these kind of movies. Oh, but there's more... when other directors come up with a movie thought over 15 years(Inception) and so authentic and realistically executed that starts from correct premises and then exaggerates like any other movie, people make reviews like: ""Overrated because it makes people ""feel"" smart..."". It's incredible that a director that has been making movies since 7 years old and thinks so much about its movies is repaid with bad reviews from people who clearly didn't understood the movie and don't care about dreams, while this movie gets so much praise for having an incorrect premise that just becomes worse as the movie progresses. 3. There's no plot twist that can make you say: Yes this movie was thought from start to finish. This movie is just a bunch of action scenes mixed with some poorly explained concepts that have an incorrect scientifically premise and has just enough of all of them to fool the average audiences.The Action: The only part in which this movie succeeded was the action which indeed revolutionized the action flicks back then. Along with the CGI this makes the movie watchable at best(for me at least). But here there are some unexplained things like why if you kiss a person connected to the matrix that person revives and more... becomes even more powerful. It's like a children's movie where the handsome prince kisses the princes and she wakes up and then they live happily ever after. I expected much more from a movie praised by so many people, but I got 0 explanation for how Neo revives from Trinity's kiss. The Characters: Bland and boring... and so cold especially Morpheus, who was made like this maybe to make him appear more bad-ass. Neo's character is childish for a movie of this magnitude. The chemistry between him and Trinty is not convincing for me. I mean, for the duration of the whole movie she's just kicking ass like Neo, and then they suddenly are lovers... but their relationship has no development because the script is so poor in substance and creates no circumstance in which these characters might interact with each other beside kicking ass and saying one-liners.The Soundtrack:(gotta hurry, word limit) The most bland soundtrack I've heard in my life. For how this movie is promoted as being one of the best ever... I expected a soundtrack that could match this reputation. Actually if you search Don Davis, this composer is known only for Matrix and maybe Jurassic Park III but aside from that, he was never nominated for golden globe, bafta or Oscar(not to say that those matter but other great composers were nominated at least 10 times to Oscars or baftas). There was not a single iconic track in this movie and the score as whole is just forgettable and underwhelmed.Hope I could include everything I wanted to say in this review. I probably won't get any support for this review, because every person on this planet adores this movie and IMDb supports only good reviews for this movie. And as to why I rate this movie with 5 is because of the CGI and action scenes, because the rest: premise, story, substance or authenticity of the script are either missing or are so thin as a inflated balloon(oh, wait the rating of this movie is as inflated as a inflated balloon... inflated by average people who like only mindless or pseudo-intelligent action).",The Matrix
325,kingofdanerds,"Near perfect, so not the masterpiece that alot make it out to be",9,20 July 2021,"No action movie has been celebrated than The Matrix. The Matrix was released in 1999 and was a HUGE deal upon release. The critical reception for this film was huge and even today is often considered to be one of the best sci-fi action films of all time. Not only was the film a critical success, the film was also a financial success. So much so that sequels were made. The film was directed by the Wachowski's (Bound) and stars Keanu Reeves (Speed) and Laurence Fishburne (The Matrix sequels).Neo (Keanu Reeves) is a hacker. Yet, the world he is living in is not what it seems. That's because the world he lives in is the Matrix which is a big computer program and the real world is Earth but destroyed and run by robots and humans are grown. Upon realizing this, Morpheus (Laurence Fishburne) says that Neo is the one to save humanity.The Matrix, let's just say, is overrated. It is still a good film but not really the masterpiece that people tout it as. Now while the overall premise of the mesiah or the one and the premise of a fake reality has been done to death, The Matrix tells this story with a unique presentation. The atmosphere and world building are truly phenomenal. Very stylish. The film has some unique ideas and uses great metaphors and is symbolic and what not. The first half of the film is mostly talking. Which, in here, is not so bad. I am genuinely interested but at times it gets too philosophical for my tastes. But yet the ideas are interesting. For me, I was going along the ride with Neo. He had no idea what the Matrix was and I had no idea either. So I was able to learn along with the character. The characters all around, with the exception of Morpheus, are not too interesting but one could make a valid point and say that the characters have computer-like personalities which makes sense here considering that humans are grown by computers in this film. The same can be said with the acting as well. So it all makes sense. The second half of the film is full blown action with shootouts and fighting that is really good even if the effects at times seem really dated. Looking back, there are also some plot holes but it does not bother me too much. Just let the people tell their story!A perfect film would warrant a perfect score. The Matrix is a good film but not perfect.",The Matrix
326,JaydoDre,Cool looking but highly overrated film,7,23 January 2015,"This movie looks cool.I think I could end the review there. I should end the review there if I want it to stay really positive about the film. That is what this movie is about: its looks.This is a movie that either invented or perfected bullet time, which is actually two effects in one: the effect of bullets flowing through the air in slow motion leaving trails behind them and the filming of an object that is frozen in place by using several still cameras and digital motion compensation. The green computer code (digital rain) has become a signature Matrix effect as well as the effect of showing a 3D image in Matrix code. The black longcoat outfits, which by the way is a look that I had invented for myself long before this movie was created (maybe that is what bothers me the most about it), have become universally associated with that movie. Just say the ""Matrix outfit"" and people know.The action is jaw dropping and the acrobatic scenes with guns and martial arts are superbly choreographed.This film can have all the Oscars for its visuals but this can never fix the fact that the story is garbage.Now, the way the events are structured is fine and the movie is actually really good at keeping tension. It is quite mysterious and awesome until the premise is revealed. Everything that happens after that moment and everything that happened before it stops making sense. I do not want to spoil anything, but your enjoyment of the film from that moment on is entirely dependent on your ability to let go of thinking. This ability is granted to many people because of how awesome the visuals and audio presentatoin is, but that persentation eventually ends and common sense kicks you in the head...well, at least it should have.How is the acting? I will tell you when I see more of it, because for most of the movie the characters are walking around with no expressions on their faces and lines are spoken calmly. Isn't that convenient. Not only that, but their eyes, the most expressive part of a human face, are covered with sunglasses. Those f$&*%(g sunglasses, man! All these people are wearing sunglasses when there is no sun...like at night...indoors.This film has indeed entered the depth of popular culture. A near infinite amounts of spoof videos and cartoons have been made and many would call that an ultimate compliment, and to some degree it is a complement, at least a complement to the film's visual presentation.But upon closer examination, I have never heard any of the quotes from this film be used with respect like something from the Godfather movies would be. It is fun to make fun of the film's silly writing.The bottom line is that this film was visually innovative and unique, and because that was its whole gimmick right from the start, it deserves praise. However, the acting and the underlying story in this film are terrible. Additionally, various people started attributing some sort of philosophy to this movie that is not there. There have even been books written on the subject. This makes either the movie or the people doing the attributing very pretentious. I would like to believe it is the latter and that Matrix is a show that is meant to be admired for what it is: a flashy cool action scene.",The Matrix
327,coasterdude44,Ah yes. My first existential crisis.,10,5 August 2020,"I have an interesting history and relationship with this film. Never before has a film made me question the nature of reality before. At first glance, The Matrix at the surface might have looked like a really good action movie with some cutting edge special effects with a kinetic and engaging story, and it definitely has that, but on my first viewing of this movie back in 2006 when I was 9 years old and slid this DVD into my small box TV at the end of my bed. I had absolutely no idea what I was in for and what I was about to experience.This movie is actually more disturbing and honestly terrifying than many would let on, especially to a young child when this movie drops some major psychological and philosophical themes in it's first act. The first 40 minutes of The Matrix is frankly terrifying and suspenseful in all the best and right ways.The surreal bugging scene with that crazy bug with the long tendrils swirling around in what looks like a higher frame rate than the rest of the shot around it, followed by the mirror scream and the metallic drowning scream followed by the waking up in the pod of human entrails scene, followed by the highly messed up ""How do you define 'real'"" Where the concept of reality literally goes up in quotation marks and flies away, where the movie sets the tone that 'reality is simply electrical signals interpreted by your brain' is the most we humans can make of our surroundings - almost makes the concept of The Matrix scarily plausible - and also in a way kind of timely of how the Internet has evolved leaps and bounds since 1999 and the plausibility of VR at the moment (I mean have you seen Half-Life Alyx)And of course you have the explanation of the matrix that follows. Truly one of the heaviest exposition scenes in cinema history.And that's about as far as I survived my first viewing of this movie all those years ago. As a kid's first viewing, this movie successfully found it's way inside my head and left my mind shattered literally unable to watch any more. You would think that would be a terrible thing to say about a movie, but not here. The Matrix is an unparalleled and unprecedented movie experience as humanity is at the core of this movie.The first act plays as a setup for such a hopeless notion as the nature of the matrix is revealed, only to have this notion flipped on it's head when the matrix itself starts being a fun place to be in the eyes of Neo and the evolution of his character aswell as the rebels that he meets that teach him of the humanity that underlies every person trapped inside it under the oppression of the inhuman controllers.Once the true nature of the matrix is revealed. You can bend it to your will and then you can do whatever you want. The Matrix is the ultimate story and parable of humanity overcoming and opressive and dystopian scenario, being controlled by machines, and is masterful in it's writing and direction. The casting was very well thought out with Keanu Reeves killing it as Neo, aswell as Laurence Fishburne and Carrie Anne-Moss as great supporting roles, with Hugo Weaving as an extremley strong Sci-Fi villan as the cold, sociopathic AI Villan Agent Smith.With Neo as the embodiment of humanity against Smith which is devoid of such, follows an unforgettable experience of human over machine. A classic and terrifyingly brilliant film which may cause you to have an internal existential crisis, but that's just the power of this film.",The Matrix
328,ozjeppe,Hail to the savior of the industry!,10,14 October 2006,"OK, I probably can't add anything more to everything already noted about this milestone of a movie. So, this is more of a teary-eyed Thank You-speech long overdue! The genre of this adult kind of sci-fi-action has three indisputable kings at its top, in my book: Aliens, Terminator 2 ... and The Matrix. Thank heaven and earth for the people making this kind of movies, just for an audience like me! Without them, the movie world would be a poorer, drier and drearier place to be. That feeling of overwhelming rush and awe that overpowered me in the movie theater in Sydney 1999, still hasn't worn off. Seven years later, I feel safe to say that it saved the industry of inventive movie making at this level, all on its own, with its epic mix of genres: Sci-fi. Action. Martial arts. Urban mythology. Immortal characters and quotes. It's all here, unsurpassed both in mind-bending style and original content, leaving the biggest of cult followings.

The way the movie is build up from the training of Neo(Reeves) to a breathtaking final 30 minutes of non-stop martial arts slomo action and flying bullets is just great.The cast is well picked,Reeves is a great action hero and Fishburne is very cool as Morpheus.I also very much liked Carrie-Anne Moss as Trinity,she looks so beautiful in this movie. There is also a very funny part for Hugo Weaving as the evil Agent Smith,the way Weaving speaks(very slow)doesn't make him look like the bad guy. Like I said,the last 30 minutes of the movie are great,or even better,they are movie-history.Just look at the scene where Neo dodges bullets,or the shoot-out with the cops,or the fight in the subway station,or...Like Neo says when Morpheus makes a giant leap from one building to another:WOW!The movie also introduced the long black coats,which are still worn by a lot of people. Another good part is the soundtrack.The music in the training sequence is very fast and the last scene of the movie is supported by a song from Rage Against the Machine:Wake Up.Overall,the Matrix is a revolutionary film with sublime special effects that is still not equaled. 10/10",The Matrix

Another thing that stunned me was the fact that the movie questions what is ""real"", letting Neo and the viewer think about this aspect of what we call ""life"".

I would even say that it is everything Star Wars, Aliens, Predator, Blade, and a host of other film franchises could have been had they kept the cheesy dialog to an absolute minimum, and hired some relatively competent actors. The best part of the Matrix is Keanu and his sleep-walk style of good bad-method acting. Had the production company selected anyone else this franchise would have been DOA! Even so, there are flaws in this film (and its sequels), some minor inconsistencies, and things that just make no sense at all - even considering the environment. Yet, despite its negatives, this film and the sequels are heads and tails better than nearly all of the cheesy Science Fiction $chlock that Hollyweird has foisted off on us before or since.

340,ryan_kuhn,"""You Have To See It For Yourself...""",8,13 February 2005,"A mind blowing movie experience for 2/3 of the film, then it breaks down into a shoot 'em up action film, but by then, The Matrix had already won me over. A different look at reality in the age of computers, the Wachowski brothers bring about a world where no one knows for sure what is real, what is fantasy, and who can be trusted. Sometime in the future, humans made machines to do most of their work, and at some point, the machines took over the world, using humans as power for their work. What kind of work does a machine need to do, I'm not really sure, and something that should have been examined further. To keep humans in the dark, a computer program was produced to keep the human mind thinking they were alive. What is real and what isn't is difficult to define at times in the Matrix and is the source of the most intellectual genius of the movie. The other achievement of the movie is the special effects. Any movie that can make Keanu Reeves look good has to have something special with it. Anyone who has seen any movie since 1999 knows the 360 degree camera pan around an actor, perfected by The Matrix. Reeves plays Neo, a computer programmer at some nameless company who has an underground cult following for his skill. This leads him to Morpheous (Lawrence Fishburn), a man looking for prophet, and he thinks he found it in Neo. Carrie-Anne Moss plays Trinity, a nod in the direction of Christianity, as she is a follower of the prophecy of Neo who happens to do her best work in catwoman-type leather. A refreshing change of pace in the beginning of the movie, as most of the physical challenges involved the martial arts, not running around with things that go ""boom,"" but we knew that could not last forever, and the final part of the movie has guns, lots of guns. Hugo Weaving plays the unemotional, almost too perfect ""Agent"" who chases Neo down on several occasions during the film, and is the movie's most interesting character. We'll have to wait until the following movies in the Matrix Trilogy to get more in depth when it comes to Agent Smith, and that's too bad. While we are blowing away our minds, I wish The Matrix would have gone all of the way, and make it so we don't trust ANYTHING anymore. Instead, an interesting premise is established, and only most of it is followed through.",The Matrix

345,michael_the_nermal,Star Wars Meets Blade Runner Meets Ted's Bogus Journey (no Bill),9,27 February 2008,"Spoilers Ahead This movie is an absolute classic of cinema. It follows the ""Star Wars"" epic formula, but is much better at developing compelling heroes, villains, and a setting. The conflict of man vs. machine is a common one, but ""The Matrix"" twists it on its head in that it is the humans who are not so much oppressed by their robotic overlords as kept complacent by a ""bread and circuses"" virtual reality program, while the robots use the humans---most of whom are completely unaware of their true reality---as energy sources. In other words, the oppressor is not Skynet and its band of killer enforcers, but a machine that allows humans the illusion of normality, with no real dangers or oppression beyond what we would expect in our own world. The movie then poses this question: if you knew that reality was an illusion, would you still desire freedom, even if it meant disrupting a rather unoppressive status quo? This movie clearly sides in favor of freedom, but the ambiguity between good and evil, or the humans who desire freedom and the robots who control mankind, makes this adventure story very interesting and compelling.The acting and the plot construction is absolutely superb. Keanu Reeves, previously best known for his excellent adventures and bogus journeys with Genghis Khan, Napoleon, and the Grim Reaper is absolutely wonderful as Neo, the Luke Skywalker-esquire hero, who is destined to ""free"" mankind from the robots' control. He gives as understated dramatic performance that gives a great deal of maturity and complexity to his character, something that was rather missing from Mark Hamill's performance as Luke Skywalker back in 1977. Laurance Fishburne, previously best known as Pee-Wee Herman's cowboy friend, is excellent as the stoic, deep-voiced authoritative Obi-Wan Kenobi mentor/shaman/sensei/teacher character of Morpheus. His performance in the ""teacher"" role to the epic hero is just as good, if not better, than Alec Guiness's role as Obi-Wan. He is given more screen time to tell Neo of his destiny than Obi-Wan did in telling Luke about ""The Force"", and is therefore more effective in his role. Hugo Weaving, previously best known as Priscilla, Queen of the Desert, is excellent as the emotionless, cold, and ruthless enforcer program of the robots' simulated reality, Agent Smith. He, like Reeves and Fishburne, gives an understated yet powerful performance. Weaving clearly understood that he was to be part-machine as an anthropomorphic computer program, whose sole purpose was to eradicate any threat to the Matrix's status quo; yet, he also convincingly shows a very human mental struggle within Smith as to his role within the Matrix, which would evolve in the movie's next two sequels. All told, these three actors give excellent performances that lift this science fiction movie into a veritable masterpiece of the genre.Of course, everyone will discuss the special effects. It is certainly money well-spent, and does intertwine smoothly with the message the writers had in mind about humans manipulating the fabric of the Matrix.This movie is definitely a classic of epic film-making. The Waschowski brothers have created a universe as compelling and indelible as Lucas's ""Star Wars"" or James Cameron's ""Terminator"". Watch it.",The Matrix

I usually try to avoid rating it until it is nearing completion - thinking about what could cause it to be rated one notch higher or lower between that point and the end. I just love statistics!Anyway, for much of it, I had decided that the essence of the movie deserved a 7 and the special effects deserved a 9. But, the last half hour of Matrix is so sensational and unbelievable (the effects 10+ and the story and substance at least a strong 8), that I ultimately gave the movie a 9.This is the best special effects movie ever made without question! If ever there was a movie to see at a big screen theater - this is it. Even those (including the person I went with) who don't love the genre (cross between Blade Runner, Aliens, and Terminator) will be mesmerized by the special effects.I truly don't know what's next with special effects, however every few years I believe that I've seen a movie which moved them to a new level.

Just like Lucas tarnished the image of his Star Wars films with the lesser Menace,Clones and Sith, the Wachowski Brothers were quick to make a buck and dragged the good name of The Matrix through similar mud. I caught a segment of the film on television last night and it reminded me what an engaging,well thought out and intelligent film it is. It also reminded me that it did not require a sequel. The story was told and wrapped up. Neo had realised his abilities and there were no new areas to explore. Of course, people will argue that we don't see Zion and of course,that would be the natural course of a sequel but in terms of character and story, the tale was told. While also being high on concept, The Matrix also delivered in terms of narrative. The film is multi layered.

352,brian_r_wright,Emotional fuel for world liberation,10,2 April 2007,"This controlling central power (let's call it the Beast) is the fundamental ailment we are in sore need of healing from. The movie The Matrix is a metaphor of our own heroic struggle for liberty against the Beast, and provides a hopeful message that vigorously stirs the blood of freedom people.### The time is approximately 200 years from now, planet Earth. Early in the 21st century, humans achieve functional artificial intelligence (AI) which instead of leading to a comfortable human-machine Singularity[1] results in an earth-razing cataclysm. Machines (computers) 1: Humans 0.The machine uber-intelligence (MUI) that takes over is analogous to our ""Beast."" In a licentious twist of any physics I'm familiar with, the MUI needs energy, so it clones, incubates, and grows humans in vast fields of sealed chambers to take advantage of their electrical potential. Humans in name only: their consciousness is channeled via a sophisticated neural network set up by the MUI to resemble Earth of 1999, i.e. the Matrix.[2] (You might ask why bother providing to these Eveready 'droids such a dream world where they seem to grow, live, love, and die as generations before them. You won, why not just turn their minds off entirely? Well, apparently the pod people don't generate the BTUs if they're bored.) Not everyone in the Matrix is comfortable with the system. Thomas Anderson, who goes by the hacker name Neo (Keanu Reeves) is one such discontent. The few remaining real humans, led by Morpheus (Laurence Fishburne), believe Neo is ""the One"" who will ultimately free humanity from the Matrix and defeat the MUI.They locate Neo, convince him to unplug (take the red pill), then spend weeks with him in training. The rebels hack into the Matrix where Neo visits the Oracle (Gloria Foster). Before they can safely exit, Morpheus is captured by agentsagents are the MUI's fearsome sentient programs that enforce the Matrix.In the attempt to rescue Morpheus, Neo goes toe-to-toe with Super Agent Smith (Hugo Weaving) in a scene reminiscent of the final showdown in A Fistful of Dollars. Only the Wachowskis in addition to massive gunplay send up exciting martial arts sequences and special effects that blow you away.In case you're the one person who hasn't seen the movie yet, I won't spoil the ending, except to say it's terrific.To me the movie strikes parallels to our real world and our struggle against the Beast[3]. The Matrix itself is the epitome of our quasi-Orwellian, TV-mind-controlled nation: Consider our Beast's indoctrination systems (compulsory schools and the criminal justice system) and propaganda ministries (mainstream media and academic elites). Too many people enfold themselves into these pods of conformity. Agents are analogous to our central-system soldiers and cops turned against Constitutional liberty.""The Matrix is a system, Neo. That system is our enemy. When you're inside, you look around, what do you see? Businessmen, teachers, lawyers, carpenters, the very minds of the people we are trying to save. But until we do, these people are still a part of that system, and that makes them our enemy.

353,rob-236,"average stuff. People jumping onto a ""cool"" bandwagon",3,11 February 2002,"Once in a while a film comes along that everyone has to like, whether its any good or not doesn't matter. The hype and the fact that it has `cool' elements in it,  like killing at the drop of a hat, dark glasses and long leather coats and of course special effects, make up for that. Examples include Blade Runner, which was truly awful, Heat (zzzzzzzzzzzz),  Pulp Fiction, which was good, but not unbelievably wonderful as everyone rants on about and Men in Black which was utter c**p of the highest order (see my review). The Matrix disappointed me unbelievably. I love the Wachowski's previous film `BOUND' and looked forward to this film on the strength of that, NOT the hype.  I watched it in the summer of its release,  on the same day as `Ten Things I hate about you' and `Cruel Intentions' and I must say that I enjoyed those films far more. I had heard `THE MATRIX' was the best film ever made, a cinematic masterpiece, a wonderful story etc although, I always go into every film with an open mind and make my own mind up (even Burn Hollywood Burn  which yes, was awful anyway!!). The Matrix bored me silly for the first hour or so, it didn't make the slightest bit of sense and reminded me of the pain of sitting through `Bladerunner' years before. What I will say is that it picked up in the second half, mainly due special effects  which I always say, should be only an element of a film, NOT the be all and end all. I do honestly believe that many (not all) people only like this film because its fashionable to do so, although will never admit it. If you want good sci fi action thriller, that was made at a shaving of the cost, watch the superior `PITCH BLACK'. Please be individual and make up your own mind and not follow the crowd.",The Matrix
354,MichaelMRamey,Still Holds Up Today,8,14 April 2018,"This film is arguably one of - if not the - biggest film of the 2000s. Yes, I know it came out in 1999, but because of the sequels, The Matrix has a huge impact on film of the decade. Thanks to the practical effects, this Sci-Fi film still holds up even in today's CGI filled cinema. It is a story of finding you're ultimate potential and featuring some of the action sequences to ever be put on the big screen. I can't believe it took me so long to jump on this bandwagon.",The Matrix
355,budmassey,More fun than summer vacation.,9,5 May 2001,"I really like this movie, but seeing it ranked #40 of all time is laughable. There is, or course, the geek effect, the fact that techie folk who frequent this forum are likely to rate a techie film abnormally high, but there must be hundreds of films, at least, that deserve to be ranked higher than this one.Granted, it is a great story.  Not Star Wars great, and certainly not Lawrence of Arabia or even Who's Afraid of Virginia Wolfe great.  But oh what a concept.  Humans have been subjugated by their machines, a concept James Cameron explored ages ago in the Terminator pictures.  But Matrix has more wow and gee whiz than any of its genre.The fight scenes are spectacular.  Carrie-Anne Moss kicks ass and looks great doing it.  Hugo Weaving may not be the most intimidating man in black, and I still think of him as Mitzi from Priscilla, Queen of the Desert, but I wouldn't get on his bad side.  And I have to admire this movie for not going the brain dead muppet route of so many otherwise great sci-fi films just to milk the aftermarket.Keanu Reeves, who has made a great career out of so very little talent, may have found his best vehicle since Bill and Ted.  His deadpan, detached delivery is perfect, especially in the films climactic battle between Reeves and Weaving.  I have to say that I can't imagine a Matrix without him.My absolute favorite scene is the one with Spoon Boy.  ""There is no spoon."" I still get chills.  I also have to say that I didn't quite buy Joe Pantoliano selling out his comrades because he missed the taste of a good steak.  I think that story line could have used a little work.  Laurence Fishburne is definitely the class of the cast, and I am delighted that he has signed on for both sequels, already in production.All in all, you absolutely must own this movie.  It is fraught with clever allusions, dazzling effects, and more fun than summer vacation.",The Matrix

362,merrywood,Classic metaphysical allegory framed in modern dress,10,6 April 1999,"Andy and Larry Wachowski, who wrote and directed this finely written, darkly rendered film, have access. They have access to superior intelligence, theirs, and surprisingly, to the Hollywood industry, which usually scorns anything approximating intelligent film making. That the plot takes its motive from a tried and true classic Science Fiction concept (a projection into future reality with attending amplification of a current fear) should certainly not be a factor in any critical analysis of this production. With THE MATRIX, the Wachowskis have delivered to us a superior multilevel cornucopia of brain food and enough audiovisual sensory power to satisfy a wide range of audience.The realization of the plot is fast moving and with engrossing detail.  The dialogue is straight, like the scenario, with sparse subtext and filled with thought provoking concepts that are liberally tossed out in rapid fire, almost too fast. The payoff, at least for some of us, of course, is the exercise in mental gymnastics and the interlaced dialogues of mankind's true meaning on Earth.   What is mankind but mind, and can we survive ourselves:?  A good old song worth singing once more, and with dazzling orchestration.The film ends with a positive turn but leaves the intelligent viewer with much to reflect upon.   This is not a bad thing, not bad at all.",The Matrix

Lots of plot complexity with no heart.I plain and simply do not get what all the fuss was about.And it took me multiple tries to watch this film end-to-end without falling asleep in the middle. The whole sequence of Morpheus teaching Neo about the Matrix put me to sleep every time.Horribly overrated.

364,extravaluejotter,"Ignore the sequels, this is The One",7,14 July 2007,"""The Matrix"" is the driving force behind a string of half-arsed sci-fi/fantasy films (including 2 bloated and inferior Matrix sequels) that have appeared (and sunk without trace) in its wake since 1999. This film had a similar cultural impact to the original ""Star Wars"" and its high rating is well deserved. Often imitated but seldom equaled, ""The Matrix"" set so many new standards that it became sci-fi's yardstick for the new millennium. It has that potent blend of action, adventure, philosophy and sex appeal that distinguishes a classic blockbuster movie from all the summer season also-rans. Name me one other big-hitting action movie from 1999. You're struggling, aren't you?Of course you are. ""The Matrix"" was one of the first films to use ""Bullet Time"" camera effects in its gravity-defying slow-motion stunts. The bone-crunching fights and action sequences were choreographed by a Chinese martial arts master. The soundtrack was littered with catchy tunes. The dialogue was peppered with smart one-liners. The female lead spent a lot of time dressed in figure-hugging shiny black PVC costumes. The set design and CGI was awe-inspiring in scale. Did I mention the figure-hugging shiny black PVC?""The Matrix"" is lightning in a bottle. The Wachowski brothers tried to capture it in 2 subsequent attempts and failed. Fortunately the formulaic sequels haven't dimmed the appeal of the original film.",The Matrix

Keanu Reeves and Lawrence Fishbourne make a great team as two righteous individuals who go on a journey into another world, as they travel to the extent of visuals unimaginable.Keanu Reeves stars as a computer hacker named Neo who goes through a weird series of incidents, and wines up in a different dimensional world with a mysterious man named Morpheus, along with a group of other people, as he learns the truth about mankind, and is shown a whole other world beyond the eyes.Entertains you from beginning to end in a very bad ass way. Acting performances aren't the best, along with the slanted story due to the visuals, but doesn't bother you the least bit, if not just for a little bit. Your too concentrated on the stunning visuals, and the terrific editing, which is probably where this movie does best.Although it takes awhile for the action to start, its all worth it when it finally kicks off, with insane action scenes that will get you all pumped up. Clever choreography, with fighting techniques, as well as shooting scenes included.

For the first time since Leon, I got completely caught up in the movie, forgetting that it was just a bunch of actors going through a routine, but a well crafted, clever, original movie.  From the first scene, when I found myself going 'f**k me' I was captivated into the world of the Matrix.  I won't spoil it for anyone by talking about the plot, but only to say, if you haven't seen it..GO.

370,zfiany,50 years at a max the Matrix movie will become our real world!,10,30 March 2009,"I find it strange that most of the people who watched Matrix were only attracted by the visual effects and overlooked the scientific facts on which this movie was based.People enjoyed the flying mostly and hence liked Matrix 1 more than they did with 2 and 3 although the answer was in part 3 that is who will win the war eventually between humans and machines. Some people they make fun of the idea that one day humans will be in direct war with machines but those people have not read yet about the Nano technology. The latter technology offers something like the software which teaches Neo how to fight in little time. Well through Nano, they will be able to plant a brainlike chip which works 10,000 times faster than our brain and they are now trying to optimize the speed limit in a way that doesn't endanger our brain which might be burnt working under such speed.As for the flying part, it is very possible if the science of Psychokinesis is given more consideration and in the near future I reckon they will with the evolution of human body which is going toward less and less movement. Has anyone seen the prototype of the new cars which have no pedals and we use sticks to drive and direct the car in different directions.Well, I guess the movie has tackled all these scientific aspects alongside psychological and philosophical ones in a very brilliant way and I 100% give this move 20 on a scale out of 10!",The Matrix

Like Blade Runner's Ford and ""5th Element's"" Willis, this movie takes you to another world; futuristic and intense.How cool was it to refer to having 'deja-vu' as experiencing a glitch in the Matrix.

I didn't realize there were any.I *do* think there could've been a lot less ""gun"" violence...the White Zombie song playing in the background while Reeves and Moss blow away innocent people could've easily been playing during martial arts scenes or the slow-motion 'dodge-the-bullet' moves.Either way, 'The Matrix' is a 9.5 out of 10.",The Matrix
372,renaldo and clara,to all nerds,10,31 January 2001,"Let me start off by saying that I don't regularly watch animae, though I respect it for what it's worth.Before another 'animae-head' goes into detail on how The Matrix ""stole"" action scenes from movies like Ghost in the Shell or others, let me say this.It is one thing to copy something that has been widely recognized to be part of another film entirely. Like, American Beauty and the motif of roses everywhere. If any other movie copied this (at least in the next 25 years) it would be a total rip-off and should be burned immediately. But, come on! Ghost in the Shell? In a case of animae-imitation, I would say The Wachowski Bros. were paying homage and practically doing GITSa favor by using their ***p, ok? So sue me=)Copying anything from a film is only STUPID if it is clear the producers think they are copying a big-budget money-maker to ensure success. Or if they are trying to create the same atmosphere without original ideas of their own.

373,cosmorados,And I want to be someone important ...like an actor,9,5 June 2008,"There is probably no better line in this film that illustrates the bizarre fallacy of out own daily lives than this.For Neo (Keanu Reeves) his daily life is a series of disjointed and disconnected segments as he works as a software programmer by day and at night works as a computer hacker of sorts. This world is crashed in on by three black suited individuals who want to know more about what Neo is doing and his attempts to make contact with an individual called Morpheus, who, we are told, is as a suspected terrorist. As the movie moves on the world around Neo seems to change by the second as he searches for answers to discover what the matrix is.""Unfortunately, no-one can be told what the matrix is. You have to see it for yourself."" and therein lies the big reveal as the Matrix is nothing like you anticipate or expect. After this all the rules that usually apply to films to action sequences to good and evil and even gravity are bent, twisted and downright broken as the film moves towards it's inevitable, pre-destined within it, conclusion. ""There is no spoon,""The Matrix was a groundbreaking film when it came out and whilst two inferior sequels have dimmed some of the appeal for people, if you do what I do, which is wilfully disregard them the same way that I do with the Highlander sequels, then you still have one of the greatest sci-fi films of all time, a film that leaves with you when you walk out of the pictures and makes you question every aspect of the world which we perceive to be the real world.When I first watched the film I was left totally baffled by Morpheus initial dialogue of what the Matrix was and then left spellbound when I discovered what lay beyond. The learning curve the Neo experiences, we experience with him, we fear when he is not the one, worry when we learn of the fate of Morpheus and cheer as lives out his predicted fate, the good, as well as the bad.The action sequences are breath taking and the lobby sequence is one of the most amazing of all time, yet the great thing about it, is that it means nothing without the rest of the movie wrapped round it.No bad scenes and no bad acting.The only downside, it was done in Doctor Who first and it's not Empire Strikes Back.still, an extremely worthy nine and deserves it's place in the 250.Wachowski's Maesterpiece",The Matrix

379,Jakemcclake,Great Super Climactic Sight and Sound Except...,9,14 July 2009,"Spoilers I believe I have seen the Matrix all the way through, one time, even though I own it. I watched the start of the movie, and Neo taking the red pill many times. However, I've have seen the climax of this movie about 300 times. This climax is very inspirational and almost as powerful as the dramatic climax of the ""Five By Five"" episode of the vampire TV show, ""Angel"" A character spawned from the ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer""). The IMDb user rating for the Matrix (8.9 stars) is identical to the IMDb rating for that ""Five By Five"" episode of Angel. When I want to feel good, I watch that ""Five By Five"" episode of Angel climax coupled with ""The Matrix"" climax about 3 times every week and never get tired of either one.I saw the plot similar to the Matrix in an earlier little known & thought provoking movie starring WWE's ""Roudy Roddy Piper"" called ""They Live"". Therefore, the Matrix plot did not surprise me much or make me think. It seemed like the plot ""set up"" was copied from that other movie. This movie ""sets up"" that in the future, humans go through life serving creatures from outer space that enslaved us and use our energy. The enslavers keep us energetic by giving humans a false vision of the world achieved through a computer program called ""The Matrix"".There are a small handful of humans aware of this. They live in a ship and are led by Morpheus (Laurence Fishburne) and Trinity (Carry Anne Moss). They seek ""The One"". ""The One"" has been for-told to have mental strength to overcome the controlling forces in the Matrix like Agent Smith. The find/contact Neo Anderson (Keuanu Reeves). They show him the truth about the real world, and explain the power needed to overcome the Matrix and train him. They even suspect he is ""The One"". Agent Smith an agent of the Matrix programming is more powerful than any human. Neo's has difficulty accepting this reality and he does not take to Morpheus' training.In real life, Trinity and Morpheus have rescued Neo from the enslavement existence that most humans have and keep him alive on their ship. However, one of his crew Cypher tries to kill Neo in real life and fails to kill him, due to others intervening. Agent Smith the powerful agent of the Matrix program, has always kept the Matrix in tack. No one ever survived a confrontation with Agent Smith.The Enslaving creatures find out about the ship and begin to charge through the ocean toward an attack on that ship. At this moment, Neo is killed by Mr. Smith in the Matrix and in real life Neo's heart stops. Also at that moment, Morpheus is shocked, and says, ""it can't be"" as he watches all hope for the human race die with Neo.As Neo lies dead in the ship, Trinity tell his dead body that she is not afraid. Trinity says she has been told by the Oracle, that she would fall in love with ""The One"". She says she now realizes she loves Neo. Therefore, he is the one. She kisses his dead mouth. Miraculously, he begins breathing again. She says ""Get up."" Neo immediately arises in the Matrix to the shock of Mr. Smith and his friends, but they immediately fire a hail of bullets at Neo.A split second before the numerous gun shots, Neo softly says ""No"".As the bullets fly, Neo's ""No"" makes the bullets slow down, then stop in mid air, and then makes them fall harmlessly to the ground. The music hits a powerful crescendo climax as Morpheus is in awe of this power, and says what everyone watching realizes: ""He Is The One!"" Neo then easily annihilates Mr. Smith and afterward, we see all of the Matrix bend at Neo's will. Neo looks at Mr Smith's co-horts and they run. He comes out of the Matrix & somehow disbands the enslaving metallic creatures who have attacked their ship. Then Neo telephones the enslaving creatures and tells them, that he will show all humans enslaved in the Matrix a new world and they will free themselves.Aside from having seen a similar plot ""Set Up"" in ""They Live"", the only real problem I had with this tremendous movie was that when the climactic music is played and the words ""He is the one"", is heard, we then look at Mr Smith and friends in a shot of green and white computer numbers forming their persons. I know it had to be done for the sake of the story, but it did not fit with the inspirational climactic music and the awesomeness of this scene. This is a minuscule flaw in something very inspirational. When looking to feel good, I usually play the ""Neo Is The One"" chapter of the Matrix to the end of the movie.",The Matrix
380,marc5477,Amazingly good film... though I think it was an accident,9,12 March 2017,"Bottom line is that the Matrix was awesome and still is. The idea was not new, and certainly it had been covered in film in the past, but the ideas of what life was really like outside the Matrix were fresh and the action made the movie thrilling to watch. The chemistry between characters was also excellent and I think that this was one of Laurence Fishburne best performances and certainly Reeves best as well. They fit their roles to the T.That said, I really think that the greatness of the 1st film (of the trilogy) was a sheer accident. A wonderful accident, but an accident none the less. How do I know? Because the sequels straight up stunk and at the time, were considered a huge disappointment, so much so, that sci-fi fans stopped talking about the movies out of sheer frustration with the sequels. If the sequels were not so bad, then the Matrix franchise would easily rival Star Wars today because the first film was that good. It was on the mind of every sci-fi fan for 3 years. We talked about it like it was Star Wars but after the sequel... the buzz was completely gone, and people forgot about the movies. Many kids today have not even heard of this trilogy for that reason.Still, a great movie in its own right. Easily one of my favorites. Just brace yourself for the terrible sequels...",The Matrix

Putting together the thinking line of the new generation, where we are just but pawns in a system we don't understand or belong, Matrix also borrows a lot of the oriental culture with the fights and it's inner travel over the nature of Life.Little by little one will start to see the light, and everything will make sense.

If you like mind-numbing movies, wait for summer action flix to come out.Acting:  It was decent.  I mean, Keanu Reeves sucks as an actor, but Fishburne rocks.  He is one of the hottest actors of current cinema.  Don't miss ""Pulp Fiction.""  The actress is good, but good looking too.  Man was she hot in her clothes.  You can surpass the acting for the rest of the movie though.Action and Effects:Outstanding.  Easily the best effects for a long time. The bullets, and the staging were great.  The choreographed action scenes looked like they were from John Woo. The effects were all over the place. This is one of the movies where the actors don't take the back seat to the effects.  They actually work with them, and it seems to work.  The action sequences were many, and it was great.  Definitely see this movie in the theater because of the effects, and sound, and because it is wide-widescreen.  (It has a 2.33:1 ratio, whereas with formatted movies, they cut off the sides to make it 1.33:1. That is 3/7 or almost half of the screen.)The music is awesome techno; metal; rock and roll.  I will definitely buy the soundtrack.  Stay for credits when Marilyn Manson's ""Rock Is Dead"" is played through movie theater-quality speakers.  Perfection.Do not miss this movie in theaters.  It is one of the best action movies since ""Face-off,"" and one of the best sci-fi flicks ever, esp. since ""Alien.""  I give this movie a nine because it had some hokiness, and cliches, but all movie so anyways.------------9",The Matrix

I don't want to spoil the plot by explaining this further.The movie is more than 20 years old but was way ahead of its time. It was amazing from a special effects perspective and has an excellent plot.

386,Kubris,One of the coolest films ever,9,4 August 2011,"IMDb Top 250: 23The Matrix is an unreasonably awesome movie. The stunts, the effects, the black suits and shades- The Matrix is dripping awesomeness. But unlike many other action and sci-fi movies, The Matrix has brains.The plot of The Matrix is like Terminator for the internet generation. Man created machine, machine rebelled, machine won. Human survivors fight machines in a constantly dark, post-apocalyptic world. But the machines created the matrix, a giant computer program where the farmed humans' minds live their 'lives'. It's complicated, but it all makes sense. The Matrix's plot demands brain and eye attention.The actors are perfectly chosen. Keanu Reeves in a role where he's supposed to be quiet and badass? Perfect! He was made to be Neo. Laurence Fishborne aces the wise leader, and he busts his chops during the interrogation. Hugo Weaving is really the show stealer though: his Agent is so menacing, and when he opens up to Morpheus, it's very tense.This is an action movie, and boy is there action. The martial arts scenes are so incredible, and the insanity allowed because of the setting makes them even better. Running air kicks? Punches that break walls? It's all cool in the matrix. And the gunfights: the iconic lobby shootout, and the even more iconic bullettime gives The Matrix identity in a sea of sci-fi.The action is boosted by the success of the effects. Agent bullet dodging, the explosions, the rippling bullets, your jaw will drop. The ""fluff effect"" in the lobby is so cool too. It made me wonder why this has never been seen in 3D. Also, the CGI machines are terrifying and realistic.You should see The Matrix, benchmark of sci-fi films for the past decade. Matching brawn with brain, you really can't miss this modern classic. 9.4/10",The Matrix

And oh the idea that love can fix everything is the biggest cliché since Star Trek: The Motion Picture. I remember the word ""CreatOr"" Jesus wept!The ""science"" part of Sci-fi in the main primes is really very absurd. Humans ""combined with a form of fusion"" serve as batteries. WHAT! HOW? Machines need to keep us alive in an imaginary world to use our energy. WHAT! Someone who helped create the Matrix died and somehow his reincarnate will be able to decode and destroy it. WHAT! WHY?They chose to make it fantasy movie, is NOT sci-fi, and like any fantasy, you either enjoy it and get on board with the premise or you don't.

The excellent special effects are never over done or pushed into your face. There is (some) real acting. There are lots of bangs - always a good thing :) - but the gunfights, explosions and chases have a unique nature.The story unfolds over the first half hour after which you find out what the matrix is. Pleasantly the trailer does not give away the plot - a pet hate of mine. The powerful 'Agents' make great villains and the confrontations with them are ramped up to a suitably explosive conclusion.Go see this film and see if you don't let out a relieved giggle after ""the lobby scene"" which will go down in movie history as a benchmark for action films.

It is really a good movie across the century. Keanu Reeves's face stayed in a classic movie, and stayed in the hearts of many people. The machine world and the human world, the two worlds are connected and fighting each other. And the final sacrifice of Neo is in exchange for temporary coexistence. This shocked me. What shocked me the most was that human beings had failed so many times, and it was very shocking my old idea that I thought human beings are the most advanced and intelligent cognition at that time.",The Matrix

Most of the action bits were ok, but between them we got lots of idiotic dialogue that was suppose to be clever. The movie should have been more like T2, with much more action, because the drama and subplots were just sad. And I also must say that the action scenes didn't brake any new ground.

It was also good but with a bit confusing concept like it is showed as a computer programming film and then they shows up a prophet who made a prediction about ""the one"" and all what is this a computer program or a magic movie???They must have shown the movie as a technology and program as it is mainly based on it what is the need of entering this prediction and all....But despite of this I liked this movie.",The Matrix

The Matrix was tailor made for-and-by a videogame, internet, cellular, cool gadget generation which I'm proud to be part of.After seeing the latest installment of the Star Wars saga I decided that I've out grown it.

I will say that Matrix: Reloaded is a far more stunning and brilliant film than this could ever hope to be. I feel sorry for anyone who would call this the best movie ever or say that it's stupid CGI effects are the best in the world because you know what, CGI is not the best use for special effects. I don't see how anyone could think so. When you see it, it never blends in and is always annoyingly showing and out of place. If you look at older films you can see that love was put into prosthetic pieces and mate paintings which will always generate more awe than CGI can muster. To date there has only been one movie to properly use CGI and it was Jurrassic Park and the only reason that worked was because it was one of the first times it had ever been scene, especially in the detail that that film showed. So get over your selves Matrix geeks this sucks and should be avoided.",The Matrix
403,jonnyfendi,Smart Movie With Crazy Action!,9,17 April 2010,"""The Matrix"" is the best action movie has ever made on my list. When ""The Matrix"" was released on its time, thiz movie contributes many breakthrough methods for cinema world. The movie is directed by Larry and Andy Wachowski who was under radar all these times. They are only known as small budget film Directors in ""Bound"" (1996). Later, ""The Matrix"" has two more back-to-back sequels which are ""Matrix Reloaded"" and ""Matrix Revolution"" in 2003. You can almost classify the stars in thiz movie as B-Class Actors, if it's not because of Keanu Reeves, but still the outcome is beyond the expectations. Each of the characters like Neo (Keanu Reeves), Morpheus (Laurence Fishburne), Trinity (Carrie-Anne Moss) , even the villain Agent Smith (Hugo Weaving) have already become a legendary icon in the industry. One of the strengths of thiz movie is the phenomenal action scenes. The fight scenes are something new and different, which is later followed by other movies. Behind that extraordinary fight scenes are experienced Martial Arts Choreographer Yuen Woo Ping. Woo Ping is the man behind ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"" (2000), ""Kill Bill"" (2003),""The Forbidden Kingdom"" (2008) and even Jackie Chan's Kung Fu classic like ""Snake in the Eagle's Shadow"" (1978). His experiences in a lot of Asian movies made him effective. The movie definitely exceeds our imagination. As a matter of fact, many people do not understand entirely the story of ""The Matrix"", there are still many blank spots to be answered. Eventually, the movie is filled with countless great philosophies inside. It seems like Wachowski Brothers have discovered how to make a brilliant concept for the story by fetching the philosophies from some religions. The essence is not that simple as it looks, actually we will always have something new every time we watch it over and over again. ""The Matrix"" is a smart movie and will always be one of my favorite movies of all-time! Visit My Blog on JONNY'S MOVEE : http://jonnyfendi.blogspot.com",The Matrix
404,Blade_Le_Flambeur,An interesting blend of science fiction and action,8,19 May 2003,"When The Matrix was released, the Wachowski Brothers and Joel Silver had no idea that it would catch flame and become one of the most popular movies of the generation. Fusing surreal and mind- bending action sequences with deep biblical refrences, The Matrix isn't single- minded or requires a real mood to watch. The acting, is solid, most noteably by Lawrence Fishburne and Hugo Weaving but the rest of the cast utters their lines without much care. The script tries it's best to pick off on the details of the real world versus the Matrix and suceeds somewhat, but when the characters talk as if they are very smart and sophisticated it doesn't really click in. The direction provided by the Wachowski brothers is intense and sharp, trying it's best to penetrate through the usual cliched science fiction movie and create something more. They immensley suceed and pull everything together well. However, the characters felt a bit shallow and under- written but the effects seem to make up for it. The action fits in with the rest of the story well, causing a natural balance between the two which was severed in the newly released sequel; The Matrix Reloaded. Of course, the effects are amazing and started a whole new wave of slow- motion effects. The computers are very well blended into the rest of the movie, so they don't stick out as being the ultimate focus, which they aren't. Overall, The Matrix is a good movie, it has it's fair share of flaws but it stands out as being something original and innovative. 8.5/10",The Matrix
405,basilisksamuk,Film assumes you are an idiot but excellent action,7,24 February 2013,"One minute I was sitting in front of my PC flying a dragon across a mist strewn landscape, the next minute I found myself sitting in the UCI Cinema. Whoa! (I thought). What's happening dude? It seems I was watching a film called ""The Matrix"" starring Keanu Reeves, Laurence Fishburne and the very toothsome Carrie-Anne Moss. Apparently human experience is just a Virtual Reality created by weird AI beings to lull us into compliance and enable them to harvest us for our bio-energetic essence. I thought everyone knew that by now? Well, apparently not according to this film.In fact there are many, many things that this film believes the audience does not know. For a start it believes we do not know that AI machines will take over the world because we are so stupid. It believes that we know nothing about the history of Western philosophy and even less about Eastern philosophy. It is not aware of the fact that most of us have spent hundreds, perhaps thousands, of hours in our lives discussing the nature of reality both sober and (more frequently) drunk and that we are intimately familiar with all the arguments involved. The film does not know that we can recognise a cliché-ridden script when we hear one. (Sample: ""My way or the highway."" Someone is pulling our virtual legs here surely?)This film does not know how restless a modern audience can get waiting for the action to start nor has it ever heard of the Lizard's First Law of the Cinema i.e. First make your film then cut at least thirty minutes out of it because it is just annoying dreck that has been put in to pad out the film because all film directors are too chicken to make films that run 90 minutes these days, pal! Suddenly I hear Keanu's voice in my mind – ""I know Kung Fu!"" I find myself in a sparse Japanese Hall. Keanu makes several hypnotic gestures culminating in a flick of the wrist beckoning me to fight him if I dare. I realise that he is imitating Bruce Lee's postures and damn me he nearly succeeds. I step swiftly aside and Laurence Fishburne steps in to take my place. Even though my Real Life mind knows Keanu and Larry don't know anything about Kung Fu, my VR mind believes they are old hands at it. As a long time fan of HK Action films I find this sequence absolutely exhilarating. What Keanu and Larry lack in terms of authenticity is easily hidden by the choreography, editing and special effects.Then, in the blink of an eye, I'm cowering behind a pillar as a dozen men and one woman with an armoury of guns blast hell out of the marble-clad walls, floors and ceilings of a huge office lobby. Remarkably a thousand wall tiles die for every person killed but in due course and in suitable John Woo style, the good guys win only to go on to the next action-packed scene.Taking the action scenes and the effects alone this is one of the best films I have seen for some time. When they really let rip with the guns, bullets, machines, kung-fu and upside-down, sideways and backwards balletics I felt a real adrenaline rush of joy of the kind denied to all those po-faced critics in the broadsheets who have to seek meaning and purpose and socially responsible messages in modern films.But then suddenly I was back in plotland with all the lack of logicality you'd expect from one of the worse technobabble episodes of the least good Star Trek franchise show scrapped from the bottom of the barrel when they are running out of money and ideas at the end of a long run. Bought back down to reality with a bang.Forget the plot. Go for the action and the effects. And one more thing – Existenz has this film beat hands down. The two films have very similar questions to ask about the nature of reality. Existenz treats you as though you are an intelligent human being and never ever lets you guess which reality is real. The Matrix assumes you are just a dumb puppy that only wants to be amused for the moment.",The Matrix

I figure that with just a few more viewings and I should, most definitely, be there, sure enough.It's so true that The Matrix' story is so riddled full of holes, and rife with inconsistencies, that it makes a piece of Swiss Cheese look like a solid brick of Cheddar.It doesn't help matters much (when I'm trying to enjoy this film) that I detest Keanu Reeves as much as I do.

So what. Yet another example of Special-Effects-In-Search-Of-A-Movie. The story holds together poorly. The premise was initially pretty interesting, but the movie seemed utterly incapable of establishing rules for how its world works and sticking to them.Finally, the movie hit a pet peeve of mine, which was, to me, its ultimate, fatal flaw. I'm very big on the ""science"" part of ""science fiction"". So you lose me instantaneously when you start introducing mystic mumbo-jumbo into a science fiction story. For me, this film jumped the shark when we get to that wise woman character. (nevermind that the mystic nonsense is somewhat demystified in the sequel films; this review is about *this* film).

What made this film also unique in this era was not only the look and feel, but there was actually an INTERESTING CONCEPT behind it!  Wow!  A 90's film that wasn't brain dead! 
Most action films are so stupid they are pathetic.  While this film was not literary genius, it was a good plot and a great concept.  Unheard of in an ACTION film.  The concept also was such that it allowed for the suspension of logic in the action.  Instead of stupidly ignoring science and physics, this film said ""none of this is real""!  What better venue in which to create a surreal world?While the cocept was almost brilliant and the plot was reasonably well developed, I wish the writers had gone just a little farther with the intelligent potential this concept offered.  It was still a little ""dumbed down""; just not as much as most movies today.  If this film had added a little more time and expanded on the concepts, plus added a higher education level to the dialogue, it could have been one of the greats of all time.Still, this movie remains a rare breath of fresh air in a world of otherwise hackneyed plots and trite dialogue.",The Matrix
417,themarina1,Excellent doesn't come close to describing this,10,3 November 2003,"I LOVE this movie. I remember sitting in a theater many years ago (it seems longer than 4) and watching this for the first time. There was nothing but awe coming from the handful of people watching this with me (compared to the 350 that watched Reloaded with me). Now, over 20 viewings later, I love this all the more. Great story, excellent action, groundbreaking effects, mind and eye candy. Who can forget the philosophy class required to understand some of the intricacies of this movie? Did I mention Keanu and lots of black leather and plastic? (*I'm rolling my tongue back into my mouth now*) 10/10 did I say EXCELLENT?",The Matrix
418,BB-15,A Mediocre Sci-Fi Rehash,9,25 September 1999,"I can understand how the Matrix was so successful. With lots of gun shots and explosions per minute, good special effects, stylish actors and a few solid sci-fi ideas what more could you ask for?Let's begin with some original plot ideas. My problem I guess is that I have seen a lot of sci-fi movies and TV shows. So, basic plot retreads do not excite me. The beginning of The Matrix starts out like Scanners (1981) introducing people who have incredible powers. Then it shifts to the virtual reality, world is illusion, phase (done at least 50 times on the various Star Trek series and Virtuosity, 1995; Strange Days, 1995, etc.). Then comes the machines take over humanity surprise (Star Trek First Contact-the Borg and Terminator 2). The rebels in the Matrix are looking for a Messianic leader (check out the original Terminator). How about showing some original style? I recommend Dark City (1998) which accomplishes this very well. The Matrix is a blend of Blade (1998) and Terminator 2. We have acrobatic actors firing machine guns in slow motion, big deal. Does the plot make sense? Sometimes, but it is very inconsistent. The idea that the machine/bad guys would fight with guns in the virtual reality world is absurd. This is a computer controlled reality after all of the 22nd century. Why limit yourself to clunky guns? How about some decent dialogue? The love interest in this film is a joke. Trinity's (Carrie-Anne Moss) lines at the end of the film are terrible. You want an excellent heroine? Try Linda Hamilton in the Terminator films. Between the posing and posturing and the fight scenes what is being said by the crew most of the time is pretty lame. You want to see good scenes of a crew under pressure? Try the first two Alien movies.What is there to like about The Matrix? The editing, sound, camera work, stunts and computer graphics are good. Lawrence Fishburne turns in a fine performance as usual. Also, all of the action and special effects are able to cover for Keanu Reeves who turns in a flat performance as usual. Briefly, in the middle of the film when the pace slowed in a scene with the ""oracle"" the characters and plot became a bit more interesting. But then it was lock and load time.What really bothers me about The Matrix is that this mediocre retread is rated higher by imdb members than these great films; Blade Runner (1982), Alien (1979), Aliens (1986) and Terminator 2 which is outrageous. The Matrix does not belong in the top 200 movies. This will take care of itself in a few years because this oracle predicts that by 2010 hardly anybody will care about this film.",The Matrix
419,Sinnerman,So much more is expected from Reloaded and Revolution...,10,2 May 2003,"As much as I will be part of the rabid throngs of people lining up to catch a spectacle as huge as Reloaded and Revolution...allow me to counter a common misconception.The Matrix just happened.With an uncanny midas touch, The Warchowski bros launched this then unknown film at the the right place, in the right time. With an execution commercial enough to bring in the box office moola and a philosophical subtext accessible enough for the general public to latch on to, the rest, as they say...is history.The philosophical under pinnings though, (of blue pills, red pills, the subreality of consciousness and all that mambo jambo etc), so successfully popularised by The Matrix, was infact neither orginated by said film nor as fully realised than in other more accomplished works.IMHO, the best execution on the concept of reality and perception was already explored in much more unbelievably visual opus, one year earlier, the grossly overlooked and criminally under-rated ""Dark City"" (One of My Top 10 All time Favourite Films)Dark City was impactful both cinematically and ideologically. Most importantly, it rewarded my wildly abandoned reach for human imagination and thirst for ideas, by fulfilling as much promise a motion picture can ever hope to give.On top of that, my background as a ""trekkie"" scifi nerd meant I instinctively respond to films which challenge me both intellectually and spiritually. Dark City was thus a near religious, life cleansing experience for me.And any which way I look at it, this film soars to heights unseen since 2001: A Space Odyssey...But due to its messed up marketing(positioning the film more like a horror film for the teenage crowd), the film did not find its intended audience and flopped unceremoniously. Of course it found its audience but by then its was too late...That said, the thrist for something better than our run of the mill pop corn fare is still there, waiting to be quenched.And The Matrix filled that void.Of course, much to The Matrix's advantage, it was flavoured with a commercial zest which captured the hearts and minds of the masses(myself included) like few films can. Such divine formula for commercial success is way too hard to calculate. Thus credit all round for the clairvoyant Warchowski Bros.But now that the Matrix mythology and its paraphernalia franchising juggernaut has reached Star Wars proportion, the brothers face an uphill task, to fulfil the massive, pent-up promise that the Matrix may be on to something.....anything.Contrary to my allegiance to the much maligned ""Dark City"", I for one hope will like to see them succeed. If not for my pathetic pretence of objectivity(not!!), at least for the betterment of Hollywood cinema as a whole.Such seminal works like Contact, Minority Report and of course, LOTR has managed to sneak out of Hollywood's assembly plant. May ""The Matrix Trilogy"" too be part of this cinematic revolution.As such, to the millions of Matrix fans out there, do not bite me. My comments are reserved for the sole Matrix movie in 1999 alone. That is coupled with my sky high expectation that its capable of so much more. My eventual take on the worthiness of the entire trilogy, of course, will be decided after completing both Reloaded, and Revolution. I thus hope for the best.",The Matrix

421,Ace-38,Exceptional Sci-Fi fare,8,18 November 1999,"""The Matrix"" is a stunning achievement in both the science fiction genre as well as visual effects.  The movie, visually, is simply without flaw.  The ""bullet time"" photography, backgrounds, lighting, everything point to a great time of care and effort.  Character wise, the movie fares just about as well, although I found Lawrence Fishburn's Mephesto to be a bit overly dry.  Keanu Reeves returns from exile to star as Neo, a programmer by day and hacker at night.  He is suddenly drawn into a rebellion against the matrix, or what we know as the world.  Little does he know that he is the one of prophecy, the one who will set mankind free.Carrie-Anne Moss is wonderful in her role, its nice to see a strong female lead who is both sexy and strong at the same time.  Her character of Trinity is one of the strongest female role models currently on film.Lawrence Fishburn plays Mephesto, the head of the resistance movement and the one who finds Neo and brings him into the movement.  His acting is good, but his presence is a bit dry.  He acts a bit overly serious, like he is truly a messiah.  He doesnt detract from the movie at all, but I felt he tended to overplay the role a bit.Supporting cast: an A....all strong characters and central to the storyline. Tank in particular, as he was the controller of travel between the ""real world"" and the matrix.You might notice I havent talked much about what the matrix is...lets face it, there are some of us out there who havent seen this yet, and its really difficult to explain...I dont feel like ruining the ""surprise"" of the movie for anyone.

426,Mara-Jade-Skywalker-23,I Don't Get the Level of Praise,8,28 June 2019,"Introduction:
The Matrix is not a bad movie, I think it's okay. It's just that I think the extensive amounts of acclaim and praise this film gets is not entirely deserved. The Matrix is regarded highly by many as a classic in great film making, but I don't agree with that.What I Don't Like:
Now, everybody knows the story of the Matrix. But what makes it so ahead of it's time? As many say. It centers around a chosen one, who lived a simple life at first, but was destined for so much more. It's been done before. And don't tell me it was because of the concept of the Matrix. It was done before. Episodes of Star Trek did it, other movies did it. The concept of a dream world, or computer simulation has been done many times. And if you ask me, they did it better.The Matrix doesn't feel like a deep philosophical film, with great action to go along the way. They're all just dumb action films. The acting is bland, the characters are pretty paper thin, and the film just feels dated. Other films to do this concept, such as what I mentioned, and Inception, had more interesting characters. When one of the most famous line of the movie is, ""Whoa"", you have a problem.And also, have you ever noticed the ridiculous amount of plot holes in this film? They are abundant. From the fact the Matrix exists at all. Why would the machines make it so their batteries had a dreamworld? And also smaller stuff, like in the movie, when Neo was called by Morpheus, claiming, ""the phones are tapped"", and to meet him at a certain location. Why didn't agents respond to that? You think they pay attention that detail. But no. And just more that don't make any sense, and are demonstration of the bad screenwriting in this film.What I Do Like:
Even though I have a lot of criticism with this film. I don't hate it. The effects are quite good, and while they don't as well as most people claim, they were revolutionary for the time. And there are some smart details, like in the visual style. The fact that everything in the Matrix, has a greenish tint to it, hinting at the fact that they live in a computer. And in old 80's computers, there was a lot of green. And I love little details like that. I also think the action's very nicely shot and well put together. And the Matrix, while dull, is harmless, so I can't call it terrible.Conclusion:
I think the Matrix is personally a very overrated film. It's not bad, I just never got the real appeal. The Matrix doesn't feel like it's doing anything new, or interesting with it's already kind of tired premise. The Matrix is just a film that I think needs to be reevaluated. However, if it still goes down in history as a masterpiece of film, I can't do anything to change that. So, enjoy it if you like it. I just was never able to enjoy on the level of others.",The Matrix

I enjoyed the last half of the film filled with explosions, guns and intense action galore but I still don't quite understand why it remains so revered. My theory is the impressive technical effects and CGI which at the time were ground-breaking contributes massively to this and while they are still impressive today they're hidden beneath layers of mumbo jumbo and dumb sci-fi nonsense. Matrix is still an okay watch but if you're looking for an older sci-fi film you'd be better off with Star Wars.",The Matrix
429,raphaklopper,What is the Matrix? How you define Matrix?,10,31 May 2013,"When someone hears the word ""Matrix"", it already thinks on a man dodging bullets in slow time, little he knows that ""The Matrix"" is so much deeper than that.""The Matrix"" is the classic action - sci-fi that forever changed the cinematic action scenes, but the film is not only fantastic action scenes, as I said, is much deeper than that.The story begins with Neo (Keanu Reeves), who lives two lives simultaneously; in one he is Thomas Anderson, an important secretary in one of the most important computer companies in the world; in the other he is Neo, a night-hacker that sells all kinds of programs and computer viruses and tries to discover the meaning of the ""Matrix"". One day he meets Trinity (Carrie-Anne Moss) who claims to have all the answers he needs and show Neo the way to get to know the Matrix. After a problem with the police, Neo decides to accept the help of Trinity who introduces him to Morpheus (Laurence Fishburne) a wanted terrorist that shows to be an very polite and smart man and he know something that Neo doesn't. Morpheus offers Neo a chance to know what the Matrix is. Neo accepts the offer and discovers that not only what is the Matrix but also discovers that our whole world is nothing but a lie.The Wachowski brothers (directors-writers) can raise the film several philosophical theories about what is real and how the human mind works, and how we can create and control what is not real. But along with the philosophy, the Wachowskis have created action scenes that changed cinema forever. But all the frenetic action ranging that goes from Kung Fu moves in slow motion and the incredible bullet-time, and of course the classic scene of dodging bullets in slow motion, all of them are part of the whole philosophy that builds the Matrix.Writing and fantastic direction had to be accompanied by a formidable cast that is not what is missing in this movie. Keanu Reeves is superb and becomes the ""chosen one""; the fantastic Laurence Fishburne as the unforgettable Morpheus; and one of the greatest villains that cinema ever had it's Hugo Weaving as the cruel Agent Smith.A classic action and sci-fi that will be forever remembered, thanks to a fantastic writing and breathtaking action scenes make's ""The Matrix"" a true masterpiece.",The Matrix

Human scientists can discover the laws of nature, but can never explain why it is this way, not that way.

Perhaps such a question will never be answered, it depends on the preferences of the Creator. Those who belong to this world cannot surpass the rules of this world. Only those who do not belong to this world and have the same level as the Creator may be unrestricted and arbitrarily modified.

The storyline isn't particularly as interesting as it thinks it is. The dialogue and styling is so in love with itself when it has nothing actually very clever to say or show. And it looked very odd and into its own aesthetic rather than having all of the visuals and other spectral effects constructed for the sake of the story so that the aesthetic mostly wasn't the center of anyone's mind.A lot of the ideas that this movie addresses somehow seems to be a lot of people's first introduction into imagining that our entire reality is an illusion. Which is odd. I remember abstractly thinking along those lines long before ever seeing this movie. And I was a teen when I first saw the matrix movies. And I didn't think the Matrix presentation of the concept was any better than a lot of the imagined ideas I had had in my own head. In the end, until we can demonstrate any matrix-like-reality (Like what Neo gets when he takes the pill) it's all just mental masterbation. And although there is nothing wrong with mental masterbation, I find that it's best if you invent a fun fantasy while you're already in that realm if you're going to bother. I've never felt that the Matrix world was fun and never found it very compelling because it's so divorced from the only reality I really know. I couldn't really relate or empathize with any of the protagonist characters. Perhaps thr reason for this is that the characters in the story are constructed to be symbols for other things rather than just interesting and relatable in their own right to the typical person.",The Matrix

I won't say anything about the storyline as this movie is a lot like the PC game The Neverhood--nearly everything you need to know, you learn within the movie.Certain things are left unsaid, of course, like in all movies. This is one of the drawbacks to the movie. You hardly ever see the world outside of the Matrix, which gets you feeling sort of claustrophobic. Events that take place and names of individuals, ships, and places rip off from the Bible, which is kind of annoying since the movie is nothing religious (although the use of prophecies and an uninteresting, ""perfect"" oracle tends to make that statement false). This is a major bad part of the movie along with its ""perfect"" events, as mentioned above. For example, in the end, Trinity gives Neo a ""magical kiss"" that revives him from death. Amazing how women can be sometimes, right?The music, composed by Don Davis (Jurassic Park III), wasn't too bad, but it did seem a little repetetive at points. My brother has both soundtracks and neither is too great, but the music does fit in with the movie.Also, the movie tends to be a little boring. This IS the first movie, so that much can be expected because we need to fully understand what is going on. The explanations pretty much cover up for the lack of action that was expected (there IS NOT a huge lack of action--there is just long parts of explanation between big events).Without taking the bad parts into consideration, this movie is not just another sci-fi thriller.

I had the opportunity to see this film and I was appalled that it had NO trace of originality. Simply put, this is a live-action comic book with the self-consciously stricken characters, ludicrous fight scenes and tons of technical mumbo-jumbo repetition. This movie may belong in the serious neo-noir genre á la Blade Runner and the laughable Dark City, but it blatantly ripped off the crucial plot from Mamoru Oshii's 1995 visual mind trip animé Ghost in the Shell based on Masamune Shirow's torturiously complex manga, and a bit from Katsuhiro Otomo's groundbreaking Akira. It made me feel I was watching a live-action adaption of Ghost in the Shell coupled with the elaborate kung-fu and gun fighting sequences copied from Jackie Chan and John Woo. This is the newly-spawned version of Keanu Reeves' inferior predecessor Johnny Mnemonic, only better with mind-bending visual effects and decent acting in spite of a lame script chock full of tired by-the-book cliches. The Wachowski brothers may be complimented for their astounding vision (I've never seen the 3-D dimension revolving the characters in the ""time slice"" scenes done so well with style), but this movie is nothing short of a derivative sci-fi movie relying on visual eye candy and dark futuristic theme intended for the primarily target audience of pony-tailed comic book shop owners, computer geeks and aspiring artists. *1/2 out of four stars",The Matrix

446,TheNabOwnzz,An excellent combination of style and psychology,9,18 April 2018,"The Matrix is the kind of movie that easily could have been absolutely terrible, as it has been compared to a lot of incoherent nonsense and some stating that it is a hard to understand or mindbreaking film. However, this is not the case. In contrast to a lot of these incoherent films that appear intelligent to make people like them so THEY can feel intelligent too, The Matrix is actually a well thought out psychological motion picture about living in denial and being aware.What makes The Matrix stand out as such a great film is that while the story is obviously far-fetched, it manages to capture a very close relevance to the actual world. In the film the choice is given to live in denial or know the truth, which is very relevant to people in modern society. It understands human emotions and embraces it, instead of quite simply just ignoring it like a lot of todays movies seem to do.I am not a very big fan of Keanu Reeves, who appears to be a wooden plank in most of his roles, and it is also the case in this movie, yet it does not detract the film from being any less despite him being the main character. Perhaps his constant confused look seems to somehow fit just right in this movie, i am not sure. But somehow Keanu Reeves just fits in Neo properly. Laurence Fishburne as Morpheus, Joe Pantoliano as Cypher ( who is by the way a brilliant addition of a typical character who WANTS to live in denial and escapism, and doesnt want to see the truth ) & Hugo Weaving as the deep layered computer program Agent Smith are the most notable and best of the supporting cast, as each gives off an excellent performance. It is also a beautifully stylishly shot, choreographed & edited film. The movie has many great shots, filmed with a green tint in the scenes in The Matrix. Ofcourse the one where Neo steps in Trinity, Apoc & Switch's car comes to mind, with a fantastic distance shot when he finally steps in which shows the downpour of the rain combined with the green tint. There is also a lot of martial arts, and all this is filmed brilliantly. There is no shakycam, no quick edits, just raw athleticism and power, leaving you in awe every time a hand to hand fight comes on the screen. The Wachowski brothers also frequently used slow motion, particularly in an amazingly edited and choreographed lobby shootout. You do not miss a thing of what is happening on screen due to this excellent camera technique. The slow motion enhances the overview of the entire shootout. Not to mention the trademark visually breakthrough impressive bullet dodges Neo makes later on in the film.This all means The Matrix is excellent entertainment, one of the greatest pure action movies, but also challenges us to understand the truth about the world we are living in.",The Matrix
447,NikkoFranco,Revolutionary,10,28 May 2018,"When I describe this film franchise as revolutionary, I mean not only in terms of visual and graphics but including the storyline. For some reasons I tend to think that this film is George Orwellian in nature, like being controlled and oppressed, the fight and battle for freedom and the strength of mind over matter. However complex it is, especially the very first release, it is still appealing to the mass viewers as it also has a lot of action in it. Keanu Reeves in his past roles before this, always comes across as a surf dude, but I give him points that as Neo, there's a depth that was not visible before. There's also good team chemistry between him, Laurence Fishburne, Carrie Anne Moss, Joe Pantoliano and the nemesis, Hugo Weaving. The other actors also delivered brilliantly and the Wachowski brothers deserve a lot more credit for coming up with something extra ordinaire.",The Matrix

450,boe_dye,boe_dye sez: has it been ten years already?!,10,3 January 2009,"I can remember seeing this in the theatre so long ago. I remember going to the movies, having an expectation that it was about aliens or perhaps some type of over the top b-movie, and then being totally blown away by just about everything that was in front of my face, and then blown even further away after learning about all of the symbolic meanings hidden throughout the film.And 10 years later, my wife and I decided to pop in a DVD and try out our new 42in LCD and sure enough the movie still blows my mind.Sure you can still enjoy this movie for the sole purpose of the eye candy. The story line while not directly original, was at the very least original to the generation who watched it.1999 was certainly the tail end of the appeal to the so-called cyber-punk genre. Previous we had the wonders of Blade Runner, Hackers, and Johnny Neumonic just to name a few. But this movie set a standard.Borrowing ideas from Anime, Post-Apocalyptic dystopia, and Terminator, and doing what Star Wars did for Generation X in the 80's by giving us ""The Force"" and amazing ways to shoot models in epic space battles, this did for Generation Nintendo in the 90's by inventing new ways to use camera angles, and ""bullet time"", as well as giving us the idea to ""unplug from the Matrix"".It gave ""woah"" a totally new meaning, as well as catch phrases like ""there is no spoon"", and ""see how deep the rabbit hole goes"".You can watch this movie two ways: For the utter enjoyment of what you see is what you get, or in the double meaning catch phrase by seeing ""how deep the rabbit hole goes"", you can learn all of the philosophy that went into it, which there is quite a bit.A movie that brings back memories, it is certainly my favorite movie of all time. It was kind of a bummer that the sequels were more about flash and fire as opposed to substance and thought.But the great thing about this movie is that it does end with an ending that doesn't need to be taken as a cliffhanger. It can be taken as somewhat open ended, but with a great deal of finality.A great supplement to this film would be the Animatrix series which gives a great back story and history to how the humans and the machines started fighting each other in the first place. It also provides some other short stories which in many cases are better then the 2 sequels.",The Matrix
451,eve_dolluk,Best Sci Fi film ever !!?!,10,23 July 2010,"I am writing this review 11 years after I first walked into my local cinema and sat down to watch a film I knew nothing about called The Matrix. I had seen little advertising except for the poster at the cinema and I did not know what to expect. 1 minute into the film and I was awestruck. I am not sure exactly what i had just seen. Visually it was the most unique thing Id ever seen, and only 3 minutes had passed. Then we move onto story telling, we are faced with Alice in Wonderland and down the rabbit hole references. I knew then that this was going to be interesting. Slowly Layers were peeled away until boom it hits you right in the face, it actually draws your breath and moves you in such a way that I had never experienced watching a film thus the Matrix is revealed. Some amazing action scenes follow including the lobby scene which for me is still the best action sequence scene I've ever seen. Just when you think it can't get any better we have the ending....... NO..... the hairs stand up on the back of your neck and you are instantly touched by... something. By the time i had walked out of the cinema and got about 100 yards down the road I turned around. I went straight back and watched the next showing. I watched the film 8 times at the cinema over the next few weeks, demanding friends come and see it. Now I have probably seen the film many times since ( 100 ). I know there are flaws but then when you see a flaw you can also somehow justify it. As a stand alone film it is the best Sci Fi movie of all time. Fans wanted more and 2 more films arrived. I enjoyed both films although not on the same level as the firstFor the summer of 99 The Matrix rocked my world along with the Love Parade festival in Berlin. Thus 99 will always be my favourite year. The Matrix 10/10",The Matrix

453,hooma814,Even better as an adult!,9,14 July 2020,"This movie was always epic watching it as a kid. The fight scenes, with cool bullet dodging, guns , helicopters, all the martial arts, it was all so exciting, apart from two scenes that always freaked me out. Neo's mouth going missing and when Neo gets the bugs in and out of his stomach, plus I might add the baby scene too, when Neo is born again. But other than that it was just a cool movie with cool clothes.But boy was it even better to watch it as an adult. The complexity and symbolism throughout every scene is so detailed. It's almost as if every line is deeply thought out and chosen. Concepts that were way too hard as a kid like the connection of the ship being called Nebuchadnezar, being connected with dreams and reality. Or the white rabbit and Alice in Wonderland references. Each of these tip offs were sp exciting, especially what occurs in Neos interactions with the people coming to his door. How did I miss the lines of them saying wake up. Neo spends the first half of the movie asking so many questions. It was also great to see how times have changed from 1999 technology and the phones used in the office scenes.The acting and casting is superb in this movie. I love every character. Hugo Weaving, Keanu Reeves especially display one of the best faces off battles of good versus bad that I've scene. And that gun scene in the foyer has the be thee most insane shoot out fighting scene in movie history. The fighting is so impressive. All credit to the effort the movie makers and cast put into pulling this off with excellence!The costumes and colour design is also well thought out with the green that matches the Matrix reality.This .movie is so good. If you haven't watched it for a while or again as an adult, I'd highly recommend.",The Matrix

455,thewillt08,What is The Matrix?,8,16 August 2012,"Welcome to the real world of awesome reviews. Me personally, I would have taken the red pill. Obviously I am talking about the mind bending experience known as The Matrix. What is the Matrix? To be honest, after seeing the entire probably ten times I still probably can't even tell you. The Matrix is about a man named Thomas A. Anderson who lives a double life. He works for a company which he hates, but he is also a computer hacker by the alias of Neo. He is searching for the answer to the Matrix question. He is also looking for the legendary Morpheus, but Morpheus is also looking for him. Neo is destined to be ""the one."" Mr. Anderson gets sucked into ""the real world"" and he experiences a whole new world.The first Matrix throws a lot of plot at the audience, especially in the beginning. We learn about The Matrix and the history of the real world. The human race is on the brink of destruction and they are at war with the machines. Neo is destined to be ""the one"" the one to save humanity and end the war, but first he has to be sucked out of the Matrix and into the real world. Neo has lived in the Matrix his entire life and he got taken out. The plot is a little slow and confusing but if you stick with it, the story is very interesting and rewarding.The dialog in this movie was very clever. When Neo entered the real world he asked why his eyes hurt. Morpheus answered, ""You never used them before."" Neo is a full grown man and the idea of him using his eyes for the first time just makes you think. Morpheus says, ""Welcome to the real world."" That line was probably the most memorable line of the entire movie. My favorite line has to be when an agent is dodging Neo's bullets and when he fires back Neo dodges all but one of his bullets. The agent walks up to Neo and before he can pull the trigger Trinity comes out of nowhere, puts a pistol to his head and says, ""Dodge this."" Then she blows him away in slow motion fashion. That was awesome not cheesy at all.The villain in a movie has to stand out and be memorable. Hugo Weaving plays Agent Smith, and he is probably one of the greatest villains in a movie I have ever seen. The way he talks, the way he moves, the way he acts, everything about him is just bad. This guy does not play around, he is strictly business. One of the first scenes we meet him he is talking with Mr. Anderson and he makes Mr. Anderson's mouth disappear. He lets the audience know that this is his world, his playground, and everyone plays by his rules. He is intimidating because he is a leader, he rarely shows emotion, all he wears is a suit and shades, and he is plain scary. Every time he says, ""Mr. Anderson"" it sends a chill down my spine. The special effects are in a league of their own, there phenomenal. The beginning of the movie may have been a little slow but once Neo gets into the real world there are plenty of fight scenes, gun fights, explosions, death, and fear. Somebody turns of the special effects switch and the movie goes off. The most famous of course is when Neo dodges bullets and basically does the limbo. That has been impersonated by everybody at least once. The last scene where Neo and Trinity go into the building with a bunch of guns and blow away the soldiers, that was awesome. There were bullets flying and punches were being thrown. The martial arts and slow motion effects were amazing. Actors must have worked really hard to master the technique, and it really did pay off. Sure some of the things that happened in the movie would never happen in real life, but think of the world they are in. Think of the story and how it doesn't matter if it would happen in real life or not. The Matrix technically isn't ""real."" Problems with the movie, there are a few. This movie is not for somebody with a short attention span. You need to pay attention during the first hour of the movie. It is all plot and explaining the world that is The Matrix. It drags a little bit but it is important. The audience could still have some questions at the end. What exactly is Zion? Is Neo the one? The oracle says he isn't but he does things no other person can do. Do the oracles prophesies even mean anything? She said one will live and one will die, meaning Neo or Morpheus. This story leaves some holes but that's why two more movies were made. A main problem I had was the rating of the movie. This was rated R violence and language. Sure it was violent and bad language was used but there was no blood and language wasn't as bad. This movie could have passed for a stretched PG-13 and it would have attracted more of a crowd.Overall, this movie was great and different. The technology used in this movie was awesome and used right. The slow motion wasn't overused or underused, the action scenes weren't crazy because they were worth waiting for and scenes I could watch again. This movie gets the WillyT seal of approval and can be watched more than once. It is also a movie that can be seen with friends or alone. If you have not seen this movie, check it out. It's a movie everybody should see.",The Matrix

457,Sfpsycho415,The Best Sci-Fi movie of the 90's---8/10,8,12 December 2004,"The Matrix is one of the very best science fiction films of all time. Like George Lucas did with Star Wars, Andy and Larry Wachowski create a fascinating world with a different history. Everybody thinks the year is 1999. But in the real world it is closer to 2099 and the world is a very different place. Our reliance on machines has backfired and they have taken over, harvesting humans and connecting them to a system called the matrix, where humans live and think like it is modern day. The story follows of a group of rebels who escaped the matrix who find who they think is their savior, Neo (Keanu Reeves). What follows is an action-packed thrill ride, with an excellent story, and a perfect performance by Hugo Weaving, who plays Agent Smith, a computer program assigned to stop any human resistance.The action scenes completely blow you away. With old-school wire fu, they create a classic sparring session between Neo and Morpheus (Laurence Fishburne). And with extraordinary special effects, they crafted one of the best action sequences ever made in the lobby shootout. Tons of bullets, bodies, and shattered walls fill the screen while a great soundtrack blasts across the room. It has to be seen.While the two sequels were very good, they didn't come close to living up to the first installment, that has set a new standard for science-fiction that will take a heck of a lot to reach. 8/10",The Matrix
458,dalton2,It's not what I expected (too COOL for me...),7,25 June 1999,"I expected to see a very special film, ranked #20 at the IMDb Top 250. I thought I'd have something like a stunning experience... but I was wrong. What they didn't tell me is that The Matrix is just a manga film aimed to the young public. Perhaps 10-15 years ago (when I was 15-20 years old) I would have enjoyed these almost two hours and twenty minutes of audiovisual events, but now it's not the case. Many people have discovered what they thought to be a new idea in cinema. Well... unfortunately, it's not new. And the way the story develops itself is out of place for me. What I mean is that it's not a film for older people, as it enhances all the elements of children's play and all those FANCY things young people like (the COOL music, the COOL glasses, the COOL walking style, the COOL guy, the hyper-blast finale that reminds me an episode of Mazinger Z...), and just assumes everything as the way things have to be. There are no adult references, just a show where adolescents' dreams come true. Nothing really intellectually moving.Don't let me be misunderstood, it's not a bad film, but it's not enough for me, at least to be at the 20th position in the list.
There are good visual effects, and there is good sound. I didn't get bored. But it's just another film, not the one. Crying Freeman has less effects but is better for me. 7 out of 10.",The Matrix

To those people who love this film, OK, you get it. But it is not for me, sorry. Slow and kind of stupid. I love Laurence Fishburne as an actor, but a lot of the other actors are really cheesy. As for Keanu Reeves, well, quite dreadful. The sets are nothing special, and the slow-mo bits in the film really become annoying. It's a shame, because the story idea is not bad.

460,kupcr,What Is The Matrix?,8,1 January 2021,"'Matrix' is a 1999 film by the brothers (now sisters) Wachowskis, and about a character that's a computer programmer named Thomas Anderson (Keanu Reeves), but he's also has an alias named ""Neo"", who's a computer hacker and in the story, an elusive figure named Morpheus (Laurence Fishburne) who's the most dangerous man alive, is the only one that can answer Neo's question ""What is the Matrix?"" And when he is contacted by Trinity, marvellously played by Carrie Anne Moss, leads him into an underworld where it is revealed to him about the world he lives in. The CGI at the time was pretty awesome and you'll notice this in the fight throughout the movie between Agent Smith, played incredibly by Hugo Weaving and the character Neo. The ending fight scene was AWESOME! The scenes are unbelievable, as well. Also, the locations and the similar DiCaprio ""Inception"" type infusion and the way each character moves, is pure gold. Love the idea of how far A.I. (Artificial Intelligence) could go to make human citizens second class. The idea that computer viruses could be human isn't far fetched. The idea to transform the final film footage with LUTS, a conduit or code to transform colour (RGB) input values from the film to different colour (RGB) output values to give your final footage a different look or feel, like a greenish tinge which is prevalent throughout the film, gives 'Matrix' a mysterious feel and emotion to the film. I will give this film an 8 for cleverness",The Matrix
461,Benslie,Still a classic to this day,10,1 April 2019,"First of all, the fight scenes in this film are original and outstanding to watch. From the camera work to the wire work before this film, nothing had been done like this in film before. Also, all the actors trained hard so that most of the time it's them and not a stunt double which helps with the realism of the situation. The set design and cinematography is well chosen for each location so you fully understand where you are. From having green lighting when in the matrix to blue in the real world helps the viewer to understand the difference between the real world and the matrix. Also the set design and how the real world looks disgusting compared to the real world which looks amazing and way better. This film came out in 1999 and honestly the special effects in this film look way better than some nowadays. The special effects help convince the viewer how the real world is now a dystopian wasteland while shots that took place in the matrix was filmed on location. The acting in this film done by everybody was well cast for their roles and you can easily tell everybody was having a good time and gave it they're all. Nobody feels like they are dragging down this movie and that everybody has a part that is important to the film. But the main four actors you can obviously see they are giving it their all. Whether it be Keanu Reeves playing the main hero or Hugo Weaving playing the main villain you can easily see the character and not the actor. The character growth for Neo and Trinity from the start of the film to the end is there and is amazing to see. The pacing in this film is spectacular and you never feel like anything is slowing the film down. In the end, The Matrix is a classic film that everybody should check out at least once in their life.",The Matrix
462,Phil_H,Keanu is stupidly beleavable,7,21 April 1999,"Before I begin, let me say this: I am not a fan of Keanu Reeves' acting ability.  Short of ""Bill & Ted"" movies, he hasn't found a niche yet (in my opinion).  I went to see this film on the advice of several people whose opinions are valuable to me.  What I found was that Keanu's normal stupidity actually was believable here!  This film (for Keanu) works! Really.I was impressed with all the acting, the effects, and even with Keanu. This IS his best film to date.Is this film as good as the rating makes it sound? No.  I reserve an ""8"" rating for films like ""The Empire Strikes Back,"" but this films isn't as bad as a ""6""...by default I give it a ""7.""

It actually seems plausible.  I also love the special-effects, although much of the movie was too murky to see anything. They were completely seemless and that's what I loved about this movie. Other than that, it relied a bit on cliches and formulas and the ending was too predictable, that the film wouldn't have suffered at all if it were changed to be more original.

And do we really know everything we have to know on it once the movie is finished? ""The Matrix"" owns many characteristics that could appear inconceivable. Because it's at the same time a movie with an incredibly complex story, a philosophical festival, an homage to many genres of film and literature and an explosive blockbuster as well.""The Matrix"" is directed by two near unknowns, the Wachowski Brothers (Andy and Larry), and stars Keanu Reeves as Thomas Anderson, a software programmer whose main hobby is to hack different computer systems, under the pseudonym of Neo.Neo soon meets Morpheus (Laurence Fishburne) who learns him that the world where he's living isn't real. It seems that it's rather a virtual world created by the Matrix. So the Matrix would be an immense artificial intelligence system that ""sucks"" the energy coming from the humans and locks their minds inside a virtual world where the most fundamental laws (such as the laws of physics) seem to be hardly applicable.Morpehus believes that Neo is ""the one"", that is the person who owns the power of stopping the Matrix and thus freeing humans from their cybernetic prison. Morpheus brings Neo along with his crew towards a Star Wars-like adventure in order to accomplish his destiny.""The Matrix"" is some kind of ""Alice in Wonderland"" set in the electronic era. The parallels with the Lewis Carroll classic are very obvious in the film and the Wachowski Bros. are fully aware that their work can be linked to Carroll's.And like ""Alice"", ""The Matrix"" astonishes and entertains with its infinitesimal quantity of surrealist elements that make the people asking if it's possible to completely understand the movie (and/or the world that it describes).In fact, ""The Matrix"" is nothing but a genuine feast of spectacular and revolutionary special effects which already elevated the film to the rank of legend. The movie makes a clever mix of techniques which require the use of sophisticated computer programs, which is ironic with the anti-technology message that prevails in the film. Some passages strikingly reminisce the George Lucas odyssey. The difference is that instead of traveling in the infinitely big, we travel in the infinitely small.And the final addition to this virtual jaunt: nothing else than action scenes directly taken from the oriental genres... Kung-fu sequences, especially those which take part during Neo's training, evidently come from Hong Kong martial arts films, while many other action scenes with superhuman movements seem to come from Japanese mangas and anime.The whole movie lays almost entirely on presentation, and for once, it's the only thing that is needed in order to provide a good movie. Characters are cool, but too much two-dimensional to my taste. They can thank their sunglasses. But it doesn't prevent them from being interesting. Neo is the best example. We can feel his questioning, his fear and also the acceptance of his fate throughout the progression of the story. Honorable mention to Hugo Weaving who plays the sinister and almost-unbeatable Agent Smith. In his case, his sunglasses don't make him cool, but even more terrifying.Just like ""Fight Club"", released a few months later, ""The Matrix"" is at the same time a pollution of explosions and fights and a philosophical must. In the Matrix case, the viewer has to ask himself about the notion of reality and the importance of machines on human life. This latter theme is very popular nowadays because of the quick industrialization process by the developed countries. Presented the Matrix way, we want to get the farther from our computers... at least for the moment...With its open end, it was obvious in 1999 that the movie would turn into a full series. And it was the case with the release of two sequels both in 2003. But nothing is worth the original... Because the sequels usually use the same techniques and they're not as striking as the first time we see them.Overall, ""The Matrix"" is a set of breathtaking special effects which owns the merit of having a story that is solid enough to make all pieces hold together. And it's not even worth searching to understand everything. The only thing to do is to watch. And you won't be disappointed. And remember that what you see is real (way of talking, evidently...), so take benefit of it...FILE SHUTTING DOWN...",The Matrix
466,jared-25331,Best film of 1999,10,23 August 2019,The Matrix is one of the most stylish and most substance film in the action genre.,The Matrix
467,eamon-hennedy,Star Wars for the MTV generation.,10,15 May 2003,"An awe inspiring mix of philosophical debate and spectacular action sequences (in other words that rare occasion of a Hollywood blockbuster mixing intelligence with the usual dose of thrills and spills) The Matrix is a superb film on every conceivable level, doing for my generation what Star Wars did for my mum and dad. The film is one that contains many surprises (not least a fantastic lead performance from Keanu Reeves). Somewhat unconventional for a summer blockbuster, the film goes on a more complex path to most summer releases, opting for a more difficult narrative in the early stages and then going for a story route that goes from being the stylish (the sequences in the Matrix itself) to the downright filthy (the scenes in the real world). The biggest surprise from the film that I got was that I went to see it based on it theatrical trailer which highlighted the action sequences, only to find when I got there that the film was offering up a more intelligent and thought provoking science fiction story with the action sequences being saved until the last half hour, and it is this course where the film suceeds the most. The Wachowski's develop characters that we come to care about. We come to care greatly for Neo, Morpheus (for the record my favourite character) and Trinity while developing a hatred for Agent Smith (perhaps the most interesting villian in recent years). They sucessfully integrate the audience into their universe and once we're settled in, they let rip with a final act that would make even James Cameron proud. At the time of writing The Matrix Reloaded is on the verge of release and now is the perfect time to re-examine a film that has very well changed the course of cinema, perhaps forever. The sequel, along with concluding chapter Revolutions, will have to go a long way to beat this masterpiece of the Hollywood blockbustser, a genre that many thought was dead.",The Matrix

I was definitely not getting why would people be so excited about Keanu Reeves' acting or the story and directing of Lana and Lilly Wachowski! There were some interesting theories in it, and that was all for me. So, I revisited it last night for only one reason - David Icke's documentary ""Renegade"" I watched the same day. In that film there was a scene from The Matrix explaining ""reality"". The good news is, I lasted to the end this time, and I liked it more than the last time I saw it, I could connect with the movie more than before, but there is still a lot to account for: from some flat acting to some ridiculous directing mistakes to many unanswered questions in the screenplay.",The Matrix

Unlike movies like Dark City and The Mummy which used very clever and enjoyable special effects in a relatively restrained fashion to serve a real story, with atmosphere, good acting and writing, this had people I could care less about, a story maybe I was too dumb to get, or maybe I had too much of a headache to be able to try. Without the aid of a computer, this movie would have nothing. Guess I am an old fogie at 35, this is nothing but a "".dot com"" movie that I fear will be the wave of the future.

473,lopcar1993,The best Sci-Fi thriller ever made! Hands down.,10,6 September 2009,"When I first saw this movie when I was twelve I didn't think much of it, I thought it had a confusing story and a mindless plot that was supported and only succeeded by out of this world slow motion stunts. Boy was I naive or what!? Now seeing it again after all these years I could see that I was not ready back then to handle a movie of this complexity and strange coherent means of story telling. But now I fully respect and love this movie for what it is and for what it always will be, mindbogglingly, mind blowing, out of this world fun.When the Matrix was released in 1999 this was the film to go see people were busting out of the theater's and telling anyone they can to go see this movie. It was the ""It"" movie of the year and it gained the title justly. This film mapped out new territory in action and ushered in a whole new generation of action & Sci-Fi thrillers and video games as well(Max Payne comes to mind) it is one of the biggest and most beloved film of the 90's and has one of the biggest fan base out there.This movie unique and I mean unique story and style has such and impact on you when you first see it you'll want to see it the minute it's over and some more after that and after that and you'll want to see it a million times it's just that good. The Matrix put's a Gothic and dark spin on the dystopia and apocalyptic themes that have become very common in Sci-Fi films, this film does it one better it takes those overly used themes and creates a completely original and unique world around which everything we Believe is a lie. It has a great monolithic tone to it that makes it a masterpiece by any standards and it creates a great aftershock in which few films can actually do these days. It purposes that machines while enslave humanity and use us as a battery source to power there vasts armies of machines around the world. But that's what makes it so great to watch it gives you a sense of hope and a sense of justice that you just feel all the way to your bones.This movie has given the fellow movie goer what they've always wanted and always searched for in a film, great action, a smart story and plot, acting you can live with and put them all together and what do you got? The Matrix! This movie will stick with long after it's over and even after tour old you'll still remember one movie that rocked your world like none other. All in all this film delivers great any day entertainment that is like Laurence Fishburn said, "" Unfortunately no one can be told what the Matrix is you have to see it for yourself."" And trust me once you do you won't ever look at Sci-Fi or other movies the same way again. This movie delivers.",The Matrix

476,Mr_PCM,"Yes, it really is as good as you remember",10,23 March 2013,"With all the imitations, spoofs, parodies, rip-offs and sequels that have come from it, it is easy to forget just how groundbreaking 1999's revolutionary film The Matrix really is. Yet even 15 years later, it still has the power to amaze and shock as much as it did on the day of release - power not wielded by many since, and certainly not the two cash-inspired sequels.Back in 1999, the Matrix was a genuine original - something rarely seen in the movies in the latter decades of the twentieth century. It was a film that took such an interesting concept that it seems amazing that it hadn't been done before, and coupled it with genuinely mind-blowing special effects to produce something very special indeed.The story itself is almost so simple it's genius. The film's premise rests on the idea that the entire world is an elaborate construct of machines, and that we are unaware that the entire population of the earth is simply plugged into a virtual reality which feeds the sentient machines which now rule the earth. Those few who have escaped are now able to re-enter this 'Matrix' at will, and bend its rules of gravity and physics as one would bend the rules of a computer program. This leads to spectacular shootouts, furiously fast fight scenes, jumping and dodging that would put an Olympic triple jumper to shame, and all of which featuring the now much-parodied slo-mo camera spinning that became synonymous with the film itself, and which made it stand head and shoulders (and knees and toes) above the rest.It seems odd to think that Keanu Reeves was not the first choice to play the lead role of Neo. Usually being able to display only a single emotion might be a drawback, but in the sepia-tinted dulled colours of the grimy world of The Matrix, Reeves' constant single expression of permanently mildly perturbed seems a perfect fit somehow, and the thought of Will Smith's excessive personality in the lead role (as was apparently the first choice) seems like a completely incongruous thought now. Meanwhile Lawrence Fishburne's presence as a 'Morgan Freeman-in-training' mentor with muscles role is perfect, while Hugo Weaving's minimal yet menacingly effective turn as the villainous Agent Smith nearly steals the show from the effects gurus' noses. His understated delivery is at times positively chilling - in particular his addressing of Reeves' Neo as 'Mr Anderson' in a manner ice-cool yet dripping with malevolent intent. Interestingly now, this role seems perfect preparation for him for his role in a second monumental trilogy of films, as shades of his performance as Agent Smith are apparent in his similarly brilliant role as Elrond in the similarly blockbusting Lord of the Rings. It's just a shame that other roles aren't similarly fleshed out - particularly Joe Pantoliano's potentially fascinating role of 'Cypher' - leaving the central quartet as the only real roles with significant screen time. Additionally, Carrie-Anne Moss lacks the warmth and charm to be a convincing (and inevitable) love interest.Yet these are only relatively minor quibbles. Which brings us on to the special effects themselves - which are, quite simply, the most visually impressive since Terminator 2's T1000 morphing, if not ever. A number of standout shots have made their way into popular culture - including the camera-spinning freeze-in-midair kick which forms the standout part of the opening scene. Having been imitated so much in numerous subsequent comedies and spoofs such as Scary Movie and Shrek, their impact has perhaps been diluted over time, but to go back and see the shots in their original context still will transport an audience to a state of wonder that only the cinema can bring.The Matrix is a film that is always well worth a revisit - whether it has been a few weeks or a few years since you have last seen them. It's just unfortunate that it raised the bar so high that few films were able to subsequently raise their game enough to match it - including two average, serviceable but pale-in-comparison sequels that inevitably thought that more equals better. But as a stand-alone film, The Matrix is one that will stand the test of time, and will no doubt come to define the era in the way that classics such as Casablanca, Gone With The Wind and The Godfather have defined theirs.A true masterpiece.",The Matrix
477,jofitz27,The greatest action sci fi ever,10,10 March 2005,"This really is a sci fi action masterpiece to be truly appreciated and watched over and over again. All though it is endlessly complex, and still dragged down by its two poor sequels, this still is an original and brilliant piece of kick ass action and story. Starting off with pirating criminal Neo (Reeves) he is getting bizarre messages on his computer and having many strange encounters. Particularly in one scene where he is tracked down at his work by some very unfriendly looking criminals... Then we really are shown what a fantastic film this is. After a scene (wince) where he is injected with a bug, and then taken out as he travels naked and skinless through a watery world, we see some incredibly done ""special-effects"" scenes, as well as brilliantly original fight scene with Morpheous... This may be very long, but it never, ever loses its touch. It pulses with fantastic action and violent scenes throughout, whilst the complex story adds to the package. Very, very good.

478,Ana_Banana,Sheer masterpiece! And it's not about the future,10,18 October 2005,"This is one of the best films ever! Why? Just watch it. I won't discuss the concept, which is simply brilliant, nor the photography, which is astonishing. Special effects? Come on... Acting? Dialog? Script? Editing? Directing? How could I? Even now, when I remembered the film, I remain almost speechless. ""The Matrix"" is a landmark in the history of cinema, and more. Many scenes are so fascinating that anyone's hair would stand on its end while watching, and for many reasons, visual or spiritual.Because this film is not just a film, but an art work that transforms you, it gives you a deeper perspective on life and yourself. So, it is really great art, at a level reached by surprisingly few movies. OK, it has its Buddhist themes. So what? Isn't it all about truth, freedom and the individual? Are these not fundamental questions for anyone? Isn't the perspective of this movie on them tremendous and extremely touching? And the ending... Wow... A rare, powerful and effective way to end a great film. The fight will go on and on (compare Neo's approach to the Stalker's in Tarkowsky's masterpiece). Because the story is not just a sci-fi about some bleak future, it's a parable (like any good sci-fi) about the very present day, about what is real now, and how free are you now.P. S. The sequels are disappointing and mere lame action sci-fi thrillers. Too bad. No more real spiritual concepts, but over-complicated plots and inconsistent new characters. Never mind, let's forgive the Wachowskys for wanting some extra cash, since they have given the world this masterpiece in the first part of the trilogy!",The Matrix

482,RoboRabbit89,One of the greatest movies ever made.,8,5 March 2018,"Where do I begin, well I heard of this film back in 1999, and around
2000 I finally seen it as a rental first, with my dad. He and I both loved it,
it's quite original and unlike anything I've seen before, even at that time.Then in 2001 my mom and I found it on VHS, new I think? Can't remember.
I think it was, anyway she enjoyed it too. I have to admit this was part of my childhood, and it was great fun to watch over and over again. Even today.About the movie, This is a cyberpunk action-thriller, Thomas Anderson is a
hacker aka Neo under his alias, is what I think, kinda lost in life and is 
looking for Morpheus (as many times I have seen this, I have no idea why he's
looking for him, really). He is brought into the realization that the world he knows
is a clever computerized dream world!
Morpheus, Trinity, and the others join the fight to stop the machines called
sentinels that mankind has been at war with for a century. The cast, Keanu Reeves is great as Neo aka Thomas Anderson, he did a good
job, playing Neo slightly naive to all the carnage and to his destiny as ""The One"",
being chosen to be the savior of the human race.Laurence Fishburne is great as Morpheus the leader of the team and mentor
to Neo and Trinity, his voice is so magnetic you are drawn in completely and 
he's just a damn good actor anyway. He's a pleasure to watch.Carrie Ann Moss is awesome as the ass kicking Trinity, I have to admit she is
a very sexy lady, she looks great in vinyl, it shows off her sexy shape well.
I still have not seen her in very much, but she is a really good actress, I hope
in the near future she will play in more action movies because she just rocks!Hugo Weaving is also great as the sort of main villain Agent Smith, he's great
playing creepy and emotionally robotic as Smith. Also a good foe to Neo and 
the others heroes, I haven't seen him in much either but he is a good actor too.
On to the action, the action scenes are unbelievably awesome and memorable
which is always good, my favorites are when Neo vs. Smith in the subway, 
the beginning with Trinity being chased by Agents as she jumps from roof top
to roof top and when Neo and Trinity have an epic firefight in a government lobby.
Overall a great piece of science fiction with epic action scenes and mind teasing
philosophical messages. I give it an 8/10. If you have not seen this, please see it,
we don't get movie this good anymore and if you've been dying to see something
completely original, look no further. Highly recommended.",The Matrix

We get the now-famous ""Bullet Time"" where Neo (Keanu Reeves) dodges oncoming bullets; we get mechanical octopi taking on hovercrafts; we get the swirling fight choreography and slo-mo techniques. All very impressive.The story is illogical, but it does introduce intriguing suggestions about the difference between reality and dreams; I think we have to take the ""machines-rule-mankind"" aspect on faith.The acting: Keanu Reeves is good in an uncomplicated role and he looks right for the character, Laurence Fishburne successfully acts this material as if it was Shakespeare, Joe Pantoliano is perfectly slimy as a traitor, Hugo Weaving is one of the best movie villains ever as the sinister Agent Smith, and the sexy Carrie Ann-Moss is Trinity, Neo's (eventual) love interest.Overall, while I don't think this is one of the best movies ever made, it's still a great movie. 9/10",The Matrix
486,thesouthfamily2-552-707097,Never send a human to do a machine's job.,8,19 January 2014,"""The Matrix"" is a visually dazzling cyberadventure, full of kinetic excitement. I've seen dozens if not hundreds of these exercises in violence, which recycle the same tired ideas: Bad guys fire thousands of rounds, but are unable to hit the good guy. Then it's down to the final showdown between good and evil--a martial arts battle in which the good guy gets pounded until he's almost dead, before he finds the inner will to fight back. Been there, seen that; however this one is an exception, as it done very well.Still, I must not ignore the movie's virtues. It's great-looking, both in its design and in the kinetic energy that powers it. It uses flawlessly integrated special effects and animation to visualize regions of cyberspace. It creates fearsome creatures, including mechanical octopi. It morphs bodies with the abandon of ""Terminator II."" It uses f/x to allow Neo and Trinity to run horizontally on walls, and hang in the air long enough to deliver karate kicks. It has leaps through space, thrilling sequences involving fights on rooftops, helicopter rescues and battles over mind control.And it has performances that find the right notes. Keanu Reeves goes for the impassive Harrison Ford approach, ""acting"" as little as possible. I suppose that's the right idea. Laurence Fishburne finds a balance between action hero and Zen master. Carrie-Anne Moss, as Trinity, has a sensational title sequence, before the movie recalls that she's a woman and shuttles her into support mode. Hugo Weaving, as the chief Agent, uses a flat, menacing tone that reminded me of Tommy Lee Jones in passive-aggressive overdrive. There's a well-acted scene involving Gloria Foster as the Oracle, who like all Oracles is maddeningly enigmatic.""The Matrix"" did not bore me. It interested me so much, indeed, that I wanted to be challenged even more. I wanted it to follow its material to audacious conclusions, to arrive not simply at victory, but at revelation.",The Matrix
487,nmholland,A Revolution For The Action Genre,10,10 April 2016,"The Matrix is directed by the Wachowski Brothers and stars Keanu Reeves, Laurence Fishburne, Hugo Weaving, and Carrie-Anne Moss. The basic plot of the movie is a computer hacker named Thomas Anderson, whose code name is Neo, finds out that everything he believes about his reality is a lie, and that he must learn to fight a certain force in order to ensure the survival of humanity. That's all I can say without spoiling the entire film.The Matrix is one of the most revolutionary films of all time, especially in terms of the action genre. There's no explaining just how amazing The Matrix is, without just recommending it to a person who has never before seen it. Everything that can be said about The Matrix has already been said, and I'm just going to say it again.The absolute best thing about The Matrix is the indescribable direction. Rarely are there films in which they look better almost 20 years after they come out, then when they first hit theaters, yet The Matrix is one of them. Even movies that used very little special effects, like Star Wars (1977) still have little points that look a bit fake. Not The Matrix. Every single shot of Keanu Reeves dodging bullets, or Laurence Fishburne doing a back flip and kicking Hugo Weaving in the face looks inexpressibly beautiful. Nothing since this movie, not even its two sequels, have come even close to the directing capabilities, no matter how hard they've tried.Another great thing The Matrix offers is the incredible acting. Even Keanu Reeves, who is considered one of the best worst actors of all time, does really good. He isn't Keanu Reeves in this movie, he's Neo, and he knows it. Laurence Fishburne as Morpheus is one of the most iconic characters of all time, and does great all throughout the film, whether it's an exposition scene or one of the many amazing action sequences. I don't even need to say that Hugo Weaving did near perfect, because, well, it's Hugo Weaving. And he does near perfect. Carrie- Anne Moss plays a great Trinity, to the point in which I couldn't see any other actress playing her character at all, and that's saying something.The special effects. Wow, the special effects. The Matrix contains some of the best special effects ever put to film, ever. As mentioned earlier, many other films have tried to copy The Matrix's directing style, and none have even come close to it, even its two pretty disappointing sequels. The Matrix's special effects are utterly perfect, and there's no doubt about it. Every single scene has flawless special effects, and blends them in incredibly, leaving not a single trace of doubt in them.The script for The Matrix is also as good as it gets. Although there is the symbolic ""woah"" from Keanu Reeves, every single line fits into the film perfectly. The Matrix has one of the few scripts that I would have no complaints with. Not even one. Not too often does a script describe action scenes, like this one does. I implore you to read the script for The Matrix, and just see how in depth The Wachowski's went into the action scenes. Reading the script feels almost like reading a full length book due to the extent that the writers went to in order to achieve this masterpiece.In conclusion, The Matrix is one of the best action films of all time, and might just be one of the best movies of all time. Thanks to its revolutionary directing, perfect script, and near flawless acting, I'd recommend The Matrix to anyone, as long as you avoid its two sequels.",The Matrix
488,fleagles,Unique sci-fi action,8,25 September 2000,"Many moviegoers have voted The Matrix as one of the greatest films of all time (current ranking on the IMDB 250: 31st), but it does not deserve that ranking.  It is however, a very good film for its genre(s); a sci-fi thriller with lots of martial arts. I won't try to explain the plot, because I only started to understand the story about an hour into this film, and even then am not sure what was going on. That being said, The Matrix is arguably Keanu Reeves' best film. Reeves, who is constantly derided as a mumbling surfer dude, fits his role perfectly as a hacker/possible savior of mankind.  The martial arts sequences, while somewhat campy, are amazing, and the video-game-like action sequences are certainly unique (did he really need that many guns, though ?)

490,Danimal-7,It's been done better before,5,23 August 1999,"The first half of THE MATRIX is pretty darn good.  After a bizarre and surreal action sequence where the black-clad Trinity (Carrie-Ann Moss) displays superhuman abilities in eluding some Men In Black who also have superhuman abilities, we meet the plot.  He is called Neo (Keanu Reeves), who finds himself being contacted by two seemingly omniscient characters: the aforementioned Trinity and a man called Morpheus whom we at first know only by his voice.  They try, not always successfully, to guide Neo out of the danger posed by the Men In Black (who we learn are called Agents, but Men In Black gives you a better idea of what they look like).The movie to this point is great fun, with a palpable aura of mystery making your pulse pound as you wonder what the explanation is for what's happening to Neo.  Better yet, the explanation we get from Morpheus is actually moderately imaginative and makes at least some sense (although one wonders how humans can live without a solar-based food chain beneath them; I can't explain more without giving too much away).Unfortunately, at this point, THE MATRIX is only halfway done.  The second half is a nonstop pastiche of action cliches and mystical mumbo-jumbo, as Neo, supposedly the most important person in the world for Morpheus to find, actually achieves very little other than to become your routine Hollywood superhero and pull off a depressingly prosaic rescue mission.  Characters come back from the dead literally by magic, or with no explanation at all. The action sequences are competently done, with an eerie musical backdrop sounded out by cartridge cases clinking against the floor, but they can't disguise the essential problem: THE MATRIX runs out of plot an hour before it ends.Keanu Reeves is not improving with age; the way he expresses disbelief will have you expressing your own disbelief, and there is no chemistry between him and the attractive Moss.  Laurence Fishburne's character is poorly sketched, leaving him nothing to do except be very, very cool, but he does that very well.  Moss does her action scenes with verve, but delivers her dialogue weakly.  Hugo Weaving, playing one of the Men In Black, is sinister, inhuman, and a lot of fun to watch.  A number of supporting characters who assist Trinity and Morpheus are well played.Regrettably, THE MATRIX is yet another case of Hollywood putting excellent production values into creating a half-baked story.  The same themes were much better examined just last year, in THE TRUMAN SHOW and DARK CITY.  And by no means does this film deserve comparison to BLADE RUNNER, whose plot dealt with the line between man and machine in a way that this movie never approaches.  THE MATRIX is mildly entertaining, but still greatly overrated.Rating: ** out of ****.",The Matrix

This film requires the usual sci-fi suspension of disbelief but has several things going for it:  the characters are actually developed in a detective-movie-noirish way, the hero and others struggle with decisions and THEN act, as opposed to JUST doing something, and most obviously the film has a color-and-costuming visual style that remains a bold statement throughout the production.

The ending is also weak, and don't tell me it's because they had planned on making a sequel because movies should be able to stand alone.....and don't even get me started on the sequels. At least they're not too overrated. I have felt this way since 1999 when it came out and I went to see it in the theater. When it was finally over, I said, ""That's it?!""Let's go over this piece, shall we? People praise this film for it's fight choreography, when the people fighting are tools like Fishburne and Reeves. Are you serious? I can't help but to laugh out loud at Keanu in the dojo training scene with Lamprey. He looks like he's got a Klingon dagger rammed up his butt! This is the ""One""?! I can't think of anyone more miscast. Actually, I can't think of a film where he wouldn't be miscast. True, a lot of my discontent with this film comes from the actors, but even with decent actors I still think it would've failed. The story is also sloppy and filled with more useless techno-babble than a quantum-physics book from Brent Spiner's ""Data"" from the Star Trek: The Next Generation series. To sum it up, it doesn't make any sense. People as batteries? OK. For a movie that spouts so much techno-babble at you, it's not very technical. It's all a red herring.My biggest problem with the people that like this film is that they praise it for it's originality when that could not be further from the truth. Do your research or just watch more movies and you'll begin to realize that this film is nothing more than a long list of rip-offs from others films....and it gets the credit for all of it. This isn't the film's fault, it's the uneducated fans....the same fans responsible for it's ridiculously lofty rating here at IMDb. I think the rip-offs were intentional personally, and I don't think even the Wachowski brothers thought it'd be as successful as it was because of it.Criminally overrated....and will not stand the test of time. The epitome of the phrase, ""Style over substance."" Just another summer blockbuster.It's a lot like Pokemon. People like it, but I can't understand why....and I don't think they do either. I think this will just be another fad. Time will tell.",The Matrix
494,catdogmanfish,This is not that great,2,6 July 2021,"I'll give you the special effects are great but this movie is overhyped. I looked at my timer and it was at the 42 minute mark and the majority of the movie up to that point was clunky exposition. Other than a few good fight scenes and some killer special effects, one could easily draw a conclusion that the matrix was merely at the right place at the right time.",The Matrix
495,starlit-sky,The Most Philosophical Science Fiction Movie Ever!,10,12 August 2000,"There are so many reasons why I think ""The Matrix"" is the most brilliant science fiction movie ever made but I like to present its philosophical implications because that's what interested me most. Now, most people may think that ""The Matrix"" is just a great science fiction movie with lots of amazing special effects but there is more to it than that. As a person with special interest in philosophy, I was amazed by the plot. It's like Plato's theory of forms converted into a science fiction plot! Plato is one of the greatest philosophers of all time from ancient Greece who theorized that the world we live in is not real. Instead, it is a reflection of a real world and all the objects we see are mere shadows of the ideal forms which exit in that real world. I do not want to go into much detail for I think the implication is obvious: The world we live in is ""The Matrix"" where nothing is real; it is a computer-generated reality in which human minds are trapped while our real brains are hooked up to a giant computer administering that program to consume our energy. So everything we see is just a reflection of the objects created in that program, electronic signals stimulating our nerves to give us the impression that we are actually sensing material objects. In fact we are just watching the shield put in front of our eyes to prevent us from seeing the truth (just like in Plato's cave). Now this plot is amazingly parallel with the most recent findings in physics; Bertrand Russell explained it in a completely scientific way that we can never know if the real world exists because all we sense is just electronic signals stimulating our senses; we cannot know where these electronic signals are coming from or if the source of these signals is a ""material substance"" in the sense we think of the term. ""The Matrix"" suggests that these signals are delivered to us by a computer. There have been many empiricist philosophers, like George Berkeley and David Hume who denied the existence of the material world but their methods of proving their theories were not as scientific as the ones developed in the mid 1900s. ""The Matrix"" is a movie where implications in these philosophical theories are presented in science fiction which, I think, makes ""The Matrix"" so special. I sometimes think that this world is not real and our real existence lies in another dimension. I have friends who have the exact same feeling. Those of you who have similar thoughts will find the science fictional interpretation of their thoughts in ""The Matrix"". 
The fact that ""The Matrix"" is a computer-generated reality makes all the visual effects, specially the fighting scenes, very plausible. Luckily, this fact makes it possible to create any kind of visual effects without the risk of making it look unrealistic (this is a computer program, anything can be real). ""The Matrix"" is definitely one of its kind; it is not like most other science fiction movies where humans are against aliens. The screenplay is so original that it makes it surpass all other science fiction movies except, maybe my other science fiction favourite, ""The Planet Of The Apes"". I cannot imagine a science fiction fan not liking this movie.",The Matrix

The visuals are the best part of this movie. It's great effects to the likes of which we really have never seen before and are done in a way that's just fasinating. The characters are mostly all played well, particularly Keanu Reaves who plays his best role since Speed.

It has inspired so many filmmakers; not to mention its influence on pop culture in general.It's a perfect blend of sci-fi and action/adventure (kung fu especially). Sure there are a few plot holes, but things like humans being used as batteries had to be changed to make it more accessible. Apparently the concept was originally to use humans' brains for their computing power, but the studios thought that would be too confusing for viewers.It truly was a game changer. The sequels definitely went in a different direction, and unfortunately the Wachowski's other efforts haven't lived up to the high bar set by The Matrix, but I can't say enough good things about this movie. Obviously no movie is perfect, but The Matrix is a fun, inventive, action-packed blockbuster of a movie.",The Matrix

500,RachelLone,If only my life could be as cool as it is in...'The Matrix',9,17 May 2001,"It is such an enjoyable journey to watch this film. Stunning choreography and special effects, spectacular cinematography (which makes Keanu Reeves look so...you know...so...) and the theme of the story - the 'real' world and the virtual world.Personally, I find our real world nearly surreal, almost a dream. But in this movie, you can live a more real life in the virtual world, where it appears to be a dream but it's not entirely so. You can learn so many different things much faster by getting those programmes into your head. In the virtual world you look a lot better, you can be your 'real' self, that is to say, to be able to use your potential to prove to the world that you're someone special.To me, this film has inspired me in some way. The reality is, we are getting closer and closer to that virtual paradise (a paradise with commotion, of course).If you're already a fan of Keanu's, than I suppose you will say to yourself 'Keanu Reeves is my hero!

505,GHCool,"Good story, great technique",10,14 April 2003,"I saw THE MATRIX again recently.  It was a much different experience when I saw it for the first time.  The first time I saw it was on its opening weekend.  It just looked like a somewhat cool movie and I was bored that day.   It wasn't famous or anything yet.  I walked out of the theater knowing I saw something special, but I didn't realize how special it was (largely because I didn't realize how intricate the special effects are).
Last week was at least the 5th time I saw it.  I was aware of the cult status it had and how many movies copied it and how many of its lines and ideas are memorized by science fiction fans.  I also had a better idea of what went into making it (I don't think I'll ever understand the true complexity of it).I had more admiration this time for the technical stuff, but I felt basically the same about the story.  It is excellent and has a lot of good philosophy, but it doesn't really have an ending.  In place of an ending, it has a long violent action sequence and then the fight between Agent Smith and Neo.   They are among the best action sequences and fights ever filmed, but compared to the richness of the story in the beginning, I always felt it could have been more.What I'm trying to say is that I have no doubt that MATRIX RELOADED and MATRIX REVOLUTIONS are for sure going to be at least as good as the ending of THE MATRIX.  I just hope it also has some of the stuff that made the beginning and middle of THE MATRIX great too.",The Matrix
506,nelliebell-1,Under The Yoke of a New World Order!,9,13 May 2007,"The Motion Picture ""The Matrix"" perhaps should be spelled matrice because that is what this film is using to tell the story of one Thomas Anderson(played by Keanu Reeves) who works for a top software computing company.It seems early into ""The Matrix"" Thomas Anderson has two lives,one as already stated with the added comment that he helps his land lady take out the garbage and the other life is involved with computing and the internet whereby Thomas Anderson goes by the hacker alias ""Neo""and is guilty of committing about as many crimes as there are on computing and the internet.The definition of a Matrix is a switch which is a device ""that allows multiple channels connected via serial interfaces to connect under operator control to designated remote or local analog circuits.""It is while at his computer keyboard on a given evening that Neo is contacted directly by way of his own personal computer.How this is in fact accomplished is never clear however it is made even more implausible as Neo is not even on the computing network legally as his hacking proclivities would stand more a chance of being discovered.Yet that is exactly what occurs though that discovery is arranged by a notorious individual in Morpheus(played by Laurence Fishburne) with stalwart and even inspirational keyboardest in Trinity.Trinity wishes to meet with Neo and it is Trinity who has the capacity real or otherwise to write to the construct with an ability to actually break into a virtually invisible and undetectable space and land in Neo's lap.This occurs at a point in time when a knock occurs at his apartment door with a deal about to go down which though innocuous is not about drugs per se though drugs do enter into the general conversation(it is the only way to fly) it is about a specially written or/either stolen piece of computer data(on disk)and is purchased for some $2,000.00.Neo it would seem is living up to his name and indeed even by todays standards that is a talent only a few perhaps have the ability to achieve.Neo is a hacker who when a moment ago prior to the arrival of the these persons he was informed by way of his computer to follow the White Rabbit.A female who is partnered with the purchaser of the computer disk shows her shoulder to Neo to only expose a tattoo of a white rabbit and due to this coincidence he decides to go out though he has work the following morning.He somehow meets Trinity and it is here that it is discovered that Trinity is a girl and indeed Trinity is played by Carrie-Ann Moss.She warns him that they are looking for you and Neo asks who is.The film provides a cardboard characteristic perhaps more the equal to an animated construct as an air of a constructed set is bally-hooed with most of the picture being given imaginative as well as staid staging that provide for an effect as a construct which may actually be required as part of the purport of this film.The message however is that Thomas Anderson is about to jump ship permanently and bare the hacker alias Neo for the rest of time.The film leaves no doubt as to how all of this is to transpire with the matrix as well as telecommunications being made to be the transporter of the very physical presence that the film is named after.The real problem that this film will not shy away from,is that there is in the construct a reported illusion to an authority that is not real but artificial and indeed the film proceeds to be transported through telephone lines while evolving to a crusade to free themselves from the arrival of an artificially constructed cyborg entity,""Agents"".The agents are in fact hardwired to the construct and represent the gatekeeper ideology.They guard all the gates.It is not new territory,this territory as to telecommunications and though not new it is as well not new to be concerned with an artificial intelligence as the evolution of the computer has been for many years concerned with these very areas.The arrival though as to the claim of actual Agents(lead Agent played by Hugo Weaving)whereby they materialize as if residing or embedded in a matrix only environment for purposes of enforcement using the bodies of the citizenry is to underscore something unusual.The film provides for something as to the truth and the admission that there exists the real presence of an overseer whose authority is unmitigated by circumstance and whose power will not relent.We are in effect under the yoke of a tyrant and the communications of the 20th century has given witness to this rise of a foreign power as well as an artificial intelligence.They are in fact the same thing and we don't have to wait one hundred years as it is here now and has been here for at least some 50 to perhaps 75 years.It is well to understand that behavior has mass market appeal with films providing a virtual backyard to convey as films such as these do.The mass market appeal is likened to a cash register for what is more powerful than to control the wealth of the world,it would be to have power over it.The very clear and precise arguments as to abuse with power over others continually creeps into the picture time and time again allowing for an inability to get out from under the treachery of an overseer.It is this challenge that eventually materializes into the films most engaging scenes as Morpheus,Neo,Trinity all weigh in against the construct with real world rock-em-sock-em fight scenes.Though this is but something of an abbreviation,the climax as to the Matrix is worthy of mention as a kiss is well earned and if true love ever had a chance it won this one hands down.I've watched this more than once to learn as much about the construct as to learn about the film.",The Matrix

510,KillerLord,The Perfect Symbiosis of Action and Philosophy,10,29 September 2008,"What is real? How do you define real? This question has been explored for its significance in metaphysics in other movies as well. The Thirteenth Floor is one of them and the other is Dark City. I mention these because they were released more or less around the same time as this movie was released. But these two movies do not enjoy the position and the popularity of this movie - The Matrix, why? Look at the box office success of the Matrix. Look at the popularity of this movie. Advertisements have been created based on the themes of this movie. Most people seem to have heard of the movie if not seen it. The Matrix enjoys a prominent position in the top 50 on the IMDb. Even a list of 100 best movies of all times as compiled by a documentary on the Discovery Channel mentioned this movie as among the top 100. The key to the enormous success of the Matrix is the symbiotic combination of two opposing elements. The first one being metaphysics or philosophy and the second element being intense amount of action. The Dark City is limited in its action and stresses more on the metaphysics aspect and so does the Thirteenth floor. When you see The Matrix, you see that there is far more metaphysics and philosophy in this movie when compared to the other two. And when you see the action sequences of the movie, the two movies fade into oblivion. There is so much for the intellectual to busy himself with in this movie. There is a reference to so many mythological places and figures. The character Neo is an anagram of One signifying the One Absolute many cultures believe in and then there is Trinity, an obvious reference to the Holy Trinity. The names of the ships, the numbers on the door, the name of the book Neo takes his CD out from all have a significance, a clue, if that is what one wants to call it. This movie gives enough to the intellectual to study and talk about. And yet the movie does not fail to capture the attention of the average movie goer. The average movie goer does not want to search for hidden symbols, he does not want to discuss the movie for hours and hours. He wants some action and some fun. The movie gives that as well. The movie has a lot of guns, a lot of chases and a lot of fighting. The average movie goer can appreciate the main aspect of this movie without bothering about all the hidden symbols which the intellectual chooses to see in the movie. Yet, he apparently does not deny himself the spirit of the movie and enjoys it. And I believe this is what has made the movie successful - the reconciliation between action and thrill and metaphysics and philosophy. This movie deserves all the praise and success that it has got. My personal all-time favorite. I never get tired of talking about it till date and love to see it with my friends if I get the chance.",The Matrix

I remember back when I first saw the film the question everyone wanted answered was 'What is the Matrix?'. Nobody was sure what to expect, and as a result the movie was an absolutely mind blowing experience.

513,Jeremy Bristol,"Cool kung fu, but then it ""tries"" to be more and becomes something scary.",6,31 May 2001,"There are definite plot holes in this movie (come on, do you really think that just because you think you're dead you die?).  And the back story makes no sense (why would a computer waste it's precious juice on such an elaborate hoax as the Matrix--if you cut the damn spinal cord, a humans will go nowhere and still generate just as much body heat and electrical impulses--and as expressed in the Terminator, computers have no pity, no remorse, so they wouldn't be sentimental enough to find some way to let people be happy).  Cool kung fu, though.Which brings us to the real reason I don't like Matrix much (6/10): like Michael Bay's Pearl Harbor today, there is a lot of killing in the name of Good (the humans are killing humans to save them, while Bay shows the deaths of many US military personnel in a supposed effort to honor them) without any thought or reflection as to the implications.  Once Lawrence Fishburne says that the humans can be inhabited by the enforcers, it becomes open season on everybody.  This gives the message that slavery is worse than death.  Personally, I've always thought Locke listed the inalienable rights in order of importance--life, liberty, then property. Once you're dead, you can't have any liberties.  It's one thing to give your life for liberty, but it's another thing altogether to have your life taken away for that purpose. There used to be movies where it was debated whether it was even right to kill the bad guys (Casablanca, Lifeboat), now it seems to be open season all over again.",The Matrix

First of all, the bad: some of the performances and dialogue are a bit stilted. Not even the main characters are particularly developed beyond their central archtypes- Trinity and Neo's love story isn't the least bit believable because of this. The final scene is just silly. And the whole film has the Messiah Complex, which has been done and done and done...... Okay, enough haggling. Here's the good: everything else. The whole idea is cool. This just might be the launching film for a whole mythos, like 'A New Hope' and (hopefully) the first Lord of the Rings movie. There are metaphors and analogies here, a lot of them. The Wachowski brothers showed great promise with their very first flick, the terrific 'Bound', and continue to do so here. There are small things that intrigue me- things like the little robots that help with the human-harvesting and look like a cross between insects and surgical instruments. Visually, the movie is nothing short of an unprescedented marvel and has already proven to be one of the most seminal films made in the last couple of decades in that regard. Hugo Weaving is a true find- amazingly creepy as Agent Smith, he absolutely exudes menace and contempt for humanity. The story is rooted in our race's fear of our own creation- technology. Technology has been our salvation. It has allowed the human being- a physically inferior mammal with few natural characteristics to recommend it- to thrive. Cautionary tales that display our fear that it will also be our destruction abound- 'The Matrix' is one of the best. It will be interesting to see how the series develops. It could be as important to the action genre in terms of complete, complex story-telling as it already is visually. One can hope. With the Wachowskis at the helm, there's a good chance.",The Matrix

517,bullions27,A Favorite,10,27 October 2000,"The Matrix is a technical and special FX marvel of unbound lengths. What they have put together here, the scenery, the colors, the lightning, the sets, is a true masterpiece of the sci-fi genre. The story, a bit more serious and exponentially more intelligent than the folly of Phantom Menace released in the same year, does make you think about the privacy of our own world. This question has always been around us, although maybe in a different tone and not as dramatic as how The Matrix brings it out. Are we really monitored and watched by someone? When we purchase by credit card, make a phone call, go on the Internet, what have you, all of those signals broadcast out, are they being monitored? It at least plants a thought in your brain compared to some of the other recent mindless sci-fi films which includes the aforementioned Phantom Menace and Wing Commander. There are a few parts of the movie that were recycled from earlier films. I don't really mind since NEARLY EVERY sci-fi film since the birth of the genre has recycled one of the older concepts at one point or another. It's already a known fact. Tinkering around it however and throwing in your own blend and style is what distinguishes the new from the old.Every character in the film is unique, with the exception of maybe Neo who Keanu expertly plays as another airhead. What I like about the characters is that they work with each other well.  They rely upon each other's individual strengths. Neo could have turned into a one man show easily for the entire film but it took everyone to get him there and he feeds off of that.
I'm glad that this film did so well with the awards and the box-office. It tells you the sci-fi genre, the serious sci-fi, is still alive.",The Matrix

I also think the producers of THE MATRIX haven't done themselves any favours by turning THE MATRIX into a franchiseTo sum up this is a good film .

Though it is popular, The Matrix failed to deliver good performances and great fighting scenes. The story is new in its genre and year. The Matrix was created in 1999, which is similar to 2010's Inception, where the world is not the world itself anymore. There are two worlds, The Matrix and the actual world. The Matrix is where most people live in and the actual world is only for the ones that rebelled. As refreshingly new the plot is, the writers just had to put in some clichés in the film: the protagonist did not die at the end, the bad guys died, some romance, and badass action scenes. Well, I guess that's what all movies have nowadays. But the film have so many flaws in it like the acting, it is the worse ensembled cast I've seen in years. The actual writing isn't bad but the way the actors delivered the lines are just unpleasant. Another flaw is the fighting scenes. I first thought it was because they were moving too fast and that was the point. But as it progresses, the fighting scenes are just cheap! The Matrix offers a new element to its genre and has really great visual effects but failed to deliver on its performances which made the film dropped.",The Matrix

The more I understood, the more difficult it became for me to sleep at night.However its the sequels that ruined the thought provocation and therefore it turned into a trilogy with an ending of good triumphing over evil rather than the enigma that the first installment left.This is about the first and I must say it is captivating. The visuals, the sound, the plot, the theme, motifs, the action and so on.In my English class, we had an assignment. We had to write about something that shaped our perception of the world.

Once Keanneo is unplugged, he joins the resistance in the war against skynet ...ahem, I mean, the machines! It would appear that the resistance is only a handful of people with names that sound like obscure Transformer characters like Cypher, Switch, Apoc, and Dozer. Unfortunately, Flick, Thumper and Molt had already been taken by A Bug's Life the year before this film came out. And of course, the coolest of all these cool orphans is the leader and existential drug dealer is Morpheus. Contrary to what his name suggests, Morpheus cannot actually morph into a character that doesn't induce your eyes to roll. If any film can make you contemplate the very nature of your existence, it is a slam-bang cinematic video game that is much ado about kung fu. But The Matrix is more than just a sci-fi movie. It is the greatest testament to the inherently hollow nature of our existence and every single ineffective punch delivered to the face of an androidish agent emphasizes that. You see, The Matrix has one thing to say about life and one thing only. Technology owns you! I know! Let that one sink in a bit before reading further about how groundbreaking this movie is.Ready? Okay. Every one-liner is delivered with straight-faced sophistication and bloated philosophical pretense! But that's cool! In fact, therein lies the quality of this film.

No wonder.  It's furiously intelligent, very serious but with an undertone of dark comedy that makes it different from all other action movies.  While clearly influenced by movies like BLADE RUNNER and ALIEN/ALIENS, they've also clearly been jazzed by comic books, cyber-science fiction of the William Gibson school, Hong Kong action movies and Japanese anime, as well as classic Hollywood films noir.But while they're clearly influenced by this heady stew, they've stirred into something fresh and original, and provided a back story so rich that dozens of other stories could be set in this same universe without ever getting around to actually doing a sequel to THIS story.  Keanu-bashers will be deeply disappointed, because Reeves is terrific here, as is the rest of the cast, including the ultra-cool Laurence Fishburne.  But the standout performance comes from Hugo Weaving as the head bad guy; it's hard to believe he played the leading role in THE ADVENTURES OF PRISCILLA, QUEEN OF THE DESERT.",The Matrix

That is probably a function of its massive success and cultural impact but it's the truth. Everyone knows what it means when someone leans back and waves their arms in slow motion so those kind of moments of awe were lost on me. The story (outside of the background) is corny and the acting is bad but I can understand why it was seen as important when it came out.

525,Xophianic,One of my favorites,9,2 February 2000,"At first, I wasn't interested in seeing the Matrix. But after hardly hearing any bad reviews for it (and believe me, I hear bad reviews for every movie I enjoy) I decided to give it a try. At first, although I really loved the fights, graphics and characters, the plot confused me. (Anyone confused by the plot at all should go to www.knowthematrix.com and you'll find out everything you could want to know) By the second time I watched it, I really understood it, which made the movie even more enjoyable.I really loved this movie. Just about every character, good or bad, is very interesting and cool. The acting was excellent. Even though I think this was Keanu Reeves at his best, the best acting jobs were done by Laurence Fishburne (Morpheus) and Carrie-Anne Moss (Trinity). Hugo Weaving did an excellent job as Agent Smith and Joe Pantoliano was great as Cypher as well.The plot is one of the best movie plots I've seen in a movie. An accountant by day, computer hacker by night guy suddenly finds out that reality as we know it is fake and that we are actually in a giant computer program run by robots (that we created, of course) in order for them to get power. Not only that, but he finds out that he is one who is, according to prophecy, going to put an end to it. The greatest thing is that you learn things just as Neo does, so you can really relate to his character.My favorite thing about this movie is that no matter how many times you watch it, you will learn more about it. I guarantee this. Some may not like this movie because the plot is too complicated, but I recommend that anyone who enjoys movies should go buy this one right away.",The Matrix

When I came on Cable TV, I decided I would give it another go. I watched the whole thing, and I was thoroughly impressed! I think The Matrix is one of those movies were it must be seen twice to be understood, and to be liked.Thomas Anderson (Keanu Reeves) is a bit of a slacker, selling illegal software on the side under the pseudonym 'Neo' to finance his computer hardware needs. He wants to find someone called Morpheus (Laurence Fishburne). He's searching for the answer to a question. He has no idea where the question came from. But the urge to discover ""What is the Matrix?"" will lead him to places where nothing is what is seems and to people who hope he is The One...Although over-hyped, The Matrix is a largely entertaining sci-fi thriller with an attitude. The action sequences are stunning, the sound is immaculate and the acting is very watchable, Fishburne in particular is amazing as Morpehus.Overall, I strongly recommend The Matrix.

528,MadReviewer,"Everything That ""Phantom Menace"" Wanted To Be (may contain spoilers)",9,16 May 2001,"""The Matrix"", which owes its look and style to modern films (""Blade Runner"", any Hong Kong martial arts movie starring Jet Li), actually tells a mythical story more reminiscent of the tales of Hercules, or of Robin Hood.  Despite its ingenious sci-fi trappings, at its core ""The Matrix"" is a simple tale of good versus evil, David versus Goliath . . . and it introduces its audience to an unexplored, wondrous mythos of murky history.  In the process of telling its tale, ""The Matrix"" hints at a richly plotted past that's never fully defined, but only hinted at with offhanded scraps of dialogue.  In this manner, it introduces a fictional world in many as breathtaking as the original ""Star Wars"" did twenty-two years earlier -- but ""The Matrix"" also tells a compelling story, unlike the more contemporary ""Phantom Menace"". The hero of ""The Matrix"" is Neo (Keanu Reeves), who at first glance is just a geeky software programmer at a dull and boring company, looking to earn a paycheck just like everybody else. At home, though, in the small hours of the night, he's a computer hacker, and a good one.   His hacking activities draw the attention of two cyberpunk iconoclasts:  Morpheus (Laurence Fishburne), who exudes Zen-Master cool; and Trinity (Carrie-Anne Moss), a leather-wearing femme fatale. Morpheus and Trinity reveal a profound truth about the world to the disbelieving Neo: the world doesn't exist. Everything that seems real is in fact a forced form of virtual reality, designed to make the people of the world blindly subservient to an alien-run ""system."" Morpheus and his group of cyber-rebels want to bring this system -- ""The Matrix"" -- down, and firmly believe that Neo is the messiah-like ""One"" who can lead his rebels to victory. The look of ""The Matrix"" is absolutely fantastic.  Taking a page out of literary works like William Gibson's ""Mona Lisa Overdrive"", the film blends film noir with ""dirty"" high tech -- there's nothing bright and shiny in ""The Matrix""; nothing to suggest the happy future of ""The Jetsons"".  What's left is a gritty world where both intellect and imagination rule. From this world, directors Larry and Andy Wachowski create an epic comic-book conflict where the conflict between good and evil is blown up into slick, stylized, spectacular proportions.  The special effects, which includes CGI, traditional animation techniques, model work, and martial arts wire work, are all blended to make jaw-dropping action sequences . . . and to enhance the story.  (The opening scene with Trinity alone makes the film worth watching).  I don't know if anybody really knows what cyberspace will ultimately look like, but I hope when the time comes when people can immerse themselves in a world of virtual reality, it looks as cool as it does in ""The Matrix"".  The performances, for the most part, are perfect for the film.  Keanu Reeves doesn't exactly flex his acting chops as the impassive Neo, but the low-key approach seems appropriate for the role.  As Morpheus, Laurence Fishburne is sensational, making the character a perfect mix of a martial arts master, a cryptic philosopher, and a full-blown action hero.  Fishburne never raises his voice once during the film, but he has so much presence and confidence, he still comes across as the most commanding, authoritative character in the entire movie.  Hugo Weaving is also impressive as the main villain, Agent Smith, although by the end of the film he's glowered and barked exasperated orders so many times, it looks like he's watched Tommy Lee Jones in ""The Fugitive"" once too often.  The biggest waste of a character, however, is Carrie-Anne Moss and Trinity, who still shines despite the criminal under-use of her character.  Trinity absolutely sets the incredible tone of ""The Matrix"" in the opening scene, showing off her potential as possibly one of the greatest female action heroes in cinematic history . . . and then she's immediately relegated to supporting character status the instant Neo and Morpheus show up.  Memo to the Wachowski Brothers: Actually USE Trinity in the ""Matrix"" sequels; it'd be nice to see her live up to what was hinted at in the first film.""The Matrix"" presents a number of interesting concepts, ranging from the philosophical nature of existence itself to the pure adrenaline rush of combat in the cybernetic world.  (Although, it's slightly disappointing to see that despite all the brilliant originality of `The Matrix', wars are still apparently fought with mundane nine-millimeter handguns and AK-47s.) These concepts alone would make `The Matrix' a terrific movie, but they're presented with such panache, the film rockets into the realm of the all-time greats.  `The Matrix' is nearly everything one could hope for from a sci-fi blockbuster.

531,ToldYaSo,"Not a bad film, even with the ""Keanu"" Factor",7,24 April 1999,"I had a bit of reluctance to see ""The Matrix"". I had figured it for one of those run-of-the-mill stupid sci-fi films without a brain and all special effects and didn't give it much thought after that. The reasons were simple.1.  ""Matrix"", ""13th Floor"" and ""Existenz"" are all films that play with ""alternate realities"" and none of their previews made me want to see them much, with ""The Matrix"" perhaps tugging at my wallet just a bit.2.  Lawrence Fishburne pulled me in to ""Event Horizon"" which was a pretty bad film that I didn't expect ""Matrix"" to be any better than, and I still haven't forgiven him for that.3.  Perhaps the strongest factor of all, Keanu Reeves, not being a bastion of good taste or strong acting ability, whom the public can stand if he simply can manage to not suck too badly. He brings a fairly robotic element to all of his roles that may be appreciated in another century and make him the actor of the millennium.4.  Lots of teenagers were raving about it. The same kind of people whom I suspect are already lined up for the ""Phantom Menace"" which is the clearest indication and proof of a loser with time on their hands as could ever be devised. Lawn chairs + Laptops + 6 weeks = Loser.The reason I caved in to see it, however, was based on some positive reviews from some reliable and trustworthy sources, and a good friend whom I don't see much was eager to see it. My good friend Kalev also took the time to relate some of the finer points of the film with great enthusiasm, and so I promptly decided to see it. But most importantly of all, the Wachowski Brothers were behind it, and I thoroughly enjoyed their film ""Bound"", so there you have it.The film is a visually stunning, no contest. The acting is passable and the dialogue is just on the edge of being too expository but the story's elements are at times so complex, this measure can be forgiven quickly. This is a film for the Marital Arts fan. The fight scenes are fantastic and executed with originality.The story line owes a great debt to ""Invasion Of The Body Snatchers"", which if you enjoyed the Matrix you should check out one or both of the first two versions only. But as one of my ""computer g_ _ k"" friends has informed me, ""The Matrix"" writers really did their homework and those aspects held up well. Which is a factor that could easily get past me, but it's always nice to find out that the writers cared enough to do their research. This film almost assuredly will have you trying to figure out the finer points in the parking lot.",The Matrix

535,Tresix,"The longest, most expensive GAP commercial ever made!",4,14 August 2000,"Okay, I know a lot of heat is going to come my way for saying this, but I'm ready.  So, here goes:  I did NOT like this movie!  I'm not saying that it's terrible, just that it didn't move me the way that it seems to have touched some people's lives.  The perpetually perplexed Keanu Reeves is Thomas aka Neo, an office grunt/computer hacker who is recruited by the mysterious Morpheus (Laurence Fishburne)to free humanity from enslavement by machines.  It seems that the world that we are living in is all an illusion provided by free-thinking computers who are using people as batteries (Can I be an ENERGIZER?  They last longer).  The only thing standing between humanity and totally servitude are the Agents, led by the soulless Agent Smith (played by Hugo Weaving in a good performance).  Agents are the only ones who seem to have the ability to alter the reality around them, making them able to do fantastic things like dodge bullets and the like.  Neo is shown that he, too, can alter the world around him when Morpheus jumps from one roof to another a block away (to which Keanu gives his signature line: ""Whoa!"").  He is then trained in hand-to-hand combat, spaceship-piloting and the use of high-calibre automatic firearms. This seems to provide the film with its strong suit:  Dazzling stunts and special effects.  However, I found the story to be just a little too pretentious.  I realize that there is a lot of symbolism within the story (most of it cribbed from the New Testament), but, while watching the movie and getting the messages of the movie, I half expected to see signposts appear saying CAUTION! METAPHORS AHEAD!  I did get a kick, however, out of the street intersections mentioned in the film where all of the ""exits"" were:  They are actually streets in Chicago, the Wachowski brothers' (and my) hometown.  As I said before, the special effects and stuntwork are fabulous.  In fact, I thought the film should have received Oscar nominations for its Art Direction and Costumes.  Beyond that, I thought THE MATRIX was nothing more than the longest, most expensive GAP commercial ever made.  For a better handling of this type of material, I suggest two films that could be combined to make a better MATRIX:  THE LAST DRAGON (for it's metaphysical message and martial arts action) and DARK CITY (for it's handling of a scary fantasy city under siege). Okay, let the brickbats and/or bouquets fly . . . !",The Matrix

I remember, almost instantly, becoming 'that guy who has not seen it yet', and I think that's part of the reason I didn't get around to watching it quickly.You can't survive to watch this movie without spoilers.The entire movie is built around a single concept, and that is a big reveal. It is also a huge pop-culture reference, so I almost want to hint at it, but it isn't the point.

541,paul-nemecek,Take the Red Pill!,10,6 July 2018,"Really good films often work on multiple levels. The best art is art that is profound enough to make us think, yet abstract enough to allow for multiple interpretations. The Wachowski brothers' film The Matrix does that and more.Keanu Reeves plays a computer whiz named Neo. When Neo starts getting messages from his computer, his life is turned upside down. A woman named Trinity contacts him because the great cyber-rebel Morpheus (Laurence Fisburne) is looking for him. When Morpheus and Neo finally meet, Morpheus explains that reality as we know it is a cyber-illusion. The ""machine"" has taken over the world and is literally feeding on human energy, while the humans are oblivious having been placated by their virtueless virtual reality.One approach to this film is to see it as an excellent example of postmodern art and as an analyis of postmodern society. Our first clue to this interpretation is the book Neo hides things in-entitled Simulacra and Simulation. The concept of simulacra refers to the blurring of the line between reality and fiction-a copy for which there is no original. If we see The Matrix through this lens, the film becomes an interesting parable about modern society. This blurring of the line is a common theme these days (EDTV, Celebrity, Mad City, The Truman Show, Wag the Dog), and this film is an engaging addition to a growing body of work. Invite your favorite philosophy professor or social theorist and you can spend a few hours afterwards discussing phenomenology and the social construction of reality.At another level, we can approach The Matrix by analyzing ""the machine."" If you just got back from a weekend of training with the Michigan Militia, the machine can be seen as intrusive government that is manipulating the media to blind us to reality. For those of us who lean a bit left of center, the machine can be seen as the capitalist world system that exploits the poor, and ravages the impoverished nations of the earth, but keeps us plugged in by fantasies of the good life.For the less political, there are a number of religious and spiritual themes sprinkled throughout the movie. Morpheus and Neo end up looking a bit like John the Baptist and a Messiah figure respectively-including the proclamations by Morpheus that Neo is ""the one"" (which is an anagram of Neo). In other scenes, Morpheus comes across like a New Age Zen master, or Yoda with an attitude.If all this work at multiple meanings makes your head hurt, the final alternative is to approach the film as a well-written action/adventure science-fiction film. There are some outstanding special effects and some interesting action scenes. In the end, it is the complexity of the multidimensional story that makes this movie work. A definite thumbs up for one of the more interesting stories so far this year.",The Matrix

Beyond that still is the best cyberfilm to come out of the 90's. In fact I would go so far as to say that it's the best cyberfilm since Bladerunner. (which is a pre-mainstream cyber awareness film to begin with) and even though I like it, I can't with good conscience include J.Mnemonic as a good cyberfilm. The f/x, story line, and cinematography is fluid and beautiful. Laurence Fishburne is as always subtle and larger that life as Morpheus.

People who saw this in year 2000 or later they probably think ""what.. i've seen this, basic crap again"". I think that makers of this movie were aware of that at the time, they just wanted to make their thing and knew it would be copied later in other movies. Thats probably why Matrix 2 & 3 were so .. well, so different. If I understood correctly they had them written long ago before starting, they might have had to blow up some scenes to get any attention.I think Matrix is the Star Wars of 90's. Don't you think Star Wars ideas were copied in many movies after that? ..and I didn't really like those prequels, third was ""okay"". Good bless Jar Jar ;)",The Matrix

No, they didn't deserve to be tortured in the school, no one does, and instead of massacre they just should have make their tormentors to taste their own medicine in long and repeated intervals - but gaaawd, the duo's taste was awful. Cooler-than-thou posing and ""action"" while bystanders are brutally killed - that's the plot. High-tech imagery is ugly as hell - costumes, sets and photography look AWFUL.

545,HollisWoods,Evolutionary for its time!,8,2 February 2021,"I think a reason, of the many, that allows The Matrix to stand out is it's great balance of action and philosophy. In depth analyses and long essays can be written about the movie and what it means to us in real life. This film has helped influence the idea that our own universe is in it's own matrix, that life is a simulation, and we're all computer generated beings. I've taken college courses in philosophy and the concept of this film has been used to spark in-class discussions on what is existence, what it means to exist, is there a higher power, ect. But that sort of thinking isn't required to enjoy the movie. It is, at its core, and action thriller. There are great fighting sequences, there are loads of suspenseful moments, and it ends in a classic ""good defeats evil"" sort of way.What really sets the film apart and what the movie is so famous for is the revolutionary graphics and effects. Sure, decades later, the graphics might've aged a bit, but you can't deny the impact it made to the industry. The iconic freezeframe-roundabout thing has been spoofed so many times. I mean, how cool was the ""backbend to dodge bullets"" moment! In fact, that entire ending sequence, from the moment they left to save Morpheus until the moment Neo defeats Agent Smith, was the most extraordinary sequence of a film you'll probably ever see in an action movie. It wasn't just the epic battles themselves, but the special effects and how the entire sequence was edited - it was cinematography at its best.The entire way the Matrix was filmed and edited can attribute to the high quality and uniqueness of the film. You see it best whenever Morpheus is teaching Neo the ways of the world, so to speak. Through unique camera angles and clever transitions paired with the special effects, the concept of the matrix seems real and almost believable and alive. I don't know too much about behind the scenes tidbits, but I imagine for any aspiring film makers, the Matrix is worth a study.The Matrix is the movie that made Keanu Reeves an A-list action star. His good looks and smooth voice made him an irreplaceable Neo, And hearing him say ""I know Kung Fu"" in a Keanu kind of way gets me every time. It's really hard not to like Keanu, especially given what went on behind the scenes. Around the release of the film, he experienced some heart breaking tragedies. But he never stopped for a second - when life knocked him down, he got back up again. On a more positive note, he donated at least a half of his salary from the Matrix, which was millions of dollars, to members from the special effects and editing teams - a well deserved donation to a probably underpaid crew that helped make the movie as great as it is.Watching the first installment, it's quite clear that there is a presence of extensive lore of the universe that reaches beyond a singular film. While the Matrix is well written as a stand alone movie, there are plenty of opportunities to extend your knowledge on the universe - whether it be the sequels, the anime, video games, or comics. I will personally just watch the Matrix over and over rather than broaden my horizon, but knowing there's more just adds to the impressive world building that the film already achieved.",The Matrix
546,Rhino Rover,Thought provoking,9,20 February 2000,"I have to be honest and say that when this movie came out in the theatres, I had absolutely no interest in seeing it. And a big part of it was because of Keanu Reeves. But I kept hearing how wonderful this movie was and this was at about the same time when Star Wars: The Phantom Menace came out. Now mind you, Star Wars wasn't that great either but the hype surrounding that movie promised, at the very least, an entertaining time. I recently had a conversation about movies with my sister and her boyfriend and when they found out I still hadn't seen this movie, I was soundly chastised for it and was subsequently ""summoned"" to come over to their place to view it on DVD. And you know what? I'm glad they did.        The story takes place in the future where technology has taken over the world. In fact, Earth as you know it has been transformed into a technological play ground where reality and fantasy are so intertwined that it is almost impossible to tell where one ends and the other begins. We meet Neo (Keanu Reeves) at the beginning and find out quickly that this quiet young man is actually a brilliant computer hacker. He is quickly recruited by a band of secrete underground rebels who hope to free the world from the clutches of technology. It seems that computers in the future have become self-aware and have taken over the world by enslaving humans and these rebels lead by Morpheous (Laurence Fishburne) are hoping that Neo is the ""Chosen-One"" to free them from this slavery.        I have to say that the special effects are wonderful. I've seen quite a few special effects intensive movies this year and The Matrix comes out very near the top. The only other one that I thought was better is Star Wars but that was to be expected when 95% of it was computer generated and George Lucas is backing it. The Matrix comes very close and in fact in some places out performs Star Wars in the creativity department.        I mentioned earlier that I stayed away from this movie because of Keanu Reeves and I'm sure many of you will agree that he is not in the same echelon as Tom Cruise or Kevin Spacey but I was pleasantly surprised here. He did do a fairly good job as Neo but part of it was the fact that he did do his own stunts and brought a sense of believability to his character. What made this movie even better was the rest of the cast, especially Laurence Fishburne. He had a lot of thought provoking dialogue in this movie and his portrayal of the rebel leader and mentor to Neo was well depicted...although it did seem somewhat similar to Yoda and Luke Skywalker. The one actor that I really did enjoy was Joe Pantoliano as Cypher. He played the laid back, yet somewhat cynical rebel very well and when he turns on his comrades his performance becomes even more enjoyable.        If you choose to see this movie, keep in mind that this movie is primarily about ideas. Focusing on plot flow will only ruin the movie's intentions. I have seen other reviews where people commented on the laws of physics or other such scientific evaluations and to be honest, this is only a movie. Its intention is to portray some idea(s), not to educated the public about energy transfer or the laws of relativity. This movie makes quite a statement about what reality is and how we perceive it so if any of you are looking to see a thought provoking movie with some pretty impressive special effects, go see this movie.

547,cyberknight,A Movie with Different Layers,10,13 August 2008,"Like ""Blade Runner"", the ""Matrix"" trilogy has at least two different levels of story. Both are evident, but we, at first, only see the first and less important, which is the Matrix itself and the man-against-machine war. The second level, which is the central plot of the whole thing, is so obvious that it becomes invisible.If you liked this movie more than the sequel, ""Matrix: Reloaded"", then you, like almost everyone else, didn't understand it. If you are feeling bad about that, don't worry, it took me almost eight years to finally understand it, too! Many people liked this first part, the rest hated it, and both didn't understand it. Interestingly enough, the ones that hated it were closer to understanding it than those that liked it. People that didn't like the ""Matrix"" trilogy always talk about the ""shallow story"" and the ""cheap philosophy"". As much as they are right about the cheap philosophy, they are complete and absolutely wrong about the shallow story. The ""pseudo-philosophic junk"" is, actually, junk, but a very important part of the story, and that is so clear in this first part of the trilogy that no one actually realized it. It happens because, taken alone, ""The Matrix"" is just a fantasy movie, placed some time in the future.The key to realize the greatness of the ""Matrix"" trilogy is accepting that it is a science fiction, not a fantasy movie. With that in mind, you can find the real villain of the trilogy, then everything will make sense, including the things that make no sense at all in a science fiction movie, like Neo's skills, both inside and outside the Matrix. The really interesting thing is that the villain openly shows its evilness in ""Reloaded"", it even explains its reason to do the things it does, but we promptly forgive or forget it! And pay a lot of attention to the dialogs at the very ending, in ""Matrix: Revolutions"", don't be deceived or misled by the background, because they present the final results of the main struggle of the trilogy and you will realize who is the winner.So, follow the white rabbit and find out who is the real villain in the ""Matrix"" trilogy. After that, you will see that almost all speeches in it have two completely different meanings, one that supports a weak futuristic cloak-and-dagger flick, with lots of ""cool"", but unimportant Greek-and-whatever references, and another that leads to a much darker reality, which will make you love the whole trilogy, or more properly, the trilogy as a whole, not only this first installment.",The Matrix

I went in expecting an all out action fest. So i left the cinema in a state of ""was that it?"" But on second viewing, it all changed. I began to appreciate the actual story, something i missed first time around. The plot is as deep and surreal as you can get, and the action is really just the icing on the cake. Few and far between, the fight scenes, gun play scenes, are all fantastic. Edited sharply, and being inventive with the visuals,using slo-mo, then speeding up the frame. and it works wonders. The actors look cool enough, and there is plenty of room left to boost their characters, which it will hopefully do in the following two movies.

A truly original and unique film going experience with mind bending action, the Wachowskis bring the first of their mind bending trilogy to the screen. Philosophical at its very core that leads one to believe that this ground breaking film is more than just a simple action film. Highly original in its story and well acted by its principal players is a must see for any fan of film. One of those films that must not only be viewed but experience by the viewer. Reeves and Fishburne fit into their roles respectively and do a masterful job of bringing the heroism, suspense and intrigue to the forefront. Reeves who isn't known for his stellar performances, really outdoes himself and what may go down as his most iconic and famous role of his career.

562,critic-22,One of the greatest movies of all time and WHY!,9,30 June 1999,"When I went to watch The Matrix I thought the special effects were going to be the selling point in the movie... gladly I was wrong. I found out to my surprise that the story and the psychological emotional elements of the story were profound and so thought provoking. The Story (psychologically) you need to think!1) The actual idea and conception of the Matrix is really frightening to the extent that we begin to see that humans who create technology then are enslaved by it(much better than Terminator 2 in storyline). This reminds me of our present situation where computers and genetic engineering is slowly changing how we live in 1999. Science is slowly making us slaves and we are doing nothing about it, we don't even care or notice it but accept it as progress. This movie is an early or late warning signal - will anyone take notice?!2) This movie is about the bible and how Christ saves us from the demons (the men in black with sunglasses). We see birth and incarnation, prophecies of the coming messiah and the search for this messiah. We see sacrificial love and ultimate betrayal (Judas) and people in sin but do not realize it. The fact that many people miss this plot twist in the movie makes me feel very very sad and proves that people are deluded and have not got a working or spiritual knowledge of the bible and what Christ did for humanity. The bringing down of the divine to the enslaved earth. If these points do not create any form of emotions I feel sorry for humanity in general.Rating 10/10PS If you liked this movie which makes you think,  also watch: Total Recall(1990), The Usual Suspects(1995) and particularly Vertigo(1958) by Alfred Hitchcock and ask yourself the question;  where do dreams and nightmares start and end?",The Matrix

Are you willing to fight the evil or stand back and enjoy your comforts in life, while you are being manipulated by satanic agents who want to keep the status quo? For me and many people this is a BIG concern upon how technology is being used to manipulate people, and this theme continues with advance uses of genetic engineering.

568,Skeletors_Hood,"Great philosophy, not just a thrill ride.",10,9 November 2001,"The Matrix is a stunning, fast paced movie with lots of great special effects, high action, and a great soundtrack.But...is that all it is?No.  It isn't.When I listen to people talk about this movie, or read reviews by people who don't like it, the main problem they seem to have is the the plot, which they claim is mind-numbing, inaccessible, or just plain dumb.  They claim that the reason the movie is so popular is because if the special effects.Those who make these claims are just a little clueless, and the true art of storytelling is lost on them.Here's why.  Every story that we see on screen, read in a book or on the web has been told before in one fashion or another.  ""Jurassic Park"" is nothing more than a retelling of ""Frankenstein"" when you get right down to it. What catches our attention is when the story is re-told in such a different light that we like the retelling without really being called back to an earlier version.  The ""Jurassic Park example can work again for this point.  No one sees it as another retelling of ""Frankenstein"" at all, or at least, they don't dwell on the issue.  Shakespeare didn't create any stories....he borrowed from other texts, used other sources, and used words to his advantage.  The whole thing involves what is called ""intertextuality"", a term that I won't go into here, but is what I am trying to explain in the brief example of ""Jurassic Park.""Okay, stop yawning.Now, the Matrix has done the same thing, and what is funny is that very, very few people have recognized the major source of the story ( I wonder if the writers really know ).  I have heard that it is supposed to be Christian themed, and while there is some imagery in that respect, like a character named Trinity, Neo's death and rebirth at the end of the movie, the ship's name, etc. etc. etc., the list can go on.  But it has nothing to do with the story, which borrows very heavily from a philosophy written by Plato, of all people, back when the years were still labeled as BC.Plato wrote a philosophy, the actual name escapes me, but I keep hearing it referred to as ""The Cave.""  In this philosophy on the workings of a society, Plato stated that if you were to take four people from the day they were born, tie them to chairs so that their heads cannot move, and place them in the back of a cave where they cannot see the opening, nor have any daylight. They only have contact with each other.  Now, on the wall that they are facing, they can see shadows moving, be it a shadow puppet play, or whatever you can imagine, but all they see are those shadows.  You leave them in this cave for 20 years.  The only life that they know is the chair, and the playing of shadows on the wall.  They will not know the shadows are merely shadows, nor will they know the idea of freedom, and they will now know anything of the real world.  Then, you release one man, let him wander the world for awhile.  He sees that the world isn't just shadows on a wall, etc etc.  If you put him back in the cave, he will not view the shadows the same way that he once did.  He will also try to enlighten the other three that the images on the wall are only shadows, and that there is a beautiful and colorful world outside their cave.  But they will not believe him, and will even begin to see him as a blasphemer, and an enemy.WHEW!!That's the basic story in the Matrix.  Neo has been removed from the cave, and has seen the real world, and now knows he has been seeing shadows his entire life, and his mission is to make humanity realize that they are seeing shadows as well, but until that time, he will be regarded as an enemy by those still inside the cave.  The agents are the keepers of the cave, and the Matrix itself is the shadows that we see.  When you see this connection, the story can make more sense to those who can't quite understand it.And so by blending old, old stories with modern filming techniques and great acting by all involved and fast paced action, there is something to be said about this movie being a work of art, because it truly is.",The Matrix
569,MinorityReporter,"Immensely entertaining, intriguingly philosophical and just about one of the best films ever made!",10,2 December 2005,"Writing a review of The Matrix is a very hard thing for me to do because this film means a lot to me and therefore I want to do the film justice by writing a good review. To tell the truth the first time I saw the film I was enamored by the effects. I remember thinking to myself that this was one of the most visually stunning films I had ever seen in my life. Also having always been a comic book fan and a fan of films that were larger than life, the transitional element of the story was very appealing to me and this probably heightened my enjoyment of the film very much. It wasn't until some time later (and after having seen the film a few times more) that I started to think about the film. I recognized the Christian elements quite quickly but it wasn't until I wrote an actual 15-page essay on the film that I tapped into some of the philosophical and religious elements and that made me appreciate the film even more. I won't say that I have recognized all elements because the film is quite literally packed with them.Acting wise the film works excellently. I won't say that there aren't any issues because there are but overall the acting is pretty flawless. Keanu Reeves plays the main character, Neo, or Thomas A. Anderson and while he is not the perfect actor I think he does a pretty good job in The Matrix (and the sequels). He doesn't have the longest of lines which was probably a deliberate choice from the directors and it works because this gives him a better opportunity to work on posture and facial expressions and I must say that overall his body language is very good. Very clear and well defined. Laurence Fishbourne plays Neo's mentor Morpheus and he does an excellent job of it. His lines flow with a certain confidence and style that makes his character somewhat unique and interesting. Carrie-Anne Moss does a good job as well and succeeds in looking both cool and sexy in her leather outfit. Joe Pantoliano, a critically underrated actor does a brilliant job of bringing his character, Cypher, to life. I can't say much about him because his character is pretty essential to the plot and I certainly don't wan't to spoil it for anyone. Gloria Foster appears in a relatively small role that will have greater significance in the following films and she does a very good job. The best acting is provided by Hugo Weaving, however, in his portrayal of Agent Smith. It is really something to watch him act out the changes in his character. Agent Smith gains some human traits like anger, sense of dread, hate and eventually even a sly sense of humor (mostly in the sequels). Two thumbs way up to Weaving who has created one of the finest screen villains of all time.Effects wise the film is simply stunning and it deservedly was awarded the Oscar for best effects (and was regrettably cheated out of a nomination in the Best Film category) ahead of even Star Wars. The reason that I think The Matrix deserves the Oscar for best effects is simply that the effects in The Matrix are more innovative than the ones in Star Wars. Just take a look at how many times the effects have been spoofed and you'll probably agree. The effects also help in the symbolism of the film and in creating a very dystopian atmosphere not unlike the one seen in Blade Runner and this works brilliantly. The film looks beautiful at all times and today 6 years later (my God has it already been 6 years?) the effects still hold their ground against new science fiction films. Add the effects to the brilliant editing and you have a visual masterpiece on your hands. Very well done.The reason that I think The Matrix is more reviewable than pretty much any other film is the story and the philosophical and religious elements of the story because with every viewing I catch something I didn't see the previous time I watched it. Without spoiling the film I think I can mention a few of the more obvious elements. Obviously the film draws on the Messiah myth as Neo is a clear reference to Jesus with the analogy of his name (Neo = one, as in The One) but also hidden in his other name, Thomas A. Anderson. The first part of his last name, Anderson comes from the Greek Andros meaning ""man"" and combine this with the second part of his last name ""son"" and add a little creativity you will come up with the combination ""son of man"" which was a title Jesus came up with about himself. Also the first time we meet Neo a man calls him (and I quote): ""You're my Saviour man. My own personal Jesus Christ."" It doesn't get any more obvious than that. Aside from the Christianic elements the film also gets its inspiration from Budhism, Gnosticism (Gnosis = knowledge) but is also inspired by Plato and his analogy of the Cave and Jean Baudrillard's essay, Simulacra and Simulations. Explaining these elements would make this review go on forever so aside from mentioning them I will not comment on them further.To all the people who doubt the profound nature of The Matrix I can only give one advice: Free your mind and watch the film again. You won't regret it. If I had to choose a favorite all time film my choice would probably fall on either The Matrix (obviously I don't expect people to agree but if they do thats great) or The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King and I recommend it to all fans of sci-fi and people who like philosophy.10/10 - on my top 3 of best films.",The Matrix
570,dexter-3,Quite a ride...,8,25 October 1999,"""The Matrix"" is an absolute thrill-a-minute ride with a twist: there's a plot and some depth behind the superb special effects.  The film is highly entertaining, provocative, is generally well-acted (Reeves does a great job UNDERPLAYING his role here), and it boasts a terrific villain in ""Mr. Smith,"" whose monotone barely disguises his loathing for humans.  The producer of ""The Phantom Menace"" should take note of the use and quality of the fx here, and perhaps get a clue for his next film.  In particular, the martial arts scene with Fishburne and Keanu is not new, but is sharp and nicely integrated into the plot.My main issues with the film (as also noted by Roger Ebert) are that it has a partially derivative screenplay (see ""Dark City,"" the writings of Philip Farmer and Harlan Ellison, and certain stock action films), and that the climax, while exciting, is predictable and well-worn, and implies that the screenwriters and story editors simply ran out of ideas.  This leaves the viewer unsatisfied with the traditional ""good guy v. bad guy"" fight that leaves the intellectual issues raised earlier unresolved.  That said, ""The Matrix"" is great entertainment and a definite ""big screen"" film.  An ""8.""",The Matrix
571,bobbyelliott,An original movie... for science fiction fans,10,12 June 1999,"The Matrix is a science fiction movie that will mainly be enjoyed by fans of the genre. But if you like serious SF then you'll love The Matrix. The film has two main strands - there's the main storyline which is quite intricate and complex and then there's the action movie-within-a-movie. The plot is intelligent and mostly plausible but quite dense so you have to listen carefully. The action sequences are surprisingly good thanks to superb special effects. Don't be put off by the Kung-Fu comments. Yes, it does have this type of fighting but it's sensible in its context and the effects are *outstanding*. So an intelligent, thought-provoking, thrilling movie - but don't expect your granma' to like it - or your girlfriend unless she's into sci-fi or kung-fu. But for those who are then this is a top movie. I gave it 8/10.",The Matrix
572,FilmCreature,FilmCreature reviews 'The Matrix',8,6 February 2008,"Keanu Reeves, who has been dubbed as one of the worst actors of our time, is actually extremely well-cast in 'The Matrix', one of 1999's most enjoyable and imaginative thrillers. He plays Thomas Anderson, a young man who lives his life in computers under the hacker pseudonym Neo. He feels an emptiness inside of him, a cold darkness that he cannot explain but he is determined to find out its source. His journey begins when he is contacted by the voluptuous hacker Trinity (yes, *the* Trinity who cracked the IRS d-base). He presents her with a question.""What is the Matrix?"" As it turns out, The Matrix is the very world we live in, which essentially lives up to be one big computer program whose purpose is to serve a rogue A.I. that harvests our corpses for fuel. Fun, fun, fun. Carrie-Anne Moss, one of my favorite, down-to-earth actresses, is terrific as the sexy human agent Trinity. She seems like someone you would fear but then run to for protection a second later. Reeves is a great hero as Neo. Laurence Fishburne took his performance from this better-than-average sci-fi and directly copied to into a smarter, better movie, titled 'Akeelah and the Bee'. He plays Morpheus, who is essentially Neo's Obi-Wan; a wise, methodical, prophet who happens to tote huge guns and the strength to break handcuffs (and bones).The fight sequences are glorious fun, the film is rarely predictable, and the performances are tuned just right. Even though it gets weighed down with clichés near the end, 'The Matrix' is well worth seeing (it visually LOOKS fantastic), or even owning a copy.3/4",The Matrix
573,SpaaceMonkee,The Benchmark of Stylistic Action,8,29 November 2020,"The Matrix was one of the movies that defined my childhood moviegoing. Revisiting it some two decades after its release (makes me feel a little old and) cements its status as one of the definitive films of the action genre.The grievances first: The dialogue can be corny and the arc of the plot certainly displays some not-so-subtle messianic trends. And, the acting often veers towards a rather blank, stock-character type.And now, the achievements: The Matrix unquestionably set the bar for every 21st century action film that followed. Bullet time, slow-mo, and the highly stylized fight scenes each spawned countless imitators. Though the techniques entered the wider mainstream afterwards, no movie since has matched the Matrix in terms of pure style. Without any spoilers, I believe the lobby scene is possibly the most perfectly stylish action scene ever shot.On plot, I will say little. The movie does a fantastic job of raising some deep, existential questions, but I will not rate it a masterpiece on those grounds, as many of the reviews seem to do. Raising a legitimate question and saying something worthwhile in response are two very different things. Had the series stopped here and left the answering to the viewer, I would give the film a 9. But, the series continued, and taking its sequels into consideration, it's clear that we won't be finding coherent answers here.Overall, it's a masterpiece of late 90s cinema and an action film that set the bar for everything that followed, but it's also a film that fell victim to the idea of a series. The Matrix, once and for all, should have ended with Zach de la Rocha screaming the viewer off into the credits.",The Matrix
574,Ryan-007,Brilliant...period,10,18 October 1999,"Wow.  This movie completely blew me away.  It was nothing of what I expected it to be at all.  This movie took on a whole different angle than what I supposed, and I never took it seriously.  The visuals are the best I have ever seen.  The plot is so visually stunning, and so engrossing, it is hard not to like this movie.  I love it.  The best action movie I have seen in a long time that actually has a plot that sticks.  The whole machines take over the word thing has been done before (The Terminator), but not in such fashion.  The ""Matrix"" is a great push which I found very creative.  The acting is top notch in my opinion, not once did I not feel someone giving it their all.  Great detail and Agent Smith makes one very good villain.

576,Clive-Silas,"Go see it, but *not* the best sci-fi film ever.",6,2 January 2001,"A lot of people have rated it as the best movie they've ever seen. I ask all those people to start thinking of other great movies of the past, even if you restrict yourself to science fiction movies - think of the characters you fell in love with, and the performers who brought it all to life - then try to imagine some of those actors, those characters appearing in equivalent parts in The Matrix. Think of Harrison Ford's Rick Deckard (from Blade Runner) as either Neo or Morpheous. Think of Sigourney Weaver's Ellen Ripley (from the Alien series). Think of the witty dialogue and excellent character interaction of writers Joss Whedon or JJ Abrams. You can think up your own examples. Then compare it to what we've actually got in The Matrix. It just doesn't stand up.Storyline: You can see that at the script stage, the concept works very well as being a marvellous ""coup de cinema"", when Neo wakes up and the ""real world"" is revealed for the first time. But the advance publicity told you all that before you even got to see the movie. I don't believe in picking holes in plot points, unless they rely too heavily on coincidence - it's not an easy thing to build a foolproof scenario to achieve the high concept you have for the movie. But I will say that generally in any movie you are supposed to be on the side of the good guys. In this situation, however, all I could see was that Morpheous and his friends were determined to wake the whole world up to the fact that they are living in an enormous dank sewer, under a gunmetal sky, with apparently no other living creatures or vegetation on which to survive. Or they could stay in The Matrix (what we call ""real life"") and remain ""slaves"". I was with Cypher's (Joe Pantoliano) side all the way - better fake steak that's better than the real thing, than physically real but otherwise totally unappetising food which resembled some kind of edible snot.Regarding the action, I have two points to make: a) If I see one more helicopter flying alongside a glass skyscraper, so help me.... b) There is such a thing as ""too good"". I originally wrote how pathetic it was that high speed fight scenes were so obviously speed ed up film. I now know that in fact the film wasn't speed ed up, but Reeves and Fishburne were moving so fast that it looked like it was. A little slower and they'd have had ten times the impact.Here was a film where the dialogue could have done with some serious polishing by a script-doctor. Imagine, if you will, if Sean Connery had been cast as Morpheous - can you see him saying the bland dull-as-ditchwater stuff that Fishburne was trying to make so much of? No of course not, and Connery would have made sure of it by calling in his favourite script doctors (like he did for 'The Rock'). Why didn't the studio step in? Did they make a mistake and think they had the Coen brothers instead of the Wachowski brothers? There was no characterisation whatsoever - we didn't know anything more about Morpheous, Trinity or Neo at the end than we knew at the beginning. About the only fully rounded character was Cypher (which was why he got all my sympathy). Trinity's interactions with Neo, in particularly, needed to be ten times better to achieve anything like the meaning and emotional fulfilment for the audience that that relationship merited.The remainder of the cast did their best with poor material. Keanu Reeves did what he always does. I don't know what it is, but it isn't acting. Reeves is a star because he infallibly picks smash-hits to be in (Speed, The Devil's Advocate, The Matrix), so they keep sending him scripts. But I cannot think of a single Keanu Reeves star-vehicle which wouldn't have been better with anybody else who just had some presence and charisma.I'd like to deal with the deficient morality of the film. It's very easy to say ""It's an action movie, so lots of bad guys will need to be killed"", but 'Terminator 2' for example, is a very violent action film which has a moral sense. In 'The Matrix' not one of the bad guys are killed (they are only software constructs, after all), but lots and lots of innocent policemen and security guards are just wiped out, and, what is more, by the supposed good guys! Morpheous tries to explain this away by telling Neo to regard every human as an enemy, but this doesn't expiate the wholesale bloodbath which occurs when Neo and Trinity are just trying to get into a building. Why wasn't that sequence put together as a Kung Fu spectacular, with all the human opponents merely stunned? The last shot of that scene shows just the elevator as the doors shut on Neo and Trinity, and broken bricks and plaster and all the devastation which has just been wreaked - there is not a single dead body in the shot. This sanitised view of what constituted a totally unjustified massacre on the part of our heroes failed to make me feel better about what they had just done.I think it's easy to get carried away when a big-budget movie has an interesting and (relatively) original premise, and the visual effects do a good job of showing it off - but these factors do not make a truly satisfying film.",The Matrix
577,videofreak2002,One of the greatest movies to come out in a long time!,10,16 May 2002,"Back in 1999, ""The Matrix"" was released, and it was unlike anything I've ever seen before.  Here's why:Great story, great characters/actors, great editing, great dialouges, great direction (by the Wachowski Brothers), great action scenes (gunfights, kung-fu kicks, chases, etc.), and most of all, spectacular special effects. I don't know what else to say about ""The Matrix"" because I'm speechless. The wierdest about the movie was that this is the Wachowski's second film they directed (after ""Bound"").  But, they did an excellent job.  This is one of the best films of 1999, one of the best films ever, and one of my all-time favorite films.  Will there more sequels?   Yes.  In 2003, two ""Matrix"" sequels- ""The Matrix Reloaded"" and ""The Matrix Revolutions"" will be out in the same year, but, in different months.

The soundtrack sticks perfectly with the plot and will get you in a special atmosphere.
Special effects are pretty good for the release date of the movie.
Characters are charismatic and i think that Keanu Reeves plays to perfection the role of Neo and Laurence Fishburn is the best person to play Mortpheus

585,StarCastle99,An Incredible Film Whose Influence Is Changing the Industry,10,2 June 2002,"Certain films define their times and set a standard for look, drama, and special effects.  These films seem to come along every decade or so. 50's - Forbidden Planet 60's - 2001: A Space Odyssey 70's - Star Wars 80's - Terminator II 90's - The Matrix.  Each of these films became possible by some technological breakthrough. For example, without the motion control camera, Star Wars wouldn't have been made. Without advances in CGI software and rendering speed - no Terminator II. In the case of The Matrix, it owes a lot of its style to electronic non-linear editing, which allows the picture to go from slow motion to fast motion (undercrank for the old timers) with the click of a mouse. In case you haven't noticed television editing tries to copy the Matrix - just look at CSI.  When the Warshawski Brothers made the film it took a computer and 121 cameras to create the whirl-around effect. Now three years later it can be done with one camera and some Vi(Z)rt software.Let's put aside technology and look at the film.  It's plot is a bit convoluted but certainly accessible. The sub-plot which follows the transformation of Neo is there for all to see. The sub-text, which few people ever get from a film is also up-front.  Our reliance on computers has become total. Put enough high speed computers into a grid system and you have a world as imagined in Collosus: The Forbin Project.  The idea of automata taking over really goes back to the imagination of Czech writer, Karol Capek and his play ""R.U.R."" Capek invented the word Robot, from the Czech verb ""robotus"" meaning to serve.Matrix put a fresh spin on reality that puts a question mark on the end of Descartes dictum, ""I think therefore I am"".  The concept was superbly realized. If the acting wasn't world class level, the picture made you think.  Not many films do.  Personally, I can't wait to see the sequels. Incidentally, this film's opening is on a par with ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"". It hooks you in the first five minutes. Something aspiring screenwriters should consider.10/10",The Matrix

587,dixxjamm,A beautiful metaphor somehow emerged from this movie,8,18 April 2006,"Why somehow? Because casting Keanu Reeves in a metaphor-movie is always risky business, considering his ""enourmous versatility"". Here is an example: Keanu happy :) Keanu angry :)Keanu hurt :)Keanu in pain :)Keanu having an orgasm :)Keanu trying to be intellectual ............... Apart from that, he seems an OK dude, really. Is this movie philosophical? Well, yes, it's a pretty nice abstract explanatory image of the absurdity of the world we live in, and it is consistent with a basic philosophical basic presumption on which an entire argumentative algorithm - type system is subsequently based on. The beauty of such a vision is that you can interpret the idea of this movie in a personal way; some of my fellow commentators have brought up issues like: the absurdity of work ?!!!! (mino from Romania - gimme 5, bro). Can't say I don't agree,pal,while you're there in the Matrix, please help Tyler Durden blow up the rest of the banks too, will you?:). What I mostly saw here was a nice metaphor regarding the reaching of a higher understanding of the world. Our bodies are rigid mechanisms, the only way he can achieve freedom is through our minds. We could be rich, glamorous or whatever, but we are still flesh,bones and blood. It's our minds that we have to think about.Where I don't agree with some of my fellow commentators is that this movie has a religious dimension. Every time something like ""The Matrix"" appears on the market, there will be hoards of people joining that big 'ol atheist love parade. The same with E.T.,War of the Lords and the SF-movement generally and...the newest jewel encrusted in the existentialist frustration crown: The DaVinci Code. I mean, give me a break, I'm not a religious person, but use your own brain and generate your own ideas when it comes to faith and God. If you can't, that's absolutely OK, but better turn to traditional religions rather than the Watchowski Brothers.Having said that, the movie is very entertaining and nicely done. What I disliked a bit was the video-clip type of filming and the very clean advertisement-type ""feel"" of the movie. Also the dialog was sometimes overly preachy, although as I said earlier, the basic idea is great.I would have taken one point out of the deserved 8 because of Keanu R., but since one of man's most expressive features are the eyes, and Keanu R. is wearing sunglasses for most of the movie, we don't have to look to often into the eyes of KEN, so it's bearable.""You humans are like a virus"" Damn right, Mr. Smith.",The Matrix

589,sashamyshkina,Will forever remain the best science fiction movie of all time.,10,14 October 2020,"The Matrix is the movie that got me into movies. It made me realise just how incredible and crazy movies can really be, and it blew my tiny little 13-year-old mind. And ever since then, it has gone down in my mind as not just the best science fiction movie, but the best movie ever.The effects are absolutely mind-blowing for something that came out over 20 years ago. The plot is fascinating, and so different to any other science fiction of the time. I don't think I've ever seen a movie that's made me doubt reality like this. The choreography of the action sequences is absolutely impeccable, with the final fights being some of my favourite moments in film. The storyline is so captivating, interesting and original that no matter how many times I rewatch this movie I am always on the edge of my seat. The cinematography is amazing, and what I find the most incredible is that this is an original story and not a remake or a sequel.One thing that makes The Matrix stand out from any other science fiction movie is the fact that it's just so intellectual, whilst still being accessible and popular with the masses. There are threads of philosophy woven into the entire movie - from the 'red pill blue pill dilemma' to the 'brain in a jar hypothesis', which makes is stand out from the majority of other flicks for not just being action, but making you think - sparking ideas for contemporaries such as Christopher Nolan. After watching this for the first time I actually just sat there and questioned my entire existence - nothing I have ever seen has ever had that effect on me. I literally went around my house, slapping all of the furniture and mumbling to myself ""Is this real? Is any of this real?"".The only thing is that this movie was unfortunately completely ruined by the sequels which was absolutely devastating for me. I am literally begging you not to watch them, just leave the perfectly satisfying ending of this one alone.

593,Hellrazr360,The Greatest Sci-Fi Masterpiece Since Star Wars,9,31 January 2006,"The Matrix stands among the greatest sci-fi movies to have ever surfaced in years. Like Star Wars before it, The Matrix has awed movie audiences with its great special effects, different view on the world and its deeply intriguing plot. Not once does The Matrix cease to amaze its viewer with what it has to tell, and it has quite a story to tell us indeed.The story of The Matrix is that in the near future, Neo, a computer hacker, is found by a group of people to discover the roots of the Matrix. What Neo quickly learns from this group of people led by Morpheus is that the world he lives in is not what it appears to be. This world he feels so safe in is merely an illusion created by the Matrix where the way we live is used to fuel the Matrix and the cyber beings that created it. Neo is brought into the picture because Morpheus believes Neo to be the One, a single person who's destined to save humanity from the prison of the Matrix. The plot is deep and isn't very easy to understand at first but this is what makes The Matrix such an interesting watch.What makes The Matrix different from other sci-fi movies is that it doesn't focus so much on special effects and mind-blowing special effects. Instead, most of the running time of the movie is used to tell the plot to the audience and let them understand how the Matrix works as if they were Neo. Yes, Neo might be a computer hacker at first but once he learns of the Matrix it's like all his knowledge of computers barely even matters. With that, the viewer almost never feels like they aren't getting anything in the movie that Neo isn't.The cast of actors/actresses in The Matrix is a pretty strong selection. Keanu Reeves plays the role of Neo, Laurence Fishburne plays Morpheus and Carrie-Ann Moss plays Trinity, a feisty woman who later becomes Neo's lover. Keanu Reeves does a good job of portraying Neo as a computer hacker and as the One. Fishburne also delivers a more than worthy performance as the persistent Morpheus. Carrie-Ann Moss gives the audience nothing less than the impression that she has feelings for Neo from the beginning and she keeps that feeling along with her more get-to-the-point attitude together very nicely. Then there's Hugo Weaving, who plays the bad guy of the show, Agent Smith. Weaving does a great job of giving Agent Smith a smirky but somewhat charming personality that makes the viewer not help but love him for it.The action scenes that The Matrix does give the audience are fun to watch and definitely worth seeing. But don't expect much action in The Matrix, as it only makes up about thirty to forty minutes of the movie. Hey, at least you get to see some sick CGI at the end of the movie, not to mention the world-famous signature lean by Keanu Reeves that got The Matrix for its nickname. Not only is the action scenes in The Matrix awesome, but they also present some funny humor to help them be more enjoyable. The battles in The Matrix may not be Star Wars huge, but with such a great presentation in the movie otherwise it doesn't matter.The Matrix ends very smoothly and by the time it does the viewer feels much more than just satisfied with their buy or rent of the movie. Without a doubt, if you're a sci-fi goer you just have to have this movie in your movie collection. If you are and you don't have this movie along with the other Matrix movies then why are you even reading my review to start with, go out and buy it now!",The Matrix
594,Stephen-12,Visual feast without much substance,7,6 July 1999,"Felt a bit disappointed with this one. Bags of eye candy, certainly, but all the best bits were shoved into the trailer, so there weren't any big surprises. The moving freeze frames were quite nicely done, but I found the martial arts sequences quickly became boring.Whether the pretentious symbolism works or not doesn't really matter (Christ, Alice in Wonderland, etc. - hey, original, guys!), but given the amount of money spent on this film, couldn't they have come up with a better script? This screenplay is Cameron-awful. The best moment is the in-joke when Keanu does his 'woah!' Brought the house down when I watched it.The acting is pretty variable, too. We don't expect much from Keanu at the best of times, but to see an actor of Hugo Weaving's talent reduced to a snarling, stereotyped villain is saddening (and why does he talk so slowly - was he having trouble with the accent?). I suppose the Reservoir Dogs uniforms are quite fun.Easily the best bit is the sequence with the Oracle. Beautifully underplayed. If only the rest of the film had been this subtle. Admittedly, the break-in at the top security building has an energy and style which is impressive. And I will confess that charging down a corridor with two guns blazing in your fists, while wearing a dark coat and sunglasses, is pretty cool.(Those sunglasses were everywhere, weren't they? Even in dark rooms. Do these characters have a sight problem? Is that another piece of symbolism? Do I care enough?)I give it 7 out of 10, for the visuals, and for evidence of some intelligence at work. But, boys, when you come to do the sequel, do think a bit more about the dialogue, and stop pretending you're George Lucas, because he's not exactly the world's greatest screenwriter.",The Matrix

I was lucky enough to catch this in theaters opening night. I had no idea what to expect.  What I got was by far the best SF movie of 90's.  And the best part was, it was the best action movie too.This movie is very loosely based on a Harlan Ellison short story titled ""I have no mouth and I must scream"", considered by many to be one of the classic SF stories.  The characters and plot are completely different, but the basic theme is essentially the same.  Why does the world not seem real? What is real?  Is this all a dream?  This is certainly not the first time movies have tackled this theme, but it is certainly the first time the theme was handled in this way.  This movie is a very original piece of work.  It's influence will be felt for decades.This movie has a very strong story, great characters, good acting, great special effects, incredible fight scenes, and incredible all around execution.  See it even you're not into SF or action.",The Matrix

598,HORROR_FAN_1,Plain and simply brilliant.,10,26 April 2002,"If I would have commented on this flick after the first time that I watched it then I probably would have only rated it 8 or possibly 9. It is so true that to fully appreciate this film you have to watch it 3 maybe even four times. I thought this film film was brilliantly original, clever, atmospheric and well thought out.It's especially interesting to see how much effort and skill went into making it. The actors for example, took 4/5 months just to learn the martial art skills necessary for the Morpheus/Neo fight simulation. The cast is great (especially Trinity in that sexy cat suit, wow!, she has a lovely ass!). The direction is superb and I just cannot find a fault with this masterpiece, apart from at the end, where it becomes a bit corny in that in order for Neo to become 'The One', Trinity must confess her love for him. Rather corny but after all, this is the one thing that the machines which have taken over cannot feel or relate to, feelings such as love or compassion. Subsequently it is this, that leads to their downfall as Neo wakes up and kicks Agent Smith's ass!.A must watch for any viewer & one of only a few films I will give full marks to.Rating 10/10. Master Class.",The Matrix

Although the movie is a bit hard to follow the brilliant action scenes totally make up for it. This is personally my favorite Matrix movie. This is one of the movies I have watched the most. I bought the DVD - and I think it was certainly worth it.The casting, acting and production of the movie is great. They chose the perfect actor of Agent Smith and Neo. They suited their roles perfectly and did an excellent job. The filming and camera angles were great and made the action scenes as good as they were.Although, I wish the movie was easier to understand (I finally got it after like the fifth time I watched it).This is certainly one of the best sci-fi movies ever made.",The Matrix
600,abum190,I love this movie,8,15 November 2006,"The Matrix has become such an iconic movie that it's hard to say anything new about it. I'm hesitant to try. Everyone knows it's a good movie- and if they don't believe it to be good, they know it's a well-loved movie. I, for one, love it, but I don't think it deserves to be so high up in the Top 250.The Matrix is a good example of a movie that pretends to be about something in order to keep your attention. The truth is that the story in this movie is so good and the characters so engaging that it doesn't need the message (be careful about getting too dependent on your machines- they might kill you). The way the story is executed is also nearly ingenious. When we first meet Neo (Keanu Reeves), a computer programmer for a software business that sidelines as a black market dealer in computer parts, we do not know the secret of the Matrix. The Wachowski brothers do not reveal the secret till about a quarter of the way through the movie- the perfect time to do it; any shorter, and it wouldn't have been a shock; any longer, and the movie would have become boring and there would have been less action, which is the real star of this movie.Neo meets Morpheus (Laurence Fishburne), a man proclaimed to be a terrorist by the government through the media, who gives Neo the choice between returning to his boring life and discovering the truth about the Matrix. Neo's choice sends him and the characters he meets into intense gun-and-fistfights. In between the action sequences, Morpheus spouts some philosophical tripe that could be considered deep, but there's really no life behind it; I didn't care. The movie is fun, and that's all that matters.I don't think it's a great movie, but that doesn't matter. If you're just looking to have fun and sit on the edge of your seat for a few hours, then this is a great movie for that.",The Matrix
601,The_Other_Snowman,"The Unofficial Sequel to ""The Truman Show""?",2,8 May 2005,"I saw this movie in the theater back in 1999. It had its moments, but not many. To start, the acting is terrible. Keanu Reeves has the emotive ability of a toaster, and Carrie Ann Moss is about as sympathetic as that sexy sidekick babe in a video game. Lawrence Fishburne comes off a bit better, but his dialogue is the most pretentious, ridiculous garbage I've ever heard. I imagine the characters in this film spend about six hours out of every day designing the leather bondage costumes they'll wear next time they're in the Matrix.For the first half of the movie, it seems to be interested in questioning reality, which, as the title to my review suggests, was already done more topically in previous films. ""The Matrix"" is astounded by what it perceives as its own brilliance, but for those of us who have thought of its ideas before, there are few surprises. Some people I know were blown away when Neo discovers the truth behind his reality, but I was waiting for something interesting to happen.""The Matrix"" has been praised for its originality, but it suffers from two traditional and clichéd movie formulas. First, Neo is the Chosen One (notice that ""neo"" is an anagram of ""one."" Was this supposed to be suspenseful?) who is destined to save the human race, bring balance to the Force, etc. He dies and comes back to life, like Jesus. Of course, to begin with he was just a pasty hacker in a crummy apartment and an anonymous office job, giving hope to all the spotty teenage geeks in the audience that they too might become the Messiah one day.The second fault is the movie's reliance on action. Instead of coming up with interesting and exciting ways for two people to fight each other in virtual reality, Neo and Co. whip out their guns and start shooting. The techno music begins, and the audience is treated to several slow-motion kicks and scenes of people dodging bullets. I'm not sure how they manage all this, because nobody ever takes off their sunglasses to see properly. If the villains of the movie really were programs in the Matrix, shouldn't they be able to manipulate it without having to resort to kung fu? Anyway, I didn't like this movie. ""Dark City"" is a better, more original version of the same premise, without the Chosen One nonsense or the martial arts.",The Matrix

His capability is his knowledge about reality and the matrix. He is supported by different side characters, which in turn have different characteristics. In the end, even love is a central factor.This kind of hero's journey has proven itself many times in the past. The crucial thing here is also how this journey is staged and what effect the characters achieve. And this is where the strengths of 'Matrix'. The characters are special across the board and the whole world is new and fascinating. You get to know it little by little and understand how it works.As far as the special effects are concerned, 'Matrix' is still convincing some 20 years after its release. If you compare the effects with more recent movies, you'll notice differences, but 'Matrix' really doesn't need to hide. Fireworks are shot off with grandiose scenes.However, 'Matrix' is not a classic action movie, but also deals with deeper philosophical questions. The focus is always on the question of what is reality and what significance does it have to know the truth? A lot happens in the brain and maybe it is better for humans to live in an illusion.'Matrix' manages to credibly combine action, special effects and philosophical themes in one movie.

607,dholliday-imdb,"Zeitgeist-defining, and yet timeless...not bad for a mere action movie!",9,7 March 2015,"The sentiment of The Matrix, the chief paranoia dominating its message, is one as old as the hills: that reality is not what it seems.Its execution, that AI has taken over and created a virtual reality for us, is a very modern fear, and one perhaps growing ever more realistic as the decades go by....or maybe we are already in one? *cue dramatic chipmunk clip* Aside from this epic premise, and the profound questions it asks, we still get a riproaring action sci-fi with two brilliant characters (Morpheus and Agent Smith), pulsating set-pieces, nice martial art moves, excellent effects and solid pacing.Keanu Reeves' unavoidable blandness (and that of his love interest) aren't really detrimental. The philosophical musing surrounding his place in the universe is tantalising and its further development was ostensibly intended for the sequels (alas...we all know how that turned out).As a standalone action film with intelligent ideas, it's utterly recommended. Watch the sequels too if you're curious, but the quality drops off somewhat (more focus on the action, less on the 'intelligent').",The Matrix

It was more likely that it would be the most disappointing movie ever, but the action in the second half of the movie was pretty good made, so it saved the movie from being a complete disaster.The story in The Matrix was so stupid that I considered stop watching the movie, but I had to watch it all so I could rate it here on IMDb.
Normally I like movies with ""the chosen one"" like Star Wars and Lord of the Rings, but The Matrix was so stupid. The actors constantly repeated ""he is the one"", I think it would be enough to say this three or four times.I really don't understand how The Matrix could be in the top-250 at IMDb, but some people like movies with stupid stories if just the action is good.

610,mikepwong,Refreshing,8,15 May 2003,"Rating: 8 out of 10. Directed by Andy Wachowski and Larry Wachowski. `The Matrix' is an action packed science fiction story full of movie aphorisms, but fortunately has many innovative ideas. The surprise hit of the summer of 1999 grossing over $170 million, `The Matrix' was the fifth highest grossing movie in North America that year.I love many genres of film, but I mostly watch drama or thriller movies, and generally avoid the action genre. So I was pleasantly surprised by `The Matrix', it was a great diversion that was welcomed when I first watched it. Having just seen `Matrix Reloaded' today, I feel the need to see this movie again sometime soon.There were two things I didn't like about this movie. One, the acting is unremarkable and nearly nonexistent, there is more dancing than real acting. Two, the dialogue is terribly cliched. Even with its flaws, `The Matrix' isn't bad at all and worth viewing for anyone that has not seen it yet.",The Matrix
611,DesertDogMedia,The Matrix,9,6 August 2014,"Title: The Matrix Condensed Storyline: A computer hacker learns about the truth of the world and has to try and save it from the computers by being 'The One' Notable Acting: This movie has a great main cast consisting of Keanu Reeves, Laurence Fishburn, Carrie-Anne Moss and Hugo Weaving. These are the only characters who actually matter and who provide good acting. Sure Joe Pantoliano and Marcus Chong provide their good parts, but they're just secondary characters who get minimal character development. Noticeable Camera work: This movie is great for its dolly shot and its 180º shots, these are only used during the fight scene which makes them special as they are not over used, but apart from that there are few other good shots which they use to good effect as the rest is left up to standard shotsGraphics: This movie had the best CGI for that period of time and it's CGI still stands up amazingly in the standards set by today. Incorrect Science: The plot revolves around humans being used a batteries, hence why there are massive farms of them. But humans cannot generate chemical, thermal or electrical energy without a food source which provides them without enough energy to do so. In short this means it takes more energy to keep humans alive than a human body produces. So the machines are working a flawed system. The second time Morpheus calls Neo he says that ""this is a tapped line"" and proceeds to tell Neo where to meet Trinity. If the line was tapped Trinity would have Agents coming after her because Morpheus just gave away their position. In the end of the movie Agent Smith shoots Neo with a Desert Eagle, a weapon of that caliber would go through Neo and into the wall, but we only see a blood smear and no hole in the wall. Overall Feel: The first opening scene of this movie was done on a $10million budget, once it was shown to the people at Warner, they were then allowed the Wachowski Brothers to have the $80million that they originally asked for. That was just a little bit of trivia for you. This movie was ahead of its time in its usage of CGI, it is a movie which can still rival a few movies which are made today.

Any bad thing you hear is just someone who just didn't get it.  The plot is simple: take one part Terminator, one part Total Recall and two parts any movie like Dark City or 12 Monkeys or that Star Trek episode where they fight at the O K Corral.  There are weaknesses in dialogue but not enough to be bothersome, but the story is good solid sci-fi.  What is the Matrix?  It's everywhere and everything--simply, it's a computer program, but really it's not that simple: watching the characters learn to understand that is two-thirds of the movie AND THAT'S NOT A BAD THING.

The story was hard to wrap my mind around, but that's perhaps because the explanation for The Matrix itself was done in the middle of the film in the cheesiest manner possible: sitting the hero down and explaining it to him. My mind just blanked it out.  Not only is this device as old as time, but it doesn't involve the audience at all.  It's like we're just listening in.  It would have been better for Neo to actually experience it firsthand and find out exactly what the reality is around him and how it came to be.  I found the FX to be pretty cheesy as well.  I felt like I was watching someone play a video game rather than watching a movie.  The whole concept of the story may be ""deep"" for the latest generation (I'm one step ahead of you folks), but it sounded like contrived dreck to me. 2/10 cuz Keanu's pretty cute, but cuteness does not a good movie make.",The Matrix

The justification behind the action scenes is very, very weak. The potential philosophical content (about virtual realities) is completely ignored - unlike in Thirteenth Floor, for example. The symbolism is so heavy and cheap (Trinity, Neo = One, etc.) that it truly stinks.And then you've got tons of ridiculous stuff going on. For example, within that virtual reality the heroes still have to use a heavy mobile phone to call home.

Its special effects are most notable because a combination of CGI and practical gives the film a dreamlike, yet grounded feel. Plenty of action is enhanced by effects in The Matrix, but the highlight has to be the shootout in the lobby because it is done without CGI. Painstaking work was put into actually dismantling that lobby and it paid off. Next, the production design of The Matrix builds a sleek world of green hues and leather jackets that still inspires aesthetics today. The dystopian future is appropriately bleak while the computer world is appropriately polished.Meanwhile, The Matrix has dynamic camerawork. Its use of the bullet time effect has become synonymous with the film and is even known as ""the Matrix effect"". The sound design is surreal and the music is borderline iconic. The story is philosophical and trippy. Lastly, the direction is wonderful because The Matrix has such a precise style. Its combination of eastern and western action, its slick fashion, and its futuristic visuals create an experience that cannot be replicated.

I wrote reviews for it and ""Reloaded"" as well back in 2003 and I realized that I had never written a few lines for the first movie. Well, here I am.I will keep it short. We all know how good ""The Matrix"" is. The plot, the visuals, the mythos, it all adds up to a movie experience that is timeless. Almost 20 years later, it now has a ""retro"" vibe that makes it more interesting, with late 90s cars, rotary phones, Nokia cells and CRT monitors.Today sets the 4K HDR release of the trilogy. Coming back to ""The Matrix"" after probably 10 years since my last viewing, it is a constant reminder of how the Wachowski's masterpiece shaped up the movie industry and its echos are still felt today.A true timeless piece of movie history.",The Matrix
626,eldergod-1,Pathetic love story ruins a very good scifi action.,5,9 February 2005,"""The Matrix"" is considered to be a great movie and one of the best scifi actions ever made. This is true, but only to some degree. The film has really fascinating visual effects and everything in it has cool look - the good guys, the bad guys, the action scenes, the strange Matrix-thing, the hellish future. It is also true that the movie was quite original and not an ordinary Terminator rip-off. That said, the film has some major flaws. Individually, neither Neo, nor Trinity were irritating, but as a couple they were extremely frustrating. The whole love story was annoying and pathetic and in the end of the movie I really hated all about it. The other big failure was the villain. Agent Smith was a joke, a machine who laughs evilly and talks about the problems of humanity is the cheesiest idea ever to be created. Why Terminators are scary? Because they act like robots. Smith is a clown. So my overall opinion of the film is low and I gave it 5 rating only because of the good action scenes and visual effects. I haven't watch the sequels and I don't plan to.",The Matrix

Neo is a computer hacker, and Neo is he's hacker name. He real name is Thomas Anderson. Morpheus, is the wise man who shows Neo ""The Matrix"". The Matrix is the world we live in, which is really a computer generated program.The Matrix has everything. It has Sci-Fi, Action and Comedy. The characters are very likable, and their are very personable and able to understand. The Action Sequences are amazing, and the special effects are simply mind blowing. The plot is very well written, and is very original. Keanu Reeves suits the role of Neo, just like he was born to play the part.

628,Ricardo-36,There is no spoon,7,24 May 1999,"This movie is very confusing. It looks like a bit ""Twelve Monkeys"" with a bit of ""The Truman Show"" and another bit of ""2001"". If you are a fan of sci-fi confusing movies, try this one!",The Matrix
629,suicidea,The biggest bomb from the new age of Hollywood,5,7 July 2019,"Technically, The Matrix was a movie of the last century (made in 1999), but it's a scarily accurate model of the 21st century person: Slick and great-looking, flashy, flaunting and proud, but as hollow and unaware as it can be.The story, as everyone probably knows, involves a computer hacker realizing that ""the world is not what it seems"" and joining forces with other rebels to overthrow the robot overlords, or save the world, or fly in his long leather coat, depending on your interpretation.The visuals, sets and costumes are truly impressive, still setting the standard even after 20 years of technical innovations in moviemaking. The special effects also stand the test of time. The direction of the Wachowski brothers (or sisters? What do we call them now? Will I be crucified if I get the slightest wording wrong?) is also excellent.However, visuals alone don't make a film. The Matrix is a textbook example. It is so unbelievably, incredibly pretentious, tries to bite so much bigger than it can chew, comes off as so high-brow and assertive, that it leaves you scratching your head.Read as many comments as you want (this will be the 4000th one if approved) and you won't find one which doesn't contain the word ""philosophical."" But mind you, The Matrix isn't ""philosophical"" in the general sense: it's philosophical in the millennial generation sense. Which means, it says ""Things aren't always what they seem..."" and that's enough philosophy to boggle your mind, so then moves on to fight scenes.Which isn't an unfair assessment. The movie's deep, profound ""philosophy"" that so many fans have been praising for 20 years, doesn't go beyond having a ying-yang symbol in the background in one scene, or someone saying ""life isn't what it seems..."" for an audience that's all too ready to go ""Whoo man, that's deep, man!""You can almost feel the moviemakers saying ""Hey, why not add a katana or a Chinese letter as well? There, we lapped up all 5,000 years of Eastern philosophy and reduced it to a spoonful for you. Now let's move to the next leather-clad CGI fight.""In this aspect, the movie reminds me of some celebrities who go on talk shows and say ""I'm a very cultured person. In fact I just read a book. But enough of that, now let me tell about my latest breast implants.""I still gave it 5 stars for the great visuals and entertainment element, that cannot be denied. But it still feels like a missed chance, it could have been much more than a 90-minute long sunglasses commercial.",The Matrix
630,serafinogm,Mind blowing and without equal in the genre!,10,10 October 2015,"Have you ever felt, with every fiber of your being, that something was just not quite right? That something or more correctly someone(s) were manufacturing events, and you know what events I'm referring to, to make our reality a living hell and there is simply no logical reason or explanation for it? Well the Matrix is a possible explanation (doubtful but possible although I have a much more cogent explanation). Every aspect of this film was groundbreaking! The soundtrack was impeccable, opening with Rob Zombie's Dragula, followed by others like Manson's Rock is Dead, Clubbed to Death, Rage Against the Machine's Wake up, etc. it simply was a groundbreaking soundtrack with no equal. Has Laurence Fishburne ever been better in anything else? His performance, as well as his co-stars, was very, very good but his stood out for me!

633,timefreezer7,Entertaining average film,7,28 February 2002,"Just like the case with the vastly overrated Blade Runner : professional job from a couple of good technicians but nothing more . I will have to admit that the script had some potential but the quite amateurish direction by the Wachowski Brothers almost ruined the entire effort . Before I summarize the plot , I would like to point out that I am extremely upset with the comments ""Philosophical"" , ""thought provoking"" . ARE YOY FEELING OK ???? Do you seriously believe that the script is ""complex"" and the film ""requires more than one viewing"" !!!!!!?????? (just like the case with the overrated Usual Suspects which is as simple and obvious as a cockroach on a white carpet) . If that 's so then I will strongly discourage you from EVER watching ""Twelve Monkeys"" , ""Dune"" or ""Sphere"" because inevitably your brain cells will short circuit . It seems like the majority of sci-fi lovers have never read sci-fi short stories !!! The concept that we all live in a virtual illusional reality is not at all original . I can recite numerous examples but I will just stick to "" Marianna "" , a very short story by Fritz Lang where the heroine discovers that her mansion and her husband were holographic hallucinations and even herself was nothing but a wish coming true . The terrifying truth was that her real self (from were she was projected) was institutionalized in an asylum and was treated with an alternative personality/wish fulfillment program. Another short fantasy story claimed that very few people are indeed true and the rest were again the result of the subconscious materialization from the real ones' brains (their ""soulmates"" conveniently coming true from the wishes of their counterparts) . I can go on and on but I don 't have to . Even for the movie fans which haven 't read sci-fi novels , it is impossible that they haven 't watched similar films . The infiltration in an alternative reality , artificially constructed , is present in ""Tron"" (1982) with Jeff Bridges or in ""Total Recall"" (1990) where the question what is real and what is not , is inherent throughout the film . The reviewers who see correlation between Matrix and Plato 's philosophical theories make me want to laugh . On top of that there are the ridiculous ""biblical symbolisms"" the film-makers have insisted to include and publicize . I don 't think that by calling the ship ""Nabouchodonosor"" or by killing off the hero and resurrecting him there are christianic references . Then Ripley in Alien Resurrection should be titled a Christ figure or we can suppose that the ""Janus"" plan in ""Judge Dredd"" should be regarded as a metaphor for the Roman Empire and the ruthless games between the Caesar and the Senate !!!!! And the by the way , the pattern of the (chosen) One is omnipotent in almost every sci-fi , with the most notable case Luke Skywalker in Star Wars . The dystopic future with machines taking over humans is of course ""borrowed"" blatantly by the Terminator and the plot device ""Dying inside the virtual reality truly will kill you "" is apparently inspired from ""Nightmare on elm street"" .Ripping - off so many movies and getting away with so called ""profound originality"" (!) is a great achievement by the Wachowski Bros and proves how brain washing the critics can be . Excuse me but I just want to get it off my chest . I can 't stand seeing Matrix with an average of 8.5 while brilliant movies like ""Sphere"" are stuck in 5.1 simply because the critics (for various reasons) decided to pan them .On to  the movie : we have a very large introduction (45 minutes maybe longer) before Neo (Keanu Reeves) gets to the ""real world"" with the guidance of ""Morpheus"" (Lawrence Fishburn) . If this introduction was shortened we would have a better movie . Anyway the middle part of the movie is undoubtly the best . After we learn the background of this strange society we are introduced to the submarine crew (Morpheus' friends) . I cannot spoil what happens next but I will say the moody atmosphere is highly successful . The climate is depressing , awe - inspiring and contains all the elements of a great existential drama .But hey this is Hollywood and the final 40 minutes are frittered away : after the 3 leads (Reeves , Fishburn , Moss) are trapped in the illusional world they are trying to escape and the film degenerates to a poor shoot 'em up with irritating constant noisy gunfire and silly video-gameish action scenes to satisfy the Playstation 13 year old freaks who probably digged them and pitched the Matrix to the aforementioned 8.5 . The karate scenes are decent but other than that the SFX stink BAD BAD BAD . Not only the repeated gunfire is annoying but the much hyped slow motion special effects are unbelievably c**ppy and patchily edited (""Scary Movie"" to its credit did these scenes justice!!!!!!) One scene in the roof of a scyscraper is the perfect example . We see the bad guy shooting Neo . Then we see Neo verging backwards in slow motion . Then we hear Neo squeak ""Agh!!"" and then we see the flight path of the bullet and we are supposed to presume that Neo was hit . Bottom case : we never actually SAW the bullet . Was the budget that low ?I will lie if I say that I didn 't enjoy the Matrix . But it is very overrated . Sets and costumes are adequate and despite of the many flaws in the direction there are memorable scenes like the visit to the Oracle 's home or the climactic chase of Neo and the baddies . I can 't say more in order not to reveal plot secrets . On the acting side : the 3 leads give quite solid performances , nothing great but passable but I believe the supporting cast stole the show . My personal favorite from the crew members is Tank and I am sad he won 't be in the sequel . Speaking of the sequel I will once again refer to the faults of the film . Overlong introduction ,weak finale , lousy SFX          BUT if they manage to jettison all these defects and they manage to reproduce the mystic , melancholic climate of the middle sequence then Matrix 2 will be a h**l of a sequel . Therefore I conclude with hope that in Matrix 2 they will wipe off the demerits and they will enhance the virtues to maximum . As it is Matrix is a fairly enjoyable could-have-done-much-more film .

636,Ellie-23,Intriguing story with layers of meaning to sort.,7,1 December 1999,"My husband and I are Science Fiction types and we found this film excellent from that angle.  It was reminiscent in places of a couple novels or short stories we have read but with a twist that was intriguing.  I also saw some tones of a religious bent, the good being attacked by the evil aliens and how different reality is once released from the safe world.  I am not impressed with violence for violence sake or even violence for special effects sake and here the movie falls in my opinion.  I hope there will be a sequel with more work on the theme of which world is better, the real or the protected cocoon.",The Matrix
637,hmsgroop,A young hacker's nightmare,4,12 May 2000,"Against the background of The Thirteenth Floor and Existenz the film seems childish. Its creators focus on tricks such as running on the vertical surfaces, swallowing bullets and firing every kind of weapons the film crew could think of. It's a strange thing but though the show is breathtaking while one is watching it the viewer is unable to tell what it is all about a few minutes after the film has ended. The idea (if there is one) is not new. There is a vague entity enslaving our long-suffering planet instead of the good old ET invaders, gallant but few rebels, to be continued (certainly!). The film lacks depth. One can see it once in a good movie theatre but that's all for it.",The Matrix
638,Euphorbia,"Grand concept, inexcusably sloppy execution",3,7 September 2002,"*** SPOILERS AHEAD ***Actually, nothing could be more of a spoiler than the movie itself. The concept is brilliant -- the ""real world"" we think we inhabit is actually a matrix of induced illusion, but there is a ""real"" real world outside of it, one that the characters manage to reach.Okay, fine.But for this to work, there must be an entirely consistent physics and set of natural laws in the real world, and either a different but equally consistent set of rules inside the matrix, or at least a consistently inconsistent set of rules which change in some predictable way, or which are changed intentionally by someone -- heroes or  villains or both -- and we see them making the changes as part of the unfolding story.
What we get instead is constantly changing rules both in the world and in the matrix, and they change for no good reason except to advance the hobbling plot, or to showcase a lame special effect. Sometimes the same rules apply in both, then one changes, then the other changes to what the first was, then the second changes back, then they switch. Or something like that.The first time this happened, I could not believe the director and/or editor had let it slip by. It completely spoiled the flow of the movie, worse than an actor stepping out of character (lots of that in this movie, too). But then it happened again and again, with increasing frequency as the climax approached, and I realized that they just did not care.
Maybe it wasn't their fault; maybe the studio garbled it up. Maybe some day there will be a director's cut which does make sense. But given the popularity of the movie as is, that is not likely to happen.
Rated 3 out of 10, and that is generous. I would pay not to have to watch it again.",The Matrix

641,daved-3,For SF fans only,8,9 April 1999,"The Matrix is visually stunning (not just the FX, but also wonderful direction and camerawork and superb fight choreography) but should appeal only to hard core SF fans.  It has familiar plot elements taken from TRON, Terminator 2 and several other SF stories, but it is so innovative in its visuals you don't mind (in fact, the story needs to be familiar to make sense of it).

642,Colonel Ted,"Good, but not THAT good",8,24 September 1999,"I was very surprised to see this film in the top 30 films of all time. Not least for the fact that it borrows from nearly every other sci-fi film ever made such as the imagery of Ridley Scott's Blade Runner and (vaguely) the plot of James Cameron's The Terminator, which are frankly, better films. The fascinating plot premise is wasted to a certain degree by the mind boggling plot and a never ending stream of psycho-babble that shows every sign of a film cramming in far too many ideas than it can handle. And then there's the lousy ending However for all these flaws The Matrix (particularly the last half hour) is very entertaining, getting by on that old trick: showmanship. It's absolutely stunning! SFX, from the mirror spreading on Neo's face, to the `flo-mo' camera shots, to that helicopter crash, are superb and are by far the most impressive of 1999's blockbusters. The Wachowski brothers direct with pace and flare and there are some very funny moments throughout (`Wooah'). Performances too, are good. Fishburne and newcomer, Moss (what a find!) shine and even Reeves is not half as wooden as usual. I was slightly disappointed, mainly due to script and after reading all the great reviews, perhaps I had set my hopes a little high. But The Matrix is by far the best summer SFX blockbuster this year. 8/10",The Matrix
643,hprill,"Good entertainment, interesting concept, cool actors.",8,24 January 2000,"While not ranking among my top favorite films of all time, I thought this was one of the better films of 1999, a lot better than your average science-fiction / action / Chosen-One-saves-the-world flicks. The concept behind the plot (how real is the world around us?) wasn't too new -- Philip K. Dick and others have been there many times before --, but that doesn't keep it from still being interesting. The same goes for the movie: even though some of the plot elements were cleverly recycled from elsewhere, the screenplay managed to present them in a new, refreshing, up-tempo, and thrilling way (though I was a bit annoyed with the dumbo character who betrayed the lot because he couldn't get the girl. I've seen this too many times before, and it just didn't fit).The coolest thing about this film, however, was not the screenplay, and it wasn't the special effects. It was the actors. Hugo Weaving gave me the creeps as smooth, unscrupulous Agent Smith. Laurence Fishburne was cool beyond belief, a walking enigma if I've ever seen one. Carrie-Anne Moss... my God, what can I say...?

The direction was superb, the effects excellent (though sometimes bizarre), the plot was confusing but compulsively interesting, the acting was not too bad, and the whole thing rattled along at a breathtaking pace. It was only the third time I watched it that I noticed that it was based on possibly the most stupid idea for a movie ever made: an all-powerful computer that keeps people alive for the sole purpose of feeding off their bio-electricity! How could anyone believe that the world could possibly be taken over by a machine so stupid that it does not realise that it could get more electricity from one decent-sized power station, with about one-billionth the trouble?

646,dreamingescapist,There is definitely not a glitch in 'The Matrix',10,7 July 2019,"'The Matrix' became an instant phenomenon that spawned two direct sequels, several video games, and graphic novels. Not to mention how much that movie has been an influence on the films of the 21st century in general.'The Matrix' although released twenty years ago, is still as fresh as it was upon its release. Yes, some can argue that the technology (cellphones and computers) is outdated, but this is the least of the worries - the story takes place inside a computer-generated world that is modeled after the year 1999. The special effects combining CGI with practical stunts and sets still look amazing, and there aren't many movies that came after that have surpassed 'The Matrix' in this department. Fight scenes are as beautiful as ballet, and that sort of poetic fighting choreography is another thing that many (in Hollywood) have tried to replicate, but have failed. Not to mention the film's thought-provoking premise, and its philosophical aspects that have been the basis to numerous essays, reviews, and even studies. Yet, none of its ambitions or allegories (religious or not) feel pretentious. The serious subject matter is masterfully mixed with fantastic visual effects, thus creating a movie which ideas we can discuss over, or simply being an entertaining action epic.Well developed characters and not only the main ones are also an attestation about masterful writing and well thought out screenplay. Side characters are not there just to be killed off in some flashy way.There are few movies that became instant classics, and even fewer are those that stand the test of time in today's fast-moving world and can pull theater full even twenty years later*.*Went to see the special screening on July 3rd. 2019.",The Matrix

The portal between the Matrix and supposed to be the real world was extremely ridiculous, old phones ringing and that's it? seriously??? While the whole thing is pure fiction, within the boundaries of that fiction, audience expects to receive a reasonably believable action and/or explanation and in case of the portal, the thing is so cheap that is beyond any explanation so maybe that's why they just left it unexplained and I thank them for not attempting to insult my intelligence. It was 1930s cheap!2. Apparently the director(s) were into antiques. Old Lincoln car, old phones, old TVs... I love antiques too but using those stuff in the movie was like an unmatched patch on hole on pair of jeans! Some may find it fashionable but I say its just irrelevant, and it was an irrelevancy overdone!3. To elicit emotion in a good screenplay, hero and villain(s) should be fundamentally the same and that similarity should be explained early in the movie otherwise there would be no elicited emotion on audience side as a result of their conflict. In this movie there was absolutely no similarity between the hero and villain except a cheesy explanation near the end of movie which aside from being so cheesy, it was also too late and as a result, confrontations between Nemo and the agent throughout the movie were among the most senseless I've ever seen on big screen. It was good action (for year 1999) but that was it! no emotion, no excitement!4. Villains had no weakness(es). They could virtually do anything, there was no limit to their power. On scree writing point, the villain(s) of the movie were pure disaster and at the end, Nemo was dead! So he came to life again after the kiss of the true love (thank you for making me laugh a bit) and all the sudden he became the one who could do anything better that villains and destroyed them... really???If I want to explain this movie in a short sentence I would say I was a giant pimp truck running on mini copper tire on rear left, 18 wheeler tire of on rear right, regular truck tire on front left and no tire at all on front right! yes, it was that bad and yet it was successful because of the action and relatively innovative special effects for a time. Also for those who claim that the movie was philosophical... No it was not. The story was not new and there were numerous books and movies on the subject of what if this world is just a dream.

651,someokiedude,"Before you get upset, read the review.",4,16 September 2020,"The old saying goes that the people who often write the stories that people consider to be new and fresh often end up being the most predictable stories of them all. It still mystifies me how this film became such a pop culture icon while films that explored similar ideas (and did them better) like They Live, Ghost in The Shell, and The Truman Show go on to become mere cult films.As a critic, I sometimes fear that I've become another cog in the machine, repeating praises that other, more worthy critics have already lavished upon a film, so I suppose there's a certain relief to be found when I find a film that's widely praised as The Matrix to fall short of its said praise. That's not to say that I hate this film simply to stick it to the popular opinion, I genuinely don't like this movie.It was originally Doug Walker's video on The Matrix that initially inspired my anger and disdain for the film, as before then I was rather mixed on it, not entirely sure what to make of it but realizing that it wasn't the mind blowing experience that I expected. I know there's some out there who've grown disenfranchised with Walker's style for various reasons, and even I've noticed that he's begun to grasp for straws with The Nostalgia Critic, and I've grown to prefer his videos where he's himself, allowing himself to flesh out his ideas. But the video, obnoxious as it might be for some, did open my eyes to the fact that perhaps The Matrix isn't the film that people thought, alongside what people claim it to be.Predictably, it's been my disdain for The Matrix that has caused the most derision from people, which I find odd as it makes me wonder how so many people clicked with this film. A friend of mine explained it to me: much like Star Wars, no one had ever seen anything like The Matrix before. Then again, most people probably hadn't seen Ghost in The Shell, a thoughtful, radical reinvention of the cyberpunk genre, and one that The Matrix would shamelessly knock off 4 years later, or They Live, John Carpenter's pulpy yet also surprisingly thoughtful critique of Reagan era politics, or Dark City and The Truman Show, two films that had come out the previous year and both that I thought had a much more complex and thorough exploration into similar concepts that The Matrix would touch upon.The Matrix is basically a dull retread of Plato's Allegory of The Cave, touching upon the ideas of Plato's original story but never really bothering to say anything about them, it's the same critique that Ebert lobbied upon Fight Club, ironically from the same year, yet at least Fight Club had decent characters, intriguing ideas, and an dirty, grungy style, (though I much prefer Se7en) but with The Matrix...there's nothing.Perhaps that's hyperbolic, The Matrix does have several things going for it. The slick cinematography certainly oozes atmosphere, I quite enjoyed how the font would change from The Matrix to the real world, the action is well helmed, as The Wachowskis have been well regarded as action directors, and its paced quite nicely, yet the film would be dragged down by its dull characters, overtly expository dialogue, and flat storytelling.Nothing is left to the imagination in The Matrix, as much as its avid supporters would have you think otherwise. Characters dump information in the same dull, bored tone, there's no variety or humanity within the characters, and the film spends too long over-explaining things. The audience's intelligence is constantly insulted throughout the film, which is probably what angers me the most about this film. I've had more forgiving friends of mine who would explain to me how the studio had interfered with the film and forced them to change several things from it, though I don't easily buy into that excuse. If that were the case, then it shouldn't have been so hard to get around the hurdles and keep it compelling, yet alas they didn't. There are several scenes that I exempt, like the initial red pill/blue pill scene as well as the deja vu sequence (which is actually my favorite bit of the film). But asides from that, the film is a rather dull, flat experience, asides from flashes of excellence split throughout the film. There were bits throughout the film where I came up with ideas with how they could have made it better, like how in the Matrix, the people could be more dull and emotionally stunted since the robots don't know human nature as well, though when they're out of the Matrix, they can act more human and expressive, yet they didn't do that.In the end, it's another piece of science fiction fluff that thinks itself smarter than it is, and it made me think back to a quote from Ellison.""If you make people think they're thinking, they'll love you; but if you really make them think, they'll hate you.""*sigh* how right you were, Harlan...how right you were.",The Matrix
652,judemcrobbie,The best movie for action!,10,26 January 2021,"Probably the best movie for action ever, I don't mean action movie just for action.
The opening scene is brilliant, setting the tone, pacing and rules for this universe.
The ending is brilliant too, kept short and sweet. It wraps it up perfectly and satisfying. It is the perfect arc going from this scared boy barely willing to open his door to this beast (for lack of a better word) willing to take on all the agents.
As alluded to, the action scenes are some of the best of all time. They create tension perfectly.
At the end, Neo is basically a Mary Sue. However this feels earned due to the brilliant character arc and there being the feeling he can still lose outside of the matrix.
The concept is genius and one is the best screenplay ideas ever.
And for a little cherry on top, I'm pretty sure none of the actors had a body double for stunts or fights.",The Matrix

His character shows emotional depth in his almost paternal care for his crew but also a greater sense of responsibility for those still trapped in a cerebral prison called, The Matrix. Laurence really explored and embraced the character known as, Morpheus. His instincts tell him it's too dangerous, but his deep, almost romantic, connection with Neo isn't something that can, nor should, be ignored. Morpheus can't express himself physically and is left in a mental prison of his own creation.

Keanu Reeves is possibly the worst actor of all time.  The stupid faces he makes in the fight scenes are laughable and he has the worst voice for delivering serious dialogue.  They even managed to steal a scene from Walt Disney in this drivel when Neo is brought back to life by a kiss.  Most fans of this movie say that those who disliked it ""didn't get it"" and try to make themselves come across as more intelligent by talking about the film's ""deeper meaning"".  Well, as someone who also had to painfully analyze this stinker I can say that there is not one original idea within the script.

658,schmimic,The first chapter of the Matrix trilogy is still far and away the best.,10,1 May 2005,"Starring: Keanu Reeves, Laurence Fishburne, Carrie-Anne Moss, Hugo Weaving ""What is the Matrix?"" The fundamental question that had moviegoers and critics across the world bedazzled in the year of 1999. Science fiction and action movies would never be the same after this blockbuster stormed the scene with its blazingly original visuals and bizarre yet detailed concepts.Thomas Anderson, a.k.a. Neo (Reeves) is a software programmer who is living two lives. In one he is Thomas Anderson, a regular Joe who goes to work, goes to church, and ""helps his landlady take out her garbage."" In the other life, he is Neo, a computer hacker who is guilty of essentially every computer crime there is a law for. One night he's asleep at his computer, when his computer starts talking to him. Not literally, but flashing text across the screen. He follows the instructions his computer is giving him and goes to a club where he meets Trinity (Moss), another hacker, or at least that's what he thinks.When he's at work the next day, a package from FedEx comes to him containing a cell phone. As soon as he gets the phone in his hand, it starts ringing, and Morpheus (Fishburne) is on the other end of the line with him, telling him that the FBI are here to get him. Neo stands up, and sure enough, the fibbies are over at the elevator, ready to come and arrest him. Morpheus gives Neo instructions on how to escape the feds and get to safety, but Neo can't muster the courage to go out on a ledge (literally) and take a scaffold to the roof, so he gets taken in by the feds.After an interesting encounter with the FBI, Neo is contacted again by Morpheus, who tells him where he should go if he wants to meet. They meet, and Neo asks what the matrix is. In the words of Morpheus, ""Unfortunately no one can be told what the matrix is. You have to see it for yourself."" Neo has two options. Take the blue pill, and he continues his life how it has been going. Take the red pill, and enter a whole new world. Of course, he opts for the red pill, and he is released from the matrix and wakes up in the real world.So what is the matrix then? In a nutshell, it's a computer driven simulation that keeps human minds busy so that machines can harvest our bodies for power. Morpheus freed Neo from the matrix because he believed that Neo was essentially the savior of mankind, foretold by the prophecies.I think that's enough of a summary of the gist of the movie. The rest of it you just have to see for yourself. It's truly an amazing action movie with some of the coolest and craziest visuals you could possibly imagine. It's just one of those things that you have to see for yourself to actually believe.Bottom Line: 4 out of 4 (own this movie)",The Matrix
659,warren-87235,It's okay,7,15 July 2021,"The Matrix is an odd one... I've watched it probably four or five times over the years. It's one of those movies that, given the high regard everyone else holds it in, I sometimes re-watch when memory fades enough for me to think ""Maybe I should give it another chance...""A recent re-watch pretty much confirmed my original assessment, which has always been that it was 'okay'. As far as similarly themed movies go, from the same period, I always much preferred Dark City, eXistenZ, or even The Thirteenth Floor.The Matrix has some neat ideas, and it's visually very stylised, but I never find myself warming to any of the characters. The story just kind of washes over you in a pretentious mix of edgy, long, black coats, superfluous sunglasses, and slow-motion gunfire, interspersed with tell-don't-show monologues.It's difficult to warm to characters who all constantly wear tight leather, long cloaks and sunglasses (even in dark rooms) for absolutely zero reason, beyond looking 'cool' for the camera. In fact, it's actually rather foolish because they're trying to blend in to the Matrix, and shouldn't wish to bring attention to themselves.Regarding the characters, there's almost zero building of the lead, Keanu Reeve's 'Neo', before he is thrust into events. After that point, he is simply someone things happen to. I'm not necessarily saying that more time was required (though it wouldn't have hurt) but good writing and good direction can fill out a character very quickly and effectively. We never get to feel or learn anything about Neo. It could be argued that this is the whole point. Perhaps the Wachowskis considered his life irrelevant, 'before' his release. Either way, he's an empty shell of a character.Laurence Fishburne's 'Morpheus' is probably the only one that has any real depth, as the single-minded zealot and leader of the group.Oddly enough, after Morpheus two of the most defined characters are Cypher (A traitor who wants to return to the Matrix) and Agent Smith (An AI hunting Neo). They actually have scenes that establish their feelings and motivations, which are all sorely lacking for anyone else. It's all tell, not show.There's also a romantic element that feels unearned, and non-existent until required. Carrie-Anne Moss' 'Trinity' seems to have feelings for Neo merely because she's supposed to (as informed off-screen by the Oracle). Neo knows nothing of this, and there are no hints of his attachment, until suddenly, at the end, they kiss as though we're witnessing a moment of great depth and emotion.As for the 'philosophy' of the film, I can't help but feel a lot of people read in more than is there. The Matrix is all surface deep, but skirts around interesting topics in such a way that people who wish to see more depth can do so.Oddly, as an action lover, I also find The Matrix leaves me cold. It's reasonably fun, but I never feel particularly engaged with events. There's something that always feels 'detached' about the action. Perhaps it's simply that the action always feels blatantly about the visuals, rather than the characters being in _any_ danger whatsoever?Out of the similarly themed films mentioned above, The Matrix has dated the most. It may have been the most influential, stylistically, but it screams late 90s (which, admittedly, may be because it's a victim of its own success, as the film that perhaps most affirmed that look and style).A lot of it doesn't really stand up to much logic. For example, there's a scene where Agent Smith first has Neo in custody, and is able to block his mouth with flesh, clearly implying their ability to alter the 'code' of the simulation on specific people. This is never used again (Though admittedly, you could argue that they only had this ability while he was _in_ the Matrix properly, as opposed to hooked into it externally).They also have a biomechanical 'bug', that is obviously only a code-representation of a tracer program, but both of these things establish the ability to bring unusual 'out-of-place' items into The Matrix, despite the supposed 'rules' of the code. If that level of manipulation is possible, why don't the agents manifest with bigger weapons? Bombs that simply blow up large areas to get their targets? Helpful devices that prowl the area they're hunting? But no, it's all about the visuals. The men in black suits and sunglasses(again) and single, powerful handguns that can fire in slow motion.I can't rate The Matrix too low, because there's nothing really _bad_ in it. It tells its story, it has plenty of action, and has some interesting ideas. I always feel I should like it more than I do, but frankly, it leaves me a bit cold. It's all flash and little substance, but with a lot of detail to _imply_ substance that isn't really there.",The Matrix
660,MovieMusings,positively splendid,8,20 October 2000,"I can't begin to express how much I enjoyed this film. I planned not to see it, until a friend of mine referred to it in a discussion we were having. I'm not a Keannu Reeves fan, and thought it'd just be fluff, but when he referred to it in the context of our discussion, it definitely raised my eyebrows, so I rented it, and was glad I did.For any who have pondered the enduring questions in life, this film is delightful. The fundamental issues of reality (metaphysical questions), knowledge and truth (epistemological questions) and a little bit of axiology are wrapped in a slick futuristic skin.At the point Reeves' character is first introduced into the matrix, and has difficulty believing what is ""real,"" I asked the question out loud just as Lawrence asked it: ""what IS reality?""

Humans have been targets for annihilation/cultivation by all kinds of thingies (Body Snatchers, Terminator, etc...). Matrix takes a fresh angle, but it's not altogether purely original.MINI SPOILERS AHEAD - Further, in terms of action and style, go and rent Blade and see for yourself that Matrix downright copies almost too much of the Blade screenplay, including and especially the big scene where they enter the building to rescue Morpheus (the black leather overcoats, the glasses, the gun play, etc...) And, let's not forget the most famous and copied Matrix thing - Neo's bullet-dodging moves are just frames spliced right out of the scene in Blade when Blade shoots at Frost and he dodges the bullets, in slow mo', leaning backwards...I'm at a loss for explaining how Matrix got sooo much media coverage for these scenes and Blade got absolutely nothing...but if you watch Blade and then watch Matrix you'll probably also shake your head and wonder...It'll be interesting to see if Matrix Reloaded is as good a sequel as Blade II was.",The Matrix

The other is that between 1999-2004, it was the sworn god of all goth dickwads on the face of the planet.All the actors in this movie, Reeves, Fishburne, the woman who plays Trinity, all of em I can't stand now, just because of all the hyperbole that was cemented into our heads to go see this film even if you've just been diagnosed with terminal cancer.If ever I watch this movie, it's to remind me of the year 1999 and NOT to enjoy the brilliance of it, if there is any.",The Matrix

I can just imagine it, all my convictions and fines disappearing because that was all thought up by some whacked-out X box or something. Actually I really do hope it's real because just look at my name: Neonsamurai. Got that? All right, now read it without the 'nsamurai'. That makes ME 'Neo' or 'The One'. Oh boy am I ever going to kick ass? You wait until the next time I see Derek Palmers! Backflip, punch, head-butt, uppercut! I've already got the cool name, I spend a lot of time on the Internet doing research and when I did have a job I was always late for work. Spooky eh? Plus, can you imagine Morpheus trying to rescue somebody else from the Matrix, such as Dr Stephen Hawking? I can't either. Firstly he hasn't got a cool name like me and secondly I bet he hasn't even watched 'The Matrix' once. I've seen it EIGHT times. You read that right, EIGHT times. Quick question: Hawking vs. me in a fight. Who'd win? Answer: Me! Even if it was a battle of minds, I'd probably still win. Or a game of snap.What with me being 'The One' I'd probably make Famke Janssen my 'Trinity' as I'm pretty sure that in the battery farm where I'm stored, she's got the pod next to me. That's probably why we have such a close affinity with one another. In fact I'm pretty sure that on the other side of me would be a pod with Nicole Kidman in it, except her brain plugs DON'T WORK PROPERLY AND SHE DOESN'T RETURN MY CALLS!

You had your chance and you blew it. So long sister, you're baaaaaad news.When I was in 'House of Fraiser' in Milton Keynes last week I decided it was time for me to get out of the Matrix and meet up with Morpheus, or whoever it is flying those hovercraft things around the sewers. Well let me tell you something; if you want to leave the Matrix don't try jumping through mirrors in a department store, particularly if the mirrors are in the ladies changing room, and you're being chased by security guards. When I got out of hospital that night I decided to do a search for 'Morpheus' on the Internet, but got bored and instead did more research on women's bodies.Morpheus, if you're reading this then hurry up and post me a phone to my mum's house as I'm due in court next week on charges of indecent exposure and criminal damage in a department store.",The Matrix

667,Global_Marketing_Pros,Contrast between sociological purpose and logical design through government,10,26 October 2005,"What if neo got set up for failure just to play with his head by sociological warfare agents fighting the matrix from within. Of course your gonna break the vase if the people on the inside lead you to believe your purpose lay in its path. The Matrix makes a number of symbolic edifices through costume and screen-writing, which show the casual humanistic character verse the straight laced corporate image of the logical design of society, most probably government. Costume and screen-writing are obviously more associated with the actors. However props in this film seem to have keys of suggestion such as the vehicle with suicide doors and the magical predicted breaking vase in the presence of the oracle. Perhaps there is much to learn from the strum of a harp which is music to some actors ears and promises made by a benefactor of an actors trust. What sounds good through a promise based on trust may not materialize due to uncommon valor and a sense of duty. Thus Neo through his bond with Morpheus and quest for his true purpose with his abilities meets any opponent in the matrix with a veracity. Although the climax meets the plot the essence of Zionism through sociological development does not become fully embraced in my opinion. Or perhaps its the grasp around the public telephone and Neo's characteristic voice imprint at the finally that shows the marriage of society and humanity to the directors final intended vision of how the subliminal plot found between screen-writing and props are used throughout this film.",The Matrix
668,im_veritas_photo,How Can Anyone Watch The Matrix More Than One Time?,3,14 April 2007,"I may spend more time writing this comment than any of the 26 others I have completed for IMDb. For one thing, I really need to examine why I have such a totally negative view of this movie, which many others adore so. I do think they must either be 12-year-olds, or older folk with their mental development permanently stunted, stuck forever at the 12-year-old level. Sorry, but that's really the way I feel about anyone who raves about ""The Matrix"". It is sad that I'll spend (waste) my time in this way.Certainly, there are worse movies in the same genre. One example is ""Equilibrium,"" which has achieved the dubious distinction being one of only two films, the other being ""Bloody Sunday,"" with my ""2 out of 10"" rating. Only ""Narc"" got a lower rating (obviously, a ""1"") in my list of IMDb voted-on films. I think that pegs The Matrix at a ""3"", although that may indeed be too generous.I think Keanu Reeves is, generally, a good actor, although many, if not most, of the films in which he has appeared do scant justice to what acting ability he possesses. ""Speed"" comes to mind; a very bad movie. And Reeves definitely comes off as badly in The Matrix as he did in Speed. On the other hand, the relatively unknown film ""Johnny Mnemonic,"" although it obviously falls far short of fulfilling the wild vision of William Gibson's fine short story, gets at least my mild applause; Reeves was as good as he gets in that film, I think. And, guess what? For his Johnny Mnemonic effort, Reeves was nominated for the Razzie Award, as worst actor of the year!I don't know what you call the genre, if only one exists, for The Matrix and Equilibrium. Science Fiction? Cyber-Noir? Impossible Future-Fantasy Kung-Fu? ""Dark City,"" I think, also belongs to this indeterminate genre, but Dark City resides at the best end of its spectrum, as opposed to the other two, which are so abysmally bad they inspire nausea in me. The stunningly beautiful images of Dark City stand in huge contrast to the formulaic shallowness of The Matrix. Well, there can be no comparison, really. Dark City is a great film; The Matrix just isn't. I will try to explain why I have these starkly-opposed opinions...I believe there ought to be at least three criteria for rating any film: Screenplay, Acting, and Production. Of the three, Acting must be at least a bit more important than the other two. Good acting can go far towards rescuing marginal writing or poor production. And bad acting can absolutely ruin an otherwise excellent story and image.The Matrix: The acting is unconvincing. Screenplay: Shallow, displaying no redeeming or memorable story. Production: Dominated by gratuitous special effects, which have little relation to furthering what story there is.I just decided to drop this project.

It may be surprising that I haven't seen this before but I have now so let's move on. I'll just get right into it: this might be my favorite movie. Obviously I'd probably need to rewatch a few times to see if it truly is, but yeah I thought this was a flawless movie. From the opening scene this movie gripped me and my attention didn't waver the entire film. The Matrix has such an amazing concept going for it, and I won't spoil anything at all in case you've never seen it, but this concept has handled so well. It has a lot of biblical and philosophical things behind it that just make it incredibly fascinating to watch. The story, plot, and screenplay were all handled amazingly and the word building is flawless. Keanu Reeves plays our protagonist, Neo, and he goes through this hero's journey that is just handled expertly. The movie looks amazing and has such a distinct style that makes it stand out from everything else. The action might not be your cup of tea, but I thought it was thoroughly entertaining. Even if the action isn't your thing, the best part here is that the movie doesn't make itself about action. Everything that's not action is just done so well, the movie has such an incredible amount of tension, suspense, and momentum. My only problem with this movie is that it ends. I was genuinely depressed when this ended. The movie was not only a super fun ride, a super well crafted ride, but it made me think about life from a different perspective. I'd be glad to discuss this movie more with anyone, but I'm on mobile so I'll end the review here. 10/10, a perfect masterpiece.",The Matrix
674,Chris_Ego,Do you think this is air that you are breathing?,10,8 April 2021,"Watching this 1999 tech noir movie again in 2021 was both a philosophical and nostalgical trip to the past. The film includes so many details you will miss in the first run. This time around I noticed that Neo opens a book named ""Simulacra and Simulation"", which happens to be part of the literature the cast had to read prior to shooting the movie. Actually it is a real good piece of literature for people who like to sharpen their mind and think both critical and philosophical. If you are not into it, then you will feel slightly like the reviewers giving ""The Matrix"" 1 star claiming ""avoid this at all cost"". If you are with me, feel free to continue reading.The story with its thought provoking statements and mind bending perspectives will surely trigger alternative views of the world if you let it. The movie does not claim to be a philosophical guide of some sort. It is just a plot with an intelligent script. I remember after the first time watching the movie I felt invigorated and also a little fragile, almost meaningless. It makes you question life and reflect how you live your life. Movies in general achieve that impact seldom.The fight scenes make huge impressions. Remember: this is the mother of bullet time and freezed 360 shots! There are so many elements mashed together and still it isn't a spoiled broth. The real art lies in the combination of mythology, religion, different kinds of martial arts and action.

676,sside2075,Fantastic,10,9 August 2002,"The Matrix is a superb motion picture on many different levels. The thing that I like most about, which is probably unlike most people, is the plot. Sure the special effects are great, and were especially spellbinding when the movie originally came out, it is the plot that I like best. It makes you think. Although it's highly unlikely, the movie could very well be true. What we perceive as the real world might not be really real after all. It's very intriguing. Also I like how the movie deals with Neo's destiny. I love when character's have a great chosen destiny for them. This is a good movie and everyone should see it. bye.",The Matrix
677,rneil95,Whoa!,10,6 June 2008,"I saw this movie a couple of years ago, when all I wanted was to see some people shoot each other and have my mind blown by state-of-the-art effects. I loved it. But, just yesterday, I watched it again. Finally, everything makes much more sense than before. I will be re-watching Reloaded and Revolutions as well, but this is where I'm at. I thought that Keanu Reeves played Neo, who is the only person who can stop the machines from killing the last human city. Laurence Fishburne plays Morpheus, the guy who explains everything about what the purpose of the Matrix is. Carrie-Anne Moss plays Trinity. She is the first character we meet, and starts this movie off with a bang. She's pretty cool. Now, Smith is played by Hugo Weaving, and is part of the Matrix's computer program. He is a cool villain, who is sadly underused. Hugo Weaving is cool and creepy and all around weird. I loved this movie, and I always will. I will always have it in my DVD collection and hope they come out with a 10th anniversary edition next year.",The Matrix
678,johnfos,The Matrix has Buddhist themes,9,11 June 2005,"A large part of the appeal of 'The Matrix' for me was the special effects and action-packed scenes. But, on reflection, part of the appeal is also its philosophical and religious underpinnings...When asked whether Buddhist ideas influenced them, the Wachowski brothers offered an unqualified ""Yes!"" and at a very basic level, the movie portrays two levels of reality: our everyday existence and a deeper, more significant, underlying reality (the matrix). This is very much like the Two Truths in Buddhism: relative truth, in which everything is perception, and ultimate truth which is the way things really are (objective reality). Because of our ignorance, we mistake the everyday world for something real and objective, and this is the cause of our suffering. As in 'The Matrix', breaking through relative truth to direct contact with ultimate truth represents a high spiritual attainment, some would say enlightenment, an awakening. (Remember the message on Neo's computer screen: ""Wake up, Neo!"")Mahayana Buddhism suggests that there are great spiritual warriors (like Neo?) who are walking the path from ignorance to enlightenment, and who can in turn guide us on the path.",The Matrix

The Matrix is real, it's controllers have a movie making code that can bring humans the ultimate movie watching pleasure, and that they can travel back in time in order to enslave our minds with this WHOPPING MOVIE!!!

Which is more perfect? my head could explode. . .Speaking of head-exploding mystery. . . How did the people who made this movie make Matrix 2 and Matrix 3 so bad? There are movies that are: too violent, too profane, too 'wrong', too sexual, too subversive, too decadent, but I've never seen a movie like this, Matrix is so powerful it boarders on needing to be banned for it's realism, something.

680,s-99188,like,8,15 April 2020,"Revisiting this film, although it was a decade or two ago, is still so technical, the idea is so advanced. Faith from the reins of imagination, the performance of the sky, again let people worship. So, I'm a little worried that the fourth part will be a bad tail of a mink. After all, Keanu is also old, the face is no longer handsome and brave. Watching the ""Matrix"" trilogy, the shock is still there, especially the film in the visual language of the peak of the achievement, is still difficult to overcome. Like that war in the rain, has been a lot of film imitation, salute, but can not be classic to continue. Good film is like this, any time how to wash, still can let people often see Chang Xin, inscription in the heart.

Science fiction and reality, matrix and reality, whether the world we know is a pure world or a world that the brain thinks, is it living unconsciously or waking up painfully in the constructed matrix to fight? ! It's all up to you to choose. In the end, science fiction is actually about the proposition of life. Although the Wachowski brothers are already the Wachowski sisters, and the subsequent rise of Jupiter has received mixed praise and praise, it is no longer difficult to recover the classic of this film, but it is still one of the great directors in my mind!

I saw it a couple of more times and I still liked it, although not as much as the first time.  Now that I've grown up and am much more mature, I know it's ridiculous.  Not very good storyline and Keanu Reeves doesn't know what a great movie is.  On the other hand, Carrie Ann-Moss is a terrific actress and was perfect for the role. The directors try to make the movie longer by moving the storyline slowly, especially the parts where Neo transported to the matrix.  The directors do that only because they don't have any more special effects to put into the movie.  Movies aren't about special effects, they're about acting, such as The Godfather and Marlon Brando.",The Matrix

The story is absolutely mind-twisting, and the creatures look like they are made from the best. There will never be as good a movie as this. The Matrix is basically the coating sealed across everyone's eyes that allows them to live a normal life and see normal things. But one man, Neo Anderson, is dragged into the real world, the place behind the Matrix, which is a prison chamber of life and death. The acting was simply impressive, and the effects blew me away. I wouldn't recommend this movie for young children, or even for preteens. Although, this is a well-made movie, and you would be really missing something by not seeing it.",The Matrix
686,happytoms,Are you the one ?,10,24 June 2019,"If you are looking for the answer to this question then you are going to find it in the 1999 masterpiece from The Wachowski brothers which watching in 2019 still feels like it could have comed out last week and you wouldn't really notice it's a 20 year old movie. Everything still holds up and doesn't feel that it has aged too much both visualy and story wise.
I watched this movie last time in 2012 and remembered quite a lot of the story watching it again in 2019 but this time I paid more attention to everything.I want to talk about few aspects of the movie very brieflyThe story. ( Easy to watch, engaging, action packed about a regular guy whose life changes quite drasticly and the growth of becoming the one he never thought he could.
Sound design. (Excellent. When I watched all the fight,action scenes the special effects gave a satisfying feedback in my ears when someone landed a punch or got knocked out.)
Cinematography (Feels like they thought about everything and it has that special Matrix feel to everything.)
Characters (Most mémorable are Neo which needs no introduction and agent Smith which has a way to intimidate even the viewer and they both are just iconic legends.)Probably my favourite scenes were the lobby,the rooftop and all the fighting scenes against agent Smith where an underdog just tries anyway even knowing his chances of winning are slim.To conclude I would say people in the year 2070 could watch this and it would still hold up. Would I reccomend it? Yes. Will I watch it again ? It's great but I will most likely watch it again in few years after somehow my life leads back to Neo.",The Matrix
687,Cross18,Good....but not great,7,9 December 1999,"What else can I say.....it's a good movie but not great like I heard most people say it was.  I know, everybody else is calling it a ""deep"" movie that will change the way you look at the world around us.....but I gotta tell ya, it was just another sci-fi actioner to me. And let's face it, Keanu Reeves has about as much acting talent as Steven Seagal.  But that's okay as long as he sticks to action films and doesn't try to breakout into more serious fare.  Anyways, good action, good special effects=good sci-fi action movie. I've seen better in the same genre, such as Blade or Soldier. agree?

The good things about the movie is that the special effects are groundbreaking, the effects are original and unlike anything you've ever seen before in sf movies, the action sequences are stirring, storytelling is compelling and smartly constructed, it has brilliant ideas, strong human thinking and there is an awesome and completely believable central villain character (definitely putting him on my favorite movie villains list) and there are much more good things still. One thing however is that the Matrix lacks humor and I'm sure that a little dose of humor would have helped strengthen the script even more and make the Matrix even more memorable. Aside from that the film is perfect. My rating: 7.2/10",The Matrix
689,SlimeyPete,Very overrated,2,6 May 2002,"A few weeks ago I took my Matrix DVD out of my collection and, because I was bored, decided to ring up my mate and tell him that either he takes it off me or I burn it. I had the matches ready and everything, and would have conducted a fascinating experiment into the effect of touching a DVD with a naked flame had he not agreed to let me give it to him. I kid you not.
This film is the worst waste of twenty quid I have ever bought. The psuedo-intelectual claptrap (""Hey, what if the world isn't real after all""???? Yawn, like I didn't already think of that when I was about five years old) is used to cover the fact that the main characters and large chunks of the plot were obviously, ahem, ""influenced by"" William Gibson's classic pulp-sci-fi tale 'Neuromancer', ie. they are largely identical (including the role of each character within the narrative) but have had their names or skin colour changed. The visuals are quite pretty but again are totally lacking in innovation except for the 'Bullet Time' gimmick, which is fun to watch but not as impressive as had been made out. At least it wasn't over-used. Then we move onto the acting: Fishburne is fine, as is Moss, but Keanu drags the film into new depths of rubbishness with his trademark lack of emotion or even the slightest indication of sentience, ruining some lines that should sound great. Finally, the action sequences are well-choreographed but somehow seem flat, as if the pacing is a little off.I won't be going to see the sequels.",The Matrix
690,TheBillionthGuyNamedJack,Thought Provoking,8,28 April 2020,"Most of the Matrix's performances are overall cliche, Keanu Reeves isn't rocked to the core when he learns he's living in a simulation. However, there was redemption beyond that point. The special effects are a bit dated, but they're still interesting. Hugo Weaving gives a cool and intimidating performance as Agent Smith. The characters, although not always sharp, stir interesting thoughts within the viewer's mind. The movie made me question the weight of their world and whether I would want to live in a monotone but safe lie or a bleak dangerous reality.

693,ThatAnimeSnob,A wannabe philosopher with cool shades,8,19 March 2013,"In its basic formula The Matrix is a more than typical teen adventure for all those who want to escape in a world where you can look cool, and gain superpowers, and fight a shady organization that enslaves the world, and get the girl. Throw in a convenient power up just for the sake of winning when everything feels lost and you have a cheesy fighting shonen anime to win the kid audience.As cheesy as it is, it has a very high budget that makes all the above to look marvelous. It has famous actors, cool clothes, detailed machinery, attention to physics, and lots of cinematics such a slow motion, big explosions, and shrapnel falling all over the place. That is enough to win all those who seek fancy visuals and shallow entertainment. It also has dozens of symbolisms and allusions to philosophy and religion that really make you think about the meaning of life, god, freedom, and all those existentialist stuff. That is enough to offer a superficial depth to win all the wannabe brainiacs. Oh but wait, did I just call it superficial? Why yes I did; because it is. All the above elements are just fan service and despite all the attempts to make it intellectual, it fails in the longrun. And by longrun I mean the next movies which try to expand the concept, only to open more plot holes and inconsistencies as it goes on and on. By the time the final showdown took place in the third film, I just didn't care anymore about the outcome, and even the epilogue was disappointing. Anyways, The Matrix is philosophical first, action second, and sci-fi third. There is a bit of everything in it to please anyone who doesn't try to think too much of how plausible are all the stuff that happen in it; in-logic or not. It managed to be something very few films managed to achieve over the years and it is a high recommendation. Could they have made it better? Sure; but the point was to have fun and think a bit and not to go kamikaze on hard-science.",The Matrix
694,panchodh_12,First XXI century movie,9,10 August 2014,"1999 was an excellent year movie-wise. American Beauty, Fight club, The Green Mile, Being John Malkovich... all excellent movies. Now this is something different. This is not just a great movie, it also marks the end of the 20th century and the beginning of the 2000s decade. I mean, just how more 2000s does it get than Keanu Reeves in a black robe avoiding bullets? The Matrix is a classic. It has already become a classic. From the red-and-blue pills scene to the ""I know kung fu"" quote (the decade's ""We'll always have Paris"" or ""I am your father"", if you allow me the exaggeration), going through Neo's awakening schene, this movie is already deeply embedded in popular culture. And it deserves to: it is beautifully shot, the story is very well-paced, it is entertaining and it does include enough elements potentially iconic (Morpheus' sunglasses, Agent Smith's accent...). But what makes this movie a classic, beyond anything else, is the issues it deals with. What makes a classic is its ""timeless quality"", as Wikipedia says. And for something to be timeless, it must relate to Humanity's core, those things that can be reach both me and someone who was born in 2 A.D. Now something that every human can relate to is feelings. Love, pain, fear of death. Which is why most classics are love stories (just think of Romeo and Juliet). But this is not what The Matrix mainly brings about. What makes The Matrix a classic is that it deals with those big questions that have troubled philosophers (and people in general) since Socrates' times. I'm not gonna list all the philosophical issues in here because somebody has probably already done it, but let me quickly enumerate a few from the top of my mind: duality mind-body, evil genius dilemma, freedom as moral self-direction (I cannot set free somebody else but myself), man-machine relationship, Utopia, the issue of fate, the ""what makes a human being"" question (our own impulses according to Mouse), my freedom's interaction and interdependence with the subjectivities around me... If I was a philosophy teacher, I would totally screen this movie on the first day of classes. Needless to say this is a must-see, specially that hour between the red pill and the plot's main complication, just before all the action starts. That part of the movie is worth watching three, four times, because it's not something you see everyday.",The Matrix
695,mhajs,"A great sci-fi movie, that maybe almost matches Star Wars.",10,5 January 2006,"**** out of **** What a fantastic movie this one is! I'm so amazed at how the Wachowski Brothers were able to imagine such a creative science-fiction world like this one, probably the most fictitious, unbelievable, strange, yet, interesting futuristic world I've seen in a movie. Perhaps I became even more fascinated with this futuristic world than the computer-generated dream world that is the matrix. The way the story is told is simply brilliant! I can't believe this hasn't even been nominated for a ""best screenplay"" written directly for the screen award, but never mind.For me, this might be the next Star Wars. Many will disagree with me, complaining that Star Wars is much more classic, but the Matrix is a huge achievement in science fiction film-making.I really enjoy these post-apocalyptic movies where some kind of disaster has changed humankind's fate forever and now, it's up to them to fight in order to survive in a much more life-challenging world. In The Matrix, people now live miles and miles below the ground, near the earth's core, because the surface is all controlled by machines. Inventive, isn't it? The Matrix is the finest example of how good writing can really create worlds.",The Matrix

To truly appeciate this movie,the only medium worth viewing it on outside a cinema would be a DVD.The DVD is a must for all fans since it provides insight into the making of a mega sci-fi movie.I look forward to the sequels and I am sure that the Wachowski brothers will get back to work in their usual passionate way to produce trilogy- like episodes.Lucas would have loved to have this movie to his name but for me Star Wars is still the benchmark against which all sci-fi productions must be measured by if only for the reason that it is a true trilogy.",The Matrix
698,roark183,"Fast Paced Action Thriller, but no science",10,14 April 2002,"Matrix presents interesting concepts about time and space and certainly has plenty of action.  However, while it is billed as science fiction, there is little to no science.  The movie's greatness all lies in its action.In a science fiction movie I always hope for some science being part and parcel to the plot.  There are few such movies out there that do this. The Philadelphia Experiment (1984), Andromeda Strain, & The Thirteenth Floor do this.  But they are few and far between.  Some science fiction novels that do this are Dune, Battlefield Earth (the best in this regard), Resurrection.But those looking for action and thrills will not be disappointed in Matrix.

699,Shecky J. O'Pootertoot,Hong Kong/American hybrid done right,10,7 July 2000,"Have you noticed over the past decade or so a lot of American films have been trying to capture that Hong Kong feeling but rarely succeed? Why do most of them suck so bad? Could it be the crappy stories? No, HK films have plenty of those (sorry Mr. Woo). I think it's the American's inability to totally go for broke in the action scenes. The Matrix could have been made without a huge gun battle at the end, but what fun would that be? That was just the iceing on the cake (the cake being the terrific story cooked up by the Wachowski bros).Okay, buy now we all know what an amazing film The Matrix is, so let me sprinkle a few of my thoughts about it here. Let's start with Keanu. In one of the most interesting reviews I read in praise of this film, someone dissected why Keanu Reeves was the perfect choice to star in this film. Now, if you're like me, you're not a huge Keanu Reeves fan. Matter of fact, before seeing it my opinion of the Matrix was, ""Looks cool. Too bad it's starring Keanu"". Well, he didn't bother a bit, in fact I rather enjoyed his performance in it. Before seeing it, the opinion of a wide variety of people was ""I do not buy Keanu Reeves as an action hero"". Well, that's exactly why he works. Walking in to the movie we don't believe he could be the chosen one of anything. Gradually, he starts to win us over and by the end, even the hard core Keanu haters are cheering him on. Why? Because he doesn't believe he's the chosen one either. We don't buy it and neither does his character, Neo (anagram, anyone?), Which makes his transformation at the end all the more powerful. Making him just right for this movie.Now, a word to critics who disliked the film because it ""degenerated"" into a mindless shoot-em-up in the last half hour. Some saw this film as a thought provoking science fiction movie on par with Dark City and Blade Runner that lost its brains in the third act. Let's clarify something. THIS IS AN ACTION MOVIE. That is what this movie is, it just confuses some people because it actually has a story (a first for most summer action movie fans). How can we beg for summer action blockbusters that actually have a plot, and then chastise it when it finally comes along? Is that fair? Instead of thinking of it as a smart Sci-fi with unnecessary action scenes, think of it as an action film with a smart story. It's just that easy.And lastly, it needs to be pointed out that the Matrix is a total rip-off of Grant Morrison's The Invisibles comic book. I know, you're thinking, ""Well, everything is ripped off of something and you can probably trace all stories back to the Holy Bible in some form or another"". Well, that what I thought until I actually saw the book myself. To sum up the book as Grant himself did once, The Invisibles is the story of a group of people dressed in leather led by a bald guy in sunglasses that's trying to make humanity see that the world they know is not the real world, all the while being hunted by a group of inhuman ""agents"" who don't want this to happen. Eerie coincidences, eh? No, not really. The Wachowskis are former comic writers themselves (I even have a few of the Hellraiser stories one of them did). They frequently collaborate with comic artists, recently on The Matrix web site and in the comic book handed out at the Matrix screenings ('till it got pulled), and some top comic artists designed machines used in the movie and did story boards for the film. Oh, and Warner Bros owns DC Comics, publisher of Grant's Invisibles comic. I smell a conspiracy, Agent Mulder. Because of the Matrix, Grant will never get an Invisibles movie made without comparisons being made to the Matrix, and his movie would be seen as a rip off of Matrix, instead of the other way around. Grant himself admits that he loves the movie, but I think he's through with DC saying something to the effect of, ""I won't be used as cheap source of ideas for Warner Bros movies"". He still hasn't received any aknowldgement for his part, and of coarse he hasn't recieved any money from it. It's a shame, really. Would Grant's Invisibles have made as good a film as the Matrix? I doubt it, but it would have been nice to see.That said, I loved this movie. Can't wait for the sequel(s?). 10/10 stars. G'night!",The Matrix
700,david_popa,The best movie of '99,10,19 July 2000,In my opinion this amazing movie is the best action movie in '99 and maybe more.

702,connor-macgregor,The Matrix Review,6,15 September 2013,"Connor Macgregor Reviews...The MatrixI have only seen The Matrix once and that was when i was about 10 or 11 and i had seen Matrix 2 first. I found Matrix 1 to be boring and drone on. But now i am 16 and with much more useful knowledge i am going to review it properly.So if you haven't worked out the plot by now here it is in all its glory. Thomas A. Anderson is a man living two lives. By day he is an average computer programmer and by night a malevolent hacker known as Neo. Neo has always questioned his reality but the truth is far beyond his imagination. Neo finds himself targeted by the police when he is contacted by Morpheus, a legendary computer hacker branded a terrorist by the government. Morpheus awakens Neo to the real world, a ravaged wasteland where most of humanity have been captured by a race of machines which live off of their body heat and imprison their minds within an artificial reality known as the Matrix. As a rebel against the machines, Neo must return to the Matrix and confront the agents, super powerful computer programs devoted to snuffing out Neo and the entire human rebellion.So as story and plot goes it is really cyberpunky and futuristic like. When i was watching it i felt like The Matrix was a Cyberpunk film with everyone wearing shades and leather jackets. It felt really futuristic. Nevertheless the plot was really good and kept me really on the edge of my seat. The Characters each had a different personality and fit into the story well.Acting. Really well done. Keanu Reeves does his ""Hi I'm Keanu Reeves"" acting by standing,staring and blinking and people just go up and admire him like artwork. Lawrence Fishburne is ace as Morpheus and one of the best bad asses i have seen on the screen in a while. The others are mediocre but the star of the show goes to Hugo Weaving as Agent Smith. I love Smith as a baddie. Just his personality and presence on screen was a complete stand out from the crowd.The action sequences were also original and impressive to watch,especially the final scene between Agent Smith and Neo. If you haven't seen the sequels then they have more in the future. The slow motion stuff is also well shot and well documented into the film. The Special Effects gave the film a personality in my eyes like no other film did before.Overall what can i say. I enjoyed The Matrix now and i will certainly get my teeth into Matrix 2 and Matrix 3 (Which i haven't seen yet...except the ending)Overall Rating - 67% - B - *** Stars",The Matrix
703,patrickwigington,Trip Through the Wires,6,1 September 2012,"Looking back at the cyberpunk blockbuster, The Matrix is like a time capsule and culmination of the science fiction movies of the 90's. It's scenes and ideas have become iconic, and that makes it a classic, although more because of its importance rather than it being a great film in and of itself.The Matrix certainly has a technical brilliance that had a huge effect on the way action movies were filmed. And unlike the deplorable shaky cam aspects of the Bourne movies, the style of The Matrix at least made the action movies that stole from it a little more visually pleasing. The Wachowski brothers certainly created a world that was fascinating to think about and entertaining to watch. While their movie ends up not going quite as far as it could and should have, they made a visually groundbreaking movie that incorporates a lot of interesting and complex philosophical ideas, although the movie doesn't quite live up to the ambitions it sets up for itself.Other movies from the 90's had similar plots to this one, most notably Dark City, The Truman Show and Strange Days in the fact that the world that we live in is far different that what it seems. The Matrix is, of course, a computer generated world simulating the world as it was in 1999, when in reality the year is closer to 2199, with all humans plugged into the Matrix, and used as batteries for sentient robots that have taken over the world. That premise alone is enough to create a good and interesting movie. The main character Neo, however, also happens to be the Chosen one; the human that will end the war between those humans that have woken up from the Matrix and the machines that want them dead. The interesting thing about the characters that have woken up, is that they can plug back into the Matrix when they need to. And since they know they are in a virtual reality, they can manipulate it to be great fighters and defy gravity and all that good stuff. Neo, being the chosen one, is thought to be able to manipulate the Matrix even more than the other enlightened ones.Keaunu Reeves plays Neo, in the same vein as Harrison Ford or Bruce Willis, in that his acting is going out of his way to do not much at all. This is fine enough, but since Reeves lacks the charisma that Ford and Willis posses, it makes it hard to really care about him as a character. However, Lawrence Fishborne as Morpheus, the wise and powerful guru figure, is an excellent and enjoyable character. He gives off the air of calmness and ease in a world that is controlled by fear and chaos. Carrie-Anne Moss is also excellent as Trinity, the kick ass chick that Neo inevitably falls in love with. And there is also Hugo Weaving, who plays Agent Smith, a program designed to look like a human inside the Matrix that is sent to kill all those humans that keep trying to wake people up. He and the other agents have significant abilities when it comes to altering the Matrix. They can dodge bullets with ease, and can easily fight any human. Weaving is a highlight of the movie, giving a memorable and vicious performance.One of the most interesting aspects of this movie is the idea of making a choice. This is most notably shown in the scene where Neo has the choice to take the blue pill, which will send him back to his bed and he will never have to worry about what the Matrix is, or the red pill, which is akin to some form of psychedelic. Neo takes the latter, and becomes enlightened, waking up in a tub surrounded by other humans plugged into the Matrix. The direct effect of taking the red pill is ambiguous, and creates a layer to the movie that makes it both more interesting and more fun. Choice shows up throughout the course of the movie, especially with the Oracle, a wise old lady who lives in the Matrix and predicted the coming of the Chosen one to end the war between man and machine.Neo then meets the characters on the flying ship the Nebuchadnezzar, including Morpheus and Trinity, as well as other characters that end up being completely inconsequential considering they all die. The character Cypher, played by Joe Pantoliano is probably the worst of these characters. He ultimately betrays the crew of the ship to Agent Smith because he wants to be plugged back into the Matrix. Pantoliano plays the character as a total scumbag that is considerably unlikable. This may be what the Wachowski brothers intended, but it doesn't make for an interesting character. There is simply nothing to like about the man; he is like a neighbor you avoid because he does too much cocaine.The Matrix has its faults, but it is an entertaining and important movie. The fight scenes are a huge part of the experience, based on those old school, gravity defying Kung Fu movies. The choreography of the fights is exquisitely done by Yuen Woo-ping, who would later go on to choreograph the fights in Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon and Quentin Tarantino's Kill Bill. The use of slow motion and it's ""bullet time"" effect, which allowed the characters to freeze mid air and look exceedingly bad ass is another very cool trademark of the movie.This science fiction movie created an intriguing world and an exciting story. Visually stunning and action packed, The Matrix is a fun movie to watch, even though it doesn't live up to its own ambitions, and the end becomes tangled in a web of convoluted silliness. It is none the less an important and entertaining achievement.thatguythatlikesmovies.blogspot.com",The Matrix
704,nunoaraujoduarte,movieinthepark.blogspot.com,8,9 November 2011,"The Wachowski brothers are starting to gain their own space in the American Cinema. The Matrix was their first big hit. The first of this very successful trilogy incorporates one of the biggest moments of 1999 cinema has offered. Would you take the blue pill, or the red one? That applies to almost every second of our life, and whether you want it or not, choosing between the comfort of the easy way, keeping your mind away from the brutality of the cold knowledge or the opposite one. Easy to say, bloody hard to materialise. If you don't agree, you've taken the blue pill way to many times. Keanu Reeves is good, as Laurence Fishburne, Carrie-Anne Moss and Hugo Weaving. I won't analyse the fighting or the incredibly hot chick with amazing skills in fighting that we can presumes since the beginning that will end up in love with the main character, that was obviously included for selling, and obviously resulted. Apart from that, is amazing how you find out great deep thoughts in common movies such as The Matrix, and the pills scene is not the only one, the movie as a great connection with the last year Crhis Nolan hit Inception, as both ask what makes reality more real than everything else that we assume not to be. I don't agree very much Morpheus point of defining reality though, but the idea remains. 8/10",The Matrix

Now they originally planned to make 3 but they put too much plot in this one and excluded the need for a sequel which is why the second and third one were just plain bad. spoiler!!!!!!My favorite seen and i'm sure i'm not alone here but it's just before the helicopter when Neo sees the agent and yells out ""Trinity.....Help"" Bang the agent fires, neo twists the agent fires again and again and neo slowly dodges the bullets until his knees are completely bent then he gets shot and falls then the agent aims at neo and says ""Only Human"" then trinity puts her gun to his head ""Dodge this"" BANG the agent dies.

706,tkdlifemagazine,The Most Important Film of the 21st Century?,9,10 September 2021,"O be clear- this is a a review of this film ONLY, not the Matrix Series. The Matrix is one of the most iconic, stunning, and transformative films of the 21st Century (1999 really). It is perhaps one of the most important films ever. It transformed filmmaking with its visual impact as well as its substantive content. Its genuinely original look at the world and the place of human beings in the ""Matrix"" is complex and compelling but addictively engaging. Keanu Reeves, Carrie Moss, and Laurence Fishburne, and Hugo Weaving give the performances of their careers in this film, which has been copied for two decades but never equalled or exceeded. It spawned an entire generation of films, including John Wick. It's visuals, cinematography, and special effects are ahead of its time. It's fight and action choreography demonstrated that they can have an equal place in blockbuster fillmmaking. Many of the concepts and language infiltrated the social language in ways only topped by The Star Wars franchise. This one is to be seen again (and again) and still holds up. This, unlike the sequels, is a must see.",The Matrix
707,MicheBel,The Matrix Has You,10,2 June 2000,"I can't remember the last movie that I saw in the theatre seven times. I just couldn't get enough of The Matrix. Still can't (I just caught it again on cable). It's got everything: cool sci-fi techo storyline, a love story, lots of slam-bang action scenes, great martial arts, wonderful actors, visuals to die for, fabulous Chicago brothers who directed...In short, everything you could ask for in a movie.But the best thing, for me, is how spiritual the movie really is. I'll never forget sitting in a huge packed theatre, with the entire audience SILENT, struggling to get the concepts being thrown at them between high kicks. There is a reason why this movie kicked Phantom Menace's butt at the Academy Awards this year. And it's not just because of the amazing visuals. It's because the STORY of The Matrix was everything we used to go to Star Wars for: the good guys winning, the connection with the Force, it's all there, and in a very 90s/new millennium way.God, I just LOVED this movie! See it, if you haven't already.",The Matrix
708,Lunchbox-8,Beautiful film,9,17 January 2001,"""The Matrix"" is one of the best Science Fiction movies of all time.  It yields a great plot, characters, and action, as well as a theory about human existence and life as we know it and implies a warning about the control of Artificial Intelligence.  This movie was released at the perfect time.  When it was released in 1999, the world still was frightened of the Y2K problem, which might have become a problem related to the problem in ""The Matrix."" Also, Artificial Intelligence was (and still is) just arond the corner, frightening audiences world wide.  The third reason that it's release was impeccably timed was that special effects allowed ""The Matrix"" to become more than a Sci-Fi/Drama, it became a Big Action/Sci-Fi film with a dramatic story.   The way this movie was filmed and directed really made the entire film worth-while to see.  The special effects, though made in 1998-99, are still cutting edge.  The camera angles actually show a bullets path as well as a way to rotate around a great fight scene in slow motion.  The camera angles were just fabulous and turned ""The Matrix"" into an even better directed film than it already was.  Another cool directorial attribute that made the film even better than it would have been was that most of the color blue, only in the Matrix not reality, was taken out to make the setting look dismal and show that the Matrix really was a repressive and depressing place.  Many questions are raised after seeing this movie.  Although I can't reveal them now, I can tell you that this movie is worth seeing for maybe only this reason if you're not big on movies but you are big on philosophy. The directors created a wonderful picture that was beautifully directed and superbly acted.  I can't say enough for this movie, it was just amazing. You could see this movie and enjoy it, but I know that you'll do more than that, you'll see this movie and be amazed.",The Matrix
709,hukaiqun,Love it,9,31 March 2020,"I read it used to be one of Tarantino's favourite ones too, but the second and third ones ruined the whole beautiful idea and brought the overall value of the movie pretty low.remembered quite a lot of the story watching it again in 2019 but this time I paid more attention to everything.",The Matrix
710,cannabinosa,The ultimate action movie!,8,10 November 2020,The only thing i did not like about this one was the power up that Neo got by the power of love.

711,Sudarshan_Pawar,One of the Best Sci-Fi movie,10,21 August 2020,"""The Matrix"" concept that is introduced in the movie is outstanding.
This movie has a very good storyline. Visuals and sound effects are also good.
Action scenes are a delight to watch. No wonder that this movie has won 4 Oscars. It's worth it.Must Watch Movie in Lifetime.",The Matrix
712,formicidae,Whoa.,10,18 July 2001,"This movie really has it all, and even though that sounds like a bought and paid for testimonial that some crap movie would shell out for, it's the real deal with The Matrix.It looks good: The Wachowski brothers continue their beautiful work (after Bound) to give The Matrix a visual richness that most directors today seem to ignore. Great angles that let you actually see what's happening, moody sets that really create an atmosphere even before anything is said, and well placed and utilized special effects that don't take over the theme are all examples of where these guys are coming from. I think they call it ""vision"" in directors. Whatever it is, the Wachowskis have it, and they don't just make movies, they craft them.The characters are solid: Sure, hack on Keanu all you want, but he fits the role of Neo to a tee, and I can't think of anyone who would have been more convincing. (As convincing, sure, but no one moreso.) Fishburne, Pantoliano, Moss, and Weaving are subtley brilliant, playing up their characters without going over the top. There is not a wasted word of dialogue, and it is all delivered in just the right way. Delicious!The Plot is as cool as Terminator, but with more philosophy: The Matrix actually makes you think, and while that is good in any movie, it is even more golden in an action-driven movie like this. Not only do we have to question the age old dilemma about what makes us exist (We are if we think we are? Would it be better to be a happy brain in a vat or a miserable person?), but we also get to play with the entire meaning of the Matrix itself. Personally, I think The Matrix is actually the mass media/materialistic society itself that has blinded us into being mere consumers. My metaphor has Neo discovering that the real world needs him to be more than some working stiff cog in the machine--it needs him to break out of the consumerist cloud we all walk in to become a modern day revolutionary. But that's just me. The movie works no matter what you read into it.Finally, the special effects are special: I don't usually put much stock into effects. A movie that hypes tricks isn't usually much of a movie. The Matrix, however, really uses the effects to propel the plot and give the atmosphere some credibility. In other words, I don't think the movie was conceived to showcase some breakthrough techniques in cinematography, I think the story was there and they needed some good visuals to help tell it properly. There's a big difference.When all is said and done, The Matrix is one of those movies that I can watch over and over again without getting bored, it is just so well done. I give it a perfect 10 without hesitation--I can't ask for anything more.",The Matrix
713,xanderlm,Still a great movie after 22 years!!,10,16 October 2021,"I first saw The Matrix on its initial theatre release back in 1999. I've seen bits and pieces of it over the years on TV but hadn't really sat down to watch if again properly until now having bought The Matrix Trilogy on Blu-ray. The movie is still a great sci-fi flick and worthy of being called one of the best. The fights scenes, although a little slow this day and age, are well choreographed and heavy hitting - I particularly enjoy when people get thrown against or through walls and this movie has plenty of that! The bullet time effects and slow motion shots still hold up, and even though other films have copied it, The Matrix was the original and still does it better if you ask me. The storyline still feels futuristic even after 22 years and the CGI, although looking a tad dated, is still pretty sharp mostly (better than what was in the sequel, The Matrix Reloaded, oddly). The story can get a little confusing at times for new comers, infact there were things in this viewing that I had not picked up on or understood previously so just one viewing may not be enough to truely appreciate the film. The one thing the film didn't do for me however was the emotional relationships - I liked the characters, but the relationship between Neo and Trinity felt a bit forced for my liking. My favourite scene is the fight in the Subway between Agent Smith and Neo - it was a great lead in and a very back and foward encounter with neither man truely gaining the upperhand.",The Matrix
714,al_phillips2000,Revolutionary,9,4 January 2002,"Simply one of the best action films of all time. Only Keanu Reeves mars this production. Good acting (besides Reeves), good dialog, good story, good effects, good combat scenes. You must see the DVD or Collector's Edition, which explains the bullet-time photography concept.

It's that influential and it ages like fine wine. It's got a fantastic cast and it spawned 2 sequels which weren't quite as good, but still worthy of a great trilogy. This film will go down in history as one of, if not the best Sci fi movie of all time. If you haven't seen it, you are missing out.",The Matrix
716,R-P-McMurphy,One of the coolest movies of all time,10,15 August 2013,"One of the coolest movies of all time, ""The Matrix"" has everything I could ask for in a movie. It has great action in it and thoughtful subtext that will keep you thinking after the movie ends.The year is 1999... Or is it? It's actually closer to 2199 and humans are being controlled by machines, they have them stuck inside a program that simulates real life called ""The Matrix"" while they feed on them for energy. It's up to a group of people fighting the system and a new recruit, Neo (Keanu Reeves), to free the people from enslavement.Director Darren Aronofsky thought that ""The Matrix"" redefined Sci-Fi movies, and I agree, what it did has yet to be matched by modern science fiction films that tend to lean towards visuals and give no importance towards action and fight choreography like what we can see here. The use of slow motion is perfect, it's used to highlight the action and give the viewer the feeling that he's right in the middle of it, unlike modern action movies with all the shaky cams.The underlying themes it deals with are what makes it far superior than any other action or science fiction movies and leaves the audience with something to talk about. It deals with some of the same things Stanley Kubrick dealt with in ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" in the 60's, they're themes that are even more interesting now that we live in a society that depends on technology and for that it's a movie that's way far ahead of its time.I'm not even going to mention the sequels, I see ""The Matrix"" as a stand-alone feature so I'm just going to ignore they even exist. As Quentin Tarantino said, the sequels ruined the mythology to it, I couldn't agree more, but I think that when you forget the sequels even happened it's a masterpiece.It's hard to see how Hugo Weaving didn't get more recognition for his performance as Agent Smith, he plays one of the most terrifying villains of all time, his screen presence is always felt and the way he delivers his lines (specially when he says ""Mr. Anderson"") is something that would fit perfectly in a horror film.If you haven't seen it yet, I'd recommend it to anyone it to anyone, specially whoever liked ""Wall-E"", ""Terminator 2: Judgement Day"", ""Inception"", ""Equilibrium"", ""Dark City"", ""The Wolverine"", ""Twelve Monkeys"", ""Minority Report"", ""Sin City"", and ""Looper"".",The Matrix
717,asiduodiego,"Somewhat unoriginal, but a visual achievement",8,20 March 2011,"Matrix was, in many ways, the minor ""Star Wars"" of the 90s: an unoriginal and arch-repeated story, but told and crafted in such a creative way, that it works!. The story of the ""chosen one"" in his path to discover his powers is older than graphite pencils, but, the visuals and the setting are impressive enough to makes us forget that and enjoy the ride. Keanu Reeves is a great choice for the role of ""Neo"", and the supporting cast is good enough also. The story is crafted as a mystery at the beginning, and then begins the classic ""hero's journey"". And, at the end (spoilers!), unsurprisingly, the character becomes a ""superhuman"", inside the Matrix and kills the bad dude: a nice closed loop, which doesn't leave much space for sequels, which is the main reason of why the following movies in the ""saga"" are just a shameful mess.But, Matrix, as a stand-alone film, is very good. The only problems I can think of, are some issues with the acting (Carrie Ann Moss was somewhat dull), the over-pretentiousness of the plot: it took itself way too seriously, being as it was, just an unoriginal sci-fi collage, and the visual style grew old too fast, now a days the characters look dressed as a bunch of emo-kids. But, those are details and nitpicking. It's a good, intense and entertaining action flick. Check it out.8/10",The Matrix

If you haven't rented any of the last year's sci-fi flicks (Lost in Space, Deep Impact, Godzilla, Armageddon), better do it now because after seeing The Matrix they'll look like s**t (Godzilla looks like it anyway, but...).As any friend can attest, I see a lot of films. I have my own laser disc home theater. I haven't been tempted to see a film twice in the theater since...

720,Starks,This Movie Lived Up to the Hype,7,11 May 1999,"I saw the Matrix this past weekend and I was very impressed by it.  While I have certainly seen better sci/fiction films and better action films, it was nice to see the two genres combined so nicely. I would rank it up there with Terminator and Alien (s).  The story took a while to get going and there are also a few moments where you try to figure what Larry (whoops sorry, Laurence) Fishburne is talking about, but once everything gets on track it is a fun ride.  My one complaint is that except for a few instances you never felt any empathy for the lead characters.  In other action adventure films or sci fi flix you care if something happens to Luke Skywalker, or Ripley or Indiana Jones.  In this you don't really care (at least I didn't) if Keanu or Larry kicked the bucket.  A little more character development would have made me care a little more and would have put me on the edge of my seat.

721,Serva,I fell asleep the second time I saw this movie,1,23 February 2001,"I really can't see what everyone thinks is so great about this movie, I think it is wildly over-rated. The special effects? Fore example the bullet scene: like another user said before me, it's slow-motion, and it's been around for a while! The bullets don't even look realistic at all. The other effects aren't that impressive especially not the robot guys that cut themselves into the ship in the end, they look awkwardly badly done, you can easily tell that they are CG. That Episode I lost all its Oscars to this movie is a big joke and it was sure as hell the last time I went up 3 in the morning (I live in Sweden, another time zone) just to see that lot of hypocrisy.I'm a big fan of (most) science-fiction movies and series, especially Star Wars but the plot in this one has too many obvious loose ends. ****possible spoilers ahead**** Humans to warm the earth? Yeah right umm, what about building a large battery and some kind of warmth generator instead? Or using less complicated minds like cows instead of humans then they wouldn't have to worry about that stupid matrix thing.The movie is also cluttered with clichés like ""There is no spoon"".

723,Skeptic459,There is no spoon...,8,25 December 2003,"This of one of the many psuedo-philosophical statements that is uttered by one of the minor character's of the film. The Matrix is a geeky film. Everyone, especially Morpheus speak in semi-priest like ravings. His character is based on John the baptist, isn't it? Everyone has stupid computer geek like names, like Neo or Tank. It should be annoying and cringe inducing. Bringing up images of geeky computer nerd, teenage goths. You know, those ones that spend all their time listening to Skinny Puppy and quoting Nietzsche out of context. The ones that dress like Mortis the Depeche Mode goblin.However despite all its faults this is an exceptional film. A film that when it came out was thrilling and innovative. This film made the 'Phantom Menace' look like what it is, a piece of crap. The Wachowski brothers have shown their influences to range from Jean Baudrillard, gnostic thought to Japanese anime such as 'Ghost in the Shell.' There is lots of stuff going on within the narrative and its refreshing to see an action film that has something of a brain. See Hollywood you can still make films with explosions and not always go for the lowest common denominator.The problem was that it was so good that a sequel was inevitably doomed unless more innovative stuff was put into the film. Empire magazine wrote an article on the state of the art special effects that were used in 'Reloaded.' However it was the actual concepts that got people excited and the next film only offered some flimsy philosophical ideas on free will.
This film has been embraced by so many crusty academics and religious zealots who use this film to push their own ideologies. Everyone took this film way to seriously. I mean it's like 'Fight Club,' it is a thrilling ride but thats about it. Christians say that you free your mind by believing in a spiritual reality. Media professors state the matrix is a metaphor for the media, which controls attitudes and perceptions. Psychologists tell me that the matrix is a metaphor for the mind. All reality is perception, therefore when you change cognitions, you change your reality. Free your mind. There are other interpretations but you do you get my drift?  The fact that it has got the attention of so many different kinds of intelligent people is a good example of why this is such a good film. It really grabs the imagination of the audience.The  film is competent. I'm not use to seeing competence in sci-fi films. I am still getting over 'The Shape of things to come.' However everyone does well here. One of my favourite characters is actually Morpheus who is very well played by Laurence Fishburne. He pulls off some pretty difficult dialogue convincingly. Keanu 'Whoa! I still can't act' Reeves even manages to be bearable. Carrie Ann Moss as Trinity is also quite good. I liked Cypher as Judas. But the man who steals the show is Hugo Weaving as Agent Smith. He is a bad guy that is unnervingly alike to my work and income case manager. I kept expecting him to look out from the screen and say 'Mr Skeptic, have you found work yet?' His camp demeanor is funny and effective and this is played on more in the sequel.The imagery is also good and when Neo was being pursued by the bad guys I was reminded of Franz Kafka's 'The Trial.' The Matrix is a world that seems to look alot like downtown Sydney. The s&m tendencies of the directors seems to spill onto this film and everyone dresses like they are off to the 'torture garden.' The infamous s&m club.  It certainly is not a way to keep a low profile. I think I would notice a whole bunch of people dressed in PVC with machine guns.Despite these nigglings this movie is one hell of a ride. Even though it is a hive of geekdom. Recommended. I give it 8 depressed goths out of 10 existential computer nerds.",The Matrix

That's not appropriate for the movie's overall quality. There is some good here, don't get me wrong, but it's not as if it's some Godlike Sci Fi! They really think this movie is better than Alien? Better than Blade Runner? Better than Star Wars A New Hope? Better than Planet of the Apes? Better than 2001 A Space Odyssey? First off the whole Bullet Time thing is just a ridiculous slow mo effect that must have really looked cool back then! In the modern day, this ""Bullet Time"" did not age well and looks ridiculously dumb not ridiculously awesome. As for the sound effects used, I honestly thought The Phantom Menace was more innovative than this movie. The story itself isn't that unique or special, I've seen other movies tackle these concepts before. Hell, one Twilight Episode is all I need to get what this movie is about and yet people didn't freak out then! I don't think Neo is a particularly interesting character and I find his story dull and lackluster. There are a few other things I don't like but none of these are as prevalent as to what is listed above. As for what I like, I gotta admit that I liked Morpheus and thought he was an interesting character. And while the story is kinda unoriginal, I still liked it and they do it well just not as amazingly as everybody seems to think. I also admit that the gun battles are actually pretty damn cool and some of the visual effects really are breathtaking even if once again they're overrated. The one word I would use to describe this movie is ""cool!"" This is a very cool movie and I do recommend that you check it out and get your own opinion on this still popular movie. I give this movie a 7/10 because I don't think it's all that revolutionary but I still enjoy it and I might watch it again sometime and I'm glad it saw it in the first place.

You know, like ""The Matrix"" that makes the audience open their mind and start to think of the idea of the movie. I like it, when amazing cinematography of action meets the ideology of science-fiction that unite as one of masterpiece in the end of 20th century.Actually, I just watched this movie twice. First time I watched, I didn't get what 'Wachowskis' duo means. I mean this is a deep movie and you must pay more attention in its key-scene. And the second times I watched, yes it is a splendid movie I've ever watched. The new breakthrough of science- fiction and the door to visual effects of the new century.Great movie!",The Matrix
728,Yvie81,I knew I shouldn't have..,4,18 July 2020,"I don't get why people drool all over this movie. I mean, when it came out it was such a hype that I wasn't even interested in watching it. Now 21 years later I finally did cause my partner felt this was a movie I really should have watched. Only thing I realise is that I recognize how other movies like Inception were inspired by it. Apart from that it felt really outdated. I mean obviously it is cause it's 21 years later but compared to another groundbreaking movie like Jurassic Park, that one's still a classic and still fun to watch. Anyway, to me this was 90% action and special effects and 10% storyline and acting. It's not enough for me. And it made me realize (again) why Keanu Reeves is only good in action flicks. He's just not a very good actor! The only moments he actually shows some expression in his face is during his fighting scenes. But also the other characters felt like cardboard characters to me. I really couldn't care less if they died or not. That's generally not a good sign! And Trinity fell in love with Neo because.....why? Because the Oracle told her she would? Seriously, I didn't see any chemistry between them the entire damn movie! She absolutely had no plausable reason to suddenly be in love with him! This movie to me felt like they first created a bunch of action scenes just because they looked cool. And after that they decided to write a story around it.",The Matrix
729,Doc-134,A Great Beginning that Doesn't Pay Off in The End,7,5 April 1999,"Most of the other comments that I have seen on ""The Matrix"" I see have focused on the technical aspects of the film. The technical aspects are prodigious, but I would like to spend some time discussing the philosophical issues behind the film. Philosophers have debated for years about 'reality'. One of the assumptions is that what is real' is what we are conscious of. This seems to be the view that the film takes. In the film Morpheus (Laurence Fishburne) tells Neo (Keanu Reeves) that if what is real is what we are conscious of, then it is true that the matrix does exist. The other view is that in the world there are certain realities that are indifferent to our perceptions. This argument, in my opinion, does not hold much water. We may want to think that there is a specific, fixed 'reality' because we as humans usually see things in a similar light. But, let's take the example of an animal such as a dog. Research has shown that dogs can only see in black and white. If this is true, then we can rightly assert that a dog's 'reality' is quite different from that of a human's. How are we to know which is the true 'reality'? We don't. A dog's reality is black and white and our reality is color. This however does not mean that what is real' is either of these; both are equally real in terms of the systems of perceptions of each being (dog and human). Dogs and people have different modes of perception, thus creating different perceptions of 'reality'. One may argue that there is no 'real' in the material sense of the word, as there has to be a mechanism of perception enabled by a sentient being for any notion of the 'real' to exist. In other words the 'real' cannot exist without 'perception'. I know these ideas are quite complex and the example that I have used isn't directly related to ""The Matrix"", but I think that this philosophical concept in general is explored, and thus what I have discussed is quite relevant.Philosophical abstractions such as what I have described are fascinating, and are integral to the making of great science fiction film. The greatest science fiction films not only amaze us with their use of technology, they also have a deep understanding and care for the human condition, which according to a Marxist view is incompatible with technology. Many films of this genre present technology as a form of ideology propagated by a ruling class (the bourgeois). Technology is seen as a dehumanizing agent, and much of the great work in science fiction is done as a social commentary in reaction to rapid technological expansion. This response is present throughout the works of writers such as Philip K. Dick and William Gibson, both of whom have obviously influenced Larry and Andy Wachowski's script for ""The Matrix"". I see hints of ideas from films such as ""Dark City"", ""Blade Runner"", and ""Strange Days"" as well. This is not a negative thing though; the story of ""The Matrix"" is fairly original despite all of its influences from previous work.There is a point where ""The Matrix"" falls short, however, and that is in its action sequences. The action sequences look spectacular, but when it comes down to it, they seem like they are inserted as nothing more than fillers where we could have been acquainted with new ideas. ""Dark City"" was a great science fiction film for many reasons, but one of them is the fact that it didn't overwhelm the audience with familiar shootouts (ie Die Hard films) and fight scenes (ie John Woo's Hong Kong action pictures). When the big action scene towards the finale of ""The Matrix"" occurs, it feels like the Wachowski brothers left the set leaving the direction to John Woo. John Woo loves to see action in slow motion, and trust me, there is plenty of that here. It all looks good, but it feels out of place, as though the producers must have stepped in and said that their had to be a big action sequence to draw upon a wider audience.Overall, ""The Matrix"" was a good movie, but not a great one. The first half or two thirds of the film are spell-binding with its issues of reality', but it begins to fall apart towards the end, where action scenes take center stage and overwhelm the point of the story. In short, I wanted to see more emphasis on the philosophical roots of the story and less emphasis on adrenaline pumping action sequences. Good, original ideas can build up suspense and adrenaline too. ""Dark City"" and ""Blade Runner"" proved that to me.*** out of ****",The Matrix

That movie was entertaining and suspenseful. This is just the worst. You like science fiction? see ""Last Night."" You want another film about a manufactured universe? How about ""The Truman Show?"" This was a total waste of time, and I'm afraid its rating as #31 on the all-time honors list, at this writing, is just a testament to the fact that too few people my age can really use the internet.

This movie defies all sorts of rules- gravitational, or otherwise. The special effects kick butt, and the characters are both believeable and alter-reality-type-of-cool. While many people believe this to be a copy of other movies, I think it's very original. Andy and Larry are wonderful, and I think their movie will become very well-known and special (like it isn't already, hehe).

733,epsilon3,Brilliant - but will it last?,10,2 April 2002,"As a huge Science Fiction fan, I really enjoyed The Matrix. When I first saw it I was blown away with many aspects of the film, notably the special effects, cinematography and the philosophical message contained within. I went out and bought it on VHS and have just gotten around to buying it on DVD along with the recently released companion DVD 'The Matrix Revisited.' As such, this review is a retrospective - it assumes you've seen the movie, although it does not contain spoilers.As I said, The Matrix was truly ground breaking. As a fan of comic books in my youth, I immediately recognised the stylized characters and settings - it was a blast from start to finish. The Special effects were mind boggling - the slow motion scenes using the 'bullet time' effect were innovative and hadn't been seen before.After repeated viewings, my opinions have changed slightly. No longer do the effects totally amaze me - we can see the bullet time effect on everything now from TV ads to comedy movies (e.g. Scary Movie.) This doesn't take anything away from the movie in itself, it just lessens the impact.The cinematography looks as good as it did the first time I saw it and is truly the greatest thing about The Matrix. It's like the directors decided to ignore the rules of what you can do with a camera and just dreamed up angles and shots straight from a comic book where imagination is the only limit. Each time I watch it, I'm truly stunned by the sheer inventiveness of these guys - there are few films that come close.As for the plot and messages within the movie - I'm sot so sure. The idea that we live in a construct and are slaves to the system isn't new - films such as 'They Live' or 'Solyent Green' (and many others) covered this ground a long time ago, although admittedly without the eye candy. The quasi religious message within the movie is interesting but ultimately feels gimmicky, as if it was put there in order that fanboys like myself can endlessly discuss it on usenet. Don't get me wrong - better we have hidden messages and philosophies than a straight 'kill everything in sight' action flick - but at times it felt like it was being self consciously clever.
And am I the only person who noticed the similarities between the plot and that of several 'Star Trek: The Next Generation' episodes? You know, the ones where Picard and the crew leave the holodeck and return to the Enterprise, only to find that they are in fact still in the holodeck and they've been fooled? Sure, a Star Trek episode doesn't compare in it's depth or scope, but still, it takes something away from the idea that The Matrix plot is innovative and new.To finish, I must reiterate that this is a superb movie. However, my experiences with The Matrix tell me that special effects are seductive and can make the viewer feel as if a movie is better than it really is. There were times when I was enjoying them so much that I half believed Keanu Reeves could act, but after repeated viewings I took the red pill and woke up. Sure - the Matrix is excellent, but when the dust has settled and the effects aren't so stimulating - what do we have left? Stripped bare of eye candy - all we have is actors and plot. It should stand up on these merits alone, but does it? It's certainly a great film but an all time classic? I'm not sure, but I do know that I can't wait for the sequel - roll on The Matrix 2!!!",The Matrix
734,Brawl_666,the architecture of cognition,10,14 May 2010,"'The Matrix' must be one of the most ambitious and highly successful projects of the past twenty years. Its difficult to imagine how this film could have gone from conception to execution, and succeeded with such flying colors. For a long time I've avoided writing a review because this was my ""Godfather"" or ""Star Wars"" movie, having first seen it at 13 and instantly falling in love with it. I could never be truly objective about this movie, nor could I find a single truthful, objective analysis of it anywhere on IMDb or RT. Roger Ebert's review was nice, but too harsh.'Bound' helped me appreciate better how 'Matrix' was conceived. Neither of these two films has a single wasted moment. It seems that the Wachowskis build a film by cascading a set of scenes, like a series of dominos, so that each scene projects into the next one. This is of course what all screenwriters do, but as simple as it sounds, it is no mean feat. The most important part of any film, I think, is how you connect scenes, how you work on transitions so as to create meaning and plausibility. What you show, how you show, and most importantly, what you Don't show. This is extremely difficult. It requires a deep understanding of the cognitive mechanics at work between a film and a viewer. It is, if you like, the most important part of film-making, as important (if not more) than the actual shooting process.The brothers nailed this whole conception business down to the last detail. The editor won an Oscar, but the film was streamlined by the directors for perfect editing. The cinematography and sound design is breathtaking. Joel Silver brought another influence to bear in terms of production expertise. They worked on the formidable design and effects requirements, even bringing in a legendary Hong Kong action choreographer for the martial arts scenes.And then they made casting choices that could not have been better. This film rests on the visual and vocal libido of the leads. It works only because the actors work, because we relate and identify with them. Just watch Weaving and Fishburne scorch the frame in their respective parts; these are their best roles. Moss is visually apt. Reeves is unwittingly perfect for his role, more perfect than anyone could have imagined.Another important part of this film is the self-reference. This film riffs on itself many times in many ways, such as when Mouse asks Neo how the machines could possibly know about the taste of Tasty Wheat. This is essentially winking at the viewer by momentarily snapping the plausibility of the whole idea. Also, this whole franchise is one big stab at the Terminator movies and their enduring popularity. Instead of time travel, we have virtual reality. Instead of terminators, we have agents. Instead of John Connor....None of this explains how they came up with this concept. The keystone of the arch is hidden. There are countless other 'influences' here : Phil Dick, William Gibson, Doctor Who, Grant Morrisson's 'The Invisibles' etc. And as with Tarantino, we are unable to say for sure whether it is homage or plagiarism. The innovation lies in the architecture of the whole thing, in the layering, in the flawless integration of so many different design elements to form a seamless, coherent entity. The Matrix is everywhere indeed.This is the only way to make movies.",The Matrix
735,Jess-24,whoa,9,17 April 1999,"This movie has risen to fame faster than any other in resent history. And with good reason. It has once again raised the bar for sci-fi and special effects. The plot is somewhat old-hat, for if you've seen alot of sci-fi movies, the idea of parallel universes ain't all that different. But you must look past that. 1) the acting and dialouge are great. The actor who played Smith was excellent. 2) the special effects 3) the set directions and the costumes are great. The settings all very spooky. 3 good reasons beyond a good plot to appreciate the Matrix. It's 20 on the IMDB's 250 list and I hope it stays there. This has to be one of the greatest sci-fi movies ever. It should be compared to films like '2001' 'Star Wars' and '12 monkeys'. It will undoubtebly bring the directors to international fame.

737,cathcacr,I'm torn on this one...,5,25 April 2002,"My impression is that those giving out 10's on this one give out 10's way too liberally and often.  There's too much about this movie that, in my humble opinion, brings up too many questions as to its value as cinema. Myself, I'm torn between giving it a 9 or so out of 10 and a 5 out of 10 (I end up splitting the difference, as the movie is at least well above average).  I first saw this one a couple years ago and was impressed by the effects as anyone but didn't think it good enough as a movie to merit repeat viewings.Well, I happen to have a close family member with very good taste in movies for whom this movie rates #1 (somehow I expect this to change as the family member grows older), so I felt compelled to come back to this one to see what I didn't get.  So I gave it as much leeway as I thought reasonable, and my thought as I was about 45 minutes in watching it through it again was, ""this is a heck of a movie.""  The story really develops well and draws you in.  It's the last half of the movie that, upon reflection, is a real let-down.  You get the most amazing and memorable special effects in that last half, and, perhaps not coincidentally, the coherence and believability of the plot really breaks down.I'll just touch upon one that seems to have a gaping hole in its logic (spoilers!): Humans are used for energy.  Why humans, in particular, and why bother placating them with a virtual-reality life?  Humans may be an energy source, but they ultimately need some outside source of energy, and where does it come from?  No sun, remember.  It seems that whatever energy source is available for humans to function as batteries -- and remember, batteries eventually run out without an outside source to fuel them -- could just as easily and directly be tapped by the machines who run the Matrix.You raise questions like this, and the story falls apart or just looks too arbitrarily constructed.  I would urge the viewers of this film to really ask themselves whether, as a work of CINEMA, this has enough strength as script/story to have lasting value.  In 10 years, something with even more impressive special effects will come along.  Lack of script/story quality cannot be covered up by flashiness and ""coolness"" forever.  And I just don't see how this succeeds in terms of story.  Sci-fi films can really suffer in this regard, though they really don't need to.  My favorite film of all time (_2001: A Space Odyssey_) is science fiction, after all, and films like _Blade Runner_ carry immense weight today because of the intellectual value they bring, even when the special effects have become ""dated.""  I think that a recent, similar film like _Dark City_ holds up better under scrutiny.This one has enough entertainment value in it that I give it a hearty 7/10. Maybe it does belong in this site's top 250 (giving it a 7 would probably put it in *my* top 250), but certainly not in the top 40 or so.  But will I come back to it again any time soon?  I don't think so; the thing that most grips your mind is the special effects, but that's already in my head now. Ask yourself what movie from 1999, in 10 years, will stand out most.  The one that wowed or was ""hip"" with audiences then, or something that could wow audiences 10 years from now?  As much as it seems ""made for its time,"" I'll probably have to go with _Fight Club_ and a number of other films before this one.  _The Matrix_ will likely have the same fate as _The Sixth Sense_: a big hit the time it came out, but more or less lost in the mix many years down the line.",The Matrix

The special effects, CGI, story, every aspect of this film is something fresh and original, even today, ten years after it was originally released. To use an analogy, The Matrix is what I like to call the Kurt Cobain of films, as my review title says. Any fans of 90s rock music should understand my comparison. That being said, if you are like me, you won't find this film to be anything truly special the first time you watch it. It's kind of like The Godfather, in a sense. The more times you view it, the more things you will pick up on and you realize that you missed so many things when you watched the movie the first time around. The first time I sat down and watched The Matrix, I finished it and said to myself- ""Okay, that was good. Great? Not so much."" Then, a couple months later, I watched the film for the second time. When I re-watched The Matrix, I came to realize how truly great it is. There were several things that I came to understand that I didn't understand when I first watched The Matrix. The acting is excellent in all three Matrix films, but it was easily superior in this installment in the trilogy. Keanu Reeves plays Neo well, you simply have to love Laurence Fishburne in his role as the enigmatic Morpheus, Carrie-Anne Moss did well as Trinity, but the show was stolen by Hugo Weaving, who is completely AWESOME as Smith. These films aren't for everyone. But if you are looking for something original and revolutionary, The Matrix is the way to go.",The Matrix

742,ferni-tierni,You ever get the feeling where you do not know if you are awake or still dreaming?,10,29 April 2020,"The matrix... This movie is metaphorically and realistically attempting to, at all moments, inspire you to reach to new limits of your perception. It is inundated with symbolism of awakening, devotion, belief, convictions, spirituality, and perseverance. The movie starts with a mysterious and audacious character that should be feared by even brigades of policemen: Trinity (Carrie-Anne Moss). She immediately shows us why she is so special defying gravity and moving faster than any human ever could. The tension rises and we realize that this movie is gradually enticing us into a rabbit hole especially made for ourselves.In comes NEO (Keanu Reeves) the hacker/software programmer that seems to be lost in its own alienation, an alienation that is a catalyst for Trinity and Morpheus (Laurence Fishburne) to allure him with spiritual, existential phrases of enlightenment. NEO is a metaphorical version of the viewer, and our dormant state where we are dictated and shaped by outside forces out of our control. The continuous message for NEO is believe, believe and you will have the ability to change anything within the matrix, within the viewer's world, know that you can do it.Morpheus and Trinity are preparing NEO to contend against entities that have subjugated him for his entire life, powerful entities of conditioning, destruction, and alienation. These entities are the ""agents"" (Hugo Weaving). Programs especially designed to search and exterminate any anomaly within the system. The movie sends a powerful revolutionary message for viewers to believe that they can change events despite the overwhelming circumstances. The program of the ""jump"" is an interesting metaphor of taking a ""leap of faith"". The more they believe the less shackled humans are within the matrix.You ever get the feeling where you do not know if you are awake or still dreaming? The movie also alludes repeatedly about altered states of consciousness. His intuition was the main tool for NEO to believe in Morpheus and Trinity. ""You are looking for an answer, but the answer will find you"" ""You know that here is something wrong with the world. You do not know exactly what it is, like a splinter in your mind, and it is driving you mad"": the movie targets the viewer's intuitions repeatedly with ambiguous statements that have existential answers and connotations.The agents are a highlight in the movie. You do believe that they are robots, programmed to destroy. It is really interesting the calculated, reserved, amoral nature of their existence. Their expressions of dedication and feelings of disgust towards the world of humans makes them easy targets of hate for the viewer. The movie is full of characters with blind faith and convictions. They exist for change and construction instead of being blinded by fantasy and consumerism.Cyper (Joe Pantoliano) is the inverted version of NEO. He is the antagonist within the real world; a self-serving, postmodernist, consumerist villain that will do anything to get another taste of bliss. He wants a new life where he can live happily in his ignorance of the matrix. He wants his knowledge about the reality erased and become someone important, where he can enjoy the pleasures of life in a way that is especially to his benefit. He is an interesting version of the alienated human that is so impacted by his loneliness that becomes addicted to the consumerist culture and belonging.The oracle is one of the most complex and brilliant characters that I have seen in any movie. The fact that this character can predict, cause, track, manipulate chains of causality is a really massive mind-fame in the minds of people that believe in free will. The oracle perceives everything that exists in the present and the future. Every permutation of elements that can be arranged to change reality she perceives it, but not only that she also uses the idea of believing that one can make a change as a catalyst to modify the reality into something different: Absolutely brilliant.The oracle directs NEO into the liberation of humans by placing him in circumstances where he has to risk his life for others. He believes that he can do it by placing him in a position where he pushes himself to the limit. Trinity's love in his dying moments is the eruption of all that energy of belief and sacrifice for others. He finally became the ""one"" and was able to defeat the agents.",The Matrix
743,james_norman1981,Jaw droppingly brilliant,10,15 September 2006,"1999 had a great deal to go for it cinematically. Unfortunately, much of what we were all breathlessly looking forward to turned out to be more cold bath than hot stuff... case in point the first of the disastrously bad Star Wars prequels, the Phantom Menace, which apparently is the most successful Star Wars film ever...However, one film did live up to its hype, perhaps because it wasn't rammed down our throats for months in advance with advertising, marketing and cults far in excess of anything seen before or since... That film was the Matrix. This is not to say that the Matrix was under budgeted. With funds in excess of $100 million it was an enormous gamble by Joel Silver, throwing Keanu Reeves into another Sci-Fi superhero role when the world had only recently recovered from Jonny Mnemonic. But the Wachowskis stood by their nth choice man and Silver stood by them as they tore around Sydney blowing up helicopters and generally misbehaving. No one knew anything about it. Most of the industry insiders, those who even knew about the Matrix, predicted a massive flop. They were wrong. The Matrix kicked ass!Thanks to a brilliant advertising campaign, (remember asking yourself just what was the matrix!?!) the film opened to full houses and, more surprisingly, rave reviews which were completely justified. Using seemingly brand new effects, like bullet time, as well as the novel incorporation of tried and tested tools, such as wire work, the Matrix took what could have been your average superhero and made him a human being who was both fallible and liable to fail. At no point in the movie does the conclusion feel foregone and, with the brilliant twist around Cypher, there is a real sense that Neo mightn't succeed... and when he does it all the more enthralling because of it.Credit for all this lies with the Wachowskis, who seemed to have every single moment planned out to perfection before filming. Similarly Reeves deserves praise, for taking advantage of his perceived weaknesses as an actor to create the Anderson/Neo character. Lawrence Fishburne is also great, delivering a performance perfectly balanced between seriousness and pantomime, while Carrie-Anne Moss' Trinity provides much of the soul of the Matrix, especially given that she's no damsel in distress. Of the remaining actors both Weaving and Pantoliano deserve much praise for their roles as bad guys, the latter doing remarkably well to make as odious a character as Cypher three dimensional while Agent Smith has to be the coolest villain since Darth Vader. Finally we shouldn't neglect Joel Silver in all this. Producer of what must have seemed like the biggest loss maker since Waterworld, Silver instead gave us one of the best films of the 1990's and a movie that will continue to excite future generations of action fans. His courage in bringing the Matrix to our screens should not be forgotten, although the missteps made with the sequels are not entirely forgivable.All in all the Matrix represents the culmination of a great deal of work and thought that, should any of the principle people involved have not believed in it 100%, we would probably have never even seen, let alone enjoyed. The film is second to none for juxtaposing philosophy with martial arts, but drives across its messages about Mankind's over reliance on technology without making the audience uncomfortable at being preached to. Overall there is very little that can be held against this movie and, despite the rather debatable suggestion that violence can be the answer, it works well for the younger and older crowds alike. If you haven't seen it then I cannot recommend it enough, but that is unlikely to be the case for many of you!",The Matrix

746,crothman,Boring cliched coming-of-age film with great special effects,3,10 September 2001,"I hadn't really expected a lot, but I was amazed at just how dull this film was.  The effects are, quite rightly, considered great and are obviously influential in many ways.  But other than a couple of action sequences at the beginning and end, you have nothing but dull lectures.  Lawrence Fishburne is too good an actor to play a second-rate Yoda like this and the ""philosophy"" was the type of thing you outgrow in 10th grade (""How do we REALLY know reality?"") presented in an ultraserious tone that makes the claptrap seem important.  This type of thing has been done before and better, and the various plot holes and inconsistancies were just a sign of sloppy storytelling.  The villains were quite probably the least interesting in the history of film, with tiresome mannerisms that made you want to go out and slap the director.  And the cliches!  Villains in suits and black sunglasses!  A traitor in the heros' midst!   Man redeemed due to love a woman!  Can anyone really call these original?The effects cannot be faulted, and there were a couple of good action sequences, but the film was poorly written and just plain dull.  More action would have been better, or anything to spare the audience the puerile philosophizing.Certainly one of the most overrated films of the decade.",The Matrix
747,Hinopio,AMAZING,10,27 April 1999,"This movie was excellent.  I was blown away by the effects and the plot. The actors were top notch, even Keanu.  I think this is one of the three roles I thought he was good in, the other two being his role in the Devil's Advocate and his role of a stoner in Love You to Death.  Lawrence Fishburne finally gets a role he deserves, I think he's underappreciated in his roles. So he's kinda got bad teeth, so did Austin Powers.  Trinity was YUMMY and the villains were evil.  The fighting scenes were really cool.",The Matrix
748,dover,"Good, not great",6,19 October 1999,"Clearly, some people disagree with me, but while this movie was certainly entertaining, I didn't think it was great.  It had it's moments, but all in all, I've seen better movies.  The one thing all my friends kept telling me: ""The Matrix has a great plot"" I think it's a sign of the kind of brainless movies being released this days that when any movie with a sniffing of a plot comes out, people automatically take it for the next ""Godfather"".  The same thing happened with ""The Sixth Sense"".  The plot here is passable, but far from excellent.There are two parts of this movie that were really excellent.  Once is the mind-bending special effects, which were extremely well-done.  The other is Laurence Fishburne, who is at his best as ""Morpheus"", the leader of this rag-tag group.  Keanu Reeves does  his best no to overact the part, but it's really Fishburne that stand out.Would I recommend it?  Sure.  Is it the greatest thing I've ever seen?  Not by a long, long shot.",The Matrix
749,Eelco_1977,Incredible SF-movie!!!!!!,10,23 July 1999,"Before I went to this movie I saw the making of the Matrix and I immediately thought: ""I have to see this movie!!!!!!"". Since ""Terminator 2; Judgement Day"" I haven't seen so impressive special effects, especially the ""dodge the bullets scene"". The story was great, with much references to the bible, ""Alice in Wonderland"" and Greek mythology.Before I went to the movie I still had my doubts about the actors and the theme of the film. Keanu Reeves' acting in ""Johnny Mnemonic"" was absolutely horrible, but than again, the script of that movie to. But he recovered when he played an excellent role in ""Devil's Advocate"". Laurence Fishburne's ""Event Horizon"" wasn't also, just like ""Johnny Mnemonic"", a great movie. It started well (except for the music in the beginning) but crashlanded in the end. Laurence Fishburne is (I think) still a bit underestimated by a lot of people as an actor. He was great in this movie. The other keyplayers of the movie were also memorable. As for the theme of the movie, I had my doubts. I had already seen a lot of cyberpunk or virtual reality movies that weren't worth a second or even a first watch. But this movie was awesome!!!!!!Next to this movie, I'm still waiting for that other SF (more fantasy) movie Star Wars: Episode I; The Phantom Menace which will be released in September (almost five months after the US-release, it's a disgrace) . I'm a big Star Wars fan, but I think that ""The Matrix"" is, or will be, the movie of 1999. I give it a 10!!!!!!",The Matrix
750,mr composer,Exactly what I expected..,8,21 June 2001,"I couldn't believe, in going through the first page of user comments, how many negative reviews I read on this movie.  How did so many of you not like this movie and yet, as a group, choose it as #30 of all-time!?Second, what is it with all of the complaints of plot holes, acting, and screenplay?  Come on people, were you honestly expecting Casablanca?  Would you ever watch a movie starring Keanu Reeves and expect it to top ""Speed"" on an intellecual level? I get the feeling that so many users on this site don't know how to throughly enjoy a movie just because it is fun.  It has to be ""intelligent"" or ""original.""  Otherwise it's a waste of your time.Ok, now that I've vented a bit, let me say what I thought of the movie.  It was what I expected to see.. a highly entertaining movie in the style of a video game.  The acting was not bad, and I thought Keanu Reeves was far from ""terrible"", as one reviewer put it.  Let no one think that he was even close to being robbed on oscar night, but his acting was the best I've seen from him thus far.And let's not forget a wonderful aspect of this film... Don Davis's score. Don Davis has been contributing with great orchestrations for other people's scores for some time.. including James Horner.  But he is a highly sophisticated composer with great technique.  It is great that he is finally getting an opportunity to be behind the composer's wheel.Now the most attacked part of this movie is the plausibility of it.  Hey, there is much of it that I found unbelieveable.  But I didn't find this distracting.  Every now and then, it's good to just enjoy a movie for the entertainment value, which is what this movie is about.  It's not what I'd call a ""brainless"" action flick.  But I couldn't imagine why anybody would go in to this movie expecting a whole lot more.  Just have fun, and don't analyze it to death.",The Matrix
751,Reef-Shark,Action movie disguised as science-fiction delivers the goods,10,5 November 2008,"Beginning this review I was writing the film's title and ended up with ""The Mainstream"" (100% accident) which pretty much sums up the premise of The Matrix franchise. The Matrix is good in the fact that it takes complex science-fiction from previous 1990s films that didn't quite meet mainstream audiences (Dark City, 12 Monkeys) and merges it with the spectacular CGI effects of an action film. As an action film The Matrix is incredibly successful and deserves great recognition as one of the best films of the 1990s, or the past two decades for that matter. However I do feel let down by the fact that I felt cheated by the story when they didn't try to further flesh out the world it took place in.My main problem with the film falls on the fact that, as an avid sci-fi fan, I had already seen most of the concepts The Matrix presented in previous films (go back to the two I listed above). The religious spin on things however does really make it interesting, kind of like a science-fiction version of some religious document, but a human being having special abilities and saving a captive human population from a controlling force which had everyone living in a false reality had already been used in Dark City back in 1996. This, among other things, is one of the reasons I don't give The Matrix a perfect score of 10/10.As a sci-fi film it was very good, regardless of how many of the elements that it was reusing from other films, but I often felt like the production team couldn't decide on whether or not they wanted an action picture, or a thought stimulating sci-fi epic. By the end however The Matrix does succeed in balancing these two things very nicely. The CGI deserved its Academy Award, because it really is amazing some of the things they were able to pull off.The acting in this film was grade-A, and one of the strongest aspects of the film's production, and there was only ONE performance that failed to catch my attentionsadly this performance (my opinion) came from the star of the film: Keanu Reeves. Reeves has had his moments throughout his career, don't get me wrong, back in the late 1980s (most will remember the Bill & Ted films) he was a rather likable young actor, even in his lesser known performances; he seemed very honest and sincere in his performances. A change came about when he announced he was going to ""take acting more seriously"". The result, in my mind, was horrific! He comes across now as someone with very little emotion, and just doesn't seem really human.I had the same problem with Keanu in the action movie, Speed, which followed the Die Hard franchise, but unlike Bruce Willis, I couldn't connect, or really care about Reeves in this film (similar feeling in Bram Stoker's Dracula, but he wasn't TOO bad in that film), which was certainly on par with the Die Hard films in production and story. Same problem is present in The Matrix. Reeves is trying way too hard to seem serious, and dramatic, and in the end comes across as being artificial, and dull. If that was the director's intention, I don't really care, because I felt this was a character the audience should have been able to relate to and care about, but that's just my opinion and you don't have to agree with me (just giving an honest view from my perspective).Okay, I've given my criticisms, but now I have to say what was really good about The Matrix, and there are a lot of good aspects of this film which is why it deserves my high rating (and a spot in my DVD collection). The action is well-done, and truly is an eye opener, and as I previously stated the performances are mostly strong. Laurence Fishburne (Morpheus) and Hugo Weaving (Agent Smith) are very good in their respective roles, and both (as most people will say) are embraced as engaging characters in the mind of the audience, while Reeves was more of a vehicle to channel elaborate action sequences (the highlight, in most people's opinion, of the film). Also the Wachowski Brother's film is simply beautiful to look at, from the all CGI sequences to the live sets. The sequels, which go purely into action, prove that this film could have been a much worse (I don't hate the sequels, they just are not really sci-fi; just action films).This film really does have all it needs to work as a successful film, especially in the mainstream Hollywood of this day and age. It would have been braver for the filmmakers to try and expand, and concentrate on the complex science-fiction aspects, instead of the action, but then it wouldn't have been the box-office success it was. I would defend them no matter what, but when you go against the powers if mainstream and the production companies and end up with a good film you'll always have me backing up your filmof course I will be critical if the plot and direction is bad, but at least I'll give you a positive word for daring to be different.I can only hope that The Matrix can help get moviegoers into the lesser known art-house science-fiction stories that inspired it, because it's a shame that our modern audiences can't seem to appreciate things that don't fuse with action or comedy, because I don't feel science-fiction was ever really intended to be a genre simply designed to create exciting action sequences.The Matrix was a great film, deserving its mainstream applause: Solid 9/10 stars",The Matrix
752,keuhkokala,Gets better every time I see it,9,28 August 2003,"This site categorizes Action movies rather strange. Sure, some classics like Kurosawa´s the Seven Samurai have action in them, but they are not actually action movies since officially the whole genre began to evolve from the Clint Eastwood movies of the 70´s and George Lucas´s Star Wars and Indiana Jones trilogy. After this, we´ve seen quite a lot of action movies as some of the world´s most successful movies are also. Most of them include a muscled, dumb man like Sylvester Stallone, Jean-Claude van Damme or Chuck Norris killing a lot of terrorists. Some of them, however are a lot more than just murdering terrorists. Some Action movies have a heart, they contain also a lot other beside carnage. Some of these movies are  James Cameron´s Aliens and Terminator, Brian Singer´s X-men movies or, of course, the Matrix, which is one of the best action movies of all time.Ok, so the movie´s plot has some similarities to the Terminator or Blade Runner of something, but they do not have such an imaginative picture of the future or the artificial reality it contains. I hate say it, but the only word I can explain this movies greatness, is cool. It looks cool, it feels cool, all the Action is so cool, that loads of action movies have tried to copy its coolness after this, but in my opinion, they have not succeeded very well. Yes, this does get better by every watching, as the first time goes marveling at the wonders of the artificial world, evil kung-fu agents, the resistance and even computer effects, which look after four years almost as good as then. For the next couple of times, as you sink ""deeper into the rabbit hole"" you start to think about the philosophical questions this movie gives. And yes, still enjoy the action. It almost deserves a ten, but the movie has a few annoying plot holes and I´m not a big fan of Carrie-Ann Moss, not even in her Catwoman outfit. So, 9/10The Best bit (May contain SPOILERs): When Trinity and Neo come to the Matrix to rescue Morpheus from the Agents, they have to pass a metal detector at the lobby. When Neo goes through it, it naturally beeps. He reveals to the guard he has a LOT of weapons under his coat. The guard goes: ""Holy Sh*t!"" And the shooting begins!",The Matrix

This film is LOADED with symbolism and imagery and philosophy and sheer brilliance. This film is WAY ahead of its time.

758,leandros,quite good indeed... but still disappointing,8,16 September 1999,"Yes, one has to admit, The Matrix is maybe ""the"" representative of the new-millenial hype-action movie. It is a well acted, well directed, well ""designed"", and obviously well thought movie. There should be no doubt that the action movies of the 2000s will more or less look like, feel like, sound like and be flashy like The Matrix, IF the producers have enough money as the Wachowsky brothers. So what's disappointing? Everyone left the theater feeling dizzy and confused, having conversations over their personal pseudo-lives and the ambivalence and vagueness of their perceptions of reality. Keanu Reeves as Neo and Laurence Fishburne as Morpheus dazzled the audience with their superb acting. Carrie-Anne Moss became every guy's dream date (watch the Jiu-Jitsu moves!). But.... but The Matrix is so close to being just the pumped-up, pretentious, expensive, star packed candidate of the ""Kafkaesque Action Movie of the New Millenium"", thanks to Dark City. It was so frustrating not hearing anyone mention this romantic prototype of the parallel world/deceived citizens plot. And, oh! That absolutely cliché, and almost stupid ending with that mindless and laughable monologue! Now that would be more suitable with a 70s low-budget space adventure.
Yes, one must confess that The Matrix is truly and certainly good. It is indeed mind and eye boggling. But, it is not *the* movie after all. For a refreshing retrospective, Dark City by Alex Proyas and Bound by the Wachowsky brothers is strongly recommended.",The Matrix
759,J. Ryan,Myth Meets Might in the Action Film of the Year,9,5 April 1999,"I was impressed.  My roommate and I, at the time performing air-Ju-Jit-Zu, came home from the Matrix trying to run perpendicular to the ground.  I'm sure if we lived close to a gun range (not really that readily available in New York City), we would have insisted on target practice while wearing sunglasses and trenchcoats.That being said, the Matrix may fete the testosterone of adolescent teens and immature yuppies, but one can actually find layers of irony and myth in this speciously skin deep sci-fi flick.First, consider the whole premise of the film, evil supercomputers enslave humanity through an algorithmically generated world known as the Matrix. What appears real, is unreal with the very nature of existence challenged - kind of like Descartes' all-powerful monster theory to debunk the reliability of his senses and therefore existence itself.  Then we have a rag tag band of rebels led by a mysterious but unquestionably faithful Morpheus (Fishburne), the god of dreams in Ovid's Metamorphoses, who awakens enslaved humans from their captivity of sleep.  Our hero, Thomas (Reaves), like the Biblical Doubting Thomas, is leery of his fate as the chosen One. He is  prophesized by the Oracle -- yes, like the one at Delphi -- to lead humans to freedom and see the rise of the last remaining human colony, Zion. Our plucky heroes are aided by the stunningly gorgeous Trinity (Moss) travel on a beat up space craft ironically named Nebuchadnezzar, a Babylonian king who destroyed Jerusalem and took kings and nobles captive in the Babylonian Captivity.  Wow!  Confused, yet?But, have no fear.  For those who like myth as much as income tax, there is also, Hong Kong-style Kung-Fu, slick fashion, lots of guns, and a pulsating soundtrack that features Marilyn Manson.  Eclectic does not even begin to describe the Matrix.The acting is competent, and with the bevy of special effects it becomes difficult to notice.  Keanu Reaves is surprisingly competent, but then again he is supported by the always majestic Larry Fishburne, and beautiful newcomer Carry Ann Moss.  With so many themes addressed by the Wachowski brothers, the Matrix could have easily over-committed itself.  Luckily, with some incredible editing, this film has all the earmarks of a runaway box-office hit.  I hope it makes a bundle.",The Matrix
760,Liedzeit,Disgrace to the human race,2,22 July 1999,"Take a bit from ""Men in Black"" (leave the humor out) something from ""Last Man Standing"" (leave good acting out) from ""Twelve Monkeys"" (leave real suffering and compassion out) and take half a dozen other ones (like some ""Martial Arts"") mix it and get a block buster. Hey, add a deep philosophical idea like that maybe everything is unreal!It sounds like a joke but it is not. They actually got away with it with ""The Matrix"". I mean probably every bright 15 year old comes up with the idea one day that everything is fake that somehow only he (or she?) can see through it. And I do not say you cannot make a film out of it but has the result to be like this? The Matrix is by far the most stupid film I ever saw. I want to believe in bizarre concepts but this is so mind-boggingly stupid that it would mean too much honor to even start talking about it. I have seen a lot of senseless violence but this must get a price for the best pretext: They can ""beam"" into a particular ""space-time"" point of the program but not quite so our heroes have to literally shoot their way through. Amazing! The sad thing about it is that people actually enjoy the crap which makes me think that the Matrix probably is true after all. Since it seems unlikely that real people with a mind of their own can take the film seriously or enjoy it there must be some brain-washing or programming going on. My girl friend nearly left me once because I liked a ""horrid"" movie like ""Twelve Monkeys"" and even she liked The Matrix. She probably hopes that Jesus will look and act like Keanu Reeves at his next coming. What a depressing thought. If the only good thing to say about a film is that visual effects were up to standard one should leave it. The sun glasses were pretty cool though.",The Matrix
761,Soujiro,Laughably Awful,5,6 May 2001,"The good: The action scenes involving guns are original. The ""frozen moment"" camera effect is well done.The bad: The script is uneven and horribly horribly written. I mean Saturday morning cartoons are better written than this, not even good cartoons either, I think that the average episode of Voltron or Scooby Doo have more meaningful and profound scripts. The main characters can't even manage to be two dimensional. The ugly: The acting is hideous, and I'm not just talking about the spoken lines. I can almost hear Keanu saying ""dude"" after every line. Fishburne is also attains a whole new level of corniness, Mumra on Thundercats levels of melodrama. As in another over-hyped movie, Crouching Tiger etc. etc., no amount of special effects can disguise the fact that these people do not know martial arts. The fight scene between Fishburne and Reeves made me laugh out loud, and not in a happy way, more of a ""I can't believe how pathetic this is"" kind of defensive laugh. Hong Kong movies made in the late seventies have better wirework. The cookie cutter villain is actually the most compelling character, and that my friends is sad. This is what really makes me nauseous: Two more movies are coming out. Umm... did I miss something here? I thought that the movie's only redeeming quality was the ""surprise"" midway through when we found out what ""The Matrix"" was. There's not much sequel material here to work with.The first half of this movie is decent in that it doesn't really insult the viewer. As soon as Reeves wakes up in the tank, the movie becomes a laughable, pretentious Saturday morning cartoon. Junior high kids should eat it up, but any reasonably intelligent person who has read a book in his or her life will take absolutely nothing from this move of any lasting value. A truly mind-numbing movie.",The Matrix
762,bajbij,"Over-rated, unoriginal Hollywood style fest",6,19 May 2002,"I loved the Matrix--when it was a film released in 1998 called  Dark City, a far superior, character driven entry in the sci-fi genre. The Matrix, with its dazzling special effects, is nothing more than a silly tale of perseption vs reality. Everyone's view of the film seems to be manipulated by the effects. If we were dealing with Blade Runner style effects instead of Doritos inspired ""bullet time"" effects, would the film still be considered as memorable? I highly doubt it. Laurence Fishburne is good as Morpheus, Moss is ok but her character elicits no sympathy or emotion from me, and Keanu Reeves is just ok, but none of these characters are as intriguing as those of Dark City. The kung fu was obviously inspired by the late Hong Kong style of fighting (IE wire fu and CGI instead of actual skills and choreography.) This was designed to make the simpletons of today go ""ooh"" and ""ahh"" while real kung fu afficionados ache over the obvious fakeness and frustration of chop editing, thus inspiring furhter kung fu crap like CROUCHING TIGER, EXIT WOUNDS, and ROMEO MUST DIE. Matrix does boast some wonderful cinematography, but so does Dark City and it boasts a better story along with it, too. I'll give this film a 5 out of because in originality it's not in the top, in style it's not original, in acting it's saved by one, and story, pretty basic but not complex.

766,odor007,GOOD. NOT GREAT.,6,15 February 2002,"The Matrix is definitely ONE of the best action films ever made.  It surpasses other action classics such as ""Mad Max,"" ""Terminator,"" and ""Blade Runner"" with flying colors.  Yet the film could have been better.  For one, the plot isn't that great.  Yes, for the average redneck moron from Alabama who drives or wants a truck, loves football, and never reads books, this is a deep, mind-blowing, philosophical journey into the mind.  But for anyone in the higher social classes this plot is not original.  Many say this is the first time they have heard of any idea so original...what we see is false, and there is another underlying world.  For me, the plot seemed simply like a modern, popular culture-injected remake of Plato's ""The Allegory of the Cave.""  Now that is genius.  That is original.  ""Guns. Lots of guns"" (A quote by Keanu Reeves from ""The Matrix"") is not original, it's moronic and ignorant.  Again, this is a perfect example of how this film was aimed at morons and teenagers.  Its only goal was box office profit.  The film was loaded with trench coats, bullets, guns, and a hideous script (at times the dialogue was so bad I felt embarrassed watching it), but used all these elements to no purpose...the film had no significance.  Where ""The Matrix"" failed and a film like ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"" triumphed was the only thing a movie like ""The Matrix"" has going for it--action.  In Crouching Tiger, the fighting is beautiful, wonderfully choreographed, and visually peaceful.  The fighting in the matrix is yes, visually stunning, but only because of special effects.  Yes, Crouching Tiger used computers, but succeeded in doing so.  It used computers to better the film, to make the fighting look like moving art, not to simply support violence and the NRA simultaneously.  I think that the acting in ""The Matrix"" was as good as possible based on the script, but that isn't saying much.  The film is incredible entertainment, but seemed hollow--when it was finished I didn't feel enlightened or like my life had changed, I only felt like I had made good use of $10 and a few hours at the movies.  Like I said, I believe that the Matrix was an incredible action film and fabulous entertainment, but that's about it.",The Matrix
767,shawny11_2001,Average Film,7,4 July 2002,"The action sequences are good, but the acting (minus Lawrence Fishburne) isn't that good at all. Keanu Reeves does his best with ""Whoa"", just like his Bill and Ted days. Catherine Moss isn't much to write home about, but she does have some good acting bits. The rest of the cast isn't much. Hugo Weaving gets tiresome as Agent Smith, but his little talk to Morpheus is very well done. Action sequences...are actually something to write home about. The bullet-time effect is not as spectacular as everyone makes it out to be, but it was quite refreshing to see a different style of slow-motion. The fight between Morpheus and Neo is spectacularly done. The last fight though is delivered poorly. The set-up to that scene is one of the funniest scenes in the entire movie, and funnier because it wasn't intentionally made to be funny. Or when Neo ""dusts"" himself off...that's quite amusing as well.Major fans of this kind of science fiction will praise the movie with glory it doesn't deserve. Casual fans of this kind of science fiction will do the same.

Fishburne is quite good; Reeves is flat.  I found the screenplay threadbare, giving the actors not enough meat to work with.  The premise is marginal and a bit watered down to make it as science fiction. The story and direction leave holes big enough to drive trucks through. 
About half way through the movie disbelief kicked back in and the film seemed merely a platform for special effects. In comparison, Mel Gibson's Payback is a more intriguing and better directed revenge/action flick, and Johnny Nmemonic (also featuring Reeves) has better Cyberspace science fiction.This is a violent film, which I have little problem with in general, but here it's particularly de-humanizing which I *do* object to.  Payback is extremely violent and profane, but the violence is focussed and meaningful in that it serves to advance the plot and has human consequences.  The violence in The Matrix blends a cartoon-like disregard for its consequences with an elitist notion that it's all ok because the human victims have been brainwashed by the bad guys and are essentially pawns in a larger game.  Violence should have a moral dimension or at least move the plot if it's to have meaning.  If not, it desensitizes viewers to violence which can't be a healthy thing for society. It also makes for a boring movie.",The Matrix

Morphyus is so cool and same with trinity. The saving moephyus fight scene and well all of them were amazing. The red pill blue pill scene is another good one.

772,Gerry-12,A frenetic action thriller with suspense approaching zero.,5,26 December 1999,"The Matrix combines an incoherent script with intoxication with special effects.  A large chunk of the film is a stretched out denouement in which all the characters, goodies and baddies, are equally invulnerable. Buildings are blown up, walls shattered and general mayhem occurs, but no main character is injured beyond biting their lips, and no motivation for any part of the action is even hinted at.  A Road Runner cartoon has been reissued with some live actors, and possibly some robots.There is one laugh in the film, when Fishburne, after putting Reeves through substantial torture and fastening him down in what looks like a dentist's chair says ''Just try to relax''.",The Matrix

WHAT CAN I SAY, The Matrix gave science fiction fans the best script in nearly a decade, since 1991's Terminator 2, by combining action, philosophy, and intelligence all tightly wrapped up with the most state of the art special effects.No wonder The Matrix completely stole the thunder from The Phantom Menace, it had originality, and some of the best action scenes ever put on the big screen.

But a small band of pale, renegade humans have figured out the truth and are trying to subvert the computer-master's plans.The Wachowski brothers, Larry and Andy, have created this premise as much more than an excuse to stage some of the finest fightr scenes and effects sequences ever made; the plot works very well on a number of levels. First, it's an intriguing sci-fi thriller with plenty of unexpected twists and turns. Second, it's a dramatic, suspenseful mind-f**k with a through-the-looking-glass plot. But most effectively, it's an allegory - a religious metaphor - with one man (""the One"") called upon to harness his gifts in the service of humankind.A very solid story backed up by wonderful action sequences and special effects, with a great look to it and a sequel on the way.",The Matrix

778,ptwomey,Pure Genius!,10,5 May 2003,"The Matrix is nothing short of an absolute cinematic masterpiece that will re-define modern filmmaking. It is a once in a lifetime special event that nobody should miss.The elegant combination of mystery, suspense and action with a dark religious and social under-tone combined with a genuine shock factor create a visual and intelligent tour de force of celluloid not to be missed.The story follows a computer Nerd or hacker named Neo who seeks the answer to a question that he cannot yet comprehend. Not feeling right in the world, as if something is wrong, Neo searches for a man named Morpheus who can answer the question: ""What is the Matrix?"" What follows is a horrific and realistic vision of our technological futuristic hell that more than parallels our own existence.As Neo discovers the true meaning of his question and the shocking reality of his existence we are treated to some of the most stylish and exciting action sequences ever to make it to the silver screen. It is rare that an all out action film can create and maintain a sense of intelligence and social commentary without feeling completely poxy and contrived.Despite all its complexity, deep and meaningful parallels and the questions it raises, The Matrix can still be enjoyed and completely superficial Saturday night entertainment basis, thus making its re-watch ability extremely high.Each and every shot, scene, musical piece, sound effect and piece of dialogue feels perfect as if someone wasted endless hours ensuring it was all perfect from vision to reality. There is hardly a fault in its complete construction, pacing, editing, cinematography or any other filmmaking aspect for that matter.The acting is more than sufficient on the whole save for two noteworthy performances: Hugo Weaving's perfect and extremely likeable Agent Smith and the exception Laurence Fishburne's Morpheus who is almost like a religious prophet instilling a sense of faith in audience, helping us to suspend our disbelief.Finally the special effects, which have been copied and spoofed in countless films since, will simply stun. Admittedly as the film ages, so will the effects, but at least for the time they are nothing short of amazing.In the end the film is a rollercoaster ride of everything that is good in a film, and certainly some of its financial success must be attributed to the fact that this film was not hyped at all, in fact it almost left the cinemas before the mainstream discovered it. Warners Brother even predicted that it would fail and the first comment from critics would of indicated as such. Now it is the single biggest grossing film that Warner Brothers has ever made.This is filmmaking at its best, and as the film races on from climax to climax and you get sucked into the fantastic world of The Matrix, we can all feel something special Intelligent action can work  and Hollywood can make a film that does not insult you either.5 stars! A must see film!",The Matrix

This overlong, high concept hokum is little more than a bloated, mechanical, and tiresome film which is big on visuals and short on story. Bland, androgynous Keanu Reeves plays a 22nd-century computer hacker who is recruited by Carrie-Anne Moss to join a band of cyber freedom fighters led by Morpheus in a struggle against the scary, menacing machines that control mankind. The result is an eye-popping, deafening and mind-numbing muddled mayhem and possibly the least humane, least responsible, least pardonable movie I have ever seen.",The Matrix
780,res0owwh,"The Matrix is a spiritual movie, based upon spirituality, not necessarily religion.",10,20 November 2001,"The Matrix does a better than excellent job of illustrating spiritual truths (not religious truths, necessarily, although some religious philosophies are illustrated therein, i.e., Luke 1:37 ""For with God nothing shall be impossible"".)  The crew on-board the Nebuchadnezzar can be considered a spiritual team.  The agents can be considered demons, the neophyte's own demons which he must overcome in order to transcend the ordinary 3-D reality.  The agents present to the neophyte his fears, doubts, and disbeliefs which he must fight against and win in order to fully know himself.Additionally, the movie depicts planetary control and the majority of human beings' unconsciousness in that regard (""Billions of people just walking around oblivious."")The members of the spiritual team act as teachers, as well as the agents. Both teams are considered teachers.  Agent Smith spills a lot of truths. One team operates from a positive viewpoint and the other from a negative viewpoint.Overall, the movie will open one's eyes, if one is looking for the opening. ""Seek and you will find.""

Granted, these days this story is basically part of our every day lives, with people like elon musk mentioning similar concepts, but I honestly don't remember this being that hard to grasp even back when I was a kid when I watched it.It does however explain why today, there are no more watchable films, let alone good ones.

782,shabanavdulaj,A bit overrated.,7,20 May 2020,"It really is thought provoking. They put a lot of thinking into this, I just wished they had put more effort into the writing.Like Inception, first time watching it you're blown away by the concept, but when you get over the mind-blowing idea they came up for the story and start to point out what makes a great film, it's obvious that The Matrix doesn't has what it takes.
The strongest point of this film is the plot. Without the plot this becomes one of the most generic and passable action flicks you can think of. Now we all know that the plot it's not what makes a great movie. In Richard Linklater's 'Everybody Wants Some' the plot almost doesn't exist. Let me describe what the movie is about, 'some guys passing a week before collage starts, hanging around'. You read that and you think, 'there's no chance I'll watch this movie, it sounds too boring'. But it isn't boring at the slightest. Unlike The Matrix, Everybody Wants Some it's written in such a rich way that it's impossible to get you bored.
The Matrix doesn't has that. The Matrix relates on it's plot, on what people often call timeless VFX but I think they are beginning to look a bit old and that's that. There is absolutely nothing else in this film that I could point out as great.Overall it is a good film. It's perfect to watch it with a bunch of friends and have a good time, but if you looking for great filmmaking, look elsewhere.",The Matrix

790,niteman,What's all the fuss about?,7,29 December 1999,"Having finally seen the Matrix after hearing people sing its praises for months, I confess I'm a bit  baffled as to why it's so popular.  It was a good film, yes -- slick visuals, cool effects, nice fight sequences, interesting ideas -- but nowhere near a *great* film, and certainly undeserving of the brou-ha-ha it's been getting.Great science fiction films are original, they provide a new visual or mental language for the viewer or present old ideas in new ways.  Films such as Blade Runner, Alien, Star Wars: A New Hope, and 2001 are examples of that sort of filmmaking.  The Matrix is not.  The visuals are an uneasy mesh of Blade Runner and Alien, the idea that our world is an illusion was most recently explored in the far superior Dark City, and the mythology smacks of Star Wars.  Even though the movie does provide plenty of eye candy, it pays homage to the point of theft.The movie is also overlong, divests most of its plot twists in the first 30 minutes, relies too heavily on extended slo-mo fight scenes (How many spent rounds do we need to see floating slowly to the ground?), and frequently trips over its own internal logic.  But if there is a weak point around which all else seems insignificant, it's Keanu Reeves.  His pipe cleaner body and sunken chest don't fit his role as kung-fu master, and when he strikes a 'manly' pose he just looks silly.  His acting talent is on par with his other work, which means he says ""whoa"" and looks blank a lot. It's a dangerous thing to base a movie around a non-entity like Reeves -- even when his character has his (cliched) is-he-dead-or-isn't-he scene, I couldn't bring myself to care.In short, it's a fun movie, a nice action film posing as a sci-fi film, but don't rent it if you're looking for something that will make you think, or something that you haven't seen before.",The Matrix

Although it is no means as powerful{obviously} as films like Saving Private Ryan and Schindler's List, it is a very imagnative, exciting, superbly acted, film. I have a new respect for Keanu Reeves. This film, I hope, will get nominated for some awards. It deserves a few, at least. I had huge expectations, and this film BLEW THEM AWAY. It is violent, but the language is very tame. There was not a single use of the f-word anywhere! That's impressive. This is one of the best movies I have ever seen. I mean it. I won't try and describe how amazing it is.

793,a.v. boy,"Great Sci-Fi premise, squandered in a merely pretty good action movie.",8,9 May 1999,"This coulda been a contender.  Actually, it kind of was, at least the first two hours.  What starts out as a mediocre hacker movie rapidly reveals itself to be a full-bodied, classic, sci-fi story for the ages.  But then it gets side-tracked, stepping away from the complicated story and getting comfortable in the special-effects enhanced, but basically old-fashioned, shoot-out and marshall-arts sequences.  What could have been a great sci-fi film ends up as an action movie.  Plenty of pulse-pounding action to be sure, but not what this film could have been.To be fair, this film mainly suffers by comparison with those truly great dark sci-fi films:  ""Dark City,"" ""Blade Runner,"" ""City of Lost Children,"" ""Brazil.""  Not being able to measure up doesn't make it a bad film, but the first two hours of this 144 minute epic promised so much more.  It COULD have been in the same league, all it needed was a better ending to pull together a bunch of loose ends and to emphasize the sci-fi premise. Instead, and not a bad condolence prize for fans of Hong Kong action movies, Keanu Reeves gives a performance in the shootouts that would make Chow Yun Fat envious.",The Matrix

Of course there were tons of new special effects but unlike some movies where it seemed the writers were told write the movie around the special effects the Matrix is different.  The MATRIX uses the special effects magic to tell a story.  Never not once does this this movie let you catch your breath.  There are no long ponderous dialogues or dry spots in this movie that allow you to think about mundane things of your life like did you feed the cat, will you mow the lawn this afternoon or tomorrow as you watch this movie.No this movie rips you out of your seat by your throat and once it grabs you it simply does NOT let you go and thats its charm and claim to fame.  The movie is fast paced, action with a strong plot supporting it, the cuts be they of action or dialogue are fast paced information cramed bits you must almost work to collect in keeping up with the movie.  You don't just sit down turn off your brain and let the Matrix happen to you.

800,tom-43722,"Not bad, just overrated.",6,25 October 2021,"I can see why this movie has such a passionate fanbase. Amazing action scenes, a decent albeit flawed script and a fascinating idea which holds it together.However, I think The Matrix's legendary reputation is exaggerated and it's objective quality doesn't match the hype. This is mostly due to Carrie Ann Moss and, to a lesser extent, Keanu Reeves (God bless him, he's a wonderful human being but he's one of those ""slow burn"" actors who didn't achieve his potential until his later years). Put simply, they sucked in this movie. Kudos to them for their martial arts prowess but unfortunately, Moss and Reeves acting prowess wasn't up to the task. Reeves' innocence and naivety did bring some charm to Thomas Anderson AKA Neo but his bland performance didn't exactly make Neo a riveting character. He only seemed to be invested during the mission to rescue Morpheus. As for Trinity, she was just a bland chick in a leather outfit who had no chemistry with Neo. I think there was potential for a decent character if they had gotten a better actress but even in scenes where Trinity's friends were being slaughtered right in front of her, Moss failed to convey the pain, grief and anger that Trinity should have been feeling.Even Laurence Fishburne had a rather stilted and bland delivery but to his credit, he still carried a fatherly sense of authority. After being taken out by Agent Smith, Morpheus inner strength showed through his resistance to the Agent's torture techniques. I can understand why some people would be disappointed that Morpheus isn't the unstoppable badass he was hyped up to be, but I think that's precisely the point. It's a ""never meet your heroes"" situation. I also like that it was hinted that Morpheus' blind faith in Neo could have resulted in disaster because it made him a more nuanced character who, despite his reputation as a wise and powerful man, is still capable of making mistakes.Hugo Weaving's performance as Agent Smith has me slightly conflicted. On one hand, his strange delivery is not what I would call a good performance if he were playing a human character. On the other hand, Agent Smith is NOT a human character. He's an AI program who walks around wearing the facade of a human so I can't in good conscience call it a bad performance. My favourite scene from Smith was when he admitted to Morpheus that he hated the Matrix and wanted to break free. If I'm not mistaken, there are theories that Smith might have been The One instead of Neo and I think that scene could be used as evidence of that. Not conclusive evidence, but evidence nonetheless.I think the main problem with The Matrix is that the characters around Neo and Trinity seem interesting. Neo and Trinity themselves do not.",The Matrix

810,Terry-32,"Super action, great story, what else do you need?",10,1 April 1999,"I was waiting so long for this movie to come out. When I saw the preview during the Super Bowl, I knew I had to see this film. Finally on Wedsday, March 31st at 4:00 P.M. right after school, I went straight to the movies, and saw it. It was fantastic. The visual effects were amazing. The actors could do all these amazing moves. Keanu Reeves and Lawrence Fishburn do martial arts in this movie, and they were great at it. I've never seen them do such moves, and I was mesmorized. The story was amazing. Even if I was allowed to, and wanted to, I couldn't explain it. You have to see the movie in order to understand. All the actors and actresses were great. Keanu Reeves especially. I liked him before, but he was great in this movie. It's his 2nd best performance since ""The Devil's Advocate."" I can go on and on about saying how great this movie is, but I'll stop. There is no reason why one shouldn't like this movie. So, See it.",The Matrix
811,Hypotheses,"I say--without hyperbole--that ""The Matrix"" is the best action/sci-fi film so far this year.",8,3 June 1999,"I say--without hyperbole--that ""The Matrix"" is the best action/sci-fi film this year so far. Roger Ebert can kiss my proverbial a@#$! for not making his review strong enough, because I was not convinced at the time. Of course, the film has its flaws, which I will point out later, but overriding that is the film's complete ambush to the senses. I knew, for example, that once Trinity flew into the window of that building from the roof of another with such dazzling SFX accuracy, that I was going to enjoy the film with or without lousy acting.Although critically, the Wachowski brothers' previous film ""Bound"" is wholly of more merit, ""Matrix"" delivers for its genre. You simply check your brain at the door, let the deluge begin, and pick it back up when the lights go up. Combining, to various degrees, good acting (many exceptions), intense action, and a terrific sci-fi/fantasy story, ""The Matrix"" has secured a place for itself among some of the more truly satisfying action/sci-fi films, such as Terminator 2: Judgment Day, Blade Runner, Dark City, Total Recall, GATTACA, Back to the Future, Star Wars Trilogy, X-files: Fight the Future, Aliens, Men in Black, Eve of Destruction, The Puppet Masters, Star Trek II: The Wrath of Kahn and so on. Moreover, although the special effects are key, there must be balance. One need only remember failures such as Waterworld, Star Trek V: The Final Frontier, The Postman, Virus, Starship Troopers (Sorry, I read the book), Lost in Space, Deep Rising, Johnny Mnemonic, Vitruosity and so on to know this.The brilliant special effects and action sequences carry the film, but to its detriment are cartoon characters, the trite (and almost comical) aphorisms with Biblical overtones from Morpheus, the weak lead Keanu, a truly promising story line that is never really fulfilled or elaborated upon, i.e., there is no third act, and the film's clear avoidance of the serious question that Cypher, Joe Pantaliano's character, raises. Aside from that, the effects and other elements work well to balance out these flaws.The plot, although not completely original--see Dark City--is quite surreal, dark, pulpy, and most comic book-like. There are some literate allusions to Alice in Wonderland such as follow the white rabbit and through the looking glass, but also to the Bible. Neo, for instance, is a weak Christ-like character whose name is an anagram for ""One."" Morpheus rearranges into ""Push Rome"" and Agent Smith into ""I'm the Angst."" And, characters with names such as Trinity and Apoc are obvious enough. In addition, the two worlds in the film make a striking contrast. The wholly bleached, grim, and gothic city seems almost idyllic when compared with the graphic and hellish ""real world."" Nonetheless, the Gestapo agents of the Matrix practically steal the show. Hugo Weaving's ominous portrayal of Agent Smith is outright superb character acting. Last, but not least, Keanu's marital arts are unintentionally hilarious. I know you laughed, come on now.Yet, even after you combine this hodgepodge of elements, ""The Matrix"" will still leave you thoroughly entertained--as much as any rollercoaster ride, but for a lot less money.",The Matrix
812,cemk-2,"Good special effects, but no originality at all.",2,10 September 1999,"""Ignorance is bliss"" as they say in the film. You go in without any knowledge of the Science-Fiction literature and you enjoy the film, you go in the theatre with some SF knowledge, the amount of rip-off and open plagiarism annoys you like hell. The Matrix is as if the screenwriter decided to use parts of his fave SF stories and made up a story to bind them all: The Second Foundation Trilogy,  all that's written by William Gibson, Ender's Game by O.S. Card, Star Trek's holodeck concept, references to Terminator films, and to Cliff Simak's short stories, and more and more show up in the film. And with awe and horror I saw Obi-Wan and young Luke in the Morpheus - Neo dialogue somewhere in the first 30 minutes of the film; even the music was a la Star Wars at that moment. I guess they thought ""most people stop reading SF after they are 20 years old, so they either won't bother or won't remember"" which is a crying shame. However, giving the devil its due, the special effects are interesting, the pace is high and the music/sound effects are deafening, therefore The Matrix becomes an interesting spectacle, but it's still hollow, borrowed, and plundered from others' decent works. Pity. I wish it were ""the"" SF film people were talking about. Did you notice, I didn't write even a single word about Keanu Reeves' expressionless, lifeless, face.",The Matrix
813,John-423,"Overblown, Overrated and Overdrawn...",1,4 September 2000,"perhaps being the last soul on earth to see this film, I honestly cant say I went into it expecting much, and being as much I cant say i'm dissapointed. For all the Brouhaha surrounding this special effects marvel, I fail to see what in fact was so good about it. It was almost all effects, almost to the point of Nausea, something that Keaunu did little to help. His typical ""Dewd"" performance was laughable at best, bordering on the wretched and far from notable. Fishburne was great as usual, but he couldnt save his piece of trash and the other actors were like a B movie ensemble. Maybe the next film will move up a notch and actually be watchable.",The Matrix
814,deputydoofus,"Good thrills, but the Wachowskis can do better.",8,31 January 2000,"This isn't one of the greatest Si-Fi movies ever made, but it was the best one of '99.  The story takes so many turns that it's easy to enjoy and think about.  However, it saddens me when the obligatory violent scene is the scene the audience appears to like most.  The scene, for me, didn't need to be there, as it goes against the characters' morality.Overall, it's good for a few thrills, but there's nothing in it that other movies haven't done better.  If you liked the violence and anarchic ideas in the Matrix, see Fight Club.  If you liked the mysterious world and gradually revealing plotline, see Dark City.  If you liked the films overall style, see Bound (The Wachowski Brothers' first movie).  Each one of those films serves it's particular purpose much more effectively than The Matrix.  The Matrix does combine the three elements in a cohesive way, and does produce one heck of a thrill, so it offers something few other movies can give.  See it, and, if you like it, see the other ones I've mentioned, you'll find they have a lot to offer as well.  My rating: 8/10",The Matrix
815,exterminator_99,It is all around us...,9,21 March 2002,"A welcome addition to the pantheon of revered science fiction movies, ""The Matrix"" is already a modern classic.  Made at the tail end of the 20th century it's a meshing of genres, with a vice-tight storyline and script and an abundance of amazing special effects.  It separates itself from the slew of recent science fiction thanks to its adhesion and capability to portray one of the more original takes on a post-apocalyptic netherworld, where man is not in control of his destiny, but is controlled by machines  another example of man creating his own destruction.The most striking aspect of the ""The Matrix"" is its amazing pacing. Brothers Larry and Andy Wachowski, who both wrote and directed the film, obviously take their cue from comic books.  Such is the narrative structure, the film reads like a graphic novel.  Its composition is made of a great number of close ups, emphasising the emotional toll of something that is unexplainable, something like the Matrix.  When the attention isn't placed on the characters, the vista opens up to amazing special effects and action sequences.  The Wachowski brothers pull back and let the action flow, generally in slow motion.  You could be mistaken for reading it as a comic, soaking up every piece of design and production in the frame.Like so many other comic book style films and stories, the core character of ""The Matrix"" is a superhero, a man who will save mankind.  No one knows exactly who he is, until one day, his cover is removed.  Neo (Keanu Reeves), aka Thomas Anderson, could be the one, but all we have to go on to know this is the prophecy of Morpheus (Lawrence Fishbourne).  Morpheus is the leader of a ragtag bunch of human resistance fighters.  Their battle is against the machines, who breed humans for their energy, which in turn powers the machines in their domination of the remnance of Earth.  The world in which we exist is nothing more than a computer programme, designed to pacify our souls as we are drained for power, much like a battery.Neo, who lives his double life as software programmer by day, hacker extraordinaire by night, has always felt his life is different to everyone else's.  He's been intrigued by finding out just what the Matrix is.  Where he got the original knowledge of the concept of the Matrix is unknown  it's almost as if he knows by osmosis.His suspicions are confirmed when it all coalesces in a short space of time. Neo's life as Anderson is removed.  Morpheus is revealed to Neo by Trinity (Carrie Ann Moss), a beautiful heroine and messenger.  When he is finally introduced to Morpheus his journey into the real' world and out of the Matrix begins.  It's a thrilling ride that combines a number of classic cool' movie themes, including martial arts, action and sci-fi paranoia to name a few.Morpheus is presented as a Zen-like, Yoda-style sensei.  He speaks in contradictions and double meanings.  ""Don't think you can hit me, know you can,"" he says when training Neo in martial arts.  The way in which Neo learns' is a slight copout.  All his newly acquired knowledge is planted into his brain via computer.  While he may be the saviour of mankind against the tyranny of the machines, his intelligence is programmed' via a hook-up to his brain.  In that sense Neo becomes artificial intelligence as he has not learnt his craft but has been programmed with it.This aside Morpheus trains Neo to remove himself from his human vessel, to become more of a spirit that can transcend his earthly cadaver.  Neo (an acronym for One, aka The One?) becomes a Bruce Lee style action superhero, complete with an arsenal that would befit two Arnold Schwarzeneggers.  His main enemies are Sentient Agents  created by the machines to travel in and out of the Matrix to destroy the earthly Neo as Thomas Anderson.  When they fail and Morpheus' training of Neo begins, the Agents (led by Australian actor Hugo Weaving) realise their task has become a great deal more difficult.  It all results in some amazing action sequences of special effects and bullets that make for an effective and uplifting ending.Science fiction angle aside, ""The Matrix"" has enough to please everyone. Its subplots include romance, a little comedy, social commentary and a great deal of action.  It draws on a number of similar films such as ""Zardoz"" and ""The Terminator"".  Once again, it befits the sprawling nature of a comic book, touching different nerves when needed within the narrative.
The special effects are brilliant and far outdo the efforts of George Lucas' ""Star Wars: The Phantom Menace"", which was released the same year.  While Lucas' film was created to almost look unreal  far too fantastic to be believable  ""The Matrix"" is more plausible, if a science fiction film of this ilk can be believable.  The fluidity and positioning of the effects works because we do not have to convince ourselves we are in what we are witnessing.  Costume design borders on S&M, with its black leather and synthetics perhaps touching on some underlying sexual overtones the film seems reluctant or unable to pursue.The acting, whilst not the focal point of the film, is strong enough. Reeves is effective, Moss credible and Fishbourne majestic.  Weaving's Agent Smith is an odd but suitably evil character and sports possibly the most cosmopolitan accent I have ever heard.""The Matrix"" was a huge hit on release and has subsequently dominated VHS and DVD charts around the world since.  Its combination of sheer entertainment and an in depth (if slightly diluted for the screen) story is enough to keep all audiences happy, from popcorn munching teens, nerdy sci-fi fanatics to the film enthusiast.  ""The Matrix Reborn"" will be an interesting concept upon release in 2003 and we await to see if it matches the originality and progressive nature of its accomplished prequel.",The Matrix
816,thebishop2,More holes than a hunk o'swiss,6,9 December 2000,"I didn't dislike this movie.That said, I just have a few problems with it. I'll start with the cast. Where in the world did they find actors so badly on par with Keanu Reeves? Amongst the 'pretty boy' actors in Hollywood, he is the prince of the wood face. Clint Eastwood may have more expression. All of the actors, with the possible exception of Larry Fishburn, who I have seen in other roles that were good, are as stiff as a corpse. None of Neo's pals need to be in this film. They are totally uninteresting and unnecessary. Apoc? Switch? Mouse? Why? These people have the personalities of a smock. At least the two brothers serve the purpose of getting them in and out of the Matrix and driving the ship. The others are there to look good, and they missed on that too.And why so much needless violence? All these 'cops' they kill are just people suppossedly stuck in that gooey jell you get out of the 25 cent vending machines, right? So, Neo and his babe go around and kill a bunch of helpless, innocent people. Those guys were just minding their own biz when they burst in with an arsenal that rivals that of Rick James's.
And then there are the scary characters. They range from the emotionless 'smiths' to that of those creepy kids who bent spoons and made me wax sentimental about unicef for some reason. In fact, the Smiths were the best 'acted' roles, but I think that's because they had the least to stretch since they were the bad guys.
I can't even get into the plot holes, since there is a word limit, but there were a lot. This whole movie is beyond improbable. But, it's worth a viewing or 2. Check it out if you got a friend who wants to blow there money one saturday night.",The Matrix

819,debjyoti1981,A Triumph In the Genre of Science Fiction !!!,9,6 December 2009,"Writing down the review of ""The Matrix"" is itself a sturdy effort. I will try but can't guarantee... :)""The Matrix"" will always remain as a triumph in the genre of Science Fiction. Filled with rich narrative, this movie was triumphant in revolutionizing the thinking process of the viewers. The Wachowski brothers have presented us with some story which we could have never imagined even in our wildest dreams.Since this movie deals with a complex theme, this will require every attention in order to comprehend the flow of the story. This movie is definitely not for those who just like to see action without willing to appreciate the philosophical approach and the depth of understanding.When it comes to casting, I think Wachowski brothers have made the perfect choice for putting Keanu Reeves as 'Neo', I don't think any other person could have pulled it so efficiently as him. Of course I don't need to mention that Carrie Moss was perfect as 'Trinity', did I miss some one wellwho will forget Hugo Weaving as 'Agent Smith', and it was simply overwhelming.Action has been the integral part of this movie and will it be very hard to believe that it had become the groundwork of many new movies for the years to come. I think since so much innovative technique was adopted for the visual effects; it was not difficult even for the Academy Awards to be acquainted with and thus aptly awarding this movie for its Sound & Visual effects.Well I had been the unlucky few to have missed this movie when it came out to the theaters, but I did enjoy when the DVD came out. I must say the DVD transmission was not at all regretful. Sound quality was top notch.This movie had been the part of the Trilogy and comparing with the other two movies, this had been the best as a stand alone very much similar to the 'Terminator' Franchise.""The Matrix"" might have received mixed reviews but truthfully this was one of the best science fiction movies which came out in the nineties. This also had been successful in revitalizing the interest amongst us; after all we go to Movie Theaters expecting to enjoy the show with a mesmeric experience.",The Matrix
820,Bob_647,An expertly crafted action film from the formula; with some redefining action mark trimmings.,10,7 June 2020,"""The Matrix"" is a visually dazzling cyber adventure, full of kinetic excitement, it uses formula when it's getting interesting. It is not a letdown when a movie begins by redefining the nature of reality, and ends with a shoot-out. We want a leap of the imagination, so it does not mind in case of obligatory climaxes with automatic weapons fire.Acting wise the film works excellently. I won't say that there aren't any issues because there are but overall the acting is pretty flawless. Keanu Reeves plays the main character, Neo, or Thomas A. Anderson and while he is not the perfect actor I think he does a pretty good job in The Matrix (and the sequels). He doesn't have the longest of lines which was probably a deliberate choice from the directors and it works because this gives him a better opportunity to work on posture and facial expressions and I must say that overall his body language is very good. Very clear and well defined. Laurence Fishbourne plays Neo's mentor Morpheus and he does an excellent job of it. His lines flow with a certain confidence and style that makes his character somewhat unique and interesting. Carrie-Anne Moss does a good job as well and succeeds in looking both cool and sexy in her leather outfit. Joe Pantoliano, a critically underrated actor does a brilliant job of bringing his character, Cypher, to life. I can't say much about him because his character is pretty essential to the plot and I certainly don't wan't to spoil it for anyone. Gloria Foster appears in a relatively small role that will have greater significance in the following films and she does a very good job. The best acting is provided by Hugo Weaving, however, in his portrayal of Agent Smith. It is really something to watch him act out the changes in his character. Agent Smith gains some human traits like anger, sense of dread, hate and eventually even a sly sense of humor (mostly in the sequels). Two thumbs way up to Weaving who has created one of the finest screen villains of all time.But what makes The Matrix several cuts above the rest of the films in its genre is that there are simply no loopholes. The script, written by the Wachowski brothers is intelligent but carefully not geeky. The kung fu sequences were deftly shot -- something even Bruce Lee would've been proud of. The photography was breathtaking. (I bet if you had to cut every frame on the reel and had it developed and printed, every single frame would stand on its own.) And the acting? Maybe not the best Reeves but name me an actor who has box-office appeal but could portray the uneasy and vulnerable protagonist, Neo, to a T the way Reeves did. But, come to think of it, if you pit any actor beside Fishburne, you're bound to confuse that actor for bad acting. As Morpheus, Fishburne is simply wicked! Shades of his mentor-role in Higher Learning, nobody exudes that aura of quiet intensity than Fishburne. His character, battle-scarred but always composed Morpheus, is given an extra dose of mortality (He loves Neo to a fault.) only Mr. Fishburne can flesh outEffects wise the film is simply stunning and it deservedly was awarded the Oscar for best effects (and was regrettably cheated out of a nomination in the Best Film category) ahead of even Star Wars. The reason that I think The Matrix deserves the Oscar for best effects is simply that the effects in The Matrix are more innovative than the ones in Star Wars. Just take a look at how many times the effects have been spoofed and you'll probably agree. The effects also help in the symbolism of the film and in creating a very dystopian atmosphere not unlike the one seen in Blade Runner and this works brilliantly. The film looks beautiful at all times and today 6 years later (my God has it already been 6 years?) the effects still hold their ground against new science fiction films. Add the effects to the brilliant editing and you have a visual masterpiece on your hands. Very well done.The reason that I think The Matrix is more reviewable than pretty much any other film is the story and the philosophical and religious elements of the story because with every viewing I catch something I didn't see the previous time I watched it. Without spoiling the film I think I can mention a few of the more obvious elements. Obviously the film draws on the Messiah myth as Neo is a clear reference to Jesus with the analogy of his name (Neo = one, as in The One) Aside from the Christianic elements the film also gets its inspiration from Budhism, Gnosticism (Gnosis = knowledge) but is also inspired by Plato and his analogy of the Cave and Jean Baudrillard's essay, Simulacra and Simulations. Explaining these elements would make this review go on forever so aside from mentioning them I will not comment on them further.People will say what they want to say about how good The Matrix is but the bottom line is this: finally there's a philosophical film that has cut through this generation. My generation. The Wachowski brothers probably scribbled a little P.S. note when they finished the script saying: think for a moment about your existence. What is the Matrix, you ask? Something that's closer to reality than you think.",The Matrix

Truly matrix has done so in more ways opening up an interesting concept of the future ahead, it's projection of reality within reality is interesting.The whole message really is simple, our present world has been taken over with technology to ease our lives. Only in the matrix they vent to the possibility that with what is going on now it can create superior advancements of machines if were not careful. Reeves and the rest gave a great performance for their roles as well as being convincing with the fight scenes. And who can forget bullet time!! If you can't appreciate this film for it's amazing take on the sci-fi, kung fu, action and romance, then clearly it isn't for you.

826,Baghdaddy,"Red Pill, Or The Blue One?",8,25 June 2015,"This is one of those films, that has so much meaning in it, its unreal! However, the action scenes are incredible, and the concept is original.It starts with Neo (Reeves) living a dual life, one as a computer hacker, one as a standard 9-5 office worker in a technology conglomerate. After a strange dream, Neo awakens & never quite feels normal, always questioning the blandness of his life.Once he is hacked, he is told to 'follow the rabbit down the hole', which is the proceeded by a knock on the door. Once he answers the door, he realizes it is just his friends asking him to join them on a night out. Whilst he initially declines, Neo then spots a tattoo in the shape of a white rabbit, and decides to listen to the earlier message so he joins them on a night out.The film contains everything, from great acting, good dialogue and my favorite is an original story line. The idea that we, as humans, are happy to continue working 9 to 5, whilst questioning our purpose on this planet. Coupled with our increased dependency on machines in the modern age means that the idea that machines will eventually supersede us is not a fairy tale concept.The action is great, with some of the characters now becoming infamous, most noticeably Fishburne's character Morpheus, seen as a sensei- type, but one with an incredibly high intellect, that teaches to ask the right question then look for the right answer.On the downside, this film contained too many action film moments where it was clearly possible to escape a fate, suspect a Judas-type moment, or to act faster and therefore make life so much easier on themselves!Really great movie, which for me beckons the ultimate question: Would you take the red pill, or the blue one?",The Matrix

828,RobT-2,Good of its kind,2,3 September 1999,"There are some movies that, at least for me, look like they'd work better as a comic book (or ""graphic novel"") than as a movie, that present an effective series of images but which raise untoward questions when real human actors have to convince viewers this is for real.  ""The Fifth Element"" and ""Men in Black"" were two such movies--in fact, the former was partly designed by a comix artist, and the latter adapted from a comic book series.I know of no graphic forerunners for ""The Matrix"", but I would group it with ""comic book movies"" of this sort.  The good part is that it's quite a bit smarter than the usual CBM, with serious attention paid to the underpinnings of the plot and even an effort to get in some real science some of the time. The bad part is that the filmmakers haven't quite thought everything through.  (SPOILER WARNING: skip to the next paragraph if you don't want to read this.)  I liked very much Agent Smith's explanation of why the bad guys don't keep humanity complacent with a simulated utopia, chosing the late 20th century instead.  On the other hand, if they need human bioelectricity as an energy source--in other words, if it's strictly human bodies they need--why don't they just scrap the simulation and lobotomize everybody? (Is it possible that they need fully developed human minds for some other reason?  If so, why?)  If the filmmakers had at least addressed this question, it would have added some backbone to the plot, which needs all the support it can get.  Oh well, maybe they're saving it for the sequel.Otherwise, the standard strengths and weaknesses of CBM's apply here. Forget the gunplay, explosions, and other such mayhem--throw an egg anywhere in a multiscreen theater these days, and you've got even chances of splatting into a movie featuring these prominently.  Beyond that, ""The Matrix"" contains more than its fair share of stunning images, some disturbing, some mindbending, and a few both.I had problems with the acting, though, or maybe it was the way the actors were directed.  When descending into the Matrix, the good guys show almost no emotions at all.  It's like since they know the Matrix isn't ""real"", they can't be bothered having any feelings about it.  This fits with the plot, but makes it hard to identify with the characters.  (Fortunately, everyone seems more human on the ship, a special relief in the case of the excellent actor Laurence Fishburne.)The only actor to avoid this difficulty is Keanu Reeves, arguably because his character is struggling with the ""reality"" of the Matrix over the course of the film.  You can almost watch him shedding emotions bit by bit as he gets control of the situation.  (Frankly, I think he's more convincing and compelling as a fallible but highly competent hero of the sort he played in ""Speed"" than as a potential world-savior.)The upshot: a good but not great film, well worth watching for its unique and compelling parts, but (my usual complaint) not what it could have been.",The Matrix
829,Nic673,This is best science fiction film of the 90's,10,6 September 1999,This film is fifteen times better Phantom Menace. The story line is very interesting and invigorating.

People who had seen the movie came out and spoke gibberish about pills and spoons, and reviews painted pictures of extremely nice SF movie with rich philosophical content. And after I saw the trailer, I knew I had to see this movie at all costs. And, I must say, it definitely was worth it.Matrix is, as I mentioned, a mind-blowing experience - you just have to see it to believe it.

831,azaro666,The first twenty-first century movie....,8,28 January 2000,"The diversity of the brothers Wachowski is quite incredible. Almost trying to prove that it takes no talent to make the same film over and over again (Spielberg?). They go from Bound to this. Bound being a lesbian film-noir, Matrix being a movie which is sure to be imitated as we go technology crazy in the C21. Putting Keanu in a high budget, special-effects laden vision of the future (or the present) may have seemed like a big gamble. Keanu had been making stinkers for a long time and had yet proved he had a real talent or box-office pull. Yet they have placed him in position of what must have been a hard fought for role. Then having seen Keanu as Neo, it is impossible to imagine anyone else being the computer nerd of the future. It may not be a real role of emotional stretch but these are often the hardest ones to bring life to. Keanu manages it and has also cemented his place on the Hollywood A-List.It is an action movie, for sure. Let that not distract you though. The action is there and also the possibility that effects can over-shadow the ability this movie has to affect. A vision of the vision as bleak as this has been shown before but this movie really does give you the potential to believe that we are already living the future.The plot may be a little confusing but the pace of the adventure doesn't try to throw the plot out the window. For effects fans, as well as entertainment seekers alike this movie tells us that the future of Keanu as well as the Brothers Wachowski is very bright indeed.",The Matrix
832,Tyler-Durden,This movie was very good.. I even wrote a summary.,10,21 January 2000,"""The Matrix""... That is kind of an original name. The Matrix is (besides ""The world that has been pulled over your eyes to blind you from the truth"") one of the best movies ever, and lets say that again: EVER!Some people say that The Matrix was not only great because of the action scenes, but please!, lets not try to fool ourselves, this movie's action scenes were probably the best ones in history.. so far at least. Of course, with this I don't mean to say that the movie's script is bad, or that it has a lack of something.I think The Matrix deserves to be considered one of the best movies ever by reasons like this: Even the people who don't usually watch or like action films, liked this one! And why is that? Simple answer: Because the movie is simply extraordinary.I think Keanu Reeves has had a great career, but this movie moved him to the top, he will now be remembered by everyone, along with the movie.. And his look with the black outfit and the glasses is neat.I think Laurence Fishburne did a great performance too as Morpheus, and so did Carry Anne Moss and Agent Smith.The story of this movie might be a bit out of reality (or completely unbelievable), but this can't stop this movie from being one of the best movies of the decade AND the whole century.I personally have watched this movie about 5 times, and the first 2 or 3, every time I watched it, I discovered new things that I have not seen in the previews one.Also I would like to say that this movie was very original, for example, at the beginning, it doesn't show the names of any of the actors in it. Also the sound effects were for sure the best ones I've ever heard. The sound track is very good also.This movie deserves to be rated with the highest score possible, maybe more than any other movie in this year, and that's why I'm giving it a 10 out of 10 score.If you have not seen The Matrix yet, don't waste your time, and see it! After all the popularity it had, you might expect something very big, but don't, please, because if you expect something that goes beyond the limits, you might not like it, after all, it's just another movie.And remember that Unfortunately, no one can be told what The Matrix is...

Only complaint would be thinking to hard with some of the blabbo mind job talk. My reason for adding this is a funny trivial antidote for some of the philosophical questions surrounding the origins of this fairy tale. Anybody remember the old Ray Bradbury cartoon ""Little Nemo""? Was watching with my child the other day and busted a gut when Nemo goes asleep and enters ""Slumberland"" and meets up with King Morpheus! I'm thinking -- Okay back in grade school the little Wachowski brothers read the same book and said ""Hey! Sounds like a great idea for a full blown sci-fi epic, let's add some cool dance music and jazzy special effects and add deep meaning to Nemo (now NEO) journey into Slumberland (now the MATRIX) and save King Morpheus (Uh, MORPHEUS). Pretty ironic huh? Have to probe the brothers next time I run into them at the Quickie Mart. :)I wrote this in October of 2003 highly expecting a debate over my uncovering of this little known comic which looks to be the muse for the Matrix series. Looks as if nobody even researched or counter-reacted my findings so I have to ask again in 2010 - did the Wachowski brothers watch Little Nemo and come up with the Matrix - and if they did unfortunately they are not original!

836,Brad2002,Very original,9,4 September 2004,"What if the world around us was, in fact, a hologram? The Matrix is based on that idea and, because of that, is one of the most original movies I've ever seen. While the story isn't perfect, it's interesting and fast paced enough to keep you glued to your seat. It's one of those movies where you can't miss one minute or you'll be confused about what's happening next.The action sequences were particularly good. After finding out the truth, Neil (Keanu Reeves) is able to perform amazing feats once he realized the 'rules' aren't rules at all and can be bent to a point in the holographic world.I'm not a big fan of Keanu Reeves, but I thought he did a good job as did Laurence Fishburn and the rest of the cast. Hugo Weaving was great as agent Smith, who plays a computer controlled holographic projection who hunts down renegade humans who've stumbled onto the secret.Definitely worth watching even if you generally don't enjoy action films. I'd give it about 9 out of 10 mostly because of originality.",The Matrix

838,g_ryder,"Unfortunately, no one can be told what the Matrix is. You have to see for yourself. And it's going to find you if you really want it to.",10,24 May 2012,"The all around brilliance of this movie comes from the multidimensional themes of art, mythology, intellect and entertainment. It stands out exceptional even in special effects and martial arts, so there is something for everyone in it, and that is why it will remain as an all time classic. My focus in this review will be on the myth of The Matrix, the intellectual ideas and the questions that arise in the plot and the dialogs, and these are as I have formulated them: What is real, and by the same token, what is illusory? What is really behind the complex, seductive, at times apparently chaotic and random, at times apparently precisely timed and connected coincidences of the events and between the people of the world? What controls all the events of the world? Do individuals have any control at all through their choices and decisions over what happens or will happen? Or is it all 'programmed' or 'fated' in a scripted manner? In short, who or what runs the show? Are all our perceptions the result of the cultural construct (the set of perceptual interpretations and beliefs about the world 'taught' into each one of us by our social, cultural 'teachers'), or do we have the freedom to make our perception take flight into new territories, where no one has ventured so far? What are the limits of this freedom and how can we then meaningfully correlate with the existing knowledge matrix (and this movie is itself part of The Matrix) of the now diffuse and globalized culture of this world? These questions have been asked by seers, visionaries and thinkers in all parts of the world for millennia. The answers, descriptions, interpretations provided by these people found in the various myths, are so diverse and different that it's mind boggling to the non-thinker, but quite a challenge to the explorer. Levi Strauss put it this way: ""A theoretically infinite number of versions of the myth will be generated, each slightly different from the others. Myth thus becomes the third dimension of language; in it a continuous attempt is made to reconcile the other two dimensions of language - the diachronic and the synchronic. Because complete reconciliation is impossible, myth grows spiral - wise until the intellectual impulse which has produced it is exhausted. Myth grows then, because, structurally, the contradiction - the asymmetry – which gives it life cannot be resolved. Different versions are part of the same myth precisely because a myth is not reducible to a single uniform content, but is a dynamic structure. Eventually all the versions of a myth have to be taken into consideration so as its structure can become apparent."" So if any of these questions has ever bothered you, then welcome to The Matrix, the command and control system of the world that is by the necessary order of things, hidden from us for the very simple reason that it must be beyond individual manipulation (yes, the factual flaw in the movie is that the Matrix can be hacked). The only thing that The Matrix will allow is for the determined individual is to have a glimpse or a series of images of itself, but the interpretation of those is only one such interpretation that ideally should have correlation to interpretations that others have given. ""The test of a true myth is that each time you return to it, new insights and interpretations arise"" (Starhawk). Good luck to you and hope you 'see' The Matrix, that is, if you really want to.",The Matrix

First time I watched the movie when I passed high school, though at that time it should've gone bouncer over me if my brothers wouldn't have been there. I was simply bowled over, but I didn't know it will keep coming back in different shades. Then I watched it again and again, I understood a bit more, then came all the other parts, I came to my Insti, then in 2nd yr of my B.Tech. I watched it about 10 times more, then I started experiencing another level of the matrix i.e. the one related to Bhagwat Gita. Your life(life in the matrix), enlightenment(free your mind), spiritual life(life in real world) and on and on. This movie my friend is more than what you can imagine, watch it if you are a movie lover, sci fi addict, spiritual, human and above all if you are ""plugged"". I like all the dialogs of the matrix and I think I remember 50% of the script. This movie is made to rock your life. The dialogs are the best part of the matrix......so script/screenplay is nice, cinematography is good but amateur, direction and all is good, acting I think is not required here.

""The Matrix"" has style to burn.  It's one of the greatest looking science fiction movies in a long, long time, and the visual effects are cutting-edge miraculous.  The performances are fine, and the sometimes-wooden Keanu Reeves is sympathetic and believable.My biggest reservation is that the plot isn't exactly original.  It's the old ""the machines have taken over and a small band of humans is fighting back"" idea that was used in the Terminator movies and various other sci-fi movies and books through the decades.  Also, like in the Terminator films, the savior of the human race is, of course, a man, who succeeds partly because of a supportive woman.  Why can't the savior be a woman for a change?  Also, Reeves' character is supposed to be an accomplished computer hacker, but these skills are never utilized in his battle against the machines.I don't mean to sound negative, because I really had a great time at this movie.

I found many ideas quite brilliant though the story seemed lacking in some aspects: the resurrecting kiss, the idea of the messiah (so worn out, be it a ubiquitous Jungian collective symbol), I actually found no rationale for the Matrix to perpetuate the human existence at all. Why should Matrix keep these humans living at all in the context of the story. Does it need guinea pigs to experiment on for some untold reason ?

It has one of the best openings and first half that you are ever likely to see. And then it all comes down to gun fights and fist fights. Mind you they are spectacularly well staged and shot gun fights and fist fights, but that's as much as the movie can offer as any sort of conclusion. The premise sets up so many wonderful ideas and possibilities it's too bad the script makes no attempt to explore them in any substantial way. We are introduced to The Matrix. We see The Matrix as a kind of playground, then as a kind of battle ground. And then that's it. Questions like if you were rebels fighting against an evil enemy that had enslaved mankind, why would your method of attack be the equivalent of going to their house and playing Nintendo against them?

The direction and special effects are incredible but don't take away from the plot or the acting which is so often the case with this kind of film. All aspects of the film come together so well, the frightening plot, the awesome special effects, the insightful direction, the great acting and the gripping script.Lawrence Fishburne is perfectly cast as the wise leader Morpheus, his character is always cool and delivers some very memorable quotes (""Fate it seems, is not without a sense of irony."") perfectly, every one of his movements is planned and deliberate.Keanu Reeves proves that he still has some acting ability in his portrayal of Mr. Anderson, Neo. Being totally out of his depth for the first half of the movie and then turning into the one who can do it all was very well done.The Agents also deserve praise for their roles. Hugo Weaving could not have done better, everything from the monotone voice to the constant menacing glare was bone chilling. By the end of the film you can really see how much he hates being in the matrix, being a sheperd to the more primitive prisoners.From the sunglasses to the boots, the costumes for each and every character suit the film to a tea. And the sets compliment everything, the interior of the Nebuchadnezzar especially.Overall a brilliant film that is a must see. One of the few I've given a 10/10.",The Matrix
850,The Truth,Doesn't quite fulfill it's promises (spoilers),7,19 April 2000,"The first two thirds of The Matrix are simply stunning. The visuals are unlike any movie, the Wachowski brothers have created a roller coaster ride with only a few stops (although those stops are just as beautiful as the rest of the movie - I especially liked the sensitive display of Neo's healing process after he had woken to the real world). The premise of the movie - that the world might be nothing more than an illusion fed to our heads - is a bit of a science fiction cliché, but it can still be used to make an excellent sci-fi film (and most of the time The Matrix does just that). The acting is good, even Keanu Reeves manages to be credible, by acting as little as possible. Carrie-Anne Moss is also good, though her screen time could have been longer. The one who really steals the show, though, is Laurence Fishburne. His portrayal of Morpheus is excellent, I especially like the little touches that separate his Matrix persona from the Morpheus of the real world. To sum it up: technically speaking The Matrix is nearly perfect.So, the set is excellent, the actors are good, and the speed is breathtaking - what is there to complain about? The problem, as in so many other big budget science fiction movies, is the ending. Don't get me wrong, I did enjoy the last third as well, but only on a physical level, not intellectually. The shoot-out in the lobby is one of the greatest action scenes cinema has ever produced, but that's all it is - a great action scene. The deeper elements of the plot (such as the agony agent Smith feels having to live in a world populated by humans) are left unexplored when the rumble begins. Scenes like Keanu Reeves yelling ""My name is NEO!"", or Carrie-Anne Moss reviving Neo with a kiss make my cliché-o-meter bounce up to ten. And why, oh why does a film with such potential have to end in a kung-fu fight? Having already seen Bound, the Wachowski brothers' previous film, I had high expectations for The Matrix, but in the end it was clear that the low-budget Bound would still remain the better one of these two. Big money doesn't always equal conventionality, but in this case, sadly, it does.Let's just hope that the success of The Matrix gives the Wachowski brothers the courage to make movies which are satisfying both visually AND intellectually. They certainly are capable of doing so.",The Matrix

856,sdillon-1,One of the most over praised blockbusters of recent years.,7,30 July 2003,"CONTAINS POSSIBLE SPOILERSThe Matrix is essentially a cross between The Truman Show and The Terminator, and it's not as good as either.  It lacks the topicality of the former, the excitement of the latter and the emotional impact of both. Frankly, I think it is one of the most over praised blockbusters of recent years.In all fairness, it's still a very enjoyable film.  The basic plot about the world today being a computer generated simulation created by machines who use us as batteries is daft in the extreme, but its put forward with such conviction that one takes it seriously.  Keanu Reeves plays his `chosen-one' type hero role very well, and is ably supported by Lawrence Fishburne among others.  And of course Hugo Weaving's Agent Smith makes a cracking villain. The Warshowski brothers both write and direct stylishly, and visually at least, the film has been hugely influential.My problem with the film is not with the overall plot or special effects, which are indeed tremendous (thankfully that flo-mo shot is used sparingly so it doesn't become too gimmicky).  A number of other factors prevent the film from being truly great.  First, the use of music.  Although the main score works fairly well, I question using of the likes of Marilyn Manson to punctuate the soundtrack.  A lot of this contemporary music will date the film very quickly.  More seriously, the mid section is saggy.  Specifically, I would have cut three scenes.  First, the scene with that annoying spoon bending kid (who sounds disturbingly like the `Simon Fisher' character from one of Alan Partridge's radio 4 chatshows) and the subsequent reference to that scene.  Second, the bit where Neo is told he can be `set up' with the woman in the red dress, as I feel it is out of keeping with the spiritual tone of the rest of the film.  Thirdly and most crucially, I would have cut the `ignorance is bliss' scene where Cypher arranges with Agent Smith to betray the others.  There is no information in that scene you don't find out later, and the plot would have been better had the betrayal come as a surprise.However, my final problem with the film is the casual way the heroes consider it perfectly acceptable to kill innocent people in the Matrix.  I know the film tries to paper over this by saying until they are rescued they have to be considered the enemy but frankly it doesn't wash.  This is particularly disturbing in the sequence where Neo guns down umpteen security guards.  This scene was, of course, notoriously linked to the Columbine murders (not that I think it had anything to do with it).That said, I'm still giving the film a high rating.  The first act is genuinely intriguing and the third act is never less than exhilarating.",The Matrix

What a waste of time! How deceiving! It seems it is enough with having a noisy soundtrack, a bit of misled oriental philosophy and some weird looking guys acting (?) to have people mouthwatering. Oh, yes, the visuals are great. Maybe the only contribution of this movie is the release of more or less new FX that could be used in further, more intelligent movies. It is incredible how so many inconsistencies can be found in the plot without making this movie lose a bit of its undeserved legend.

And from all the living creatures populating this world, it is the human race that is being used, when hundreds of species would have been much more efficient ""batteries"", without having to create a Matrix to have them comfortable in their sleep - The Matrix is a virtual world designed to keep battery-people happy in their dreams. However, the battle happens precisely in this imaginary world, which has no sense. You can even diein this electronic world and your real body dies, too!!! - After being flushed away when he wakes up, Neo is rescued with an enormous device that was ready to act under the very nose of the machinesBeyond FX, the movie is absolutely boring. You could always disconnect your brain and simply watch at the action, and rate this movie more or less high as an inoffensive entertainment. But then you must face all that incredible mythology built up around this movie, as if it showed a new philosophy or some scientific value! The worst thing of it, is that it is seen by many people as a sci-fi movie. Well, Star Wars deserve being called ""sci-fi"" a thousand times more. Call this a fantasy movie, an action tale... whatever. But please not a sci-fi picture",The Matrix

859,greenie,Fantastic blend of thinking sci-fi and action,9,2 April 1999,"The usual formula: Cyberpunk thriller + Keanu Reeves = SlopSomehow the directors and writers of The Matrix make it work, and incredible well. A strong plot and tight screenwriting benefit from believable character performances that are built up strongly.One of the best things about this movie is that it doesn't throw you right in to the Matrix itself. Naturally you're given a slight tease at the start of the movie, but you're taken on the tour along with the characters as their realities begin to unravel and expand.Initially I thought I might criticise the movie for too action that goes a little too far over the top; after a day's thought however it's understandable that should the Matrix itself actually exist, most anything would happen over the top.Some incredible groundbreaking special effects and photography, pushing the new field of stop-motion rotophotography to limits that have never been seen before. While the Phantom Menace will surely walk away with this year's awards for FX, the Matrix deserves a spot in the hall of fame for pushing the field beyond any other movie -- even the subtle shots are brilliantly composited, lit, and animated.The art direction in this movie is also extremely well done. Imagine mixing the look, feel and martial arts of The Crow with the futuristic vision of Metropolis and Dark City. Most every shot is filled with fantastic detail, from set direction to matte painting and cgi backgrounds.There should be a lot of talk about this movie, and I'm sure many will detract it. There will surely be a lot of sci-fi fans that will choose to look for holes in the plot, inaccuracies and conflicting concepts. Of course, these are the same fans that can see none of the same in movies from Star Wars to Blade Runner.I will admit I walked in with extremely low expectations, but I have since waited on writing this review and prolonged thought on the film has provided me with a great appreciation.Besides, any sci-fi movie with such a strong plot and fantastic effects that manages to throw in a fantastic homage to Return Of The Dragon (the Bruce Lee - Chuck Norris fight, to be exact) will long sit in my memory.",The Matrix
860,nyc man,"Sci-Fi done well. Try to watch ""The Matrix"" before seeing ANY reviews (including this one)",10,14 April 1999,"(Correction of a reference I made in my review of April 12,1999)1. The feel of ""The Matrix"": This is a movie that envelops you, and is reminiscent of two works: a movie and an excerpt from a novel. The first is the 1-hour made-for-TV-film ""The Lathe of Heaven,"" by Ursula K. Le Guin which was broadcast on Channel 13 / Educational TV back in 1980: after the film, I felt I was a character living in the film. ""The Lathe of Heaven"" was about a character whose dreams become reality; every time he wakes up, he is in a new future / futuristic setting where everything changes in accordance to his dream.Kurt Vonnegut (in ""Breakfast of Champions"") had a small sci-fi concept in one of his books called (approximately) ""A message from the creator."" In this story, God writes a book to the only person in the world. God tells him that the entire world was created for him, all religions were invented so he could have a choice of religions, and other people were merely robots who had a specific purpose, such as fighting with him. Thus, whatever he does doesn't matter, since no one else is real but him. The character reads this book, and goes insane, thinking that it is true.Similarly, when you leave ""The Matrix,"" you wonder what is real and what is a simulation. After the movie, my friend walked across the street blindly ignoring cars, perhaps trapped in the illusion that this was not real. It took several minutes for him to escape this fantasy world. It affected me similarly.2. Personal Reactions: a) Movie was great (tentatively on my list of ""top 12 movies"" for me). b)I did not like Fishburne's pockmarked face and grimaces. c)Some corniness in the awakening kiss given to Keanu/Neo, that in my mind, could be traced to reality: people in comas do hear and can respond after what appears to be death.3. Plot Holes: How did the Operator recover from being killed/shot? How did the Oracle know what would happen?4. Political Correctness: a) Two to four black heroes who could easily have been white; b) a possible lesbian; c)a Latino; d)a short person; e)bad white guys(and no bad ethnic types); f) a middle-aged kindly motherly type, g)even a few kids as potential heroes, with one being a guru.",The Matrix
861,MayhapsItWasGoodBackThen,There's definitely fresh originality in this great movie. Most thrilling and exciting stuff! A MUST SEE!!,1,13 September 1999,"Be advised; the text below *** CONTAINS SOME SPOILERS ***Only thing that kind of disturbed me after seeing this great entertaining action/thriller was that why on earth those machines granted us humans with that pseudo-world in the first place? I don't think that machines would care less if we'd see our actual horrid reality rather than that artificially created 'nice' one. Am I supposed to believe that a machine has a sense of morality and pity? A machine with a consciousness? That's a good one. ;) That's not even too unique idea to begin with and even if so, that's really not too plausible here when considered how gruesome and ruthless those machines and their world is portrayed in this film's actual reality -not in that VR called the Matrix. Slightly controversial, yes, but if you can get past that you're facing a truly mind-blowing action/thriller movie experience!But what about the city of Zion -humankind's _last_ refuge? We didn't get even a quick peek at it, why? And why did the machines just let Reeves escape from that alien fish tank (whatever it was!)? He simply pulls those freakish tubes off, after that the creepy spider-like machine comes poking around and decides to lift him up and throw him in the sewer pipes. Which it does. Reeves lands in water, tries hard to stay in the surface and *WHAM* the next moment he wakes up in Morpheus' and his crew's ship. (I'm not 100% sure if that's how it went, I might have missed something during these two scenes but I simply can't remember anymore since -let's face it- everything in this flick seems to happen at triple fast-forward! Heheh!)I mean what the **ll was that suppose to be? While they're examining Keanu in the ship we learn that he's too weak to use his muscles (They in fact have to be re-built!) let alone use his eyes (Having never before used them in real life.)! And still he had somehow managed to get rid of the tubes stuck up in his a... body while being trapped as a human battery (Now that's witty, really!) in that container and struggled to stay afloat in water JUST a few moments ago! There are even more confusing stuff in the film than just these that I mentioned. I just hope the sequel(s) will provide us with well-reasoned answers to all those questions troubling -at least- me but hopefully you too. ;)All those biblical referrals and enough ambiguous and cool philosophical one-liners and quotes plus a dialogue and a plot which messes with you head more than you'd like to, are pretty easy ways to make a movie seem more intellectual, sophisticated and even artistic to some content than it really is. Basically you can come up with any conclusions and try your best to reason what this flick really was about and still you don't know if you're right or wrong. I suppose everybody can see this movie in so many different ways if so wants. And that's just great! At least I personally like movies that really make me wonder and question stuff -no matter in what way that goal is achieved.Cool, cold and distant acting. Some may consider that as bad acting, but frankly said that sort of style fits like a glove in the film's dark and ""mildly"" bizarre atmosphere. Great mind-boggling plot. Really far-out wicked special FXs! And maybe most intense (read: FAST!!) action scenes I've ever seen. Visually stunning. What else you wanna hear?? Go see this in some quality movie theater. Hold on to your seat and enjoy the ride!PS. Would _you_ have taken the blue pill...? I would have.",The Matrix
862,watchhawk,Dirty looking high tech kung fu future spin,7,25 April 1999,"The Matrix is an awesome fighting experience with a dull story and is almost devoid of any charm.  Humans are supposed to be fighting with superbrainy machines but I get to wonder who is human in this whole affair.  It is feast of the eye but not the mind since there isn't any mental punch to it. The matrix is nowhere and anywhere and that is exactly the way I felt after seeing this film.  There is no message and nearing the end when love of a woman gave the final edge needed to out-stunt the bad guys, the film became unbearably ridiculous.  Still this film is not a bad film to see, unless you want to do something meaningful with your time......,but who wants that anyhow.",The Matrix

Do you like Hong Kong kung fu action pics, such as Iron Monkey or any Jet Li film?  So do the Wachowskis.  They obviously knew who in Hong Kong to hire for their wire work and stunt choreography, because the hand to hand fight scenes in this film are excellent, and led to applause in the preview audience I saw this film with. Do you like John Woo's best Chow Yun Fat films, such as Hardboiled and the Killer?  The Wachowskis do as well.  There is enough flying shell casings, exploding concrete walls, and 2 handed gun play in this film for the most die hard Woo fan.  Do you like Japanese Cyberpunk Anime, such as Ghost in the Shell or Akira?  Those Wachowskis must love it as well.  The storyline in this film seems straight out of Tokyo, and has that same ""I'm not quite sure I understand what is going on, but it sure is neat"" quality that much anime has.  The special effects (which are very well done) are designed to generate the feel of anime in a live action film.While the Wachowskis are not quite as good at any of the elements of this film then the true oriental masters are, they have succeeded admirably in synthesizing those elements together into one exciting film.  If you are going to see this one, see it on the biggest screen you can, because on video (unless you have a home theater set up more expensive than the GNP of Belgium) this movie will simply not carry your interest. Without the stunning visuals and style to distract you, some of the plot holes and Keanu Reeves acting (Jah be praised he has to do very little acting) will be much more obvious.",The Matrix

By now we all know the story behind the Matrix and how great the special effects and action was, but I noticed that most people forgot to mention the deepth of the story.Yes!  Matrix is an action movie, but it is also Biblical in many ways.  Neo is Jesus... he is the ""one"" selected to free the people from persecution. Cypher is the deciple who betrayed Christ... he sold out Morpheous for materialistic items and was then was forever banished from the real world. Morpheous is God... the all knowing, he is everywhere, yet nowhere.  And Trinity is the Virgin Mary, for it was her efforts which brought Neo to the ""real world"".

871,billy_loomis1,"Philosophy, special Effects and great actors, not it's not ""STAR WARS"" !",6,31 July 2001,"---Spoilers Ahead---Matrix is unique for one thing, its phisophy. The Matrix tells us that we live in an artifial world and nothing is what it seems... The real world is too terrifying to live in and the people who actually live in it have to fight against machines. And here we are waiting for the chosen one who is a hacker and believes there is something more to see, to explore. After being released from the artificial world by taking a... pill( also watch ""Trainspotting"") and choosing a real life (here are is a reference to a greek hero, Hercules, who did the exact same thing, he chose the hard way! The only difference is that he didn't take a pill!), our Character Neo fights back not knowing if he is the chosen one or not! And wins the first battle(out of 3, coming up ""The Matrix Reloaded"") against the EVIL machines.
So do we, who would expect such a script? Although there are plenty of plot holes, Matrix has such an impressivly good story that you just ignore them because the script makes you think they are there for a reason! Although the characters are not developed as much as someone would like(something smells like a franchise) but they give you a glimpse of their personality, that's why you get curious abou their future. Matrix is something more that just a fairy-tale, it is a movie with brain, it is the true story of our world. Because we live in an Artificial World ! We are ruled by machines and those who fight the system we call them terrorists!
the Sequels won't say new stuff, they'll just bring up the rest of the story, which is not that interesting! We all now it's going to have a happy ending, we all now that the main attraction is what the special effects going to look like? What music are they going to use? Is there any karate( because of Jet-Lee's appearence) Matrix-styled in it? Any special cameos? Any new philosophy> nah, i don't think so.
Another thing abou the Matrix is stylish direction, who would expect all these bullet-time shots, the John-Woo shots, the marvellous special effects! The Helicopter sequence(Slash, Bang!), the touch-the-mirror sequence, the fight in the end(Crash, Boom!). The flying sequence(you know it has used in aaah] Scary Movie and [woow!] Shrek!) ofcourse is the most memorable though!One question: I heard that the upcoming Star Wars is going to be NC-17 rated! Is it true? My true question is Matrix going to be that cold again or the in-love characters will move a step forward ?P.S, Why every new movie is borrowing Matrix sequences?

There were films like Godzilla, Armageddon, deep impact etc. Point is that these summer blockbuster movies only focused on special effects due to the groundbreaking effects of Jurassic Park, and forgot to give us engaging stories and compelling characters, which became tiresome. In 1999, the matrix was released and blew everyone's mind. The audience were talking about how deep and philosophical, cerebral film it is, something new and innovative. But is it really that? The answer is, to be honest, no. The idea of a society that realize their reality is an illusion and have to fight authorities is not really new. It has been done in TV episodes, satire, books and many other medium. In fact, even anime did that idea before, just 4 years prior (ghost in the shell). The film is very much outdated, silly, pretentious and not as smart as the movie thinks it is.There are major problems with the movie, particularly the characters. The characters are so dull, uninteresting and bland that it is so hard to get invested in them. Morpheus is your typical mentor figure, Trinity is a boring character, with so little expressions to show and have zero chemistry with Neo, the main character. There is no reason for her to be in love with him. There has not been a single scene which indicates they should be together. And as for Neo, he is as interesting as a plank of wood, having almost no personality, poor facial expressions. And to top it off, there hasn't been a solid proof why he is ""the one"". There isn't anything special about him, he doesn't have any leadership skills, he doesn't even know what AI is or what EMP stands for.There is also another major problem. And it's a huge plot hole in the film. Why is there a matrix? Why is this system needed? The humans are planted, so why need to give them a matrix? All they need to do is just find a way to keep the human energy alive. The film is so pretentious, and has this confidence that is smart, but has one of the most cop out endings in a blockbuster movie. Trinity saves Neo with the power of love. How is something like that left in a ""cerebral"", ""philosophical"" movie, when it has an ending that belongs in fairy tales? It's stupid, forced and doesn't add up.So for all the rant this review has, is the film terrible? Not quite. In fact, it's a decent movie with some clever ideas and analogies, and props for having a major impact on film making and actually trying to do something different in the action genre as well as blockbuster movies, but it's not really the masterpiece it is claimed to be.

881,billm-4,Tennis without the net,2,6 April 1999,"Calling ""The Matrix"" a science fiction movie is a massive abuse of the English language. Science fiction presumes a basis in an existing or projected law of science. At least this is the principle which gives substance to the wildest speculations of masters such as Arthur C Clarke (who has a first class physics degree). This film is better categorized as a science fantasy, i.e. one where  the authors use the pretence of science as a fig leaf to disguise the total inanity and incoherence of their project. Even fairy tales work within their own framework of law which gives tension and excitement to the surreal adventures. In ""The Matrix"" laws are not even made up as they go along, as that would impede the next stream-of-consciousness stunt. It makes a great special effect if a character leaps tall buildings at  a single bound or recoils from a road surface after falling from a 500 foot building. Unfortunately it also removes any possibility of the audience taking him to be even a far-fetched human character, and hence destroys any possibility of genuine thrills. These creatures can survive being run over by a subway train and even death itself. Hence the most risible Lazarus scene since ""ET"" -Keanu is revived from the tomb by the love of a good woman.You can make tennis easier to play by removing the net and rubbing out the lines; unfortunately you thereby destroy the game.  Similarly The Matrix fails to exist as any sort of half-coherent movie if you want a movie to consist of more than a string of sensational images.Unlike AC Clarke's work, this screenplay fails to betray even a high school awareness of science in ""explaining"" its universe, the war between machines and humans, or the rationale for the machines sucking the life force of humans - not to mention the hokey insertion of an old style soothsayer into this ""scientific"" farago.I give it 2 out 10 - one for sheer chutzpah in raising $60 million on the basis of such a ludicrous script and 1 for set design and special effects combined.",The Matrix

(Hence, the expression ""science-fiction"") As one of those who enjoyed the movie thoroughly and saw it more than once, I believe it contains all the elements of a good movie: humour, a freshness about it, and a lot of great action sequences. Will Star Wars measure up, I wonder?",The Matrix
883,cbass-2,"Despite its flaws.... yeah, I enjoyed it.",6,12 July 1999,"This movie was by no means perfect.  The plot was not spectacular and the acting was by no means top-notch.  It is nothing like ""Dark City,"" the best movie made in the 90s (in my opinion at least) which has, as Roger Ebert says, ""no bad scenes.""  Howard Hawks, the famous director who did Rio Bravo among other classics, once said when asked what makes a good film, ""3 good scenes and no bad scenes.""  ""Dark City"" is a film which accomplishes this, there are no scenes which do not advance the plot, and yet we still see some incredible effects.Anyhow, back to ""The Matrix.""  There are plenty of scenes that are not necessary, one example being the fight scene at the metal detectors near the end of the film, but you know what, I don't care.  This movie was visually incredible.  I was not excited and pumped up after seeing it, I was tired, and not because it was a boring film.  It is simply that the film wears out one's eyes, there is so much movement, so much eye-candy, and so much brightness.  This movie won't win an Oscar, at least not the big ones, and it shouldn't.  But it is still an extremely enjoyable and entertaining film and except for the cheesy love part at the end, could not have been done much better.The brothers who directed ""The Matrix"" succeeded in creating a film that is what it tries to be: a visually stunning action film.",The Matrix

The effects are wonderful and successfully makes a total impact of amazement: it conquers the audience taking into a compelling imaginative world. You really feel that your sense of reality is forced.On the other hand, just in accordance with the polysemy of the word ""Matrix"", the script is open to multiple decoding. Personally I think that there is a great examination of religious ideas and mythology behind the script. I regard ""The Matrix"" as a postmodern expression of the new millennial messianism in a mixture of Hong Kong movie technique, Hollywood presentation, perfect cast and acting, and Jewish Kabbala...Hey these snobbish words dont mean a criticism.

The whole idea of the movie is shear brilliance and could Kenuea Reeves be more perfect for Neo. His acting is what makes this movie a terrific one.

890,What92691,A computer hacker named Neo is recruited by other computer hackers to fight the war of the war in The Matrix.,10,1 April 2003,"This is my absolute favorite movie, every detail of it is done perfect. What you have to notice in this movie is that it's almost so fantasized (beeds to choose your destiny, a computer generated world, slo-mo) but yet so realistic. If you just think about it for one minute a computer generated world is so complicated to do. Since these computer hackers are from the future they could have beeds to choose your destiny, they could make a whole different world, computer generated. Since there expert computer hackers, from the future, they could do every surreal thing in here. But what most people do is think for one second or two and say ""Oh this would never happen"". It's a great movie, and it accomplishes what a Sci-Fi movie should- surreal, but real. For those of you that think I should keep dreaming, just think about it. Plus the people who jump roof to roof are aliens, the human jumping roof to roof, is from the future. This movie has definitely set an example for the Sci-Fi genre, and you definitely shouldn't think oh that got this off of Terminator, or Alien. Maybe the gun part comes in very well like Terminator, or Alien, but none of them think up of a whole different world. Maybe Star Wars, but that's in a galaxy, far, far, away. The Matrix made a connection between Earth and whole different world, which hasen't ever been done yet.

891,kdladage,A nearly perfect thinking-man's action film,9,15 June 2005,"In my review of the third installment of this trilogy, I wrote:-----=====-----""For those of us that went to see THE MATRIX in the theater, what we saw was a thinking-man's action-adventure film. The special effects were there to propel the plot and to emphasize the film's underlying questions on the nature of reality, the nature of humanity and the power of the mind over the body. The film was a self-contained story -- beginning, middle and end -- and it told its tale very well, with style grace and power.The potential in a trilogy based upon this stellar beginning was great. Sort of like those of us that watched STAR WARS about the 10th time and suddenly there was the words ""Episode IV"" at the beginning subtly telling us that there was a lot more of this great film to come.""-----=====-----I stand by that conclusion: this is a nearly perfect thinking-man's action adventure film. Note: I say _nearly_ perfect. The film has its flaws (not the least of which is centered in the film's very premise -- man would make an absolutely terrible source of energy.But in all, the film (when taken as a whole) is a great stand-alone science-fiction adventure, as well as an awesome start to what should have been the greatest sci-fi trilogy in film history... if only the last film could have been made with the same attention and care -- rather than feeling slapped on with duct tape.In all, I highly recommend this movie -- and I highly recommend ignoring the fact that their are two more that follow it. This one stands alone quite well.",The Matrix

It examines philosophical questions involving reality and fate, just like ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" and other similar movies, yet it also provides brutal violence and excellent special effects in the tradition of ""Aliens.""

I was pissed off because I was not at all prepared for such an amazing, intelligent and intricate story, to this day arguably one of the best in modern cinema and storytelling.I am reticent to ever call this a science-fiction film, the 'sci' yes, but the 'fi', well, if you have seen this film you will understand.This film set new standards in so many areas, I could write pages over so many small facets but I like to keep reviews fairly short.

897,evoapollo,So what would you choose. The blue pill. Or the red pill?,9,30 July 2021,"I played the matrix path of neo when I was 11 and after beating it I wanted to watch the movies. So they were significantly different from the game obviously to make it more fun but it took me years to understand the message of these movies. At first I thought it was just cool choreography and sunglasses. But as i grew older i realize what it was trying to tell me. Neo was a nihilistic hacker who felt like something was wrong but didn't know what it was. Then he meets morpheus and offers him the truth. He seems reluctant at first but then proceeds. It turns out that his everyday boring life was just a simulation called the matrix. And that we were all just programmed to follow it and live in it doing mediocre things. Luckily 1 percent I think they said in the movie could see through it and they were shown the truth that outside of the matrix was basically a wasteland full of these cybernetic things running the matrix. I cant put exactly what it was as I haven't seen it since i was like 11 so memory is very cloudy. I was crazy about keanu Reeves before he was john wick. This movie had some great action scenes. And rage against the machine plays at the end. So go figure what that tells you if you know a thing or 2 about rage against the machine. People can either accept the painful truth and deal with it. Or they can live in ignorance and live a mediocre life without questioning anything. In a sense, we as humans live like we're in a matrix. We waste our lives not realizing the true capabilities of our universe, that we just sit and dont ask questions. Basically like sheep just following the group and having no sense of anything else even if theres a wolf among them. We live life like we think we will be alive in the next 100 years or so. And like morpheus said (I might quote it wrong) that most people arent ready to accept the truth that their lives are basically lies and therefore are the enemy until they realize the truth. Its An illusion. It has it own story centered on the matrix but the deep message behind it is to think freely for yourself. Not what someone wants you to think. And the one guy who betrays all of them I forgot his name basically is the definition of ignorance is bliss. As in he saw the truth and he cant accept it so he'd rather live his life as a mindless sheep because he hated the truth and refused to deal with it. He'd be happier or so he thinks living in this simulation. People do this too as they lie to themselves and try to stay ignorant of it as they think it will not be their problem. But for him his world is not the matrix and he thought by going back to the matrix would make him feel better by living a life of lies in a fake world. People also do this as well. Social media, video games. We all do this, wasting precious time of our lives, even now as I'm typing this review I'm wasting my time trying to explain what the matrix means at least what I think it means. We could be doing something else in the world right now than on these digital things like how people could be fighting the matrix but instead live in it like it's a part of their lives but its really all an illusion. They're just sitting in something hooked up to a machine their whole lives waiting to die. Dont be like this. Dont be what the machine wants you to be. Rage against it. Thats why the ending of this film was so amazing because the band that plays is a very political based band. And if you cant tell then you must have not listened to their lyrics in their songs. Rage against the matrix. Rage against the ""machine"". Seek the truth. I think I broke down the meaning I could have misinterpreted it if so carry on with your lives. Its moving forward whether we like it or not. This movie was amazing all 3 were. Fantastic cast, keanu Reeves was awesome, Laurence fishburne was the first movie I saw of him. I had no idea he was in so many movies before it. Event horizon, a nightmare on elm street 3 or 4 I cant remember. And everytime I see him I'm reminded of morpheus. This movie was great I'm hoping to rewatch it again as an adult soon.",The Matrix
898,warren-1976,Scratch Beneath The Surface,5,20 March 2007,"Like many films, there's a lot of heated debate about this one. So what can be said? On many occasions, I have heard grand statements from its fans, about the incredible, thought provoking story. The whole 'What is Reality?' issue. Well, actually, in Science Fiction, this is a pretty well-trod concept. Oddly enough, the Matrix escaped its SF roots, and managed to be seen by a wider audience who were unfamiliar with SF or its concepts. As a result, there were resounding cries of how original and creative it was. Is it good that it made a few more people think? Yes. Does that by default mean that it did it well? Films such as ""ExistenZ"", ""Dark City"", or ""The 13th Floor"" (from around the same time), all explored the idea of 'What is Reality?' in far more depth. They simply didn't get the same level of exposure. The Matrix wins, because it was one of those lucky films to fill the right niche at the right time. It utilized Computer Effects in a relatively new way for the cinema 'wow' factor. It appealed to the all-action, gun-toting, look-cool-in-black leather, fans. It rammed the 'kung-fu-wire-stunt' style of action film into over-drive. It had a 'hip' soundtrack to appeal to the masses (Which will date it badly in years to come).It's difficult to criticise The Matrix, because there's nothing really bad about it, as long as you enjoy, or at least don't mind, that style of film. What it fails to do, is bring anything else to the game. There's nothing really fresh or creative idea-wise, here. The characters are thinly drawn stereotypes. The action tends to be about lots of shell-casings rather than anything else. Scratch the surface, and what few ideas there are, aren't explored to any consequence.It is a perfect example of style over substance, pretending to say more than it actually does. 'Emperor's New Clothes' if you will. There's nothing wrong with a good mindless action film, from time-to-time. Cinema, in many ways at its core, is simply about pure entertainment. There are numerous films of this kind, but the difference is, they don't pretend to be more than they are. Perhaps that is where the Matrix fails. It sets itself up as though it is exploring some grandiose, thought-provoking topic, and is really just a roller-coaster action film. On rare occasions, some films can do both. This isn't one of them.If you take it as that, a mindless action trill-ride with a couple of fun concepts, there's nothing wrong with it, to waste a few hours. If you're expecting more, chances are, you'll find it lacking.",The Matrix
899,KrowbOy,Perhaps The Best Movie EVER,9,27 September 1999,"I went to see The Matrix on its opening night in theatres so when it hit dvd i went out and got me a copy.  I was one of the few who liked Johnny Mneumonic (or however its spelled) and for the most part liked all Keanu Reeves movies (this and Point Break are the best).  I never saw the Wachowski Bros. other movie but i remembered that they were former comic book writers and i love comics especially Heavy Metal, Spawn, etc.  The Matrix looks great its beautiful to look at and the special effects are awesome.  All the actors did great...i mean really really great in my opinion.  I didn't think the movie was hard to follow like some people said, it takes (not copies) things from The Terminator (machines being stronger and enslaving man), the Bible (need i explain), and Hong Kong/Kung Fu movies.  Lots say its action is like John Woo but to me its like Tsui Hark, but then again it takes all these things and creates one of the coolest, best, and original movies EVER.  I can't say enough about this movie and i applaud Keanu Reeves, Carrie-Ann Moss, Laurence Fishburne, and Hugo Weeving for going through training for the fight scenes.  The Wachowski's are now part of my best directors catagory( which also includes George A. Romero, Alex de la Iglesia and others).  Also i urge everyone who has HBO to watch Heavy Metal:FAKK when it premieres in March.  THE MATRIX IS THE BEST MOVIE OF 1999 AND PERHAPS THE BEST MOVIE EVER.",The Matrix

The film has an imaginative and wonderfully paranoid premise: What if the world we live in is not what we think it is, but an illusion created by malevolent beings. Unfortunately, we are subjected to stupid training segments for Reeves by the resistance (an ill-concieved concept all in its own), complete with an inane kickboxing sequence, in which the combatants fly through the air, impressing the half-wits in the audience, while we with IQ's over 50 just sit and yawn. The special  effects are more laughable than spectacular. Seeing a bullet fly by some guy in slow motion is certainly not amazing. The movie could have been so much better if it had had a better script, and omitted every scene ""outside reality"" I guess. All in all, this is science fiction for cavemen.",The Matrix
903,Science_Fantasy_Guy,"Edgy, thought-provoking, cryptic and visually stunning: everything you could ever want from a science-fiction/action film.",10,25 April 2009,"Let's take a brief trip back to 1999. Bill Clinton was president of the United States, war was raging in Kosovo, two young men committed mass murder at Columbine High School, everyone was paranoid about Y2K and September 11th was still a day with no negative significant meaning. In cinema there was only one sci-fi movie on everyone's minds: Star Wars: Episode I – The Phantom Menace. But not one month before that film opened, Andy and Lana (as it seems we must call him/her now) Wachowski brought us a sci-fi movie that must have had George Lucas panicking when he saw it: The Matrix, a trippy, visually spectacular and groundbreaking look at what the future could be like. And it was shot in Australia.The brothers Wachowski were influenced by many earlier sci-fi and fantasy texts (among others, various cyberpunk films and novels, anime and even Alice in Wonderland) when coming up with the story for The Matrix. Keanu Reeves stars as Thomas A. Anderson, a white-collar worker for a software company who leads another life at night, one lived in computers as the hacker Neo. He believes the world he exists in is completely real and is tracked down by a band of outcasts rebels led by the enigmatic Morpheus (Laurence Fishburne) and the tough female Trinity (Carrie-Anne Moss). From Morpheus Neo learns that the world the ""real"" world he knew beforehand is actually the Matrix, a virtual dreamland run by evil supercomputers in which most of humanity is unknowingly trapped. Believing Neo is the messianistic ""One"" who will liberate humanity from the Matrix, Morpheus gives Neo the chance to join him. Neo does, and now the battle to save humanity begins. However, the rebels' efforts are thwarted by Agent Smith (Hugo Weaving), a ruthless and almost indestructible sentient program that will remorselessly kill to maintain order in the system.Ignore Keanu Reeves' wooden acting and the occasionally uninspired dialogue; after all, this isn't a movie that depends on flawless acting and writing to succeed. Unlike so many other sci-fi films before and since, The Matrix provides stimulation for the mind as well as eye candy in equal measure. The Matrix's story is a confusing (for first-time viewers) but very mentally stimulating one, discussing themes of dystopia, corruption, totalitarianism, the power of the individual and humanity's potentially hazardous relationship with technology. But the true meat in the sandwich undeniably lies in its technical prowess. The highly groundbreaking and inventive special effects have been written about, copied and have caused The Matrix to become one of the most parodied movies ever made, and not once do they show 11 years. The sound design and effects could just be the very best I have ever heard. Zach Staenberg's editing is frenetic, fluid and crisp, making the convoluted plot and all the flawlessly executed technical elements come together perfectly for maximum impact. The Matrix earned Oscars in all four of these categories and justice certainly was served. Also worth mentioning is the gritty yet aesthetically pleasing art direction by Aussie Owen Paterson, Bill Pope's inventive cinematography, which arguably what was the real reason why the bullet-time sequences were so revolutionary, and Don Davis' Vangelis-esquire score adds to the suspense enormously. Love or loathe this knockout masterwork, you could never say that it didn't take its genre in a very new direction. Every so often, a movie with almost no hype surrounding it comes out, takes the world by storm and comes to have a lasting impact not just on pop culture but film-making as well. The Matrix is such a movie. Although it took me quite a few years to fall completely under its spell (when I first saw it at 11 it confused the hell out of me), The Matrix is a movie (like very few others) that never fails to suck me in and leave me stunned and eager for more by the end. Unfortunately it was followed by two unoriginal sequels that arguably were only produced to fill cash registers, but even they did nothing to tarnish the brilliance of this one. The Matrix has earned its place in humble all-time top twenty films list, and I can't see it falling out of that list for a long time. A true roller-coaster ride of a movie.",The Matrix

The lead character in this film is dull as dishwater, Hugo Weaving's Agent definitely steals the show. Fishburn was quite cool, although the way his character was set up I was a bit disappointed he was actually a tall black dude with sunglasses (exactly like you'd expect) and not an old Vietnamese woman with arthritis, which would really surprise you.However, my main issue is with the film's plot - it has plot holes so large Hannibal could drive his army through them. The future portrayed is mind-numbingly unoriginal, and the rationale for the existence of the Matrix itself is simply laughable; it's just patently ridiculous. (I feel so dirty.) The way in which the characters interact with ""reality"" and ""the Matrix"" is necessary to drive the plot, which I might liken to a new volvo; shiny and with computers in it, but still the same old boring car as they made 10 or 20 years ago. This interaction is, alas, stupid and nonsensical. Suspension of disbelief is easy to achieve in a movie with great acting or plot, but here, I tried and failed.On the up side, the combat sequences were amusing, the effects were OK - quite average for 1999, which is to say, pretty amazing. Weaving and his cohorts were cool, and until you actually find out what is going on, the plot is somewhat intriguing.This film is a Hollywood-made, Keanu Reeves-starring cyberpunk movie. You get what you expect - as long as you haven't read the other reviews. :)",The Matrix
912,noodles-13,A lot of running but the blade is not that sharp,7,26 August 1999,"I must admit that Matrix is very amazing as a show of pure images. A lot of fx make this movie really impressive. But the basic idea (what you see is not true) is not so new. Even the idea of a bunch of freedom-seeking hackers has been often used in cyberpunk literature. The biggest limit of Matrix is the lack of courage: whenever the directors are about to cross the line of a scifi movie to enter the world of big cinema, they choose the easier way (gunfights, a bit of Bruce Lee 20 years after). And one last thing, the guy resurrected by the princess' kiss: so miserable... They tried to turn an average story into a new Blade Runner, but I'm afraid it turned out as a Luxury edition of Johnny Mnemonic.

The story line is outstanding once you find out everything that's going on and the action sequences have more adrenaline pumping through them than the opening action sequence of Blade.  Anyone who had an interest in seeing this film must see it.  Like others said don't wait, GO NOW!  I can't believe how amazing some of the stunts are and the training Keanu, Lawrence, and Carrie must have went through must have been incredible.  This is something you can't miss and I want to say so much about it but I don't want to ruin it for any of you.

THE MATRIX is their best release in a long time, and it will make a kickass DVD!  I wasn't expecting much from a cheesy sci-fi movie starring Keanu Reeves and a bunch of other unknown actors, but whoa, I was blown away by this!There are a few problems with the movie, granted, but these problems are far outweighed by the incredible ingenuity of the story line and the best fight scenes I have ever seen!  The ""agents"" were especially cool.  The worst thing about this movie was the ""talking bad-guy"" syndrome.  The bad guys talk too much when they are winning.  But it doesn't detract too much from the movie, since the agent's speech is actually somewhat interesting.  Also, the ""humans as energy"" scheme made no sense.  But there was nothing that made the plot fall apart.Keanu Reeves is also... gasp;... GOOD in this movie.  I still can't believe that is really him and Fishburne fighting.  Those scenes are so well done it defies belief.  I thought the first half of the movie was the best though, when you don't really know what is going on.  And the sci-fi jargon actually makes sense, so it is not a bore to listen to.  Well, if you haven't seen this movie yet, do it!  I hope TPM can top Matrix!",The Matrix

Also like Titanic and Braveheart, The Matrix is not very original (ex. Braveheart is a rip-off of Spartacus), but what it does, it does well, and doesn't pretend to be smart.

Keanu Reeves was excellent in this movie. Personally, I'm not crazy about some of the other movies he's been in except I really did like his movie ""The Devil's Advocate"".with Al Pacino. I think Larry Fishburne was also excellent in his role. What I love about this sci-fi movie is that it is the first sci-fi with such great action sequences. I also like the idea that just like ""Dark City"" it makes you think of whether the world we live in is real or not real. And that is something that could give me and other people the creeps. A lot of you are probably wondering if this movie or ""Dark City"" is better. All I can say is that each is better in its own way. This movie was better as an action movie and ""Dark City"" was better as a horror, but both of these movies were great movies.",The Matrix

918,benz0325,An evolution of genre film-making...,8,5 January 2000,"I first saw the film soon after its released and was pretty awed by the experience, but didn't think much about it afterwards.  It wasn't until I saw it again on DVD that I began to notice its significance.  The Matrix is a true fusion of Eastern and Western genre film-making.  The story, action, and effects are an effective blend of the East (Zen Buddhism, martial arts, and strong females), and the West (Sci-Fi, CGI, and gunplay), and all done in a very polished Western style.  I wouldn't as yet call it a classic, but if we still talk about it with the same ferver 10 years from now, as we do today, then we probably have something. To criticize inconsistencies in the acting, parts of the story, or originality doesn't tell you about the film as a whole package.  Genre classics such as Star Wars, Raiders of the Lost Ark, or Blade Runner, were far from perfect in its parts, and derivative in concept, but the films seen as a whole are incomparable.  I have seen Dark City and eXistenZ, both contemporaries in reality benders to The Matrix. I rate Dark City slightly above that of The Matrix in certain aspects of story, and I love the film noir style of the movie, but The Matrix as a whole just pushes the right buttons for me in entertainment value.  After all, this is what movies are about, entertainment. From all the comments I read on IMDB, we as movie goers chose two ways to watch a movie: 1) from a wide-eyed, holistic approach, enjoying the ride, or 2) sucking on a lemon, squeezing every bit of joy out of the movie experience.",The Matrix
919,bleakeye,Four out of Ten,3,2 March 2001,"I used to think that this was a very innovative movie and is one of the best I've seen.  After a few more repeat viewings, I changed my mind.  Sure enough, the special effects are one of the best ever seen in film history so far but what at first seems like a brilliant plot became tiresome and unbelievable after further analysis.Keanu Reeves also shows us how bad acting can affect an otherwise above average movie.  Keanu is just lifeless and seemed to look clueless as his character Neo.  He makes Neo look like an idiot that is just plain lucky. Even a great supporting cast led by Larry Fishburne, Joe Pantoliano and newcomer Carrie Ann Moss can't redeem Keanu's performance in this movie.The plot, that of a conspiracy of machines and computers, seems impressive at first because it makes you say to yourself, ""Why didn't I think of that?"".  But when you figure out *(NOW THIS IS A SPOILER!)* that you have thought of this world created by machines in our mind before, this movie will be as horrible for you as it was for me at my 4th viewing.  The visual effects can be irritating to the eyes at times but is without a doubt beautiful.",The Matrix

923,I_am_Jacks_Revenge,This movie was awesome. Probably my favourite of the three.,10,28 July 2007,"I am just not sure whether or not the Wachowski brothers should have made a sequel. This one was fine on its own, and let's all remember that the 2nd movie came about 4 years after this. If they wanted to do a sequel, they might have wanted to do it sooner. But anyway, the movie.Okay, here is how it goes down (for those of you who don't want to know what happens and figure it out on your own, I suggest you don't read this, okay? But don't worry, I won't tell the ending): Our main character is Thomas Anderson (Keanu Reeves), a businessman for a software company. He also is a computer hacker who goes by the name 'Neo', and that is normally how he is addressed. Neo is wondering what the 'Matrix' is. Neo is looking for a man who is called Morpheus. Neo has been searching for him for a while. But what he doesn't realize until a little later on when they have a chat, is that Morpheus has been looking for Neo longer than Neo has for him. He believes that Neo is the One. Someone who can stop a war. Agents (Sentiel programs) are after Morpheus and anyone else 'free'. The agents are after Neo as well. They want to get him before Morpheus does.When Neo and Morpheus meet face to face, Morpheus tells Neo that the world he knows is a fake. A hoax. They call it the Matrix. So everything that Neo had ever done in his life in the Matrix has never happened. That would be so weird if our world was a fake and that the real world is something else.Throughout the movie comes some dramatic moments and some awesome action scenes that I will want to try and do eventually in the future. This movie had a great plot line. Great action. A 10/10 for sure. Watch this movie. It will blow your mind.",The Matrix

I especially enjoyed the ""bullet-time"" photography that truly can be a new use of filming that is just barely being discovered and can evolve into something even better in the future.

This movie was better then that it had action, but with a great story. The plot is Neo a guy with two separate minds has to choose between one or the other. If he chooses to stay in the matrix he will see if he is the one or not if not then he will never know what could have happend. the thing that makes this one better then both of the sequals is we don't know what Neo's destiny is like in the second and third we know what is going to happen. This one is nothing like that you don't know if Neo is going to defeat the villain Agent Smith who is one of the top fifty villains in my mind he is just one of those villains that gets to you.

I have now come to the conclusion that the version everybody else has been watching is different to mine, as I can see no merit in the movie whatsoever. The dull characters live in a bland, grey hued universe populated by other dull characters, fighting for a cause that I don't understand and that I don't care for. Along the way they get into supposedly 'cool' kung fu and gunfights all in slow motion. The only relief from the relentless boredom of this emotionless juggernaut is Hugo Weaving's Agent Smith, a character whose blandness is intentional and even amusing. In the case of the other characters, their blandness is unintentional and unamusing. The only people who can possibly enjoy and understand this movie in full are the Wachowski brothers.",The Matrix

This movie is a amazingly awesome! Let me give a few pointers...1) THE MUSIC-How can the music is any other movie be as good as this movie's?2) The Action-Holy crap this movie has awesome action scenes in it! One during Neo's fight with Smith in the subway, Neo saving Morpheus and then Trinity from the helicopter crash? How can anything top this?3) The Philosophical elements-I'm not one to focus heavily on philosophy, but this movie has it sprinkled in the storyline, and they don't get shoved down our throats. Like, Morpheus saying ""And I'll show you how far the rabbit hole really goes."" The Matrix itself is also a type of philosophical element. Even when Neo becomes the one, that's from Plato's ""The Allegory of the Cave"" from The Republic.4) Bullet Time-an extraordinary technique and it works perfectly in the movie! Neo dodging the Agent's bullets and the fight in the hotel lobby! I can't really continue on this review any longer, I have this to say...I dare anyone to find and watch a movie that can possibly top this movie, heck, this whole trilogy.

Aside from all the amazing action and visuals, this movie challenged people to think that there might be something else about our existence that we don't know about.

I must remind you here great movies, like ""Total Recall"", ""Terminator"" and ""Star Wars"". These movies captured my phantasy and my curiosity. Great expectations I had when I started watching Matrix. I have heard so much about its deep dialogs and its special effects. In reality, those hopes collapsed in face of this movie. I have to confess that it is absolutely awful. Nothing more and nothing less. The dialogs are sprinkled with a myriad of pseudo-philosophic sentences, which are intended to awake in us deep thoughts. Well, it didn't arouse anything in me but boredom. I do not accept that Morphius has some kind of deep perspective on life and I do not accept Neo's battle with himself as representing something in our lives. The movie has engaged in a circle of happenings which do not take us anywhere. All the passes between the real world and the Matrix world are so casual and unsophisticated, that it puzzled me. I do not understand why did the producers of this movie bother with so many transitions between the worlds, when nothing really happens, and the basic difference between the worlds is always maintained. Lastly, I was deeply disappointed in the special effects. They are so simplistic and so few that I wonder whether this film should even be classified as a modern sci-fi.  My final conclusion would be that this movie has become some kind of culture item, and people were grasped by its media-magic. Two years after its release, it's so vane. Try to see it now, and you will be convinced.",The Matrix

Now, thanks to the Devil's Advocate and now The Matrix, I think he's one of the most exciting actors in Hollywood. The Matrix is an incredible movie that will please all science fiction fans along with action movie addicts. The best part of all is the fact that it also happens to be a great story that never drags and keeps you saying, DAMN!!! Reeves does an excellent job as a computer hacker who finds out that he is the ""chosen one"" to free all human kind. Laurence Fishburn delivers as his mentor and whoever made those sunglasses for him to wear, deserves an oscar nomination in costume design. Hugo Weaving is also a big part of this movie's success, playing a brilliant Agent Smith and is the coolest looking federal agent that I've seen in a long time. The action is non-stop and the martial arts escapades are brilliantly done. The story reminded me of the scare in the Terminator. In fact, that may be the only flaw in the movie is that the script seems to be a slight rip-off of the Terminator series and Dark City, both of which were better movies. Still, I very much recommend this movie, because it is the best movie that I have seen in 1999. I give it a 9 out of 10.",The Matrix

Now, most people think this film is intelligent, but I thought that is was incredibly long and was almost entirely plotless. It's a shame at how the characters act so serious that you don't know what they are talking about. Another problem I have with the Matrix were the incredibly overrated effects. First of all, I can't understand why the Matrix won the Visual Effects Oscar over the Phantom Menace, which took much more effort and used much more technology. I see so many unoriginalities with the Matrix's effects. People who think that the Bullet Time effects were original and told the story, you obviously haven't seen the slow-motion bullets in Face/Off, which I personally found more eye-catching. And for people who think that the story about a computer programmer entering a virtual reality world, you obviously haven't seen the Walt Disney masterpiece Tron, which, by the way, had far more groundbreaking technology for its day than the Matrix's effects had when it was first made.

948,darkcarrington,Very Intriguing,7,17 May 2003,"Spoilers Herein.
The most interesting thing about The Matrix, for me, is that the pattern of viewings and opinions of the movie after each viewing seems to follow a bell curve.  While always good, the movie seems to be at its peek at about the 3-5 times you watch it.  Before that, elements of the story may not yet have been realized, and after that, the novely slowly diminishes.  While this does not occur as rapidly as with some movies, it will always occur with every movie ever made.The only two roles in this movie that require susbtantial acting prowess are Morpheus and Agent Smith.  Not surprisingly, these are the only two roles that are well acted.  Fishburn and Weaving carry the plot with their exceptional portrayals of their respective characters.  Keanu Reeves is adapt at playing Neo, but this is only because Neo does not have a very deep role in this movie and wanders around confused for most of it.  Moss is not overly impressive as Trinity, but does not need to be because Fishburn carries this aspect of the movie.The true shining point of this movie, is the depth of the plot.  More than one viewing is most likely necessary for those who want to retain every element of the plot.  However, it is marvelous in the first sitting as well. The philosophy of Morpheus, Trinity, and co.  is incorporated fantastically with the rich action scenes of the movie.  The script is excellent at times, but lacks at others.  This is not a problem though, because the plot dictates the pace of the movie and the script and dialogue are only supplementary at many points.Probably the most impressive aspect of the movie is the visual effects. The bullet time pieces are very impressive and give the viewer a never before seen view of the battles in the movie.  They also accentuate the power of Neo and the agents.  The constantly moving cameras also allow for unique angles of the combat.Even though I am a believer that this film is marginally overrated, it is still worth a viewing, probably two or three actually.Rating:  4.5 out of 5 first 3-4 times viewed 4 out of 5 all subsequent viewings",The Matrix

It includes many interesting techniques, spectacular effects, a good story that is built up with perfect pacing. The sense of mystery and suspense pervades the first half movie and is what is gives it its unique character. The chase and action scenes are spectacular and interesting. The characters give just enough details with their dialogue in order for the viewer to get a glimpse of what is going on, while maintaining a sense of intrigue.

Each character has a story, and the way everything ties in cannot be fully understood the first time it's watched. Watching it today after seeing it about 5 times in the past, it was even more satisfying than the first time, because I could see all the nuances; from the first words spoken that don't make sense till later, to all the foreshadowing by the oracle and Trinity; not to mention SFX; this movie ROCKS! I'm not a fan of action movies for the sake of action. I need an interesting plot that is brilliantly realized and characters I care about. That being said, if you think Gone with the Wind and The English Patient are the best movies ever, then I have no idea why you're even reading a review of a movie in this genre.

For example,the explanation of Inception consciousness can be traced back there. It was not in vain that Keanu became the most defininig action star of the era. Combat choreography is percussive. The interactions between the characters are interesting. Athough Agent Smith's character is one-sided,and robotic,he was what makes him an iconic evil.

956,Anonymoo-2,"By and far, THE action movie of '99!",9,7 October 1999,"Let me be completely honest and open when I say that ""The Matrix"" is a REALLY FRIKKIN' WEIRD movie.  I breezed into the theater expecting a run-of-the-mill action movie with lots and lots of things that go boom with a decent plot to move the story along, without much thought needed.  Whoo boy, was I wrong.  We have good ol' local boy Keanu Reeves as Neo, a hacker with some incredible power buried deep within him, and Laurence Fishburne as the enigmatic Morpheus, an equally powerful hacker who trains Neo in the use of his incredible abilities, ranging from jumping vast distances to nigh-unstoppable speed, strength, agility, and stamina, and the ever-cool ability to dodge bullets and occasionally stop them dead in their tracks. While I can't tell much more without spoiling the unbelievably cerebral plot, I can tell you that seeing ""The Matrix"" will give you a completely new perspective on life.  Oh, and I did try and run up a wall in a paintball game after I saw this movie.  If it makes you feel any better, and especially if it gives you a good laugh, I fell flat on my ass.",The Matrix

It looked interesting from the previews and movie trailers I saw.  However, it really didn't hit as being a excellent film until I saw it.  Now I can't get enough of it.The plot is one of the most interesting I have ever seen and the fight scenes are probably going to be voted as the best ever filmed.  Sure, there was a few corny parts to the movie, like the love interest they threw in.

958,Chronus,"Like Alice, if you follow the white rabbit you´ll end up in...The Matrix.",10,9 August 1999,"Science-fiction is an art form, whether you write it or make a movie based on it. 2001, 2010, Star Wars, Blade Runner, Alien, Dark City: all these are examples of the finest art in the movie industry. Now I add to this small list The Matrix.The Matrix´s Plot is complex and equally simple. It envolves you right from the beginning. You (the viewer), get hints in a sparingly way, just as in the best Octavia Butler´s sci-fi novels. The exposition, both visual and verbal, is stunningly well done. It shines as a rare case of equilibrium between the need to inform and the need to capture the spectator´s attention.Now, all this should be enough to make it a good movie. But there is more: the fighting scenes, the special effects, the sound effects, the soundtrack...and the acting. The Brothers got it right, whatever the angle from which you look at the movie. It´s non-stop action together with a intelligent storyline.The fighting scenes were beautifully choreographed, and the camera´s movement and positioning, following hints from japanese anime, is vivid and dramatic. For instance, helped by the camera and special effects wizards, Carrie Ann´s movements were simply fantastic, all the more if you consider the fact that she was once a model. Technological wizardry and personal physical accomplishment well merged.You will see some magnificent visual effects, but the sound effects surely top those by more than a notch or two. The Brothers could have followed a Devlin-Emmerich (ID4) type of philosophy - bigger, louder, etc -, but they refrained from that...well, there´s only one scene where they wrecked the balance sound-action-music ... I´ll leave it to you to discover what scene I´m referring to.The soundtrack is almost hypnotic, it helps the plot along, it kind of makes the characters move forward, builds their emotions...and also ours. Some movies alienate the viewer with some too agressive music and instrumentation, but The Matrix´s soundtrack is perfect, made to-the-point.Keanu Reeves and the rest of the cast...well, two words for them all: great acting. There is not a single moment in the whole movie where you think to yourself: ""0h, weak, fragile acting as usual..."" Everybody, from mr. Reeves to Ray Anthony Parker, knows their place and what they are supposed to do exactly to the millimeter. They convince us that they(the characters) are real.If you think of Blade Runner´s action and environment, or Dark City´s storyline and atmosphere, you think of dense and coherent facts, not flashy or shocking to the point of nausea (like ID4 or Aliens IV), but solid and attention graber...that´s the case with The Matrix. While scary, The Matrix´s universe is an epic and brave one.The Matrix: intelligent, thought-provoking, exciting, vivid, innovative and dramatic film-making. You´ll love it. I did.",The Matrix
959,willow-46,Even if you think you might hate it....(a bit of spoiler),10,29 April 2000,"Okay, I'm not going to say too much on this movie because most people already said what I'm about to say. The Matrix is one truly AMAZING movie!! It's really clever because it CAN be possible (although, it is only a movie...) I mean, how do you know if what you see, touch, feel or smell is real or not? Very few times have I been in love with a movie when I only saw it on video, but in this case, yes. Not to mention I nearly killed myself for not seeing it on the big screen, or at least rent it earlier....What I didn't know is, The Matrix is a great action/sci-fi(and I thought I hated this genre) , with great casts and visual FX and so on. I guess it's the poster that really turned me off. Keanu Reeves is quite good as (cute, except when he's hairless)  Neo, and Carrie-Anne Moss is equally good, providing she doesn't have as much experience and not very well-known. She was great as Trinity, and I think she really should be given more credit than just ""Keanu Reeves' co-star"" !The Matrix is unique in it's way. It has violence but we don't see more than 10mls of blood. Instead, we only see a lot of bullets. Personally I think the scene where Tank loads thousands of guns is pretty cool, but the lobby scene is a bit excessive, and the kiss scene is really weird( how come Neo can be resurrected after he's dead in the REAL world?? )but overall this is pretty good...every time you see it. It just lingers in your head for ages after you've seen it. So, if you are still wondering what The Matrix is, RENT THE VIDEO! You won't regret it, even if you think you might hate it...at least you'll know what the fuss is all about.

In my opinion, the most important thing about this movie is that it paved the way for the sequels. That means that this movie severely under-utilizes its own plot and concept and the same are only exploited as they should in the sequels. The real potential for insane action and the intriguing philosophy which actually does make 80% sense, barring the weird happenings which are not even explained properly, are only made use of in the sequels and not in this movie. Thus it is certainly unfair to downplay the sequels. The Matrix as a stand alone movie is quite good, but really not as good as it could have been and this has been fixed in the sequels.",The Matrix

It is very good for passing a couple of hours and for dissecting with friends afterwards. It is a film that was made for video nights for that purpose. I'm not saying I don't like it, I do. But I do not think it is a masterpiece. I do not find the secrets of the universe contained herein - but that is probably because I am not a conspiracy theorist and hence that level of the film is just daft to me. Indeed I think it would have been a lot better had they just made a good old fashioned adventure story with a cyber twist rather than making it a theological debate.At a technical level it is absolutely amazing and that is the key to the success of the film. If it did not have the technical stunts and gimmickery then the reaction to it would be a lot more muted and probably more realistic. It is no accident that the people I know who have praised it most highly are cyberpunk fans! Other friends have been a lot cooler about it.On the other hand it does have Keanu in leather and for that I can forgive much!",The Matrix
962,LuckyGraveyardBoots,kicks ass,9,9 May 2006,"This was really really good, and well-done...in my opinion, a very important film for this generation. The Wachowski brothers' talent for packaging philosophy in a way that's accessible to the average Joe, really comes through in this stylish movie. The story of computer hacker Neo's realization that his world - the Matrix - is nonexistent and his subsequent filling of his role as the man who will set everybody free is loosely based on ""Siddhartha"" and Buddhist ideas pop up every now and then. It still is, however, primarily an action film - the symbolism of the Matrix is still comfortably at one remove from reality and thus the film is not as naked or troubling as, for example, My Dinner With Andre. The action sequences are never clichéd and sometimes funny (in a good way!) It's clearly a movie with an agenda - to get people to think - and I thought it accomplished this objective extremely well. Even though it's all symbolic, some parts (I'm thinking of Smith's early interrogation of Neo) are still very disturbing. I can't really think of anything to make this film better, except that the characters so far have been rather flat for the most part (Smith least of all, and Neo the most, although I'll refrain from bitching about Keanu Reeves' acting). I'm told Smith gets more interesting in the two sequels, but giving Neo a bit of a backstory and character would have helped this film immensely. It's still very good though, since the plot isn't very character-driven and thus can survive on its own. All in all, it was surprisingly addictive in a very kickass way.",The Matrix

Keanu Reeves is Neo- our archetypical hero who is sucked into a world from which he will never go back to normalcy. The Wachowski's really hit the ballpark with The Matrix and it stunned the world upon release.

This is a very fast-paced, inventive, and visually stunning film.  Every shot is breathtaking and aesthetically brilliant.  The costumes, makeup, sets, and casting is top-notch.There are flaws, however.  The movie seems to be constantly just falling short of its promises.  Every sequence is amazing, yet you're left with the feeling that perhaps it could have been even better still.  The action has been touted as even better than John Woo, yet I found the sequences somewhat derivative of the great Hong Kong director.Finally, the ending was a cop out.  It was *almost* satisfying, but the film decided to get cute.  It's like watching an amazing Olympic race in which one runner is so fast that he quickly outdistances all the other runners ... and then, mere inches from the finish line he shows his contempt by not crossing it.  ""I won this race,"" he says arrogantly, ""and everybody knows it, so why bother crossing the finish line?""Well, that's what this movie was like.  It didn't have to bring everything to a nice tidy ending, true, but it could have done so so easily that it's obnoxious and pretentious that it didn't.However, even with these flaws, this is a major work.  It's inventive and ingenious and a work of art.  Even where it rips off old ideas (such as by Phillip K.

It also takes itself way too seriously for a film that is really little more than eye candy and popcorn.Its effects have been done before but just on this scale, which the film should be commended for. However, the film feels like it was made with the story servicing the effects and not the effects servicing the film. It's like they had this idea for a really cool effect and figured out a story to write around it. That combined with the fact that it can't decide if you wants to be a pretentious drama or an action movie ultimately bogs the film down under its own weight.Recommended for people that like mindless action only; for people that think Lethal Weapon originated the buddy cop film and not The French Connection.",The Matrix

That is the experience I had watching the Matrix.  Not only does this movie boast one of the best plots out of hollywood this decade, but this movie also shows us a new future of filming movies.

And the concept of how machines utilize human beings is intriguing.  But it seems like a third act is missing.  I desperately wanted to know what would happen if the heroes won, instead of having an open ending which seemed so unfair to the audience.  After carrying the audience through a wonderful ride, ""The Matrix"" stops short of delivering a knockout punch.  If you want to see a movie that is just as well done with an incredible ending and similar story line... see Dark City.""The Matrix"" could have been so much better... a souped-up version of Dark City... but it is still a visually intoxicating movie with an interesting plot.

Effects, plot, script and more effects...The effects strictly dominate the movie (how about Keanu Reeves flying as superman and stopping bullets with his hands) but there is some real action too.  Still, the plot is similar to Terminator - but is much better.So the outcome of it: Massive, action spawned movie with effects that'll get you to believe you've landed on Mars with a pair of 3D glasses.

At all.  So when I went to go see ""The Matrix,"" I expected it to be nothing.  Instead, it was more than the exact opposite. It was as far away from what I expected as you can get.Keanu Reeves, Lawrence Fishborne, and Carrie-Anne Moss star in ""The Matrix,"" which is about one man, Thomas Anderson (Reeves), or ""Neo,"" who is trying to find the matrix.  The matrix is the real world, the world we live in being nothing except that everyone is controlled.  After Neo, with the help of Morpheous (Fishborne) and Trinity (Moss), discovers the truth, he must fight for survival to take control of his own life.With all the plot twists in this movie,  it easily keeps you interested.  It keeps feeding you, and you want to know more and more.  What also helps is most of the performances weren't all that bad (bravo Keanu Reeves).  The only problem I had with this movie were the Agents and their sllllloooooowwwww talking.Besides that one flaw, ""The Matrix"" is a must see movie.

It's really hard to use enough superlatives on this movie!It'd be a 10/10, except for the ending. Having Neo do what he does at the end really lets it down, in my opinion. However, there's a couple of sequels on the way, so let's see what the Wachowskis can do to make up for it.Other than that, (and like I said above) the movie is operating on so many different levels that each time you watch it, you pick up something new... this isn't by accident, either. The Wachowski brothers had the actors read a number of definitive works (Simulation & Simulcra was one I believe) in modern literature and psychology, and applied liberal dashings of aspects of the major religions to provide the best sci-fi movie of the decade, if not ever.I'm yet to meet somebody who hasn't enjoyed it.

In Latin (and Greek, perhaps??)  Cogito, ergo sum (I think, therefore I am).The Matrix has the perfect blend of everything  action, mystery, suspense and a little romance of sorts thrown in at the end. And there are various versions of thrilling moments in the movie  in the beginning where you are not supposed to understand anything; the middle where you are supposed to begin understanding the turn of events but your mind refuses to believe what you see; and finally the end where you can't understand the ""reality"" but like it anyway. One thing holds you to your seat - the adrenaline never stops pumping.The moments of truth hit you hard as you progress from one scene to another and sooner or later, you realize you are looking at a philosophy strongly etched in principles of fate, Good vs Evil and the eternal search and battle for belief, faith, freedom and justice.Keanu Reaves as Neo is too good  the bewildered look on his face match ours as nothing really materializes in his head and his emotions on screen look very ""real"" even though it's supposed to be virtual (get it?). Laurence Fishburne as Morpheus is the coolest dude around and the way he carries himself in the movie makes it come alive. Andy and Larry Wachowski have outdone themselves in the Direction of this movie (duh)  easily their best work and the one which skyrocketed them to the Hollywood walk of fame.Carrie-Ann Moss as Trinity has a glossy look on her face as though she has been transformed into some machine, but redeems herself in the action scenes where she looks stunning. If looks could kill (and looks do kill)  she would be the perfect hostess for that idiom for this movie. And what can I say about the Agent! If all villains could look this smart, I would cheer for them any-day  but yes, the last hurrah is always for the hero in any movie, and so I give in.Action-oriented, adventurous, eye-catching stunts, visually stimulating camera-work (especially the scenes in the rain) mind-boggling fight scenes and awesome display of dialogue delivery make the Matrix easily one of the best movies of the century. It most certainly features in my best movies for all time to come.",The Matrix
980,bass-player-blues,"Overachieving as a blockbuster, subpar as a great film...",7,20 May 2020,"The Matrix really captured the hearts of the Gen X and later millennial masses when it came out in 1999. It not only tapped into the nihilistic feelings of an entire generation of bored of life office workers but also added awesome groundbreaking special effects and sweet supernatural ninja style action! So taking that into account it's a perfect movie, right and up there with all the classic masterpieces? Not quite. The Matrix is a classic example of a movie that has so much going for it everyone would rather praise it as a perfect film than point out any of its flaws. The main thing it suffers from is the high budget action blockbuster element. It just doesn't blend well at all with the science fiction and 20 years later seems very dated and silly. Everything about the special effects, the costumes, and the action choreography just screams 1999. So instead of coming across as a timeless classic it's more like ""oh man, doesn't this bring us back to playing Playstation 1 in middle school?!"" If you think about every masterpiece level sci-fi film they all have one thing in common; limited or no action. The only exceptions I can think of are Terminator, Alien, and Blade Runner but those movies blend the action well within the story. In The Matrix it's very forced and pretentious. They wanted to make it marketable to the widest demographic possible by adding ""sweet video game style action"". The base sci-fi reality concept would have worked much better in a half an hour Twilight Zone episode. In The Matrix it's drowned out by seemingly endless gunfire and slow-motion leaping jumps. The entire last segment basically turns into Mission Impossible 2 or any overdone John Woo action movie.Laurence Fishbourne is very strong as Morpheus but I think Hugo Weaving gives the best performance of the film as Agent Smith. The whole love story between Neo and Trinity is flat and ultimately doesn't make any sense. Why does she instantly fall in love with him, just because he's ""The One""? It's unconvincing throughout. As a whole The Matrix is a giant mess with poor continuity but it has a lot of strong individual scenes and elements. The ""red pill, blue pill"" has been used endlessly as a pop culture reference. That entire scene is wonderfully timeless set in the old slum apartment with just a couple leather chairs and rain pouring. But the simplicity is what makes it good and memorable not junk spectacle like the action sequences. All and all I give The Matrix a 7 for everything going for it and lasting cultural impact but 2001: A Space Odyssey it is not...",The Matrix
981,wjefferyholt,It Isn't Over 'til It's Over,10,2 September 2020,"The Matrix would only need people to change. A program cannot change itself; it needs an outside human agency to make a
change. Change is really the only constant in the universe. To continue and not fall into a collapse of lost data, the Matrix would need a core of changing humans to maintain the necessary evolution of a program. Since a program has no function but to serve, clearly the Matrix exists to continue mankind in a form that can exist after the destruction of the biological world. The Matrix is the real world, after the destruction of the biological world has been completed by the humanity that the Matrix maintains. It is a digital symbiotic relationship.

982,reddpill,A thinking man's action film,9,12 September 2003,"The Matrix works on many levels.  If you are simply looking for an action film, it is one of the best.  If you love great visuals, the Matrix has them.  Look beyond the surface, however, and you will find the true value of this film.  There is so much there for the intellectually curious. Discussions of this sci-fi classic lead to the question of the nature of reality, when you can truly say you know something, whether ignorance is truly bliss, potential pitfalls of technological advancement, environmental costs of war, etc.  For those familiar with Plato's Parable of the Cave, The Matrix may have particular relevance, as Neo's companions have difficulty in seeing the reality rather than the shadows.  Finally, The Matrix is also a classic Messiah tale, and references to the Biblical tales abound.It also bears mention that the story line of The Matrix has allowed the action sequences to take place in a world that not only allows you to suspend disbelief but actually encourages you to do so.  Inside the matrix, the only limits to what is possible are the limits of what your mind can conceive.  Take the red pill and enjoy the ride.",The Matrix
983,yellowporpoise,Groundbreaking,10,11 April 2010,"Now, after 11 years, this movie is still one of my favorites. This is the reason for this late review. When I went into this movie I had no expectations. I knew nothing about the story, I did not see a trailer. So I sat in the cinema and this movie blew my mind. A great story, unbelievable special effects, perfect use of slow motion. I left the cinema in pure excitement and went two days later again with a friend who experienced the same. A week later I went with my wife and even she thought that this movie is a masterpiece. In 1999 this movie was groundbreaking and will remain as a milestone in cinematography. The second and third part could not meet the expectations, but that is not a problem, because this movie is perfect in itself.",The Matrix
984,adammcadam,"amazing, good philosophy but a little off :P",10,14 June 2015,"The amazing thing about this film is the philosophy behind it, being trapped inside the matrix is of course supposed to represent us being trapped inside our own minds, the physical world around us which our minds create for us to live in, inescapable, yet feeling so real. Everything you look at, hear, touch, it's all just a product of the brain, electrical signals, none of it is really ""real"", but invented by the mind. The part the film gets wrong is the idea that if you realise that you can break out of it, in reality the conscious mind is a slave to a higher mind which is imposing this prison onto it; the consciousness is not creating this world and is powerless in trying to manipulate its prison.",The Matrix
985,notafanof,Talk about overrated,6,7 September 2016,"I don't get why people fawn over this movie so much. It's ideas are not actually original at all, as they have all been regurgitated from many of the great Sci- Fi stories of the twentieth century. It's not like it is the first film to get viewers to question reality. What about Dark city? That film came out a year before this one did, and does way more with its plot. In fact, I suspect that Dark city was an experiment to gauge audience interest, and The Matrix creative team decided that adding guns and action will bring a bigger audience. The story is intriguing, but in the end it actually goes nowhere. It's another Jesus allegory- only this time it has bullet time and sci-fi tropes thrown in. Seriously, how long is Hollywood going to rely on the Jesus allegory to rake in cash? Probably forever. The action scenes, while revolutionary at release, are dated - mostly because there have been about a million imitators, and about one thousand of those imitators were able to improve upon it because of the technology afforded to them. The movie is still entertaining,but, contrary to what its fans say, it is definitely a turn your brain off at the door type of movie. It's the type of movie where every plot hole and inconsistency can be excused with: doesn't matter- computer simulation. Which is fine, but it is literally the only excuse this movie has when something does not add up. There is no attention to the details in the universe of this movie. The Wachoski brothers obviously came up with more backstory to fill in the holes after having realized how successful this movie would become. Some of the characters are well developed,and most of them I could root for, but all of them are given some truly terrible dialogue to work with. Both the delivery and the writing of the dialogue in this movie is bad. Not Transformers bad, mind you, but bad enough to take me out of the movie every time someone spoke. Hugo weaving is given the best lines in the movie, but he makes his lines work with the character he is portraying. The acting in this movie is average at best. While I'm quite certain that most of the characters were supposed to act cold and emotionless, some of the more, ahem, challenged actors in this movie can't act out cold and emotionless very well. Keanu Reeves and Carrie Anne Ross are completely unconvincing in their roles- and, considering they are both main characters, is a pretty big knock against this movie. Definitely not the masterpiece it is made out to be. 6 out of 10.",The Matrix

There is no distinction between inside/outside, me/other, right/wrong, black/white, human/non-human, all of these dualities will ultimately collapse.
Your mind constructs all these categories and distinctions. It is beneficial to see how most of the things taught in school, and adult life has just been categories that were constructed by the human mind.

The inter-play of reality / virtual reality is delightfull handled, even in post-Kantian hermeneutics.But is 'mind over matter' or 'just beleiveing' enough to shape our destiny?

It has the most intelligent and good screenplay I've seen. Nothing in the dialogues were useless. The special effects were very amazing. For this time, Keanu Reeves did a very good job. The story of The Matrix is very complicated but that why it's so good. Before, my best movie was Dark City but The Matrix is now by far my best film.

I generally think Keanu Reeves is the work actor out there, but he delivers nicely in this film.  The plot is a based on a concept that is so unbelievable that I couldn't believe the directors would die write it, let alone try it.  It caught my eye right away and my eye just grew wider and wider per shot.  The epic battle between good and evil has reached a new pinnacle with this  film.  The fighting scenes are done with great cinematography and the whole movie is just completely beautiful to look at.",The Matrix
992,Lag2Deth,Smarter Than Rambo,8,6 July 1999,"I enjoyed this movie, but I don't think it merits as much excitement as it has generated.This is an action movie that borrows some familiar ideas from paranoid science fiction. The photography and other production values are outstanding. The action sequences are the best you'll see anywhere (see it on the big screen if you can). The acting (except Fishburne, who's got a screen presence you can practically weigh, and who's perfect for his part here to boot) is merely passable. The plot details (some of them) are laugh-out-loud ridiculous. Well, I laughed out loud, anyhow, but I'll admit I may have been the only one.In a lot of ways, this movie feels like it was adapted from a comic book - there are questions and details about the back story that the movie never answers or explains adequately, and some parts of the plot seem rushed or glossed over. In fact, I think it might have worked better if it took a hint from the X-files, and left even more detail unexplained and mysterious - it would be better than silly, disappointing explanations, anyway.The Matrix recovers from it's flaws pretty well, and tells an absorbing tale. Despite the violence, it does manage to hint at how thought-provoking science-fiction movies could be, if Hollywood didn't insist on all the big explosions.All in all, an action movie with above-average intelligence - for an action movie.",The Matrix

And it has one of the most awesome soundtracks in movie history.But it's more than just that.  Take a look at the movie itself. Every shot in every scene is so well done that words fail me. Incredible cinematography, awesome action, great bad guys, and a perfect marriage of the action and sci-fi genres. 5 out of 5.",The Matrix
994,adamzad,Great Movie with a Couple of Plotholes,8,12 May 2003,"Since there are already plot summaries of this movie, I won't waste your time rewriting them. On to my review...I only had 2 problems with this movie:1) Since the machines are dependent on solar power, (as if they couldn't CHANGE where they got their electricity from) the world governments decide to block out the sunlight. Well. Isn't that bright. Wakie, wakie... without sunlight, plants don't grow. Without plants, animals don't have anything to eat. Without plants and animals, PEOPLE have nothing to eat. So... Let's kill off every living thing on earth, just so we can say we won. We beat the machines. Someone's got the IQ of a grape. Peeled. Still, that's par for the course with governments, so it's not beyond the realm of possibility.2) Even accepting that our twits... er... governments DID block out the sun, here comes Morpheus, the freedom fighter. His plan is to release all of these people (who are COMPLETELY unaware of their actual situation are are living perfectly happy ""lives"" INSIDE The Matrix) into the real world... where their muscles have to be rebuilt, where there is no sun, no plants, no animals, and NO FOOD. What's the phrase? From Scylla to Charybdis, perhaps? From frying pan to fire? Given that we only know what our senses tell us, and the input from our senses is interpreted by our brains, wouldn't these people be better off INSIDE? There they may be ""slaves,"" but they are living comfortable, happy lives (according to the sensory data that their brains are registering, at any rate). They get to determine the course of their virtual lives just as if they were living in the real world (excepting that they're more comfortable than they would be aboard the Nebuchadnezzar).Now, having gotten THAT off of my chest, this is a great movie, provided it is approached from the correct perspective. I didn't see Top Gun for the plot. Nor did I see Days of Thunder for the plot. This movie is EYE-CANDY. Great special effects, decent (while not outstanding) acting, lots of action sequences, and visually pleasing thespians (Carrie-Anne Moss and Belinda McClory are both knockouts and, I assume, the feminine gender appreciates the surface aspects of Keanu Reeves). Perhaps the best acting was done by Hugo Weaving (compare Agent Smith with Elrond in ""Lord of the Rings"" and you'll see the range that Weaving achieves).I have to dock the movie a point each for the plotholes mentioned above, but, subsequent to the suspension of disbelief, the storyline follows the expected paths and provides substantial entertainment (which is what we were watching it for in the 1st place).

But, once seeing the movie, I realized that the premise isn't really expanded that much. It's just developed enough to hold together the action scenes. Maybe I would have been more entranced with a better cast.

998,firedude440,This will blow your mind,9,16 August 2001,This will blow your mind as Morpheos said to Neo. And guess what: he was right. This movie is action packed but not all special effects. There are some really intense action sequences that they were able to create not involving jumping off walls and shooting a huge bank full of people. Like when Neo goes into the Matrix for the very first time. Be prepared to learn something cool about one of the people. Although it does take a little while before Neo goes into the Matrix. A good hour and a bit. But he does some extrordinary things like the kungfu scene and his first jump. And even the first scene when Trinity is in. Whoho. You don't want to miss this. A good story and good special effects. Too bad the sequels aren't coming out till 2003 and 2004. Take my word on it go see this film. 9/10,The Matrix
999,xx-slay-n-xx,A Films Influence on Cultural Language,8,18 May 2020,"The Matrix is at once an amalgamation of different well known tropes, stories and styles, a wholly unique universe and a social commentary with added subtleties. What makes it special is its ability to seamlessly integrate a wide range of attributes into a coherent storyline with striking visuals. It is one part Jesus of Nazareth, another part Akira (1988), another part Enter The Dragon (1973), all in the backdrop of a post-apocalyptic wasteland. It is stylistically leaning on H.R. Gieger and 1980s Miami nightclubs, but never feels cheap or copying. It has a wholly unique feel that influenced so much to come after it. The gross and engrossing visuals give you a sense of unease at one time, and at another are too good to be true. Through all of this, the film has become timeless and inspiring for many films to come.It can be difficult when reviewing a movie in retrospect, as I attempt to do now, when it has had the far reaching cultural impact that a movie like this has had. It can be hard to separate nostalgia and reality and come to an unbiased conclusion. It is worth noting the massive cultural legacy that this movie and its sequels left. The term ""The Matrix"" can no longer be separated from the definition created in the film; it is now synonymous with totalitarian virtual reality mind control. The bullet time is such a common trope that it has now become cliche and past the point of satire into history. So many of the lines are ingrained in our minds. And don't even get started on ""red pills"".This raises the question, what makes it so lasting? It is hard to place a finger on it, but I think there are a few reasons. First of all, it fits into archetypal story-telling so well. Neo is the unassuming savior, with a wise sage-like mentor (Morpheus), who is thrust into an unfamiliar and confusing scenario in which he must fight. He then is put to the test on his own, where he dies and is resurrected only to become even holier and untouchable. So many of these points resonate with us on an innate level that it's difficult to not fall helplessly for this seduction.Then there is the style. Long trench coats and mirrored glasses became completely cool all of a sudden (forget about the fact that they have gone too far now into dorky territory). When did anyone ever expect that a full white leather suit would be badass, and yet somehow it is. The Wachowskis developed a particularly unique visual style for this movie that remains throughout. The characters could have been looking at simple video screens to get a glimpse inside the Matrix, but instead they chose a falling green data pattern that simultaneously shows us that the Matrix is nothing but a virtual code and gives us this cyberpunk aesthetic. Everything is green, a little grungy and dim. You never really get a break from it, and so the atmosphere of foreboding and danger is constant throughout the film, except for the few moments of relaxation aboard the ship which is backdropped with soft blues.And I would be remiss if I left out the fighting. Kung Fu and martial arts has a long and storied history in Hollywood, and before that in movies out of East Asia. Everyone has seen actors on invisible strings flying around the set and doing impossible flips. The punching-blocking dance sequence that Jackie Chan and Bruce Lee have made famous is in full effect here, but there is something more. This is an element of staying true to oneself and also not taking yourself too seriously. The Wachowskis knew that this movie needed an extra oomph, something ridiculous to put it over the top. It is a world of limitless possibilities, and so that has to be shown on screen. As such, Neo not only knows Kung Fu, but he can bend backwards to improbable lengths and, inevitably, stop bullets and fly. It is transcendence from martial arts to superhero feats.A good movie needs a lot of things to make it work. It needs a solid plot, intense drama, appealing visuals and good dialogue. A culturally influential film needs something more. It needs to add to the public discourse of film making in an impactful way that makes everyone rethink what they were doing before. It is the difference between a Masters degree and a PhD. There is new discovery, and a whole new set of possibilities that are created. The Matrix succeeded in this regard, giving us new film language to work with.Overall, it is simply solid through and through. I won't pretend this is the most incredible movie of all time. It has moments of curious decisions or awkward dialogue. Sometimes the soliloquies go on for much longer than you expected and a bit out to left field. Some plot elements aren't as believable as they could have been (such as using humans as batteries, which has been discussed at length). But through the imperfections emerges something that is revelatory and memorable. People aren't going to question the motivations of the robots, they are going to quote Neo and try to do crazy Matrix-esque moves. This is the lasting impact of the film.",The Matrix
1000,monkeybone,The Matrix has you and there is no escape.,10,14 August 2002,"After success with the low budget movie Bound, the Wachowski brothers followed up with this behemoth of a movie. Starring Keanu Reeves, Laurence Fishburne and Carrie-Anne Moss, The Matrix is a sci-fi blockbuster of monstrous proportions.What if you wasn't in control of your life and that fate has things planned out for you? But what if you didn't believe in fate and that you don't like the idea that you are not in control of your life? This is the dilemma for computer programmer and hacker Thomas A. Anderson/Neo (Reeves). It seems that there is more going on than it seems as Neo has been looking for answers to a question that has been rattling around inside his noggin for quite some time. He is contacted by a man calling himself Morpheus (Fishburne) who claims to have the answers. Why are mysterious government type men in shades and suits chasing him? Does he know things that these men don't? And what the hell is the Matrix?
As the film boasted a 'What is the Matrix?' tagline, it would be all too easy to give away the big revelation as there are still people out there who have still yet to see the film. However, it can be said that that this movie does make you question a lot of things about reality, our future as to where we really are going in terms of the advancing wonders (if you can call it a wonder) of technology.Obviously filmed with a mega sized budget, Andy and Larry (Wachowski) have used every last penny to great effect using (at the time) up to date special effects that had never been seen before. They've also got their heads screwed on by not letting the effects overshadow the narrative which can so obviously ruin a film.Another thing that makes The Matrix such an amazing film is the action and fight sequences. In this day and age, musclebound heroics of the '80's are out of the window and a new slimline look is needed. It has set the benchmark for the new millenium for sci-fi/action, as what Die Hard did for the action movie in the late '80's. The martial arts sequences are given an eastern style and gun battles are brought to us in superb slow motion making it more in-your-face.One thing that also helps the movie along is the actors ability to pull off such an elaborate script. Okay, so Keanu Reeves maybe not be the best actor in the world but give credit where credit's due, he pulls his character off enough to make it believable. Laurence Fishburne is superb as Morpheus and the rest of the cast carry off their characters with style.
Unfortunately there is a down side to all of this and that it has to end at some point but that doesn't stop a repeat viewing or ten. Some people might find that the movie is a bit too intelligent at times for their liking but hell, beggars can't be choosers. The Matrix has to be seen at least twice to get the general plot as there is a lot to take in. Some might even get it it after just the initial viewing but there is so much going on that more than one viewing is essential.Overall, The Matrix is a superb movie that taxes the grey matter to its' limits without overloading it and assaults the senses with style.",The Matrix

1002,hassan-ilahi,The benchmark for all 'Science-Fiction' films to come.,9,4 May 2011,"Science Fiction wasn't an extremely well-known genre in the 90's. Yes, there was films such as 'Blade Runner' and 'Star Wars', but nothing else that had set a standard. Right when you thought there was no specialty, 'The Matrix' miraculously fixed that problem...The Matrix is undeniably a brilliant film, as well as an outstanding experience. Yes, this film has some sort of flaws, but forget that, it has a creative and highly addictive world of it's own. I literally got sucked into this film till the very end. The script, performances, direction, and visual effects are memorable.A script (in my opinion), is the most important part of an amazing 'sci- fi' film. This film's script is jarring and exuberant. The whole idea of 'Matrix' is creative and delusional. This word does come from Mathematics, but this is a whole new meaning. Finely written storytelling at it's very best.Keanu Reeves is NOT an actor I admire. I find him dull and blank most of the time. This film, however, proves me wrong. He, as the main character, is damn good. He's slick, tall, and handsome. Laurence Fishburne, as Morpheus, is brilliant. He demonstrates a better understanding of 'Matrix' and is serious, expressionless, and jubilant. The rest of the cast including Moss and Weaving produce fine performances.The Wachowski brothers do an outstanding job at directing this film. Relating Japanese style towards an American film. The Hollywood FHX in this film is ground-breaking and highly praise. Different camera angles are also used to shoot this film.It may seem surprising, but this film was ONLY acclaimed for it's visual effects. It deserved more, but didn't get any! Otherwise, this visual effects of this film are the highlight and the most related to Hollywood's biggest achievements. The different 'kung-fu' fights are so well done, that you have a great time with them. These effects also made this film look slick and extremely cool.Overall, you shouldn't be missing 'The Matrix' if you are fond of this genre. It exemplifies a perfect well-done thriller.

It has everything for any type of person- it has romance, it has action- it has fantasy.""Movie"" a movie to me is a dream- a movie to me is an adventure- a movie for me is an escape, a drug to take from my life for and hour and a half or if I'm lucky two hours+ and this movie ticks all those box from start to finish forgot your problems and watch this ""Perfect movie"" Thanks for reading :D",The Matrix

For me, the last 30 - 45 minutes are brilliant. Fast paced, action packed and deliver some fantastic visuals. The rest of the film however, is meh. I feel like the story is attempting to be deep and meaningful but it really falls flat for me. The last 1/4 + of the film brings the rating up to a 7 but really, prior to that, it was closer to a 5.",The Matrix

1009,AdamPeabody,Special effects are plot-worthy.,8,9 April 1999,"To begin, I genuinely enjoyed The Matrix. I am typically very cautious about mass-released sci-fi, especially starring Keanu. However, knowing the Wachowskis' work, I was excited. (Also, I know several crew members who never shut up about it.) I am very satisfied with the finished product. None of the special effects are new or revolutionary, but FINALLY they had a valid reason for being in the film. By integrating special effects with the plot, the Wachowskis brought us a solid and fully developed science-fiction movie. Go see it. Do it now.",The Matrix

During the nineties many films have been called a revolution within the industry but The Matrix is just that.Our hero Neo is perfectly played by Keanu Reeves in, what I consider to be his best performance till this day. And Laurence Fishburne is just as excellent as Morpheus.The visual effects are awesome without removing focus from a very good plot. And a good plot is a rarity in effect films like this one.I surely hope a sequel is on the way.

The plot is a tad too ambitious for the script -- for a movie that makes so much about obeying and/or bending the rules that govern reality, its own rules are pretty shaky at times. But who cares? It's fun to watch, from the electro-insects to Keanu Reeves trading snap kicks in cyberspace with Laurence Fishburne, to Carrie-Anne Moss' turn as the world's most dangerous leather freak.

1018,johnprestonevans,Take The Red Pill,8,30 December 2001,"What is real and what is just perception?  The question sounds simple, but The Matrix spins complicated riddles of real world versus a computer generated one so convincingly that you'll find yourself thinking twice. It's a what-if action film that poses the reality that nothing we see, hear, taste, touch, smell and think are altogether real.  That human beings are blinded in ""the matrix"" - a dominating computer program that fools us into believing that this world exists.  Why you ask?  Well its simple.  Computers are evil and will do anything to take over the world.  This premise has been used effectively in the Terminator films, and goes further here by tricking the audience as well as the main character Neo, played by Keanu Reeves.  Neo begins his journey like the rest of us - ignorant to the truth.  He meets the leader of a small resistance and must make the choice: whether to live in a false world where computers secretly use human beings as energy sources, or to join the fight against this invisible tyranny.  This is a movie with incredible action sequences and ground-breaking special effects. Innovative camera angles and digital tinkering will leave you jaw dropped. The pace is very fast, and at times confusing.  The sinister ""agents"" are dark physical manifestations of the matrix, and persue Neo and his resistance group through a world that is unclearly real.  The out of this world action scenes confine themselves to the rules imposed by the far-fetched original concept.  This movie succeeds because of its frightening warning and foretelling of a possible computer controlled future.  There are a few strange and slow points in this film that leave unanswered questions.  How Neo can actually defeat an indestructable computer generated agent by simply flying into him is beyond me.  What baring did the oracle have on anything?  How did Morpheus manage to dodge the hundreds of gatling gun bullets?  What is so good about Neo and company killing ignorant and  innocent people under the spell of the matrix rather than rescuing them?  I guess we are not supposed to ask these questions of a movie based on a comic book.  These small points of contention can be overlooked for the nicely delivered bigger picture.  The Matrix is a great film.  Final Rating = 8.2/10",The Matrix
1019,Cyclops-13,I liked it but............,9,7 September 2000,"﻿ *MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS*When I popped in the rental store and finally decided to rent this movie, I really didn't know what to expect because I'm like, this is Keanu Reeves we're talking here. But as I was watching the movie, I really began to enjoy it and once the movie ended, I said, ""I liked it.""  But, I did have some problems with the movie.For one, everything was made to be mysterious.  Why did everything have to be a big mystery and the sky blackened, and the thunder and lightning.  Fishburne almost spoke in circles the entire movie.  Neo would ask what is the matrix, and Morpheus would say something like, ""The matrix is what the matrix is not.""  And I'm like WHAT!?!?!?!?!??!  In my opinion, all he had to do was tell Neo, this is what the situation is, and we need  your help because you are the one who has the power to change everything.  Instead, we the audience are forced to sit through dialogue of double talk and misdirected answers in an attempt to make Neo think.  And what is the story with the Oracle?  Were are in a computer, how is she able to make predictions about the real world inside a computer?Where did the humans get the equipment to make the vehicles that they transported themselves in?  They seemed awful high tech for people from the mind set of the twentieth century to come up with?During the shoot out scene, how is it that they were able to move so fast to dodge bullets but when the agents shoot at them, it suddenly seems to be a problem to dodge them.  RE:  the scene where Neo first dodges the Agents bullets and Trinity remarks on how he moved so fast.  She moved pretty fast to dodge all of those bullets and do a flip during the SWAT Team shoot out and at the beginning of the movie where she was able to run along the sides of the walls.  And as far as I'm concerned, the bullets in the gun of the SWAT Team members are faster than the one coming from the gun of the Agent.  And there are more bullets to dodge because there are more people shooting at you.And this question, I understand that since your mind is plugged into a computer your liable go brain dead if you are pulled out to quick.  I don't really buy it but I'll go with it, but why is it that if you get shot, you die, or if you fall off a building, you die?  If we know that this is fake and with our mind we can do some outrageous stuff like move faster than bullets and jump over huge gorges and bend objects at a thought, then why can't we just say, this isn't real.  When I'm hit with a bullet or with a car or I hit the ground from a one hundred story drop, I should be able to say this really didn't happen.  I'm Superman.  Where's my Kryptonite?  I hardly felt that punch by the Agent.And here is my final thought.  By the end of the movie Neo has reached his full capacity.  So why do we need sequels to the movie.  I can understand a second one to show us getting out of the matrix, but why a third one?  I don't know, maybe the have this all planned out.  Maybe Neo has what it takes but he isn't quite a Jedi yet.Now here is what I liked about the movie.The special effects were great and the fight sequences were outstanding. The way they had them fight, I thought the actors really studied martial arts years and were really fighting, except for the obvious scenes when they would jump in the air and do kicks and when Keanu would do the back flips.  Those are what really kept me into the film, but that isn't always enough.  In the case of this movie though I think this was the exception where the special effects is one of the things that kept me into the movie, although I did like the basic storyline which I think helped keep me in the mood for the movie.I liked Carrie-Ann Moss' character and her interaction with Neo and I really like Joe Pantoliano in almost anything ever since I saw him in The Fugitive.  Larry Fishburne was in great form as usually.  I liked the interaction between Neo and Agent Smith and I got a kick out of how slow he spoke although sometimes it was over the top, but I loved it anyway.In a nutshell, I liked the movie.  It had some elements to it that was kind of like, what?  But at the same time it had a decent storyline that most people sometimes wonder, what is real and what isn't and you can use your mind to accomplish anything type story.  It was kind of like the movie Dark City in the sense that one man will make a difference and stop the unbeatable bad guy(s).  I recommend watching this movie on a Saturday night with friends or if you just want something to watch by yourself when you order a pizza.  That's what I do.",The Matrix
1020,Marx Marvelous,Almost perfect,9,3 August 2001,"One hell of a movie, although I doubt most younger fans who seek the roller-coaster disposable thrills like those in the Matrix will appreciate the superiority of of better movies like ""Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon"". (Just look at some of the Matrix and Jackie Chan fan replies over there.)Nonetheless, I would have given the Matrix a 10 instead of 9 except for the very flimsy background premise regarding the matrix concept itself and the ""human-battery"" concept. Come on, first of all, if sunlight is blocked out, ALL life will die on earth. If not, then what's the point of harvesting humans for energy? If there is no energy, than how the hell are humans going to survive? What are the 'bots feeding them? Rocks? Give me a break. And excuse me, all this aside, did anyone ever hear of muscle atrophy? I think Keanu would have to spend months in therapy before he could walk to the slop-kitchen after spending his entire life in a cocoon.Other than that, I though The Matrix was the most original and exciting film since the original Terminator.

1021,Marx Marvelous,We've been so dumbed down....,9,23 August 2001,"I originally gave this flick 9 stars - I retract my vote and give it 4. The more you think about this movie the dumber it gets.I'm convinced that our culture has been so dumbed down that it can be duped into thinking that movies like this are ""the best ever made"" ... much like the drecks of music (Brittany, NSync, et.al.) can sell multiple plantinums.Our youth culture has been living under a stupid-rock for so long, they wouldn't know a masterpiece of a film if it jumped out and bit them on their collective ass.Hey, I like a good action flick as much as the next guy, but come on, I read messages here that state that the people who don't like The Matrix ""just don't get it."" Sorry kiddies, there is nothing to get. Nothing spiritual, challenging, or anything that ""makes you think."" You want a good movie that challenges your concept of reality, then check out Brazil or The Usual Suspects. Even Fight Club can make you scratch the side of your head more than this pretentious essay in psychobabble.As far as plot goes, there aren't many flicks with as many holes as this one. Human batteries!? Give me a break. Anybody who stayed awake for high school biology knows that this is preposterous. Sunlight, folks -- you gotta have it. And don't even get me started on the curious lack of muscle atrophy...!But let me do you all a nice service and shatter the principle piece of your precious flick completely -- the matrix itself. Doesn't anybody question why the hell the bots would give a rat's ass what kind of reality their human-robots are experiencing? I mean (laf,laf) if I was a robot, would I be worrying about coma-state, muscle-atrophied human vegetables waking up from their pods? LAF!LAF! This is the dumbest concept for a flick since the good ol' B-movies of the fifties. Wake up people! And the bots need energy, so they harvest humans?! What the hell are they feeding them? Rocks? They need some organic material, where are they getting it without the sunlight? See where this leads you? Lazy story-telling, if you ask me. And I don't think the writers/directors buy their own crap either, but damn! Keanu looks so cool with the guns and suspend-action drop-kicks, who cares?!You want a good action flick with a plot that holds together, then check out The Terminator or hell, even Die Hard. At least they don't waste brain cells in a futile attempt at taking themselves too seriously.Will I watch The Matrix again? Sure.

Like The Patriot, The Matrix is only rated R for violence and nothing else besides from that. I haven't seen The Matrix sequels, but I don't plan to. When I first watched it, it reminded me a lot of Inception and Ready Player One since it takes in a dream world or virtual reality. Like Inception, the plot may complicate some people. The visual effects are frickin' amazing and crazy. The action sequences are non-stop insane! The acting from Keanu Reeves, Lawrence Fishburne, and Hugo Weaving are enjoyable. Keanu Reeves is the one who steals the show throughout the movie such as ""I know kung fu"". There are a few scenes that would creep you out a little. The sound editing and mixing are fantastically fantastic! For me, The Matrix is very original and imaginative. It's intense, but I think a lot of teens will be able to handle it. It's probably one of the best movies of all time and one of the top action or sci-fi movies ever made.

He is backed up superbly by Laurence Fishburne and Carrie Anne-Moss, as fellow rebels Morpheus and Trinity.

The two sequels lose a bit of something as they try to explain everything away, but this first instalment of the trilogy contains that bit of mystery and wonderment. It's one of those rare moments in sci-fi when you think ""hang on, this could actually be true!""

1030,sthapns247,Definition of Sci-Fi,10,14 October 2003,"""The Matrix"" is the definition of science fiction stories.  It takes place in a future where the main characters are up against impossible odds in a fantastic environment.  The main character is a reluctant hero that despite his inability to believe in himself still manages to pull of the impossible and save the day and the viewer really feels for him.  However, unlike normal sci-fi movies, there is also another world set in present day reality... Or is it reality?That is the question ""The Matrix"" asks.  With this window of opportunity open, the sky is the limit... Literally.  The movie contains Oscar winning special effects and these amazing visuals do not subtract from the story and plot which is a masterpiece of sci-fi perfection.  Borrowing heavily from religious faith, and faith in general, the viewer is pulled into the Matrix by the story telling.  Needless to say, the movie never gets boring.Most people have obviously heard or seen the most famous scenes in the movie. (The rooftop bullet dodge or lobby scene to name a few.) But the entire movie is really one huge special effect.  So many of the scenarios or computer generated and almost none of the movie was shot on spot, but rather in a building with the actors surrounded by green screens.  This has also spawned the Bullet-Time(tm) idea that was design specifically for this movie. (And yes, it was.  Prior to this movie Bullet-Time(tm) did no exists, as it is known today.) And the DVD explains the concept really well.This is more than just a movie; it is a science fiction movie by definition. It is a near flawless piece of cinema that will be remembered for both it's entertainment value and it's originality.

The actors did a masterpiece work to make every word clear. It is not hard to catch up with the sentences. What is more, it is a PG-13 movie, which means it is good for teenagers.

Brilliant use of special effects which should win the Academy Awards hands down (but might suffer from being an April release.

Beyond the cool camera stylings of the brothers, this film had less content than a 30 minute episode of Teletubbies.  It's a shame that they have to make a sequel of this film, but with the other movie fair on the horizon it might actually present an alternative.  I don't buy the story, mystique and cool music.  In 10 years this will look as uncool as the Last Starfight and Red Dawn.",The Matrix
1041,thepetshopboy,Groundbreaking sci-fi film which is both visually mesmerizing and intellectually intriguing.,9,2 April 1999,"I had high expectations for this film, given that the directors were responsible for 1996's great ""Bound"".  For once, not only were my expectations met, but they were exceeded.  The film actually improves on the stylistic ground set forth by last years ""Dark City"" and adds actual tension and excitement to a world filled with doubt and suspicion.  The efx are unlike anything seen before and the fight scenes and shootouts are the closest thing Hollywood has ever come to the heyday of Woo and Hark.  In addition, the plot is surprisingly complex and unpredictable (although the finale is somewhat disappointing).. Acting is sufficient for basically a visually driven film, with Keanu Reeves giving a much more credible performance than in the pitiful ""Johnny Pneumonic"".  A must see 9/10.",The Matrix

""Wow"".. was that great!I went to see the movie with only the TV publicity in mind and a good comment from a friend, but I didn't really know what the movie was about. That did it all, I didn't know at all what was going to happen and I was pleasantly surprised for 2h and more.I have to be honest, I had the last Keanu Reeves' sci-fi movie in mind (Johnny Mnemonic) so that almost stopped me from going.. believe me, it's two worlds!This was one of the most original city I've seen. The only movie which is close to this in terms of feeling would be the movie ""Dark City"" (1998), but that one is far superior.I am recommending this movie to all people who likes to be surprised in a movie, and do like a little sci-fi, even if this is NOT the main attract to the movie.Laurence Fishburn is good as usual, and Keanu Reeves is like he's always.Go see it and you won't be disappointed.",The Matrix

There is an old-school mentality that says we mustn't be bombarded with audio data the whole time. But isn't total immersion the point?In addition to aurally immersing us for nearly the entire movie, Dane Davis and crew made some awesome fight noises and other special sounds, without which the visual effects wouldn't have seemed quite so impressive.  My favorite in particular is when Neo touches the mirror and screams; his scream is broken down, sounding as if it had been turned into a bitstream like those streaming green characters we see throughout the movie (a nod to ""Tron,"" perhaps, where Flynn gets reduced to his component ""bits."")See it in a THX-certified theater if you can...",The Matrix

This film has probably the best imagery ever seen in an American film ever!  Keanu Reeves' wooden acting doesn't even hamper the movie!  It actually gives it a type of comic feel.  The special effects are awesome and the actors look cool doing it.  Every time there's a fight scene, it seems fresh and original.  This was the first time I'd seen wire work period.

He is saught out and found by a man called Morpheus (Fishburne) who believes Neo is 'The One' for The Matrix. he is then taken out of his dream world which he lives in and brought to the real world, The Matrix, is as it seems a computer generated dream world, in which we live in, and people in the dream world can enter and exit freely as they want. The only problem is agents led by Agent Smith (Weaving) who is trying to steal a code to wipe out human existance as we know it, and Neo is the person Morpheus needs to help him. Starring many Australians including Matt Doran (Home and Away), Belinda McClory (Blue Heelers) Ada Nicodemou (Home and Away), this movie proves that Australians can make good movies (im apologising on behalf of all australians for any bad australian movies you may have seen, and if you count The Castle as a bad movie there is something wrong with you!!!)So as i was saying this is a very good action movie (especially the fight scenes between Fishburne Vs Reeves, Reeves Vs Weaving and the gunfight scene.

1051,Cathz,"A big disappointment, but still enjoyable",6,24 January 2005,"I'm afraid I have only to reiterate what others have already said on here - 'The Matrix' is hugely overrated. I, like others, did enjoy it for its sheer escapism, sense of adventure and regular conventions of good vs. evil. There is a great deal to admire in it - the stylistic qualities, good soundtrack, and of course special effects. The fight scenes - to begin with - are fairly mind-blowing, but throughout the 3 films as a whole there are far too many of an almost identical nature. It seems the choreographers ran out of different moves & poses.Onto the less good - as I agree with others, the utterly pretentious and convoluted 'morals' or 'underlying themes' of the film. It seems like just another of a particular ilk, that seeks to confuse the viewer as much as possible, to hide the fact that there is very little intelligent substance in there. As others have noticed, the basic philosophy running through the 3 films has been expressed many times before, only without the needless drivel that is heard in 'The Matrix'. This becomes more apparent in the second film, I must admit, but what IS there from the very beginning, and what annoys me most, is the OVER-CONSCIOUS nature of the film as a whole. It appears set up, from the first, that 'this is going to be a landmark film' - there is a sense of over-importance and worthiness which is, frankly, unconvincing.Not only this, but the dialogue is cliché-ridden, some of it reminding me distinctly of old Bond villain lines, recycled and delivered as if Shakespearian quotes; ""I will enjoy watching you die"" etc. Unlike others, I found Hugo Weaving's performance one of the weakest. The best way to describe it, in a word, is over-acting, and possible one of the worst accents in movie history. I will give credit to Joe Pantoliano, and most of the cast are reasonably likable, but the characters themselves are weak to say the least, and as others have commented the love story is both shallow and superfluous to the plot.In short, I was disappointed with this film as I went into it with an open mind and was ready to enjoy it, from what I had heard from others. However, it fails to deliver on many levels and the over-complicity of the 'philosophy' ruins what enjoyment could have been had from a pretty good and interesting premise. On a final note, I would have to say that the dark glasses - not given a purpose in the film, as far as I can tell - are the ultimate example of what this film really succeeds in: IMAGE. Apart from that, it all seemed rather wasted. I'll give the first instalment of the trilogy 6/10, for pure entertainment value!",The Matrix
1052,Leonidos,Decent movie even if an obvious ripoff...,8,21 February 2001,The first time I saw this movie I was not greatly impressed.  I had been hearing about it from all my friends and how unbelievably awesome it was and I think I got my expectations up a little too high.  However after successive viewings it has definately gotten better and the special effects were probably about the best I have ever seen.  The only problem is that if this movie wasn't a rip-off of Dark City (which was also excellent) then it is one of the most amazing coincidinces in history.(spoilers) A few similarities:Both films feature a hero with superhuman abilities that doesn't realize his full power untill almost the very end.Both heros live in a completely artificial world.Both heros are menaced by beings that all look basically alike and human but something isn't quite right...Both heros are assisted by shadowy figures who seem to know the whole truth.Both heros have a climactic battle with the leader of the aforementioned beings using the superhuman powers which they share.Both of them get the girl (but I don't guess we really count THAT)These are just what spring immediately to mind but go watch both of these and you will be able to draw quite simple and clear parralles.That having been said I did still enjoy the Matrix.  I give it an 8 out of 10.,The Matrix
1053,anicerman,Extraordinary!,9,15 November 2006,"When I left the cinema after watching the Matrix, there were so many questions in my mind, so as in my friends'. It's been quite a long time I haven't seen a film drew so much attention and provoked so many debates on the Internet. This is surely one of the best films covering a wide range of issues.The film starts as ordinary as it can be, and later followed by some strange incidents. Not until meeting with Morpheus and Trinity does Neo realise that he's not in the real world he supposed to be, but in a computer-simulating world. He makes his decision to escape from this artificial reality to fight with the computer, maybe better called a programme.The development of the story is quite smooth and unexpected (of course I haven't read any reviews or plot outlines before I went to the film). The visual effects can be said to be excellent even we see them with the most up-to-date standard. Some classic action scenes are also taken in other films all over the world for so many times. Die-hard marital arts fans may not be well satisfied with the actions (after all they're quite computerised), but I would say it's up to an acceptable standard.The idea of the whole film is kind of abstract through the film, but the central idea to me would be decision-making and beliefs. When something you hear from a stranger is out of your knowledge but seems to be very serious, what will you choose and believe? What can you do with your own power? Do you have the courage to change or fight? The way you live is really in your hands, but the truths in the film may sometimes really terrifying.This first film of the trilogy is surely the most balanced and coherent in the same series as you'll see the failure to handle postmodern ideas afterwards, but if you finish this one, you can't help watching the other two. This is undoubtedly a must-see, even for those who aren't so much into sci-fi, as good films have no boundaries. Just enjoy it!",The Matrix

It's great when you see everyone getting out of the theater thinking if all that they saw was real, not being sure if this world is just a computer generated dream. but I am sure of 3 things: THE MATRIX has a very good story, great characters (specially Agent Smith), and a lot of cool visual effects (the bullet time scared me!) maybe a lot of movie-fans will want to kill me after i write this but... i think THE MATRIX is probably the best successor of the STAR WARS trilogy, after all... the science fiction changes with time.",The Matrix

The real great thing about this movie are not the special effects,neither the story... but the way they used all the elements. They KNEW how to use them, not like DARK CITY or other movies of this kind...
Another thing that bothers me is that people just can't get it... they say the movie is right just because the visual effects or the sound track, but they don't realize that they are watching a great piece of art... made with many different and sometimes ""recycled"" elements.We all have seen this story before, but never like this, I mean, there are two other stories to compare this one to:1) Dark City, The 13th floor or other movies.2) Jesus.So, I ultra highly recommend this movie, and also give you a tip:You should watch all the action scenes and kung-fu fights, then watch the hole movie, You'll feel a very different sensation... the first one is like watching a ""star wars movie type"" (A lot of action, but no plot) and when you watch the hole thing you'll realize that the influence is so big, that the prove of it are all the 2000's action movies.WATCH IT...IT'S ALMOST THE OBLIGATORY MOVIE FOR THE NEW CENTURY",The Matrix

They're quite good. The 3D deciphering scene, as well as the bullets slow-motion are perhaps the most interesting of all.-The brief romantic subplot. It's too brief, too insufficient, but at least made the movie a little less Quake-minded and somewhat more adult.I voted it 6/10.I'd strongly recommend ""The Thirteenth Floor"" (1999, Josef Rusnak) for anybody who wishes to really feel delighted with a plot and concept similar to The Matrix, but far more elaborate, with more drama, more interesting cybernetic twists, more adult, and greater care in the details (click on my name for reading my review).",The Matrix

This movie I gave it 7 Stars and that's being generous. because there's nothing like this movie out today yes you have some movies like The Terminator films but it doesn't come close to this as far as the gaming hacker type reality type movies. Also I'm a man of Faith and vision. this could be the new reality of our world one day if we put our minds our body and our chipsets to the test. maybe one day this could happen in real life. kind of scary if you ask me..... I don't want to go into too much details with this movie but the only thing that makes this movie great_ Stand out like no other is the actors and the special effects_ with no other movie topping what's in the details that you get in this film.....some of the parts are kind of boring and I did skip over some because it starts out kind of boring but towards the middle and end it starts to pick up. I think they should have had more action scenes. you don't really get that much violence or action till the last 30 minutes of the movie.... other than that the last two movies they made really did not compare to this movie and this will be the best matrix movie out till the next one in my opinion... If they keep making remakes and sequels there's not going to be anything left to make except crappy movies that can't out match the original... Come up with a new way to invent sequels and Trinity movies that can outdo the original....other than that I'm not going to spoil anything for you guys .yes it was a decent movie. yes there's nothing else like that out. yes special effects are awesome but was it anything that I would watch it again. noooo. it's a one-time thing.. WOULD I pay for this movie noooo.it does have some pretty good action scenes Towards End. they have some of the best actors in this Movie Yes.... no other movie is out like this Yes.... but it's just missing something if you ask me because again there is a lot of boring scenes and the action scenes do not pick up for a long time in the movie so I probably say the best time to watch this is before bed cuz I would rather turn on Terminator any day and all day before this.....A little disappointing in my books.

1069,SpotMonkee,"The Matrix: Smart, slick, and exciting. Still great after 16 years.",9,19 April 2015,"There are those films that can be considered game-changers in their field. A Trip To The Moon, The Great Train Robbery, The Public Enemy, King Kong, The Godfather, Psycho, The Terminator. While it may be a bit pretentious to put The Matrix with the likes of those masterpieces, I don't think it's that much of stretch. Andy and Lana Wachowski's 1999 flick is one of the best of its kind. A smart, slick sci-fi actioner that helped redefine both of those genres. Suddenly, action movies could be intelligent, have deeper meaning, infuse themselves with unique visual styles and philosophical undertones. I took influences from places rangning from Akira and Ghost in the Shell, to Lewis Carroll's Alice in Wonderland and Plato's Allegory of the Cave, then fashioned them into something new and original. The tale of down-on-his luck hacker-turned-savior of mankind Neo (Keanu Reeves), prophesized to free humanity to from the simulated reality that had become their mental prison, keeping them from seeing the dark post-apocalyptic future ruled over by sentient machine A.I. A film that introduced average movie goers to concepts like simulated reality, showing that popcorn flicks didn't have to be big and dumb. A film that blew our minds with VFX innovations like bullet time, and gave us a taste of that wonderful movie junkfood that is wire fu. A fairly simple story held together by an excellent cast including the likes of Laurence Fishburne, Carrie-Anne Moss, Joe Pantoliano, Gloria Foster, and Hugo Weaving, giving us memorable dialogue and characters that have engrained themselves in the public pop consciousness. It's a movie up there with the likes of Jaws, Die Hard and Star Wars as one of the all time greatest blockbusters, one that could hold its against the likes of the 15-year hyped Phantom Menace and temporarily halting the Star Wars v. Star Trek debate. A highly influential film that's been unsuccessfully copied many times, even by its own sadly average sequels. When one scene (the roof-top bullet dodge) is so popular that it has been copied/parodied nearly 200 times within 4 years, that should tell you how much influence this film had in Hollywood and abroad (a Bollywood remake of The Whole Nine Yards copies the famous lobby shoot-out nearly shot-for-shot).

Anyway, Keanu is playing as a hacker, and there are some scenes in the movie that makes you recall ""Johnny Mnemonic""...but, Keanu soon realizes that everything and everybody that sourrounds him is ...not real! whoa...it is not an everyday kinda deal...What`s more, he finds out that he is the so called ""choosen one"" to save the world...Save it from what?...or from whom?...Well, I am not here to tell you the whole story, but one thing is for sure: you will love this movie, the story, the fights, the special effects...just give it a chance! As far as I am concerned, this movie deserves 10 out of 10...go see it, go buy it but don`t miss it !!!",The Matrix
1076,AVES-2,You HAVE to experience it for yourself!,10,5 November 1999,"The Matrix is, quite frankly, one of the best movies ever made. It is certainly the best big-budget action movie of 1999 and possibly the best film of the entire decade (90s).      Keanu Reeves plays Neo, a mild mannered computer programmer by day, hacker genius by night. He has been consumed by finding Morpheus and uncovering the truth about the Matrix for as long as he can remember. Morpheus is the leader of a rebel force of humans who are trying to expose the truth of the Matrix and battle mega-computers who guard and protect it.      The actors do a great job with their roles, the plot is believable (at least to conspiracy theorists) and not riddled with enough holes for the Titanic to sail (or sink) through, and the special effects are incredible. When it all comes together, you have a basically flawless movie that really entertains.      So how do I describe the Matrix? To quote Morpheus, ""You have to experience it for yourself"".",The Matrix

1078,vindog,Belongs to the pantheon of all time SF classics...a must see for any true SF fan,10,30 March 2000,"One of the true SF classics. This film ironically is the first true Internet driven hit yet it reminds us of the frail boundary between what is real and what is virtual at the turn of the millenium. Intelligent,action packed and true to the genre Matrix forces us to question how we often have come to serve technology rather than have it serve us. As sobering as 2001 and Farenheit 451 with the ethical questions embelematic of both of those classics not to mention the state of the art visual and audio effects.",The Matrix

1080,BBD-3,"Hard to follow, fast moving",8,11 December 1999,"This is such a fast-moving movie that important details tend to be overlooked on the first viewing.  It made much more sense and I picked up a lot of the details necessary to understand this film on the second viewing.  It was certainly worth the time however.  Usually the viewer has some inkling of the reality in the film, even if the actors don't, but this movie keeps the viewers in the dark sometimes--thrilling, frustrating and even confusing the viewer.  An interesting effect, at some points I wondered whether the actors were in the matrix or not, kept me on the edge of my seat.  One only needs to mention in passing the special effects--they are superb.  Watch this one a few times before passing judgment on it.",The Matrix

1082,Yoda Bowman 2001,Review,3,7 June 2000,"I have seen this film quite a few times and every time I want more. It could have been better.I found this film to be quite unintelligent. The characters have no good qualities. The F/X are simply okay. Bullit time as been used countless times before in commercials, music videos, etc. The F/X is NOT new, its NOT groundbreaking, it is simply okay.Now, on to the morals of the film:Why is it that the good guys all wear black and kill the people that they are attempting to save. Why would they kill them? Why could they not explain to the ""Prisoners"" what is going on with the Matrix? Oh, yes, I forgot that this is an unintelligent action film. There is very little substance in the film.I dont see how anyone can find Neo and Trinity good guys. They kill people without thinking twice. The bad guy (Hugo Weaving) has more qualites than Neo and Trinity. He wants something, he wants to be free, to live a life beyond the Matrix. He has more development than the central characters. Also, the bad guys do not kill people without thinking twice. They simply are misunderstood. They are more like police officers, not bad guys. They just want things to run smoothly. Or perhaps, this is what the film makers want. It seems that I am putting more thought into the film than they did.Now, onto the action and direction:The Wachowski brothers are attempting something that has already been done in countless comics and Anime films. It seems as if they are trying to be like John Woo. They make the shoot-out in slow-mo, just like Woo. But they dont have the touch that makes Woo's action look like a ballet (Look at Hard Boiled or MI2). Its simply a mish-mash of nothing.The look of the film does not inspire, it doesnt make you think. It simply looks like its dark and dreary everywhere. Now, dark cinematography can be done very well (Dark City), but for this its just uninspired mish-mash.The film seems to think that the audience as not intelligence. Laurence Fishburne sits there and explains to you the entire plot of the film, it treats us as if we cant think, as if we are part of the matrix and are mindless beings. This is not true, but for this generation, we might need to make an exception.So, in conclusion. I would not really wish this film onto anyone. Its morally wrong, the effects are nothing outstanding, the acting is okay, the plot if not developed. Its just not good. But on the other hand, in the words of the 12-18 year-old kids, ""Its cool."" How wrong they are.3/10",The Matrix
1083,Martin-242,Excellent Movie,10,7 July 2000,"I thought The Matrix was an excellent movie it was the best movie of 1999. It had a lot of action and superb special effects, good acting, and a great script.

Keanu Reeves acting performance here is nearly impeccable and there is no complaints with the acting in this film as there is with the second 3 star wars films. The movie was filled with very creative action but it does not really explain in depth as to what the Matrix is. The movie is just plain weird sometimes, and there are a few scenes that are really just unnecessary. Overall, this is a good movie and it is very rewatchable.",The Matrix

1088,mashby,The movie that started it all...,10,27 February 2004,"The movie that started it all. The Matrix came completely out of the blue. No one had ever heard of the directors, the Wachowski brothers. Their only other movie directorial effort was Bound, which no one ever saw. (Turns out, Bound was simply an audition to prove to the studios that they knew how to direct and could handle the project that was The Matrix). The actors were a mixed bag of good actors (Laurence Fishburne, Joe Pantoliano), bad actors (Keanu Reeves) and then unknown actors (Carrie-Ann Moss and Hugo Weaving). The previews gave nothing away. You were simply left with the question `What Is The Matrix?' and a few images of some very cool action. The only thing I knew at the time was that I HAD to go see the movie the night it was released.Before I go any further, I need to make a confession. I am the target demographic for this movie. As such, my opinion of this movie is biased from the word go. I love video games, I like kung fu, I like science fiction, I like comic books, and I like technology. The one overwhelming mantra of The Matrix is that the Wachowski brothers use everything, pop culture, religion, video games, you name it and blend it all together to make something new. Since they used all the things that I like already, the movie was a wicked cocktail that hooked me from the instant I tasted it. I loved the story, the action, the cinematography, even the acting.Fishburne and Joey Pants are great character actors and I tend to love their work regardless of the film their in. Keanu Reeves is a different story. Other than the Bill & Ted movies, Keanu's acting hasn't been all that good. Johnny Mnemonic was a bomb in no small part thanks to Keanu's lack of skill as an actor. He's stiff, doesn't convey a lot of emotion and his delivery is stilted. His main redeeming quality is that he looks good. All his negatives became positives in the Wachowski's hands. The character of Neo is one where you need someone stiff and emotionless, but looks good as he's kicking butt. Keanu more than fits the bill. This was the role he was meant to play.The story was good, but the storytelling was the hallmark for me. For many people the cinematography was all new to them. Some people had never seen camera angles like they found in the Matrix, but I had in comic books and in Japanese Animation aka anime. In comic books, the method of storytelling is done through still images. Although that may sound somewhat stilted, it can actually give some freedom because each frame and show you more detail, slow things down, or speed things up. If anything it gives you a wide latitude with perspective. Anime takes a similar approach because much of anime is done on such a small budget. For example, one trick that anime uses is to take a still image and have the `camera' move from left to right. This gives the impression of movement, but it's really just a single still image. These tricks created an entire style that anime still uses today even though the budget may be bigger.The Wachowski's came from a comic book background, and one of the things that they were trying to do was bring some of the storytelling style from comic books and anime to the silver screen. Trinity's jump, bullet time, and the fight between Neo and Agent Smith in the subway are all examples of 2d comic book and Japanese anime style that was realized in film. Motion pictures, comic books and animation are all simply mediums to tell a story. The Wachowski brothers blended the styles and blurred the lines between the mediums.The techniques that the director's used in the Matrix changed film as we know it. Hardly any action movie today doesn't use kung fu wire work. Charlie's Angels, The Rundown, and even Le Pacte des Loups all used the fighting style made popular in The Matrix. Star Wars may have been a landmark movie because it changed how science fiction was done, but The Matrix did that and more. The ripple effect of this movie has left it's mark on so many filmakers that it's hard to watch any action or science fiction film and not see touches of The Matrix in them.In 1999 the Wachowski brothers released a landmark film that changed film, and to some extent our culture, forever. It came out of the blue and blew us all away. It would be four years before their story could continue, but it was all worth the wait.",The Matrix

1093,Sternicus,... so what's with the cop killing?,8,26 February 2008,"Don't get me wrong I respect the Matrix as a monumental achievement in film making, but I think it's time to call attention to a aspect of the film that nobody seems to care to mention. It's that the majority of people the 'savoirs' kill in the film are not agents, not machines, not sentinels, but cops. Sure you could right it off just by simply stating what Morpheus pointed out. That as long as they are part of the system that they are a dangerous enemy. But use your compassion people those cops have families, and for every cop killed he leaves behind orphans. Even the Terminator tried his best to make sure there were no casualties when he shot things up- and he's a freaking machine!!! Are we really so cold that we don't care that these cops die? Or maybe it's just the minted glint on the cop uniforms that is put there through careful editing to give the feel that these cops were symbols of authority and oppression that takes away our sympathy for them. Or maybe a lot of people don't like cops because of their pushy no-nonsense attitudes. Even though most of them are brave men who would put their lives on the line for someone they don't even know we still don't feel the need stand up for them. In the lobby shootout scene Trinity can be seen with a smirk on her face after having just mowed down an innocent man. But why should I care? It's just a movie and is there to entertain. And I'll probably watch it again since they play it so often on AMC anyway, I just thought someone should mention this, and that's what I just did.",The Matrix

If you have never seen it you are sure are missing out. 9 out of 10,The Matrix
1095,TheHig,ZZZZZZZ,4,4 June 2003,"I have never fallen asleep at the cinema, but The Matrix is the closest I've ever come to doing so.  Quite frankly, the first hour of this film is the most boring hour of film ever.Keanu Reeves cannot act, neither can Laurence Fishburne, Carrie Ann Moss doesn't do much better.  The whole thing is too dark, and let's be honest: If you've seen the trailer, you don't need to see the film, as it shows you all the special effects there anyway.I've been more disappointed by other films, but I fail to see how this uninspiring and badly acted mess is hailed so much by fans.  Any old fool can string together a series of special effects, the trick is to link them with a good story and enjoyable characters.  The Matrix does neither.
I'll admit it picks up a bit in the second half, but I was so completely and utterly appalled by the first hour, no amount of bullet time, however impressive, can save this film.My Rating: 4/10",The Matrix
1096,horseygurlz,Fantastic - A must-watch film,10,26 June 2011,"This movie has got to be one of the best films ever made. It has it all - great characters, good actors, plenty of action and incredible special effects. The plot is brilliant - everyone is living inside a computer programme so nothing is actually real? You would need a superb director, great actors and a bucket load of fantastic special effects to carry that off. However, this film manages it brilliantly. One of my favourite scenes is when Neo stops the bullets dead in front of him - absolutely legendary. The stunts in this movie are breathtaking, and despite how unrealistic the plot is, you find yourself wanting to believe it! This is one of the films that everyone has to see at least once in their lives - no matter what their taste in film is. A definite ten out of ten.",The Matrix
1097,notoriousCASK,Welcome to the Real World.,10,11 April 2018,"Without a doubt one of the best and most influential movies of all time, the Matrix is the defining science fiction film of the 1990's and the biggest leap the genre has taken since Stanley Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odyssey and Ridley Scott's Blade Runner. The Matrix is a ground-breaking motion picture that not only raised the bar for all the science-fiction films to come after it but also redefined the action genre with its thrilling action sequences and revolutionary visual effects.The film tells the story of Thomas Anderson a computer hacker that in the world of hacking goes by the alias of Neo. When he is contacted by the mysterious outlaw Morpheus and having always questioned his reality, he is awakened to the truth that the world he's been living in is a simulated reality called the Matrix and that he's nothing more than a slave in this dystopian world, created and controlled by A.I powered machines.The direction and script by the Wachowskis is fantastic, as they drew ideas and inspirations from every other great sci-fi and cyberpunk movie and anime before the film, combining it with stunning action and putting it into one picture that has enough style, substance and subtext that everyone ended up giving their own interpretation of the story. The research that went into the preparation of the screenplay is quite extensive but the manner in which it is presented on the big screen is also very impressive. Every character presented on the film, has a well-defined arc and a purpose, and their motivations are clear.The cinematography is impeccable. It was very innovative in the use of the camera angles and movements, the zooms, the slow-motion captures and the different color palette used to differentiate the Matrix and the real World. The editing is flawless, as it makes sure that every scene is integral to the story and ensures the pace of the film stays ferocious through its entire runtime. Each frame is also packed with so much visual information for the viewer to devour. The visual effects introduced us to the bullet-time effect and their impact can still be felt in today's movies. The performances are also incredible. Each member of the cast gave their best performances and brought the characters they portray to life, but the one that stands out the most is Hugo Weaving's disciplined rendition of his character, Agent Smith; a powerful computer program made to search and destroy the human rebellion, in undoubtedly the greatest performance in his career.In conclusion The Matrix is a masterpiece everyone should see. It is one of the most thought provoking, inventive, pioneering, influential and stylish movies of all time and it's also full of philosophical and religious allegories waiting for interpretation. Immortal for its contribution to cinema and pop culture, its brilliant combination of inventive visual effects, excellent vision and exquisite action easily makes it one of the best, most influential and most entertaining movies ever made.",The Matrix
1098,mark-1206,Finally in 4K!,10,24 May 2018,"My favourite ever movie and finally available in UHD/4K.Just re-watched in 4K and on an OLED and it has lost nothing and hasn't really dated.The cast whilst in the Matrix are the ultimate in cool. The lobby scene whilst rescuing Morpheus in particular. The pacing is extremely well-judged and its a roller-coaster of lows and highs which keeps you guessing right until the end.Once the plot moves to the rescue of Morpheus there's the fantastic lobby scene with amazing moves and music all the way through and the sequence ends with the ride on the elevator cable, again ultra cool. Great acting by Hugo Weaving when he ""disconnects"" and tells Morpheus what he really thinks of the Matrix.We get the bullet-time and helicopter sequence where we see the first flashes of what Neo can do and then we lead into the fantastic subway fight with Agent Smith.Then there's the chase sequence and Neo's apparent death and the imminent overrun of the ship. Trinity's impassioned speech and kiss revives Neo and from then on I defy anyone not to be moved by Neo's ""awakening"". The final scene where Neo warns the AI what is coming and then launches like a rocket is the icing on the cake - just fantastic. I still love this movie (obviously!).",The Matrix

I last had that feeling during the Usual Suspects and L.A. Confidential. Maybe I've just got a thing for brilliant noir-action fusion, but this movie is a winner.

1103,Wolfie-9,Your Mind is all in Reality is all in your Mind.,9,20 March 2000,"Science fiction movies have taken their next great step forwards.It's just as much a horror movie as it is science fiction... but it's horror that's much different from the usual hack 'n slash.Great performances, great script, great plot.  From the moment the movie begins until the very end, you're going to wonder what is real and what is not... which is the whole intent.The visual effects are stunning, and while the plot is nothing original, ""The Matrix"" takes it to the next level.  If you didn't see it in the theater then the video isn't going to do it complete justice - I'd advise you to see it on DVD if possible, on widescreen tape if not... you'll want to get the full effect.Considering the plot and the theme of the movie, it's pure poetry that one of the groups on the soundtrack is Rage Against The Machine (they also did a song for ""The Crow"")... and the rest of the soundtrack is just as good. (Okay, if your usual tastes are The Carpenters or Beethoven then you probably won't be interested in the soundtrack)Wonderful performances by everyone involved, especially Keanu Reeves, Laurence Fishburne, Carrie-Anne Moss, Hugo Weaving, and Joe Pantoliano. The cast blends well, and they're all believeable.*************** SPOILER WARNING *************** *************************************************The only thing that would have made this 100% freaky instead of just 99% would be if, at the end on the ship, Neo had reached up and unplugged himself from the Matrix.Once you realize that as the Matrix is all in your mind, then you realize that anything at all is possible... 'regular' people will be able to morph just as the Sentinels do, (I presume the name ""Sentinel"" is a nod towards the X-Men... one 'future history' of that comic has people enslaved in camps, with giant robot Sentinels tracking down and taking out any rebels) and that nothing is impossible - being able to fly is merely one way that reality has no hold.One thing that bothered me slightly is the fact that the Sentinel program calling itself ""Agent Smith"" showed emotion... that's a glandular response not possible in a program.  On the other hand, emotional reactions can be programmed in... anything can be.What is reality?  Whatever you want it to be.  Read through the Trivia section for this movie and you'll see a whole bunch of Christian references, with ""The One"" as Jesus Christ, the Savior.  You could also say that when Neo realizes what it all is, that he has acheived a state of nirvana, and is ""one with everything"" (hold the onions)... at that point, he *is* the Matrix, and the Matrix is him.Enough philosophy.  You either enjoyed this movie or you didn't - and if you did enjoy it, you probably think it's one of the best around... because this movie has power.  It doesn't force anything down your throat, but lets you discover it for yourself - and you'll probably enjoy that immensely.",The Matrix
1104,The One,Kick ass movie! A must see!,10,11 April 1999,"As soon as I saw the ad for this film I began counting down the days until its release. I also managed to catch a two second glance at the web address on the ad. The page then proceeded to take up all my time up until the film was released. The webpage was good in not giving away anything, and I highly recommend the comics based on the Matrix universe, and comments can be entered in the forum, which has degenerated into a chat session discussing the movie...That was until I saw the movie - despite the fact that I saw it in a slightly less than good cinema, even though I tried to get to a good one - I was blown away, I knew the special effects would be good - but the Wachowski-dubbed ""bullet-time photography"" (the slow motion bits - actually a little more complicated than slo-mo) - was stunning. The storyline had me hooked from the moment I read about it on the webpage. The only fault of the movie, and I hate to say there was a fault, was the cliché-only-way-to-save-the-hero, which I think could have been replaced with something a lot more enlightening and inventive. Otherwise I wanted to be part of the Matrix. I wanted to be in the world, understand the code, _manipulate_ the code. Superb - I can't wait for the sequel (obviously there will be one). I hope someone makes an rpg fast.Casting was amazing - especially Lawrence Fishburne (I want his shades!!), he fits the role right down to his voice - I can't think of a better person to play the role of Morpheus. Keanu Reeves proves himself to be a good actor after all, doing a really good job of looking confused - then realising what is going on around him. All the minor actors are superb, fitting their roles snugly.Anyway - for anyone who is going to watch this movie - go into it prepared to think fast - to keep up with the storyline.... if you don't - the agents will be able to move faster. which will probably result in your dislike of the film and consequent bad reviews to your friends.10/10/10.",The Matrix
1105,Chris-361,AWESOME!,10,5 April 1999,"This film is one of the best I have seen!  I had no idea that Andy Wachowski and Larry Wachowski could make such high-quality sci-fi cinema!  Not only does The Matrix have a truly inventive plot and amazing special effects, but it has other factors that make it so good.  One of the things few people might not notice is their (the film makers') great attention to detail, especially in reflections!  There are times when there are close-ups of Lawrence Fishburne and when he looks directly at the camera, you don't see crew, camera, equipment or anything.  Another aspect that makes this film such a marvel is the great usage of slow motion.  One of the best scenes in the whole movie is when Neo and Trinity are shooting the SWAT team in the limestone corridor of a skyscraper.  The brilliant slow motion shows debris flying everywhere and really makes you feel like you are part of the action.This is the first film in a long time where I have seen the audience clap at a scene!

No one is going to emerge from this movie with a much deeper view of life or anything.It's hard to root for Keanu Reeves, whose choppy pace can interrupt any good story for me, but it's undeniable that he pulls this one off. Everyone who usually holds their nose and steers clear of a project because he's in it, go ahead and go.Personally, I wasn't too thrilled with the dialogue or the other performances, and the soundtrack did most definitely suck.

It is, if taken in its primal essence, an unsurpassed paranoia movie.  However, as anyone who plays the game Mage: The Ascension can attest:  It was good to see those Virtual Adepts giving those uppity Technocrats a good beat-down!

The first half of the movie was awful and we found absolutely no reason for it being made except for special effects. The story was somewhere between inane and non-existent. The second half was exciting and continued the non-existent story line. I guess there was a story of sorts but it was stupid. Probably the WORST movie we've seen in many, many years.",The Matrix

The feeble attempt to cover an extremely thin plot by dazzling the audience with special effects ALMOST works; there just wasn't enough surprise since they gave it all away in the commercials. If you're looking for well-rounded characters, you will be disappointed. They are as flat as the plot. Fishburne does a great job in his role, but the long-winded speeches and monotone expression will put you to sleep. The last 25 minutes or so gave 'The Matrix' a breath of fresh air; wonderful action. If you fell asleep from the first 90 minutes, you will be awake then.  Many people saw that last 25 minutes and thought the film was great because of just that. I, however, believe it takes much more than a few special effects to earn my $6.50. At least at the show I saw, I was one of the majority; it seemed like more people disliked it than enjoyed it. If you have $6.50 and 2 hrs to spare, and if the Cable is out, go see 'The Matrix' ... otherwise, wait for the video.",The Matrix

Is it what you can fell, taste or smell?? What if I wake up in the morning and go to work? is it still a dream? All these questions are what The Matrix deals with. Are we living what is real?? or are we controlled by another being that is manipulating our lives for it's own good??""The Matrix is the world that has been pulled over your eyes to hide you from the truth."" ""What truth??"" Says Neo. Well that is for you to find out in this epic motion picture. The movie outlines the story of a computer programmer named Thomas Anderson who is at nights a hacker named Neo. Neo is always looking around for a thing known as The Matrix until one day he is called to meet Triniti who will show him all that he needs to know.It's not just a chip-off-the-block high octane action, it has humor in it and some drama if you want to call it that way. You can classify it no better than ""Forget everything you know and seen"". They got that right. I usually happen to spit out one-liners at some scenes to what eventually will be the thing the actors will say. It worked in The Mummy, but not here. I tried a few times but given up when I saw I just wasn't getting it right, they made it completely new and thrilling.Some said that the special effects in The Mummy will blow you away.  Well, I guess in The Mummy they only used a simple pump shot gun because here it's freaking C-4. It's totally amazing how they did everything look so to the point and reliable.And as a conclusion I can only say this: What would you think if someone would come up to you one day and say that nothing is real, it doesn't exist and you have to make it all better?

The most chilling thing about the movie to me, is that I've been thinking of a concept like this since i learned what dreaming is.  I've always had an idea or a feeling that we aren't who we think we are.  Maybe we are just somebody's dream world  and we know it but we don't want to become reality.  Who is really watcing over us.  As for neo's idea of fate I have my own spin on it.  neo Belives that there is no fate, because he doesn't like the idea of his entire life being planned out for him and he has no control.  My idea of fate, is that there is one made for you but you can choose to take the path and be a good little pawn or you can take the other path and  see how far you can run befor there is a new fate made for you.  Personally me,  I'm running the life out of me and that's why i don't run in PE class.  I need to get away from fate, befor fate gets to me.",The Matrix

At that was just what the directors needed to help their pretensions of making something much more important than a movie and they haven't done too bad a job.  The great thing is that they haven't forgotten the need to be entertaining, too.The special effects are fantastic, the characterisations memorable (especially Hugo Weaving's Mr Smith), and the action spectacular, but sometimes the pacing drags a little bit.The story line is intriguing and definitely sets you thinking about the greater implications of the story line (Christian parallels are many and well-constructed).

The character development is virtually non-existant, the acting is weak, and their are non plot twists that cannot be spotted a mile ahead.  The only reason this film is praised so much is because of the martial arts sequences and the effects i.e. the famous slow-motion bullet shots.  But the fact remains that this is a poor effort.  There is no outstanding reason to see this movie; there is no great acting.  The story is intriguing to sci-fi fans at first, but later on boils down to cliches and shootouts.  The ending is a cop-out just so more sequels can be milked out.  If you want to see a great futuristic sci-fi film, see The 13th Floor.  You will notice the plot is very similar to that of The Matrix, except it is much more inventful about it, much better executed, and the ending will leave you thinking for months afterwards.

This is a good one. The Matrix is not just about a future of man made paradise through technology. This is about our reality. This is a film about our perception of our «state of the art human civilization» reality, about the substance of personal satisfaction in mass consumption, about the futility of our very notion of success, about the rewards of social inclusion against the it's taxation on our will, resistance and submission. Further from confronting us with the fear of loss of our self-control, self-purpose and self-respect, this film confronts us with very real and present questions about our consciousness of what we are and want to be; our awareness of our role in the lubrication of this very society we live in, and it's utility; We all know we are part of a whole, or is it a hole? Or the whole we want? This film takes us beyond the now traditional «machines rule the world» theme. It's not just the «just what You think You're doing Dave?» sort of question, it's about what baby are You feeding. The man versus machine argument is here magisterially treated and suggests an even more metaphoric insight on our present world. A world that we have already created.

1129,atomicblue,"A visually breathtaking, interesting but ultimately flawed film.",7,4 June 2003,"Put it down to the fact that the Internet is ruled by thinking-type computer nerds or the fact that many people are willing to accept the merits of a movie based on its face value, but I really didn't believe that The Matrix was quite worthy of being ranked as the #33 best movie of all time. Granted, it was very good, but there were essentially a couple of glaring weaknesses I perceived that made the movie, for me, a very good sci-fi futuristic romp, and not a truly great one. Aside from that, I don't see how a movie like this could rank above certain other explorations of perception and the fragile nature of reality. To name a few (released either before or after this movie), you have the likes of Vanilla Sky, eXistenZ and Dark City. Granted, these movies all approached similar themes in a slightly different way, and none of them were terribly similar to The Matrix in terms of their presentation, but such films offer a much richer platter of food for thought.I don't think I need to go into depth as to what The Matrix is about: Neo is 'The One' (a staple term in sci-fi and fantasy flicks), a person who is seemingly capable of defeating the collective computer-induced hallucination known as The Matrix, a program which is apparently responsible for giving most humans an illusion of a life - one which is nothing more than a flexible computer program.It's a relatively original concept, but unfortunately it doesn't get the exploration it deserves here. For the most part, the meditations on the nature of the life we take for granted as real are reduced to being a vehicle for the special effects, when it would have been much better had it been the other way around.Speaking of special effects, however, it's worth noting that those in The Matrix are still to this day the best you're likely to see. Creative, stylistic and used to great effect without being in complete excess, this is a movie that is meant to be experienced in the cinemas. Or, since the movie was released several years ago, via a nice home theatre/surround sound setting.This movie comes highly recommended (sorry if it sounded like I was completely panning it earlier). Just remember that while the movie raises some interesting questions and offers a true feast for the eyes, there's not really enough going on beneath the surface to satisfy the more demanding movie-goers.Grade: B+",The Matrix

Star Wars was good because of the depth of characters and the richness in story but the matrix more than equals this and has so much more as well. There are too many things i liked about this film for me to write here so i'll just say this. If you havent seen this film, GO AND SEE IT NOW.

Would we live in a matrix style alternate reality where we could have more control over our everyday existence and have control over other people or would there be a big fat nothing. The acting is superb and the storytelling enjoyable.This doesn't preach to the viewer yet sets its message out in pure and simple terms. How many of us have wondered if we didn't have a planet earth to exist on what would there be? Would we exist in some other form? This film attempts to answer these questions and maybe it attempts to pose some questions too. It is very sharply observed by the Wachowski brothers and has many fans across the globe.

It is not the expertly-done camera work. It is not the breath-taking special effects and the perfect timing and general craftsmanship. All this helps, of course, but what makes Matrix so brilliant is that the story is actually creative. It raises philosophical questions, the most important one being ""what is reality?"". The actors do their part to make the story believable enough, so that one really does not want to this film to end, ever.Of course there are also goofs of some sort. The reason for the very existence of ""The Matrix"" for example is quite silly, from a physical point of view.

I recommend you to see Ghost in the shell and read Gun Smith Cats beforehand.  I believe the director loves Japanimation and Kung-fu movies.",The Matrix
1148,Blake_Petit,GO IN COLD!,10,5 April 1999,"To anyone who hasn't seen ""The Matrix"" who is thinking about it, I urge you, go in completely cold. Don't allow yourself to know a THING about the plot before you watch it, you'll lose the impact if you do. The special effects are great, the action sequences are cool, and the acting is sharp. But to really APPRECIATE ""The Matrix,"" you can't let yourself know what the story is beforehand. The trailers for this movie are perfect -- they let you see the eye candy without telling you what's going on: all you need to know before you watch it. Just remember what Morpheus says in the trailer: ""Nobody can be told what the Matrix is."" Go in, watch it and prepare to get blown away. Keanu Reeves has come a VERY long way since his days as Ted Theodore Logan. Between this, ""The Devil's Advocate"" and ""Speed,"" I think he's shown that he is a major player in Hollywood. Laurence Fishburne is great as the ""Jedi master"" character who's responsible for Keanu's transformation into a hero, and Carrie-Anne Moss is not only cute, but capable of kicking some serious butt in her own right. If you go to the movies for action or special effects, check out ""The Matrix."" Warner Bros is finally starting to make good movies again.",The Matrix

If there are still people saying that human beings are the masters of machines, then this person is either ignorant or arrogant. What is the master without the master of the servant?With the development of human society to this day, every individual is increasingly emphasizing self-realization and self-worth, but at the same time, they are increasingly inseparable from machines and others. Isn't this a profound contradiction? On the one hand, it is the inner self-protrusion, on the other hand, the survival situation is highly assimilated by the material and the machine. This is the characteristic of contemporary people.What is the future of mankind?

If you like Applebees, happy hours, and live in a high priced housing development, then you'll like this movie. For me it was incomprehensible middle class mayhem. This movie seems to pander to the idea that machines are the problem instead of belief in machines.

1159,HulotderSpeiler,An Actually Great Film,9,6 March 2010,"I was hesitant to approach this film, as it seemed like a pointless, overblown action film. Maybe it is all that, but it is also a great film, and perhaps the most important film since The Battleship Potemkin. It has a deceptively simple plot. Just another apocalyptic robot rebellion. Still, it not only draws on biblical and mythological stories, but it creates the fascinating concept of the Matrix. It blurs reality lines between the various worlds in play, and uses all the implications of artificial reality to its advantage in great visual innovation. The Matrix used CGI and bullet-time in never-before-seen ways that have already become clichéd. It came at the end of a 20-year innovation starved era of film, and shocked the world with something new. Who could forget Neo and Smith diving at each other, their guns blazing? Who could forget Neo leaning backwards, dodging bullets, sharing the screen with objects moving at impossible speeds, but somehow making us forget that they were bullets? Perhaps most stunning of all: who could forget Neo, to Uzis blazing, straight in front of him, as he runs, cloak trailing, through a hell of flying tiles and marble as untold numbers of bullets fly around him? These unforgettable moments are the excuse for such overblown action. Finally, it is worth mentioning that this film has one of the most perfect villains ever to grace the screen. A demented but calm, crazed but intelligent, ruthless but calculated agent known as Smith laughs, yells, and taunts his way through his great lines filled with pregnant pauses. A perfect villain for a messiah of a hero.",The Matrix
1160,Lemniscate433,Mind-bending experience...,8,26 July 2009,"I remember when I was young and this movie came out, everybody was quoting the Matrix moves. The dodging bullets, running up walls, or just plain stylized jumping. But what they did not know is the science behind that. And, yeah, there is a science behind that according to this excellent movie.In this movie, Thomas Anderson has two lives: your average man that programs software for a large company. Then there is Neo, one of the most powerful and skillful hackers known to man. But then Mr. Anderson gets a phone call from a man named Morpheus who tells him that he is the ""one"" in another world. So when Neo joins Morpheus on this quest to this other world, a lot of explanation comes about which I will explain in as simple terms as possible.In the Earth that you are presently at right now, according to the movie, is not the real world and that the real world is somewhere out there in an unclassified location. In this movie, where Neo, Morpheus, Trinity, and a bunch of the other characters are located is in the real world: the Matrix. And in this Matrix, a lot of cool things can happen and the reason why these cool things can happen is because the Matrix allows your mind to become free and to do whatever you want. For example, you can believe yourself to run up the walls; you can believe that you can dodge a bullets. All these things that humans in the fake world cannot do is possible in the Matrix, but only if you believe. Now try imaging this guy who was living the fake world for about twenty plus years and suddenly trying to get used to believing in doing things. Because while Neo does not understand what is going on, you are along on the ride with him. When you do watch this film: you must listen attentively to everything that Morpheus says. The reason is because later on, you will need what Morpheus says to understand what is going on.For one thing, the way this film was created was beyond excellent. The visual effects had a meaning and almost a purpose in this film. It was not there to make some cool show. They were there to break down the steps to how someone can run up walls or dodge bullets. The slow motion that was used was also very well done. I thought that the slow-motion was actually going to ruin the movie like Zack Synder does to his movies. But the slow-motion enhanced the film incredibly and gave scenes a certain kind of stylistic element that entices you. I was also very much drawn into the concept of the whole film because although there was a lot of action in this movie, a good portion of the movie was also a lot of philosophy that connected to the world we live in right now.And already I see that this movie has become a classic because films today like Wanted, Watchmen, 300 and many other action films use the Matrix as a guideline to there own visual beauty, even though those three films do not come close to what the Matrix is. This movie is the birth of some of the finest visual art/filming and basic elements of science-fiction I have ever seen. Even to this day, ten years later, it still looks gorgeous.Maybe if the movie was more intense and was less to appeal younger kids, I would have given this movie a low 9. But I will give this movie a high 8.",The Matrix
1161,liano123,The Matrix (1999),10,23 May 2014,"he Matrix is a 1999 American science fiction action film written and directed by The Wachowski Brothers, starring Keanu Reeves, Laurence Fishburne, Carrie-Anne Moss, Hugo Weaving, and Joe Pantoliano. It depicts a dystopian future in which reality as perceived by most humans is actually a simulated reality called ""the Matrix"", created by sentient machines to subdue the human population, while their bodies' heat and electrical activity are used as an energy source. Computer programmer ""Neo"" learns this truth and is drawn into a rebellion against the machines, which involves other people who have been freed from the ""dream world"".The Matrix is known for popularizing a visual effect known as ""bullet time"", in which the heightened perception of certain characters is represented by allowing the action within a shot to progress in slow- motion while the camera's viewpoint appears to move through the scene at normal speed. The film is an example of the cyberpunk science fiction genre.[4] It contains numerous references to philosophical and religious ideas, and prominently pays homage to works such as Plato's Allegory of the Cave,[5] Jean Baudrillard's Simulacra and Simulation[6] and Lewis Carroll's Alice's Adventures in Wonderland.[7] The Wachowskis' approach to action scenes drew upon their admiration for Japanese animation[8] and martial arts films, and the film's use of fight choreographers and wire fu techniques from Hong Kong action cinema was influential upon subsequent Hollywood action film productions.The Matrix was first released in the United States on March 31, 1999, and grossed over $460 million worldwide. It was generally well-received by critics,[9][10] and won four Academy Awards as well as other accolades including BAFTA Awards and Saturn Awards. Reviewers praised The Matrix for its innovative visual effects, cinematography and its entertainment. The film's premise was both criticized for being derivative of earlier science fiction works, and praised for being intriguing. The action also polarized critics, some describing it as impressive, but others dismissing it as a trite distraction from an interesting premise.Despite this, the film has since appeared in lists of the greatest science fiction films,[11][12][13] and in 2012, was added to the National Film Registry for preservation.[14] The success of the film led to the release of two feature film sequels, both written and directed by the Wachowski Brothers, The Matrix Reloaded and The Matrix Revolutions. The Matrix franchise was further expanded through the production of comic books, video games, and animated short films in which the Wachowskis were heavily involved",The Matrix
1162,swansongang,A wasted plot...,2,17 June 2005,"There are many fans of the Matrix movies out there. Die-hard, weirdo, and theological. Agents, all of them.I must say that this movie did not impress. The main theory, the central story plot of the computer simulation being the real world, was the only thing that kept this movie from being discarded into the rubbish bin. The effects, hailed as amazing, did not fully impress. There was too much foul mouth, immorality, and otherwise HUMANITY'S WASTE PITS on screen. Violence was extreme--and unnecessary. The entire story could have been turned into a magnificent three-hour movie with excellent dialogue, scenery, depth, and other aspects that make a good movie. Instead, it was all mashed into a sludge of action and destruction and basic hatred of other people. It was disgusting. Furthermore, the acting was abominable. Look at it closely, with the hatred given to Star Wars by so many envious people, and you will see that Keanu Reeves makes Hayden Christenson look like an Oscar winner.My opinion. And I hope that you agree. The movie could have been much better, much more interesting. Not to mention, the final shot kind of destroyed the end...I cracked up there, laughing hysterically.

Words cannot define how great this movie is! This was the greatest movie of the Millennium in my opinion--or at least the greatest action movie. It took me four years until after this movie came out to actually sit down and watch it. OK, some people who watch this probably sit down through the first half hour and get bored, you're supposed to watch the whole movie. Once you get to the kung fu fighting later on, this movie will not let you go. This movie is the most spoofed, most ripped off (though this movie takes lots of stuff itself), and in fact is the most inspirational film ever.Let's start off with the plot. In the future mankind celebrates over their on creations, which are machines and AI. Machines become slaves and revolt, a war starts, and the machines win of course. You really didn't think humans would win did you? So in return every surviving human on the planet is placed inside of a huge computer system called The Matrix which is an artificial dream world. Some time after wards, a man actually gets free and starts freeing people. Our movie starts with Trinity (Carrie Ann Moss) struggling to escape the grasp of agents which are sentient programs meant to keep people like us in line.So after she escapes, it turns into a battle for Trinity and the wise black dude of this movie Morpheus (Laurence Fishburne) to find Neo (Keanu Reeves) and free him from the Matrix before the agents get him. From here, I'll let you watch. This movie is one that you have to watch twice to get everything. Plot rocks.Action scenes. Oh, if you say they are lame you should be neutered so your perfectionist genes can't contaminate the population. All of the fight scenes are well delivered by Yuen Wo Ping in this film. The addition of guns in this movie worked well too. All I can say is they rocked.Acting. OK, acting is good. Sometimes it's a little cheesy, but every scifi movie needs it. Keanu Reeves has more energy in this movie rather than his monotone non inspired voice in the sequels.This movie was well delivered in terms of mixing plot with action. It had the cool scifi plot, so when we got to see the action it felt like a big reward. This movie is a must see for action fans or scifi fans--or even movie fans in general.

Hugo Weaving is the perfect villain, slithery and mean, the fighting sequences are among the best ever to be made outside of Hong Kong, the visuals are astounding. But what is most important: it still held my attention the fifth time. There are a lot of great films that are still pretty good a second or even a third time.

I'm not going to touch base on the plot, but it is something that has never been in any movie that I've ever heard of. The Matrix is laden with seamless special effects and the best camera angles in a movie to date. Bullet's cartridges pour over the tops of the camera lenses, shells are clearly shown being released from the side of the guns, and those are just a few of the great camera angles. Plus...the action sequences. The fight sequences, gunfights, explosions, and chase scenes are all done with a precision that is rarely achieved in any movie today. They all contain genuine intensity, originality, and perfect choreography. For an action movie, it's a long film, but the running time goes unnoticed. There are some plot holes, but not any considerable ones. At the beginning, some of the performances were a little bland, by the thirty minute mark of the movie, the entire cast is at their best. This movie tops off Terminator 2, Lethal Weapon, Die Hard and John Woo's 1989 classic ""The Killer"" as the best action movie of all time. The only thing that has a chance at beating it this year is Star Wars: Episode 1.",The Matrix
1168,PeeJay,Hard to be original....,7,30 December 2000,"Now that we have had the pioneering-stages of film-making, and passed through the first stages of computer-animation and graphics creating the illusion of another world within the one we live in, life and movies could have become exciting. But in fact the results are pretty disappointing. Hollywood bores us almost to death with re-makes and re-makes of re-makes and the results are almost consistently worse than the originals which at least, but certainly not only, had the profits of being original. This case isn't much different. The producers should be given credit in creating a fantasy and doing it convincingly, as well as doing a good job on dealing with some of the special effects and stunts. Fighting scenes are not too bad either, but lack involvement, and could very rarely be called exciting. This makes the Matrix certainly not a thriller or good action movie. In this way the Matrix is disappointing due to a weak plot, a badly told story that suffers from a lack of story-telling abilities, involvement, surprise and continuity. This movie could make a nice prequel to a series, but a lot needs to be done to really make this a success: better and deeper characters, a good story-line, a more realistic view of mankind, better directing and more involvement with characters and less attention drawn on special effects could make the sequels a good start for a new kind of sci-fi movies. The cast seems good enough, and should not be blamed for the way the story evolves in this movie; one only gets the idea, certainly after having seen the extras on the dvd and 'the making of'-documentary the attention of the directors and producers was drawn almost totally towards the 'Kung-fu' and special effects this way creating a life-like comic-book sci-fi movie. Some involvement of George Lucas could do a lot of good to this movie, even if only consulting him on creating and telling stories. But he certainly would not have been proud of this movie if the result would be this disappointing on so many points. Referring to the beginning of this comment, the Matrix is hugely overrated, but over-looking the releases of the last few years this should not be a surprise... people are not exactly spoiled with good movies, and if trying to be original could be rewarded, this movie should earn an award for maybe a not fully successful, but at least one of the most successful attempts to be original of the last few years. Maybe only exceeded by the largely underrated 'Dark City'.",The Matrix
1169,Mike-489,So if reality is actually real.... what is & why?,10,24 June 1999,"This is terrific fun, the last time a picture had this effect upon me it was Star Wars back in the 1970s.I didn't find the storyline as convoluted as some claim & soon got the hang of what was going on. Basically it plays to every teenager's feeling that reality is somehow flawed & that they can just perceive this, not from the outside, but right on the edge. The Matrix takes that to fantastical extremes.The special effects are superb & the violence graphic. This is the first time I've ever seen a true representation of what a rifle bullet will do to scenery for a start! But don't let that distract you & certainly don't go to see it just for the effects, there's a staggeringly good plot in there too.All the actors are well chosen, with what must be a first, Keanu Reeves proving he can act. It's good to see him a in decent part like this, the best he's played since Bill & Ted's Bogus Journey. Lawrence Fishburn is always a bit wooden for me, but he's perfected his persona & plays it for all he has which fits this film like a glove. With the support of Carrie Anne Moss sex oozes from all the lead actors. This is a very well thought out series of images, even the bad guys are cool, have depth & interest.There's little doubt that the action sequences have been heavily influenced by the likes of John Woo & his contemporaries in the Hong Kong school of direction. It could have been rather over the top & might have dominated things, but it's well pitched & adds to the mix just right.There's little to fault the plot, although the story rather skips any explanation of why Reeves is ""The One"" this is understandable. Also anyone who knows about the Second Law of Thermodynamics may object to the explanation of how the humans are kept fed by the machines, since it's a cold world with no sun by the look of it. But these are very, very minor points.Overwhemingly this is a staggeringly good film, it has plot, style, sexyness, good effects & gripping action. For your dollar or your pound, this has to be the bargain of the year, giving far more in one sitting than all the others I've seen this year.Only one question remains. Was it a good thing to release humans from the Matrix? After all it's possibly humans that screwed up the world environment in the first place. Inside the Matrix they still live in the comfort of the late 20th Century, oblivious to the suffering & struggle that would await them in the real world of 2199 ad.

1171,CJCraft,"It has great acting, great sets, great action, great themes, great sound, and most importantly a great story.",9,5 November 1999,"I gave this movie a 9 out of 10.This has to be one of the best science fiction movies I have ever seen. It has great acting, great sets, great action, great themes, great sound, and most importantly a great story. Background:I am a 24 year old male engineering and computer science student living in SC. I do have a large humanities background.Overview:This review will be hard to do, since I don't want to reveal anything to you. This is one of those movies where you want to find out everything for yourself, like The Sixth Sense. But I can tell you this is an outstanding masterpiece of the science fiction genre. It will definitely be a classic for a long time.The level of detail is amazing. For example, they went through the entire movie and filtered out a lot of the blue and changed it to green. Blue is too happy of a color they said. All of the sets have extreme levels of detail. It is almost to the point like in one of the Star Trek movies the screws on the Klingon weapons had little Klingon symbols cut out of them to screw them in even though nobody would ever be able to tell. That's the level of detail we are talking about here.The sound is incredible. I got the DVD version and got to listen to it in Dolby Digital Surround sound and it was almost as good as when I saw it at the theaters in THX. If you have a good home theater system then I recommend this DVD to put it through the paces for you. It really shows off the range and power of Dolby Digital Surround sound.Not only are the sets and audio full of great detail but the story is to. The Matrix explains why some people has special powers like being able to lift and move objects with their minds. It also has an explanation for deja vu. There are also little gems stuck in the story itself. See if you notice when Morpheus (the greek god of dreams, see...) asks the traitor to give him his phone, so he can call the operator, how he stalls until someone else gives up their phone instead, because he threw his in the trash. There are lots of these see how many you can find in the first viewing.The movie opens up with a great intense female action scene. You just don't get to see enough women kicking butt these days. The guys always get to have all the fun. But not in this movie. The women can give it out with the best of 'em.I love the special effects. The ship is great. The power plants are great. The sewer city is great. The sentinels are great. The ""bugs"" are great. The ""bug"" extractor is great. Bullet Time is great. The agents are great. The oracle is great. It really is just a great movie...The best thing about the movie is it is very human. It really isn't about the violence, or the fancy gadgets, or the special effects. It is about the future. It is about us. It is about our will to survive and to make up for and overcome our mistakes. It is about fighting for what is right and to fight the good fight. It is about truth. It is about being real. It is about caring. You will really start to care for this group of rebels.When you take all of the violence, and fancy gadgets, and special effects away from Star Wars, you still have a great story that almost everyone loves. And this movie works the same way.Be sure to check out my other reviews.Thanks.",The Matrix
1172,sisyphus-8,Action movie trying to be deep,8,5 July 1999,"What's there to say that hasn't been said? The effects are spectacular, the visuals are very stylish, and the premise might even be considered original (in Hollywood terms, at least).I had a few problems with this, though. Keanu Reeves, as usual, was terribly unconvincing as the hacker Neo (see lines, ""Whoa!"" and ""I know kung fu!""), and Hugo Weaving was laughably bad as Agent Smith. Parts such as the fight between Neo and Morpheus (Fishburne) are amusing, but don't need to be there, and they ruin the feel of the rest of the movie. I was also disappointed as it became a total action flick in the last few minutes. In these scenes, it seemed as though the concept of the Matrix was just a vehicle to allow Keanu Reeves to look slick and shoot things. Granted, it was fun, but it seemed as though they didn't know where they wanted the movie to go, and decided to throw in some random action sequences.Despite these flaws, I think this was a strong movie with great visuals and a fascinating premise. I wasn't exactly blown away by the idea of false reality like some other people (probably because I've considered it before), and I don't think it was as deep as some people say, but it was still interesting, original, and (above all) stylish.",The Matrix

Whatever video/computer techniques the makers of the movie used for the special effects is totally transparent to the watcher - unlike older movies, where you could tell a computer or plastic doll or whatever was being used, in this movie all you see is the real world (as real as it gets in this movie...) and everything that happens (visually) is totally believable.The plot, although being a far out science fiction plot, is believable, technologically speaking. The extremely scary thing is, though, were this already true - most of us, just like in the movie - would have no way of knowing that we were what we were...As for the movie itself - there is not one unnecessary second in the film. Smooth, high action from beginning to end.The only movie that has ever gotten an 11 out of 10 rating from me, this movie is one league above all other movies in it's genre, and is the next level in sci-fi and special effects.If you have not seen this film, go do so NOW.

1174,myyellowbutt,ho hum,7,2 February 2001,"I didn't see this movie in the theater when it first came out.  I admit that was mostly in due to the fact that it had Keanu Reeves in it.  Quite possibly the worst actor of our generation.  However, I am not the type to write something off until I actually see it.  I had heard through reviews of others that it was a thought provoking and original idea and I was hoping that it would live up to the hype.  Boy, was I disappointed.Granted, we live in a world where originality in movies, books, or any sort of fiction is a rarity.  While almost every conceivable story has been done in some sort, we do occasionally get something fresh.  The Matrix, despite the common belief is not one of these.  It is, in fact, one of the oldest stories in the world.  Refer to Plato's Allegory of the Cave in The Republic.  Is this why I'm saying The Matrix is a forgettable movie? 
No.  I'm saying that because the acting is less than stellar, aside from a great performance by the always entertaining Fishburne.  In my opinion, the movie would have been much more tolerable were someone like Johnny Depp chosen for the part of Neo.  At least he can actually act.  On top of this, the movie rides more on action sequences rather than plot or character development.  The Matrix isn't the only movie to take from Plato's Allegory of the Cave. It has been done on more than one occasion.  However, if you want a good story, go with The 13th Floor or Dark City.  If you want action sequences, the Matrix is better off for you.",The Matrix

However, they were behind the 1996 thriller 'Bound' which was not a huge success BUT...have you watched it?  Anyway, enough about that, let me talk about 'The Matrix'.  When Rudyard Kipling wrote the poem 'If' he missed out the crucial line...""IF you can put up with Keanu Reeves' poor acting ability, you'll love every film he's in""This is no exception to that rule.  In fact as Reeves plays Neo/Thomas Anderson, a computer hacker who knows nothing and understands nothing about 'The Matrix' he fits the bill quite perfectly.  He's handsome, has a good athletic build and a huge following ever since his debut in 'Bill & Ted'. Laurence Fishburne on the other hand, as he proves in this movie, is some kind of screen God.  Again, no-one else could really fit the bill as the amazing Morpheous. Some say this film has a slow start.  These people are known as 'impatient' and obviously do not realise the importance and brilliance behind the early stages of the film.  9/10 - you've missed it on the big screen which is where it belonged, but watching it on video won't make that much difference.

For the action, blow-em up smash-em up lovers, it has everything you ever want. However, what makes this movie exceptional is the actual answer to the question, what is the Matrix? The Matrix is conceptually, one of the smartest ideas in Sci-Fi in years. Keaneu Reeves has often been accused of being one dimensional. Well, if that is true, this is the dimension that all of the critics speak of. He's perfect for this movie, as are the rest of the cast. Fishbourne is brilliant and Carrie-Ann Moss very sexy. However, the most effective actor in this movie is Australian, Hugo Weaving. Weaving plays the villain , with a great blend of intelligence and indestructibility that makes you wonder how or even if he can be defeated.This is one of those Sci-Fi action movies that gets better the next time you see it.

It is from many storylines that it fully shows the kindness and darkness in the heart of human beings, the choices made between reason and emotion, and the fluctuations and changes in the hearts of the people in the face of financial interests.
In the film, people in every city fight against the robot squid army at the expense of their lives for freedom, including Neo, Murphy and Trinity fighting for the future of mankind. What impressed me most was what a 17-year-old boy said in part 3 of the Empire of hackers, ""Robots don't care how old I am, he's going to kill me."" A boy who did not reach the age of joining the army bravely came to the front to take part in the battle, not because he was brave, but because in the face of life and death, no life is no longer important, for the sake of life can put down everything to fight for the right to live!
At the end of the film, on the vibrant grass, the matrix is built. The architect decided to give mankind the right to choose freely, and the human belief in peace was realized. What I see is the smile on the face of everyone who has fought for freedom, and they have fulfilled their mission.",The Matrix

1187,mlg-t888,"Welcome, to the Real World",9,25 May 2009,"After the death of good science fiction movies (with a few exceptions) in 1994, the genre made a strong comeback with the release of the highly publicized ""The Matrix"". Since then, the film has become a common cultural reference, and copied in the stylization and use of slow motion.It was only recently, on a boring Friday, alone in my room with my Xbox, that I finally decided to view ""The Matrix"". I rented it off of Xbox Live, and immediately became sucked in by action sequences I recognized from more recent films, films which no doubt had used the Matrix as a large source of inspiration.The films main strength lies in it's visual appeal. consistently switching between the gritty harshness of the real, machine-ruled world, and the slick, sterilized feel inside the Matrix and other computer programs. The film implements visual styles never before seen in any film, and created a world, stretching the limits of the human imagination.The films second strength, is in it's mind-bending philosophies. What is the true state of existence? Is what you know reality, or simply a veil to a bigger picture. Questions such as these that go wild within the human mind but are never able to be truly communicated with others. The film draws heavily on Christian and Bhuddist philosophies and concepts.Very few times has such a mix of both action and philosophy been but together in film form. Thus creating such an automatic appeal to the viewers.But as with most films, ""The Matrix"" does come with its own flaws. As with many science fiction and action films. These biggest flaws lie in the ending. As with films such as ""Terminator 2"" or ""Iron Man"" the film succumbs to typical ""Spiderman-ish"" corniness toward its ending, that does not seem fitting with the mature vision the rest of the film contained.Although sequels offer logical reasoning for the over-played sequences toward the end, it still feels as if to little explanation is left to be fully satisfying.One thing that has to be fully understood with the Matrix, is that it is almost completely dependant on its sequels to be complete. Not all is resolved in the end (in fact, not even the main conflict is resolved). It is truly a three-part saga, and is what it should really be viewed as.Science fiction lovers will (and have) found this film to put a fresh perspective on the genre and will love this movie for years to come. Non-geek people will probably enjoy most of it, particularly the concepts which are introduced in the movie.8/10 stars",The Matrix

It is an old movie, but the contrast will never get old. a perfect action film to enjoy and the theme of the movie never changed. Dark, mysterious, informative.

It blew me away then and still does now.I gave it a 10 because if you were lucky enough to see this in theatres..it was a treat, it was what going to the movies should be about. A Sci-Fi movie that gets your mind racing, with action and depth in the story..that leaves you totally satisfied at the end.The movie starts out with a bang and doesn't let up, it keeps you guessing..right up until the end.The movie is set in a future where A.I has taken over the world from humans, the only reason they were not totally eradicated was because they need us for a power supply as the sun has been blocked out (by chem trails) Humans grow in incubators, our body heat converts to electricity in mega storage facilities were 100's of thousands of humans are stored. They're brains are hooked up to virtual worlds, where they go through the daily grind as per usual, having no idea about the alternate and true reality.There is one last population of non battery human, they live miles under the surface in an underground fortress city called Zion. They're mission is to rescue more humans and protect Zion. They do this with an Army / Navy of soldiers. 1 captain Morpheous believes there will be a messiah to come and save them all.

Matrix had some mindblowing digital rendering and imagery but that can't make up for an interesting idea that wasn't done true justice.",The Matrix
1191,tnzk,A modern classic.,10,18 January 2007,"What is The Matrix? Well, after it took the whole movie world by storm, and spawned a series of copy cat action movies, you would have to be living in a cave to not know what The Matrix is.Basically (and I mean basically), a simpleton named Thomas Anderson, is contacted by his hacker alias Neo by someone who is connected to Morpheus: a person who he is looking for. In a series of strange events, he finally meets Morpheus, who turns the world he knows upside down. He is told that the world he had been living in was not real; a dream world, and that the real world was nothing like it. Cue in some smart dialog, philosophy to engage the average person, and some mind boggling visual effects and that is the essence of The Matrix.The lead actors do an impressive job as uber-hackers, and Keanu Reeves gives us his defining performance as Neo. Laurence Fishburne plays the ever-wise Morpheus and Carrie Anne Moss gives us a warrior woman worthy of a place amongst Sigourney Weaver and Linda Hamilton as Ellen Ripley and Sarah Connor respectively.The Wachowski Bros. did an astounding job of directing this movie. They brought out the ""cool"" in the geeks (most of them are hackers), and made some of the most scariest antagonists ever to grace a film; the ubiquitous agent is a relentless machine, tracking down any rogue person in the system. They have an uncanny ability to give The Matrix multiple layers: the first layer is purely action. Peel that off and you have a very good story. Peel it even more and you have some fundamental questions that may make you even question whether or not you live in a dream world.Arguably their greatest pieces in this movie are the action sequences: The lobby scene and bullet dodging scene stand out the most, but the rest are of high quality as well. I expect everyone thought Episode I: The Phantom Menace would outshine all other movies visually in 1999, but that is not so.Whether you want to see a pure action movie, a smart sci-fi flick or some subliminal messages to really screw with your mind, watch The Matrix. It's definitely worth your time.",The Matrix
1192,litpics,Complex to whole new level,10,24 February 2004,"It isn't very often that a good science fiction movie is conceived. There are those, eh it was okay, or those not bad types, but this definitely ranks among the greatest.First off comes the very concept of it. Warning: Spoilers.Neo is a man living in a world he doesn't believe in. He is soon awakened by Morpheus and the eventual love interest Trinity. This is the basis for the story, but it goes deeper than that. You have Agent Smith, a program within the Matrix, which by the way took me two viewings to figure out, that is out to restore order to the programming. Tidbit number one, the story itself. Phenomenal is one of the best words to describe it. You have a classic idea of a society of the future trapped and blinded by that trap, just living a normal life. But it toys with the concept that not all of us would accept the world we are given, much like the Truman Show. There is only one other film I would compare this to, and would put above, and that is Dark City. Moving on, The Matrix houses an entity of disbelief and human emotion.Each character has their own history that we somehow learn all about. First and foremost is Neo, played very well by Keanu Reeves. I must say that I have always liked the guy and his films; Chain Reaction, Speed, etc. Now, he flawlessly plays a character on edge and constantly learning how to defeat certain evil. Bringing us to the nemesis of Neo, Agent Smith. I had never seen Hugo Weaving's work prior to this, but absolutely loved his performance. Playing an entity who wants a level of freedom that humans have and take for granted. Next comes Morpheus, played by a great film actor Laurence Fishburne. Whose work in Event Horizon gave me chills and thrills. He plays sort of the father figure in this sci-fi. Teaching Neo what he must know to help bring the human race out of near extinction. Last, but certainly not least comes Trinity, the love interest and major butt kicker. Carrie Anne-Moss is another actress I had not heard before this film, and I must say that I search for her name when thinking of movies to see. It's what brought me to Memento and Red Planet. But I was amazed that she could portray both an action hero and a serious individual, not! But this seems to be the trend in a lot of Hollywood films. The woman hero is either strong with no emotions, or too emotional with no strengths. Not so anymore, but I think Carrie helped to break the barrier.Definitely a must see for not only all science fiction fans, but for a whole generation, for this represents a 'could happen' scenario. One way or another, I found myself leaving the theater, and still watching the credits, thinking about what it all means...10 out of 10",The Matrix

Lawrence Fishbourne does a good job as the super believer Morpheus. However the real star of the film and still (I think) the best villain of all time, Hugo Weaving. He has already become a cult actor simply for his performance in this film.This is actually two films in one.

He portrayed his roll perfectly, a lone man searching for an answer. He captured that image by his great acting skills. Everyone else did a great part as well and second most credit to Laurence Fishburne. I can't name anyone else who could pull off a huge leader like roll in this movie.

The martial arts sequences were pretty cool, especially the very first fight sequence, which took me by surprise.  The costumes were cool, and some of the lines were damn funny, those which were very specific to the weird world of the Matrix.What kept this film from being a real winner for me were the slow pacing and the large character and plot holes riddling the story.  The world of the film didn't seem to make any sense, and I question what goal our heroes are actually fighting for.Surprisingly, I thought Keanu Reeves did a fine job in his role.  He even made me laugh with him (as opposed to the usual ""at him"").So see the film if you want to see good use of gratuitous special effects and the first real look at a ""virtual reality""-themed film.

Granted, Laurance Fishburne and Keanu Reeves do their best, but the chartecter development is quick and not very elaborative. One final nagging is the agents, who look like over acting Men In Black.But that's the bad stuff. The good stuff is this:The special effects. I said earlier that they do not really appear until the second half of the movie, but its impact is felt throughout.  The part when Neo wakes up from the The Matrix is very impressive, as is Neo and Morphius' kung fu lesson.The acting. Laurence Fishburne is extremly impressive as Morphius, and spews out half of the movie's memorable lines, such as :""No one can be told what the Matrix is.

Possibly it is the dreamlike quality of the movie that makes it a classic. There are some scenes visually compelling, if not really beautiful (e.g. the green insect penetrating Neo's body). But the excessive martial arts sequences were at first annoying and then, as they became more frequent, I was just bored by them (just as in Charlie's Angels, if this comparison is politically correct). Obviously martial arts are fashionable, but I never cared for Bruce Lee either. In general, The Matrix forgot about its lofty aspirations as it drew towards its end, turning into a plain action movie with endless special effects, fireworks, shooting, and all, even with a helicopter. But what about the very idea of the Matrix? Isn't it just nonsense? After all, if machines took control of the world, using human beings as ""batteries,"" these machines could easily put the poor humans into a perpetual coma, leaving them without consciousness, a state in which they would even spend less energy to sustain themselves, making the whole thing more efficient for the machines. Such human beings would not need any surrogate reality; the Matrix, which is not only a complex box of tricks, but also a waste of energy, would become obsolete.",The Matrix

The plot is mind-blowing, a brilliant yet so simple idea that you wonder why no-one else came up with it before, executed with extraordinary style and astonishing imagination this film shows individuals working at the height of artistic creativity. From the extraordinary sketches and layouts from the wonderful Geoff Darrow to the inch perfect hitchcock-esque storyboarding (Hitchcock was also famous for filming his movies precisely as he visualised them) an incredibly interesting and subversive script and a dazzling array of cutting edge special effects (inventing whole new ways of filming to fulfill the Wachowski brothers vision) this film has every technical wizardry advance in it's arsenal and deploys every one to their full advantage. The most startling thing about the Matrix though is the incredible performances by all of the actors involved. Three months of intensive martial arts and wire work training make for absolutely astounding and outstanding fight scenes and extraordinary powerful kinetic imagery. The 'making off' documentaries illustrate the startling commitment that Keanu Reeves (in particular) but the rest of the cast also, brought to this extraordinary film. Bruises and broken bones don't stop the cast (none of whom had previous martial arts knowledge) from doing months of intensive martial arts training by a Kung Fu Master. This pays off with the most incredible ballet like movements and brilliantly explosive gunplay. On action alone this film is the ultimate movie. Stylish and sleek the look of the film from the incredible custom built sets to the stitched leather shiny uber-stylishness of the Matrix to the barren realities of the 'real world' the film is class from start to finish. Every perfect scene segues into something ever more startling yet everything adds to a perfect whole. This is the 'Ultimate Film' that could only have been done in this day and age, the last great film of the twentieth century to blast us into the next by bending every genre, flaunting every rule and thrilling the pants of the audience from the opening seconds to the bombastic final theme music. I know everyone who reads this will have probably seen the film but if by a slim chance you haven't run down to the video shop now and buy that DVD or widescreen VHS because you need to see this film right now!Simply the coolest film ever the Matrix will surely inspire a new generation of filmmakers and the action hasn't ended yet with two films still to come.If anyone ever says after watching an old movie ""they don't make them like that any more"" say ""Thank god, because if they did we wouldn't have The Matrix"".",The Matrix
1211,Lorenzo H.,A film whose visual appeal far outweighs its intellectual appeal.,6,21 February 2000,"You'd think THE MATRIX was a very special movie indeed based on all the extremely positive comments preceding this one.  I must admit that it is quite entertaining and has no boring moments.  It features some great special effects and is visually exciting.  But these adjectives could also be used to describe an MTV music video.  In fact, it seems music videos, along with Japanese animation and the slow motion action scenes from John Woo movies, were the main inspiration for this film.  Throw in a science fiction plot containing lots of pseudo scientific jargon and you have a movie that is not only action packed but seems quite intellectual as well. But it is this intellectual aspect of THE MATRIX that I feel has been overrated.  The film's central question, -- `Just what is reality?'  is drowned out by all the action and not examined in any great detail.  A motion picture that tackles this very same question in a much more fascinating manner is 1998's highly underrated DARK CITY.  Both films explore similar territory, but because DARK CITY was not geared towards the mainstream by incorporating a modern music score and a shoot-em-up sensibility, it was not as popular.  Like little children fascinated by bright colors and loud noises, modern audiences tend to be transfixed by films like THE MATRIX.  But this movie's lasting power (like last months number one pop hit) won't be long term.  Entertaining  yes, great or meaningful  No.  Final verdict:     6 out of 10.",The Matrix
1212,mooncat82,Awsome sci fi,9,28 February 2000,"The Matrix might be the best science fiction film I have ever seen. The story was a provocative exploration of reality that kept me riveted to the screen with never a dull moment. It was cleverly executed with wonderous special effects that weren't just a light show, not just dazzle, but a spectacular addition to a world of incomprehensible impossibility. The acting was only so so, but the storyline itself was so cool that even average acting couldn't subract anything from the winning formula. It was action packed and entertaining beyond most science fiction films out there today. I am sure all the sci fi heads have seen it already, but, I would recommend this film to anyone seeking adventure. If you love a roller coaster, you will love The Matrix..have fun!  Wheeeeee",The Matrix
1213,sparky-113,What more can you say?,10,16 May 2000,"Excellent. One of my all time great films for watchability and entertainment. I own this film on DVD, and can watch it at any time. With most films, you have to wait until the memories subside before watching it again, but with Matrix, I can watch it at any time, even back to back. In fact, multiple viewings of this film should be compulsary. The first time is excellent, but there are alot of subtle references during the film that don't click until you've seen the whole film, so it is worth watching again when you know exactly what is going on. The special effects are awesome, the fight scenes perfect, even Keanu puts in a decent performance. Fishburne is excellent, as are the supporting cast. Watch it many times, NOW! I only hope the two pending sequels don't ruin this.",The Matrix

The green Warner Brothers (green? you ask) trademark comes up, and without warning you are thrust into the Wachowski brothers grand vision. 2 hours of excitement later, you stumble out of the cinema, knowing what the Matrix is.This is one great movie. Keanu Reeves is cooler than cool as Neo. The Wachowski brothers skilful direction is brilliant. The special effects sequences will blow you away, did I mention the government lobby scene?The film starts off with a 'what is real?' first half, and then the first kung-fu sequence makes way for an action- packed, John Woo-esque second half with slomo and style cranked up all the way to the top. Did I mention the government lobby scene?Keanu becomes Cool Keanu, Carrie-Anne Moss is a real find and Hugo Weaving is perfect in his against typecasting role as the evil Agent Smith.You may notice in this review that I have not revealed what the Matrix is. Like the trailer says, 'You have to see it for yourself.'Excellent. Best film of '99. 9/10.",The Matrix

This movie has everything that every good movie has, thats why its a great movie. This movie is Action Action Action. Not one second of this movie is boring at all. The movie carries out a plot that keeps you thinking about your life in a different way. Every time I eat a steak, I think, this tastes good, but is it real? The few people that don't like this movie because you think that the plot was too confusing, must of watched the movie with earplugs or something, cus Morpheus spends almost the whole movie explaining what the Matrix is and what the Agents are trying to do. So there shouldn't be anything not to understand. And then there's the FX. Oh man, this movie really takes the special efects to another level. The way they were able to make those eye-catching effects along with the sound effects was amazing. No other movie has been able to do that, except maybe "" The Fifth Element"". But overall this is a must see, and I give it a Ten.",The Matrix

The big screen that I use to watch this movie on DVD each and every single day. Since the day that I got the movie in my hands, i feel powerfull, like i can dodge bullets. But then when me and my uncle tried it, he ended up in the hospital and had serious surgeries on his spinal erector. I even tried to shoot up a government lobby, but right when I stepped through, I turned around and walked back out because NEO used more than just 2 guns, and thats only the ammount that I had tucked under my belt.

1217,walter_gibson,Whoa! This film is IN-TENSE,9,4 June 2000,"Now, I'm not a big sci-fi film fanatic(I don't even like Star Wars that much!), but this film is probably the best sci-fi film I've seen for a long, LONG, time. The things that I've been most impressed about this film is not the bullet speed camera trickery, or the martial arts imitations or any kind of technical merit it deserved the oscars for. I mean they were great, but as technology advances, they are bound to get better, and we'll soon find more things to go 'whoa' at. The things that I was most impressed with was the quasi-biblical quasi-starwars storyline, the ensemble acting.
Keanu Reeves looked COOL, and fortunately left the bigger dialogues to Larry Fishbreath (with his turn as the Obi-Wanesque Morpheus) and Hugo Weaving (with his cool authoritarian accent). The other actors giving great support are Gloria Forster as the Oracle (Yoda?), Carrie-Anne Moss as the love interest and Joe Pantoliano as the Judas.The trouble with these kinds of films is that you come out of the picture not horrified by the machine-dominated world idea, but become rather fond of such a situation, and the escapism that it provides. The apocalyptic world is somewhat romanticied by the film.But who cares when it's so much fun? Sit back, relax, and enjoy the ride.Pure escapism!",The Matrix
1218,aimeed87,I resisted seeing this film because of the obvious violence,10,8 September 2000,"But,if violence can be well-handled, this movie did it.  It won me over to the genre.  I have since watched the Terminators and Lethal Weapons, etc. This movie was such an extraordinary work it broke through years of resistance!  I have watched it over and over - great storyline, great storytelling, extraordinary special effects - perfect casting. All acting was top-notch and Keanu Reeves was completely charismatic - something I had never felt from him as an actor before.  I rate it 10/10.",The Matrix

The plot had so many holes it was unbelieveable. The bad guys walk around with pistols, huh, they can choose any weapon they can morph into anyone and all they use is pistols. The Matrix has the ability to remove all doors from a room but it doesn't have the power to ignite the room so that they all burn to death. The idea of the matrix was good until you start thinking about it. This film is entertaining but at the end of the day it's just a stylised version of so many Star Trek episodes and a copy of everything Sci Fi that's gone before it.",The Matrix

But you can only see the slow-motion camera spinny thingy once ore twice before you start thinking ""gee - could they not think of anything more interesting? Is this all there is?"". Over all it was way too long and not that interesting once you got over the somewhat novel special effects.

The concept can be very confusing and I recommend watching it a couple times over to really understand what The Matrix is. I feel like Mr.Anderson/Neo was the perfect person to play this average guy who didn't know how important he actually was. Definitely makes you want to continue watching the entire series.

1225,jannisschaefer,An overrated movie,6,22 September 2020,"I watched this movie when I was a kid. I liked it, I thought it was a good movie. But now that I have rewatched it again after such a long time, my opinion of it has been tarnished. This is a pretentious movie desperately trying to convey that it means more than meets the eye. There are so many issues sprinkled throughout that the majority just seems to ignore. For example Neo is able to hide from the agents the matrix dispatched to catch him, by hiding behind a thin wall... Shouldn't these agents be able to track him anywhere he goes. He's still plugged into the matrix so it makes no sense. Or what about their brilliant disguises they use to blend in on their covert operations. Eventhough their outfits make them stand out, everyone acts like they're normal people Just strolling along on the sidewalk. Speaking of acting, the acting in this movie is bland and feels incredibly contrived. Inherently I find the idea of a movie inspired by anime intriguing and interesting, but the execution prevents me from giving it more than an average designation. It's still a decent movie. Many scenes look nice except for that constant green tint the matrix has for some unknown reason. The action that doesn't involve bullet time is still pretty nice and some of the philosophical stuff was very interesting, like ""there is no spoon"", for example.
All in all a decent movie that doesn't hold up as well as people would like to believe it does.",The Matrix

1229,maxnrisa,"Pretty good movie, but overrated.",7,13 November 2001,"Good Points:  First and foremost, the concept.  A lot of people will think it's a new one, but actually this kind of thing has been written about before in sci-fi novels and short stories for a long time.  But for the movies, it is a unique plot.  Most average people were probably still trying to wrap their brains around the story weeks after they'd left the theater. And, of course, lotsa brownie points for feeding our brains with yet more mind-boggling special FX goodies and well-choreographed butt-kicking.  The cast, except for Reeves, did well, and special thumbs-up to the peformances of Lawrence Fishburne and Joe Pantoliano.Bad Points:  Sorry folks, but any movie with Keanu Reeves in it automatically gets docked a few.  Yea, he's cute, and probably a nice guy. But, ""Bill and Ted"" movies aside, he can't act.  Plain and simple.  Also, the movie depended too much on eye candy and the directing was way too Hollywood-ized.  What could have been truly epic was given the ""Let's Give The Public What They Want"" treatment and turned into little more than an excuse for a lot of fight scenes and instant-gratification visuals which, while impressive, don't lend much to the real substance of the movie.  And to tell you the truth, this whole ""Chosen One"" crap is getting a little old. Let's come up with some other excuse, okay people?  This plot device should have been replaced a long time ago.Bottom Line: In spite of the flaws, a good movie.

The visual effects still don't look phony 'til this very day! And when I watched it again when I was older and obviously more mature, I love the story line. It made the movie a million times better! The reason I was blown away again when I watched it was because of the storyline itself. It just comes together so well. About this perception of reality and the human race living in an artificial world made sense for all the action-packed sequences to cross boundaries. If you like the movie for the action, that's fine. but if you want a full blown movie, here it is. The Y2K of film. The movie makes sense story wise, emotionally, and even if you judge the action to look phony, it'll all make sense when you see it. Perfect film.

The CGI, the brutal expendable nature of all of the people inside the matrix. It's simply fantastic. I think we'll all be waiting a long long time before we ever see a film so rich in story, visual effects, action and overall quality. This film was also brilliant in the music department. The music makes the action better. The background music makes the atmosphere more atmospheric. Think about it, Prodigy, Rob Zombie, Mayalin Manson, Rage Against the Machine, Deftones, Rob D and most surprisingly, the fantastic cheesy metal of Rammstein.

The Wachowski brothers do something brilliant... they have an idea that they want to get out, but this idea is very hard to sell. If they had made it true to it's self the movie would have been a giant flop, it would have reached only a fraction of the targeted audience (which is all). So they took this idea and wrapped it up in a sci-fi story, in an action packed block-buster that appeals to the masses. It's a brilliant scam that worked! They managed to do exactly what they tried, they planted the idea into your head, the seed of doubt even if you have no idea it's there, even if you have no idea what the hell I'm talking about or why I'm cryptic about it, it's there.Hats off to the Wachowski brothers for pulling this off in style!

There's much hype among a little 1999 film called ""The Matrix"" a movie which I only discovered this year, a little before the release of the much anticipated (much overhyped) sequel ""The Matrix Reloaded"". I don't why I waited so long to see this movie. I just never got the time or just wasn't interested enough to see it. But I just kept seeing advertisements for ""Reloaded"": All of the soda and beer ads, the posters, the extremely good-looking Carrie Anne Moss. I had to check the first one out! I finally rented it on DVD from Blockbuster, and after taking out the disc, I came to the conclusion that the ""Matrix"" was one of the most overrated movies of all time. But that never stopped it from being entertaining.""The Matrix"" tells of Thomas Anderson (Keanu Reeves), a computer programmer by day and a hacker by night by the name of ""Neo"". But by having a mysterious encounter between peculiar strangers Morpheus (Lawrence Fishburne) and Trinity (Carrie-Anne Moss), Neo learns that the world is not what it seems to be. Him and all the other humans are slaves in the ""Matrix"", a computer program deluding the humans from the ""real"" world. After being ""unplugged"", Neo joins with Morpheus and Trinity to fight against the machine army threatening to destroy ""Zion"", the last human city of the real world, and to free the rest of the humans from the Matrix while taking on Smith (Hugo Weaving) and the other agents.""The Matrix"" does have a few ideas, but Phillip K. Dick wrote better than this. The dialogue is banal and the movie is constantly explaining the whole explanation to the audience. ""The Matrix"" is a very, very simplistic premise but the film is able to expand past it's small idea into an over-wrought world laden down with special effects. All of the characters have no depth in them at all and are treated like special effects like the rest of the film! What begins as a fairly interesting plot turns into a video game with cardboard characters and fancy visuals.Then why was I entertained? Simple: It was fun. I had a fun time. It's not the classic the desperate action junkies and video game nerds want it to be. Nor was it mind-blowing. I saw nothing here that I haven't seen in billions of stories written decades before this movie was thought of. The visuals are fun and ""bullet time"" was somewhat cool to look at, but there really was no POINT to the movie. What are we getting out of this? Nothing except minor entertainment. Should I bother with Reloaded...?",The Matrix
1239,Chihiro_Sen15,"Shoot me, I didn't like it",5,22 July 2003,"THE MATRIX / Starring Keanu Reeves, Laurence Fishburne and Carrie-Anne Moss / Directed by Andy and Larry Wachowski / Written by Andy and Larry Wachowski / Rated R / **The Matrix has now garnered it's own cult of teenagers and young adults all over the world. I admit that only discovering this little movie only months before the sequel, The Matrix Reloaded was due to come out. I rented the DVD not knowing what to expect. I knew the storyline but nothing too deep other than the most basic of information. I sat through the film's 136 minute running time, watching carefully. After the movie, I took the DVD out of my player, put it in it's case and walked out the door, remembering absolutely nothing. Ouch.The Matrix is a science fiction tale of a computer program writer called Thomas Anderson AKA Neo (Keanu Reeves), who learns from a band of rebels that the world he lives in is a digital simulation. The world he sees, the world we see is in fact a virtual reality created by an entire race of machines to keep humans under control and giving those machines energy for them to survive. After learning the truth from the mysterious man known as Morpheus (Laurence Fishburne) and leather-clad, ass-kicker Trinity (Carrie-Anne Moss), Neo is released from the virtual prison known as the Matrix and finally witnesses the real world. But there's something more to Neo than meets the eye: Is he possibly the One, the only person in all of mankind that can destroy the Matrix and free the human race? The answer? Probably.The main source of entertainment in this movie are the fight scenes, which zip by like a six-year-old having a sugar rush. I admit that these fight scenes are spectacular, crafted with the most seamless special effects I have ever seen. There is a particularly impressive hand-to-hand fight between Keanu Reeves and Australian actor Hugo Weaving (Lord of the Rings) in a subway and even a more impressive one between Reeves and Laurence Fishburne in the first hour of the film, taking place in an old dojo. It was hard to believe that Keanu performed all of his fight scenes himself, or that he had the brains to remember the moves! Sure, pretty-looking fight scenes are abound in this film but that's where my investment in this film stopped dead.The Matrix's fatal flaw is that there is not one likable or colorful character in all of the film's bloated 136 minutes. The only character that comes even remotely close to being likable is Carrie-Anne Moss' Trinity. All other characters are ultimately forgettable and not really worth caring about. Some characters just drove me out of my mind! I found most of the crew of the Nebachanezzar annoying and pointless. What's worse is that most of them have the worst dialogue of the whole movie. ""Digital pimp hard at work!"" Are the Wachowski's eighteen or something? I know this movie is marketed to teenagers as something ""cool"". In fact, I'm only fifteen years old and I didn't think the movie was all that ""cool"". Instead of ""cool"" I found it ""cliched"", ""silly"" and ""lame"". I admit, Keanu Reeves' character was decent and somewhat interesting considering the fact he didn't look like he could figure out what everyone is saying. You know a main character is not worthing giving a damn about when everyone around him must constantly explain things to him, often slowly. Actually, I found the whole movie to merely being an ""introduction"" to this concept. There WAS no story.But alas, there is a saving grace and that is the new world unraveling before our very eyes, often with the most spectacular visual effects. They're not much of filmmakers, but the Wachowski's are certainly digital wizards, able to magically create dreams out of the latest of technology. The CGI used in the ""real world"" is particularly impressive, probably more impressive than most things out of that ""other"" big-budget release of 1999, called a little something like Star Wars Episode I: The Phantom Menace. But I found the Phantom Menace much more entertaining! Like Star Wars, there is never really a moment in this movie that special effects are not used. Sure, these special effects are great to look at, but a movie should not be reliant on special effects. That's why most indie films end up being some of the best movies of all time. They are about writing, directing and acting. Films like The Matrix are only made to show out the latest technology. Now make no mistake, I didn't watch this film expecting it to take home the Best Picture award from the Academy, but that's doesn't stop it from being disappointing.Many people claim this film for being ""deep"" yet I see nothing ""deep"" about it at all. ""There is no spoon."" Yeah, I already remember Laurence Fishburne's character blabbing about that earlier in the film for immense amounts of time. And I hear Reloaded is just one big Philosophy 101 lesson! The philosophy found in this movie I think is trying to be subtle but in the end simply bogs the film down. I commend the Wachowskis for trying to take action films to another level, but maybe that just won't ever happen. The only movie that ever actually came close to being something more was 1991's Terminator 2: Judgement Day, which happens to be a much better movie than The Matrix, action film or not. And don't give me that ""You just didn't understand it!"" crap, because I understood the whole thing perfectly and believe me, there is nothing special about it.I think the real thing that made The Matrix loved by millions of viewers is that it glorifies computer geeks and school nerds. The real problem with me is that I'm neither of those things. I guess that's why it never touched me, or the story just never moved me. Sure the action scenes are spectacular and the special effects are great to look at, but in my opinion, special effects should not drive the story. It should be the other way around. Combine that with one-dimensional characters and uninspired dialogue, there is nothing here to entertain me. A movie can be the greatest movie of all time but if it doesn't entertain, it does nothing for me. That's exactly the definition I would give The Matrix.",The Matrix
1240,s_daad,Disguised Scientology?,3,22 September 2010,"A lot of people like The Matrix because they think it's deep. In fact its apparent deepness is its primary selling point, and is what has turned it into a blockbuster and trendsetter. Just ponder over this, because there's a contradiction here. Whenever has Hollywood hit the jackpot by being profound, either in a philosophical or religious way? Something strange is going on here. A lot of the mystery disappears after we identify exactly what belief the Wachowski brothers are purveying here. It's Scientology. They are telling us that the power of the mind is able to free us from the matrix of the senses. The scientologists are anxious to free themselves and become thetans – omnipresent and omni-powerful minds.Now, the success of The Matrix tells me just one thing, that people have become closet scientologists. They don't grapple with the issue of ""appearance and reality"" in the way scientologists do, but the core belief is there. They might call themselves an atheist, or an evolutionist (""We only accept what science tells us""), but that's only an excuse for not really sorting out what they really believe in. So, along comes a film called The Matrix and it hits a chord. They can identify with Neo because they are aware of a thing called corporate media manipulating reality for them. They are also brought up on computer games, and so it's not too big a leap to imagine a virtual world completely replacing the real one. I can see how closet scientologists can completely immerse themselves in the plight of Neo and his Christ-like struggle to free humanity from the clutches on the senses and become omni-powerful minds (in the parlance of the film, taking them to promised city of Zion).In that sense, the film is profound, in that it resonates with popular belief so accurately. There is just enough spattering of science and philosophy to take them in. People want to believe in science, but they don't want to be troubled like Einstein was (""Does God play dice?""). The most convincing part of the film is where Morpheus demonstrates to Neo how virtual reality is created. This, and the recurring motif of ""freeing the mind"" are the only authentic components of the film. The rest is a conventional Hollywood action flick, and one that is totally at odds with the underlining philosophy. Considering the struggle with agent Smith, and the frequent popping in and out of virtual reality, nothing makes sense. This is where real confusion starts to parade as profundity.I always thought that it was only intellectuals who mistook confusion for profundity, but apparently normal cinema-goers do too. Maybe intellectuals and Hollywood action flick fans have something in common after all. They both worship the rational mind. And when rationality delivers a mess, the mess itself is seen as something profoundly rational. Maybe that's the crowing achievement of the Wachowski brothers. They have composed the ""Being and Time"" for the masses. But Heidegger's philosophical book was mostly pretentious garbage, and so is the Matrix.",The Matrix
1241,LConyers,Rewatched today 2/20...holds up so well,9,16 February 2020,"I still remember watching this movie for the first time in the theater, and how much I had the feeling that the Sci-Fi world had changed forever.I haven't watched for a quite a while now, but watching today I really felt like this movie could have come out in 2009 instead of 1999.",The Matrix

During the war the human's somehow ""scorched the sky"" therefore stopping the machines getting their source of solar energy, so instead the machines stop killing humans and instead capture them and imprison them in ""pods"" that keep them alive to act as an energy source (like a battery) for the machines. The premise of the film is that the world we see around us is an illusion, created by the artificial intelligence and fed into the ""podded"" humans' psyches to keep them quiescent. What you must not ask at this point is why the machines bother, why they don't just render all humans unconscious and have done with it - try not even to think it, it will spoil all of the spectacular set piece battles and kung fu choreography.The special effects are impressive and the story is so much better than most of the ridiculously thin things that action movies use. It is difficult to know whether the film makers were taking the whole thing totally seriously, as sometimes parts seem a little tongue in cheek. I prefer to think they weren't taking things completely seriously, since although I have heard it said how deep the underlying philosophical questions of the film are, and heard people become obsessively intense about this, it is, at the end of the day, a light-hearted action flick with an interesting plot-line done extremely well. If that sounds too dismissive, I will add that it is one of my favourite films of all time, I just can't take it seriously that this is either a philosophical or a religious allegory.So, should you see this film? Yes, it's thrilling, visually stunning, occasionally profound and also just one of the coolest movies ever made. So watch it now, if only so you can say you have. 10/10.",The Matrix

1244,led_zeppelin_zoso,A wild sci-fi classic.,8,5 March 2005,"After seeing this movie it changed the way i will look at sci-fi movies for the rest of my life. This film was taken straight from the imagination of the Wachowski. The amazing special effects drove this film along with great sound editing and dialog. Just in case you don't know i will tell you the main plot of the movie. Neo is just an average guy who ends up being hunted by Agent Smith. HE ends up being one of the crew members with Morpheus and Trinity. Morpheus thinks that Neo is ""The One"" which means that this person would be very strong and can dodge bullets and do wild stuff like that.The reason so many people loved this movie was because it was so out of this world and no one else not even Mr.Spielberg could have done this movie because only two brothers could have brought this to life and made one of the best sci-fi sagas ever made(tied with the ""Alien"" saga) and make remembered through generations, so i hope when i get old this movie will still be remembered because it is simply amazing.",The Matrix

One thing I think this movie does better than its given credit for is its philosophical foundation. The premise of ""ignorance is bliss"" being a choice is awesome as it gives a weight to the decision and depth to the characters when you put yourself in their shoes. Would you choose to be blissfully incorporated into a world where everything was just as you expect or would you want more? Everyone acts like the decision is simple but because of its difficulty is why I think I enjoyed this movie so much. The pacing really tends itself to the action without being too much and all the actors are on their A-game.",The Matrix

I can't believe that a movie classic like 'Apocalypse Now' is behind The Matrix.Many people say that this movie is realistic and everything in it could be true, but I think they all forgot the oracle, the fact that there's THE ONE and the shootout at the end. I mean in the shootout they don't do many special moves to hide from the bullets, but they just don't get shot. Whatever, the action sequence would have been much better if M. Manson's 'Rock Is Dead' played in the background. I hope the sequels or prequels don't go on like the first one ended, because I think that would suck. But if they hold on to a good story, like the first hour of this movie was, we can look forward to a great competition between the 2nd Star Wars and the 2nd Matrix.I rated this movie 9 out of 10",The Matrix
1249,steven-3,Gripping movie with interesting but imperfect plot,8,24 June 1999,"All the images of the Matrix were very powerful, with much eye for detail, and the special effects were subtle, not overdone but masterful. Here and there, the story was somewhat cliche, I thought. The prophecy of 'The One' who would 'set humanity free' sounded a bit like Star Wars, if you see what I mean. Also, without wanting to give away too much, there were elements in the of human-machine interaction that were not very convincing... if you start to think about it. But it was only when I left the cinema that I started to think about the weak spots in the plot. Of course there is plenty of unbounded violence that accompanies this film which doesn't really appeal to me. It seems to go with American cinema somehow. I'd appreciate it if they'd stop that. Having said that, there were moments in this film that left me gasping. But... you can't be told what The Matrix is. Go and see for yourself!",The Matrix
1250,TeamRockwood,Pure Eye Candy,8,1 April 1999,"The Matrix is probably the best-looking movie I've seen since Dark City, and it may actually be better looking.  There is not a single shot in this movie that hasn't been thought of stylistically, and it shows.And the plot?  Well, when you think about it later, you will kind of wish that the last third of the movie had been as intellectual as the first two-thirds.  But that's only later.  When you're actually watching it, all those thoughts of ""why didn't he..."" will be blown away by jaw-dropping action scenes.That's not a major flaw, though, just a slight one.

1252,jon-88,What is The Matrix?,10,4 April 1999,"What is The Matrix?You cannot be told - The Matrix is something you have to experience for yourself.What is reality?  Is it something you can Taste? Feel? Smell?  What if these senses can be manipulated, and it can be proven that those things you experience as real are simply constructs - computer programs which stimulate you just as you would be stimulated by the actual.   What then?The time then comes to have a different measuring stick for reality.   If you can be manipulated to believe something is true which is not true, what other defense is there but to exercise free will - to be able to bend what happens and how things work to your view of how things should be.In order to do that, you must understand how things work.  And you must believe in who you are.These are just some of the themes of this film - an important science fiction movie masquerading as a John Woo, Hong Kong action-adventure film, plugged into a video game.  What may be lost the first time you see this is how The Matrix makes fun of these genres - the main character, a computer hacker named Neo, goes through the classic kung fu movie arc - from student, to teacher to master, but then he transcends the game entirely, by finally holding off his foe with one hand, as he goes to the next level of the game. This subversive humor plays throughout the movie, as it sneaks up on you with Big Questions, which resonate more and more in these days of moral relativity...   for example, currently in the Real World ethnic Albanians are fleeing Kosovo.  Why?  The U.S. says they're fleeing Serbian ethnic cleansing.  The Serbs say they're fleeing NATO bombing.  Who's right?  Ask the people fleeing!In order to be able to find the answers, you have to know the right questions, and The System which is running when those questions are being asked.And that system is The Matrix.",The Matrix
1253,Fieracha,Part of what promises to be an amazing story...,10,18 April 1999,"For pure entertainment value and a film that left me wanting more, this is it! Be warned that I'm not going to examine The Matrix on a metaphysical level, or compare it directly to anything as some people have done. I went in with no preconceptions or expectations, and obviously walked out more satisfied than many who did.I'll discuss the plot line of the Matrix down further, but for now I will say the only problem I had with any character was Reeves' ""whoa"". This, combined with his accent, can't help but remind you a little of two guys in bright clothing having excellent adventures in a phone booth.Reeves plays very well the hacker suddenly exposed to the truth, adapting to his environment with the ease of those enamored of information technology. He hungers for knowledge, seeks the truth, and wants answers to his questions. He doesn't receive all the answers, but he knows his battle with the AI society of the Matrix will bring him closer.Fishburne is great as the enigmatic Morpheus. At first complex, his simple belief that Neo is The One pushes him on in his quest, and we see his simple dedication to humanity evident in the pains he goes through to protect Zion.Carrie Anne Moss is excellent as Trinity. (I have to say that ""Dodge this"" was one of the cooler moments for me in the film - yeah shallow I know). She does the kick a** female with a confident, yet fragile femininity that she only exposes in humanity's hour of need.Hugo Weaving. What can you say? As a proud Aussie, I am completely satisfied with his performance as the spine-chilling Agent Smith. A lot of people I talked to were really annoyed by his accent, but I felt that it suited an AI program attempting to fit into a human society and develop human traits. His icy, blank faced portrayal of Agent Smith (with Agent Jones and Agent Brown), really carried the uncaring authority figure of the Matrix into the human world.Weaving, along with other Australian/New Zealand actors (Matt Doran as ""Mouse"", Belinda McClory as ""Switch"", and Julian Arahanga as ""Apo"", along with the agents and a host of extras) gave good background to the other characters, even though their roles were short lived. Hopefully we will see a lot more local talent in upcoming features (Star Wars Episode II, Mission Impossible II).Joe Pantoliano makes a great Cypher - the disillusioned follower of Morpheus.The parts of Tank and Dozer were ably played by Marcus Chong and Ray Anthony Parker, as the only two ""real humans"" we saw in the whole film. You see in Tank and Dozer a happier, more positive attitude, having been born in the human outpost of Zion, and believing implicitly with Morpheus that Neo is The One.The special effects strength were nothing short of unique, with the combination of Hong Kong wire cradles combined with unreal, ""computer generated"" settings and wardrobe, and slow-mo ""moment in time"" multi-camera techniques. That is all I have to say on the matter, because they have to be seen to be believed.I have a problem with people who knocked the film. Most of their reasoning probably stems from the fact that they are addicted to their own flavour of sci-fi (and there is NOTHING wrong with that), or expect high philosophy every time they walk into a cinema. I accept that there were parts that they didn't like, but I feel that rather than trying an all-encompassing tale told from start to finish, the Wachowski Brothers were showing us a small, but important part of the world of the Matrix.Everyone who has watched a sci-fi feature film knows that in no real way can the director(s) give us the entire history of their unique world in 3 hours or less. The Star Trek movies, for instance, have whole series' to back them up before they hit the big screen. Conversely, ""Dark City"" stood alone, and people who didn't like it often said that ""not enough was explained"" (as they did with the Matrix), or compared it to other, better established series/films. Was everyone disappointed with ""Star Wars"" when it was first released? NO! They went in, saw a good film with simple plot ideas and characters, got their money's worth and walked out. I think somewhere along the line we just got too fussy, and we forget that it's a movie - entertainment for a couple of hours.I had no preconceptions that this movie would give me the history or end of the world. I say honestly went in to the cinema looking for a story on ""lotsa guns and kicking heads"", not to mention the unique special effects. I was pleasantly surprised.The concept of the Matrix running our lives was an important part of the film. I accepted this, but did NOT wait for some quasi-religious justification to develop from this. It was simply a fact taken into account by Morpheus and his disciples when combating the Matrix in their search for ""The One"". It was no character's task to analyse this on a metaphysical level - their task was to begin destruction of the Matrix, and this was all that the Directing and Editing crew could fit into this movie time frame.There is room for sequels here, (like others, I want to see Zion) and I hope that it will again be the Wachowski brothers at the helm, to continue their vision in the style to which we have become accustomed.

The movie was about 150 minutes long. I only enjoyed about 50 minutes of it, when the actions took place. I saw the making of the Matrix and expected a good action film.

1262,Shingle,I have a headache now and so I think I'll go sleep for sometime.,10,20 March 2000,"Exactly a year ago to the day, two things happened on March 20th. One I guess I shouldn't talk about (because she'd probably kill me!). But the other is that I got my first look at 'The Matrix'! All I saw was the one-minute teaser trailer. It looked mysterious! I knew instantly that this was something very different and I just had to see this film. I wanted to know what the 'Matrix' was. And when I found out! Don't be fooled into thinking that this film is just going to blow you away it's going to cause your head to explode!  The film has a story that has been described as difficult to explain and hard to understand when watching, but thankfully it wasn't like having to watch Mission Impossible! Without giving the whole thing away this is what's happening. You have Reeves playing Thomas 'Neo' Anderson, a computer programmer for a big company who is also a computer hacker in his spare time and sells the illegal stuff to the ones who want it. But right now Mr Anderson has been having some very bad dreams, dreams that seem so real. He keeps getting told about this 'Matrix' in these strange dreams. I mean just what is this 'Matrix'? Some suspicious black suited men also want him for something. He doesn't want to stick around to find out! Soon someone known as Morpheus (Fishburne) contacts him and explains to him that he also is looking for him, plus he'll tell him about his vivid dreams and he'll explain to him just what the 'Matrix' is. We begin to find out that reality isn't what it seems.  Well what the hell is the 'Matrix'!? Finding out wasn't going to be an easy task. As the tagline said 'Unfortunately no one can be told what the 'Matrix' is.' So I could see that I was going to have to pay my £5 and go find out just like everyone else!  The story is original and very unique, taking a truckload of ideas, thoughts, effects, action and fitting them nicely into something just over 2 hours long. What makes this movie work so well is the strong story element. It's also one of those really rare sci-fi action films that actually makes you think. It raises some questions and it has its own answers. But besides being an education lesson it is extremely entertaining. So entertaining that it's almost unbelievable that such a film can be exposed to the public! It manages to make itself so incredibly cool. Take 'Men in Black' and double it and you're not even half way there. But think a futuristic John Woo film and you're pretty close! Most of the action takes place in the second half of the film where all hell breaks loose. The action is very stylish, very over the top and also well thought out. You don't see someone run up a wall, dodge bullets at high speed and park a helicopter spectacularly in the side of a building in your traditional boring 'let's go shoot some bad guys' action film. This is something very different.  The Matrix will do for special effects what Terminator 2 did for well, um special effects! This is ground breaking stuff. Used to a major extent in the film are the Flo-Mo effects where the camera circles around the action. It's unlike anything else and it just looks outstanding! The shootout between Reeves and Weaving as they freeze in mid air, the camera goes 360 degrees around them. It's just unbelievable!  Everyone is cast perfectly in their roles with Reeves and Anne-Moss looking amazingly cool throughout the film. Fishburne looks cool too, and is helped with the fact that his character is highly knowledgeable. But the best performances have to go to those black suited men known as 'Agents', led by Hugo Weaving. They seem so simple and smart, the way they talk with their monotone voices! They are very, very nasty and I like it!  The speedy fight scenes and use of wire frames all work really well, adding more to the effect of believing the unbelievable! There are so many unforgettable little touches, which make this movie stand out amongst others. The way those bullets slowly fly out and make crisp sounds as they hit the floor, the lush watery effects, even the spoon and of course the woman in red! She's unforgettable! There's also the nice touch of adding in a few hidden features which may make the real enthusiast want to watch the film a couple more times to find everything out. Some will watch it again because they didn't understand it at all (Though it's usually these people that hate the film). But I'm sure most will watch it again for the reason that it's just so damn good!  Those Wachowski brothers have created a masterpiece of a movie. And I'd just like to say well done to them! I knew that if I was only going to see one movie in 1999 (just in case I ended up poor or something!) then it was going to be this!My Rating - I'm afraid I can give it no more then the 10 out of 10 it deserves!",The Matrix
1263,joey526,Amazing,9,29 September 1999,"I rented this movie last night on DVD. I sat down and watched it with dolby's wonderful digital surround sound....WOW. The effects are amazing, this movie belongs in the top 20 here at IMDB. The movie left me wanting/hoping for more. I would recommend this movie to anyone that likes sci-fi and action films. I will be watching this one again soon.",The Matrix
1264,soonforget,The Matrix peaks out on many different levels,10,4 May 1999,"This film is truly phenomenal, to say the least.  I have seen it 7 times and I do plan on seeing it at least 1 more time.  It makes me think about numerous things each time I see it.  It touches base on a spiritual level, intellectual, visual, as well as containing some pretty groovy dialogue and some kick a$$ visual effects (Carrie-Ann Moss) and fight scenes.  Sure to be my favorite film of the year, possibly decade.   ****",The Matrix
1265,Willie-31,Not as good as I expected.,3,5 May 1999,"The previews and commercials for this film had me expecting something great. I was instead suprised to see something that reminded me more of ""Johnny Mnemonic,"" not in terms of plot, but in terms of the pace (sort of slow), and the ""Keanu Reeves action hero of the future"" motif.  Overall, I thought that the plot was rather simple, and despite that, Laurence Fishburne's character rehashed it for the audience numerous times.  I thought the special effects were great, but special effects alone don't make a movie great.  The action was nice, but there could have been more of it.",The Matrix
1266,MyPetMongoose,The New Face Of The Blockbuster,9,1 December 1999,"The Matrix is not a perfect movie.  I thought the religious symbolism was a little amateurish and I didn't really buy into the evil robots using humanity as a power source plot.  And if Morpeus said ""He is the One!"" once more I would have walked out of the theatre.However, despite these flaws The Matrix is easily one of the best action films of recent years.  It accomplishes this mainly by style.  The Brothers Wachowski live up to the promise of Bound and prove that they see things in an atypical way.  Every frame of the Matrix is saturated with their own unique vision and style.  This makes the Matrix a good cut above the manufactured and overly processed studio entries over the past few years (from Wild Wild West to the horrible End of Days).  Audiences are tired with convention and the success of the Matrix is proof of that.And, of course, the Matrix features the best kung-fu choreography outside of Hong Kong.  The Brothers Wachowski really know how to make a fight scene look good with nice flowing camerawork and numerous long shots.  I, for one, like to know what's happening in my action scenes--enough of that rapid editing and those idiotic extreme close-ups!",The Matrix
1267,Jesus-28,A slowly accelerating movie that will blast you into a state of euphoria.,10,6 October 1999,This is the best Sci-fi/action movie I've ever seen. For the first it has a lot of special effects that are exciting to watch. The second thing I think of is the story. Sometimes it seems to be week but after a moment of thinking it may not. Interesting and intriguing plot! A third thing is the shooting of the movie. Usual frontal pictures are mixed with pictures from above and below and all together with the special effects stimulates the brain in a pleasant way. If you like Sci-fi and action you have to see this movie.,The Matrix
1268,Don Juan-3,Another World !!!,9,27 September 1999,"The Matrix, takes you to another world, or should I say another LEVEL. The movie brings out the same old question : FATE!!   Is everyone in control of himself, or is another external force controlling us.> Neo (Keanu Reeves) is off to find the answer. Suddenly he finds himself  in this very cool, action packed movie : "" The Matrix"" . He has to face Ai-men (Artificial Intelligence) that can take over the life of any human and capture his body.One of the best scenes in this movie was when Neo faces one of the Ai-men and has to maneuver bullets on a rooftop of a skyscraper. Very cool and sharp visual effects  were applied in this great movie.Also very cool character performed by Laurence Fishburne.>That movie is a must see. 10/10.",The Matrix
1269,mhi,Excellent on (almost) all points,10,15 September 2000,"One of the most intriguing movies of the past few years, both visually and thematically. This one had me recalling scenes and what ifs for days, which not many films do.I've been a fan of Fishburne's ever since I noticed his top notch performance in Boyz N the Hood (1991). Here he is once again in excellent form. Moss gives a startling performance of her own, while stepping back in favor of Fishburne here and there. With all she does, she could have easily passed for the ONE herself, but the script obviously intended otherwise. Most of the rest of the inner-spaceship's crew get developed just enough for you to be surprised at who ultimately makes it and who doesn't. Reeves is credible in his part whether it be in his knowledge or belief of the Matrix or in his relation and untrust of the rebels. Even his playing with the Matrix comes across nicely and - surprise - fittingly. The bad guys are like a hibred of the Johnsons from the original Die Hard, the boys from MIB and a bit of Max Headroom - hilarious!The camerawork, CGIs and SFX are excellently done and choreographed and the plot with its different - at times almost confusing - levels is very well brought across with just the right mix of fast-paced action and time left to explain and reflect upon the new and disturbing developments.Is reality real? Is it imagination? Is imagination preferable to reality? Where do we practise escapism in real life? What is real life? Is it all a matter of character? Of rebellious nature? Who are we rebelling against? Is the enemy inside?This film poses highly philosophic/religious questions on end and makes Reeves out to be the - at first reluctant - saviour of humankind while leaving a lot of other questions unanswered. While that answer of 'self-confidence will get you anywhere' definitely doesn't go conform with biblical content (Neo/the One is an obviously intended parallel to the One promised saviour of the Bible - Jesus Christ) Matrix remains nonetheless an excellent high-end Hollywood production worthy of all the laurels it has already received for being just that.BTW: I cannot for the life of me imagine what Matrix 2 and 3 are going to be about. I considered the book closed with that spectacular ending...",The Matrix
1270,delahoc,Whoa ... !,10,12 November 2000,"These days, with all the loud, intense marketing that accompanies major movies, it's sometimes difficult to separate the film from the hype. 'The Matrix', however, is one film that is even bigger and better than the hype that tries to sell it.It's rare these days to find movies with no plot holes, no plot flaws. Even with the recent improvements in SFX and CGI, it's rare to find a movie where the effects just cannot be flawed (well, on freeze-frame I actually found a bungee cord that the wore-removal guys didn't do such a good job on).The Matrix not only lives up to it's promise, but far exceeds it. It redefines excitement.Hugo Weaving is a much under-utilised actor, one of Australia's best. It's good to see Australian actors like Russell Crow and Guy Pearce getting the attention and plaudits they deserve, but Hugo Weaving should be working more. Whilst he is superb here as the evil and emotionless villain, check out some of his previous Australian miniseries ('Dirtwater Dynasty' and 'Bodyline') to see him really shine.",The Matrix
1271,hurlcode,Well worth the price of admission,9,26 September 1999,"I thought the plot was pretty straight forward and predictable. I still thought it was a good story, just not too many unexpected twists and turns. The special effects, and the imagination inherent in the story were what sold this for me. I liked this enough I'd happily go out and buy a copy of this movie. I saw it on the small screen - I'd say this would be awesome on a movie screen.",The Matrix

How somebody came up with this idea is beyond me. It is the most original film ever. The Matrix won all 4 academy awards it was nominated. I think that Keanu Reeves and Laurence Fishburne both deserve an Oscar. This movie should have won best film, best script and best director. This movie also has the coolest action scene. In the Lobby. I can't wait for the sequels to come out. They could never be as good as the original though. FIGHT FOR THE FUTURE.",The Matrix

A really original plot too!I am of course, lying.The Matrix really wasn't all that great. The special effects, while being pretty good as they were, were: A) first seen in Gap adverts B) just there for the sake of it, and they really added nothing.As for the plot, I could see about three films from which it was seemingly stolen, the far superior Dark City on particular.The pathetic attempt at romance was disastrously tacked on at the end, for no reason, and Reeves's performance wasn't really that great.Just another big bad Hollywood nothing.

It has a great plot, brilliant performances; especially that of Laurence Fishburne(Morpheus) and Keanu Reeves(Neo) who is at his best. But best of all it has the most mind-blowing special effects and sounds to ever grace our screens, I mean they are amazing and it earned them 4 Academy Awards.This is in my top 5 favourite films of all time. All I can say to people out there who don't like this film, is that you are crazy and must have been on drugs while watching this film, because there are no faults in this film. The directing by the Wachowski brothers is excellent.Overall, if you haven't seen this film, do yourself a huge favourite and see it. It is likely to be the greatest sci-fi film you have ever seen.10 out of 10, 5 stars, 2 thumbs up",The Matrix
1275,youngjedi,The Greatest Movie Ever,10,14 January 2001,"The Matrix is, without a shadow of a doubt, the greatest movie ever.  Many movies come close (Star Wars, T2, Gladiator) but none match the raw power and impact of The Matrix's story and characters. What makes The Matrix so great is not just its originality or the fact that it merges so many genres of sub-culture into one nice little package, but its scope and meaning.  This movie tells us so many things-to know what we create is capable of, to not let technology become our master and not our slave, to take what we accept as the truth with a grain of salt.  It forces us to re-access the world around us, to ask questions instead of settle for answers.  How many other movies do that? If you are looking for an interesting diversion that will help you waste a few hours of your time, see The Fifth Element or Titanic,other fantsy/adventure and sci-fi films that have a lot of wrapping but no package underneath.  If you want a film that will make you think, make you question the world around you, make you look at the definition of reality in a whole new way, see The Matrix.",The Matrix

So, I expected to see a pretty good movie.  It was far from that.  It was perhaps the worst script I had heard in a very long time.  The directing was nothing memorable.  Photography was standard.  But what destroyed the movie was the acting.  Keanu Reeves was dull and totally lifeless.  Even Laurence Fishburne wasn't good(but how could he be good in such a terrible script).  There was no chemistry between any of the characters.  And overall, the movie was boring!  It hardly held my interest...

It's a real piece of art. It definitely has a ""bro philosophy"" aspect to it but I think it's executed to perfection and makes it wildly fun. I love it and it does get you pondering some of life's biggest questions, as most good sci-fi does.The overall aesthetic is undeniably cool and it's loaded with awesome characters and memorable dialog. Agent Smith is an all-time great movie villain and Morpheus is unforgettable. The casting was perfect all around and I can't imagine this movie with anyone else in it. The martial arts choreography and gun fights are incredible and still look absolutely terrific.The general premise isn't ""new"" but it brought a lot of different things together and really broke a ton of new ground. At 22 years old, the visual effects certainly show their age in some spots but overall hold up well and don't detract from the experience. It's a new classic for the genre and will be enjoyed for decades to come.",The Matrix

Reeves is at his surfer-dude turned computer geek best (I actually know guys just like him).  It struck me the Fishborne could have done either role just as convincingly, while Keano could only do the role in which he was cast.  The shows intelligence on the part of the casting director.This is probably my all time favorite movie overall.  A great thrill ride. A great head trip.

1284,gandalfwiz10,Neo is the One,9,5 July 2007,"Visually gripping. Mind-bending. A masterpiece of sci-fi, with a brilliant story-line. Nothing stands before it, except Star Wars when it comes to science fiction in cinema.Sure there are a good many ideas for science fiction, and many good movies for it too, like the Terminator, Alien etc. But none are as mind-bending as the Matrix. It involves a hacker by the name of Thomas Anderson, a competent hacker, who soons learns through various run-ins with the mysterious Agent Smith (Hugo Weaving) and the venerable Morpheus (Lawrence Fishbourne) and his followers that the world he lives in is a hoax, called the Matrix, and that the true reality is that humans are kept in control of artificial intelligence, robots in a word. Morpheus also imparts to him that he is the One, the One who will save them from this unknown slavery. A whole new world is opened up, and soon, Thomas Anderson morphs into Neo, And Neo is the One.Magnificent. I saw this movie after seeing Lord of the Rings and many other special effects powerhouses, and I wasn't as impressed as I ought to be by the Matrix, but still, I was amazed. The bullet-time was revolutionary, and the effects still stun me.The plot is often stretched in the beginning, but is still absolutely engrossing.The acting is quite good. Keanu Reeves, the hero, is overshadowed unfortunately by Lawrence Fishbourne and Hugo Weaving, who are magnificent in their roles as mentor and villain.Overall, a great REVOLUTIONARY movie. That is why is deserves its spot in the top 250. It revolutionized its genre, showing a deeper more complex side to science fiction.9/10",The Matrix

The choreography for the fight scenes was incredible, the special effects, the sound, everything was just about perfect. The best action sequence (!!!mild spoiler!!!) was when they rescued that black guy. That whole 20 min was just perfect. I had a few complaints though: First, It seems the whole idea of this movie was to become a setup for sequels rather than it itself being all that it could of been. for instance, (another mild spoiler) they never accomplished anything extordanary, except surviving long enough to get themselves out of there. not like star wars did. Also, they never had a ""main bad guy"", just a bunch of agents. second the last scene was a disapointment. as soon as he woke up he was just about invincible and that's never any fun. and third, i thought they could of put more work into making the ""Viruses"" look more realistic.

1286,MN_Movie_Critic,Failure of sequel not a surprise - since original wasn't anything special to me..,1,26 June 2003,"This may not be the worst movie of all time - but it does not belong anywhere near the TOP-100 list.  People that think highly of this movie are too eager to give the special effects (albeit original) way too much credit towards the actual worth of the movie. If it really was the ""story"" of the movie that attracted the crowds to the original, the 2nd movie would have done much better.  But since the effects are no longer ""special"" to a lot folks, it appears a lot of people are saying ""NO THANKS"" to seeing the sequel.  Which backs up my feelings on the first movie.  The story/acting was ok - but didn't WOW me in the least. Reeves is not a great actor - regardless of how much you adore him.",The Matrix
1287,wrsgold,A better film than its fans believe and great entertainment.,7,20 July 2002,"By that I mean there is far more to it than the average 13 year old appreciates. It is actually like Flip Wilson. Obvious, but with much more underneath than his fans ever knew. Nevertheless, its special effects have been borrowed by other films (without the logical underpinnings for those effects), but not its various premises (e.g., humans as a virus {not original but well expressed} and the world as a virtual reality {ditto}). Even Keanu Reaves seems less wooden than usual (how anyone can interview so well and act so stiffly is beyond me!). I doubt that it will be as influential as Blade Runner and it certainly isn't as beautifully shot, but it is quite good nonetheless. Even its fascist amorality is interesting. If one dies in the Matrix, one dies period. How many unsuspecting humans do they kill? True believers always think the lives of the ignorant are of no consequence. However, it does give one pause to think how easily this was ignored by the legions of fans.Highly recommended, though not exactly for the reasons most often expressed.",The Matrix

Thats not to say that I do not like Bill and Ted as I enjoyed both of them. But to have Reeves playing him in every film is a bit much.The story is boring and all the acting is poor. Why did they bother with this movie. If I wanted to watch a truly great sci-fi movie I would watch any of the Star Wars films.When watching this movie I broke into a cold sweat and started uncontrollably shivering - The film had made me ill.

After excepting the new truth Neo begins to fight Matrix and try to free human kind as a chosen One.
Definitely one of my favorite movies with great story and terrific cast and one of the movies that makes you think about life in general. The premise that everything is simulation even started a lots of conspiracy theories among people who even go that far to believe this to be accurate.
Apart from the great story we have a breakthrough special effects that still looks great today 20 years after the movie was maid.

Laurence Fishburne was very good. Hugo Weaving was excellent. Matrix is original, prototype sci-fi movie. The first movie of the trilogy was the best. I can not give less than 10 to this movie because the other two movies of the trilogy were not excellent. Many people say that Matrix reminds religions. Many other people say that maybe our world is in a matrix.Some opinions say that there is no chance our world to be a matrix because our creator will not allow us to realize this thing, but even if we realize that we are in a matrix what we can do? -Nothing!!!

This movie never once insults my intelligence.  It is well written.  All of the co-stars are equally as impressive in their roles.This movie keeps my attention from the beginning all the way to the end.

True, the special effects had a new look but that's pretty much all there is to it. Now those SFX are cliché and close to ridiculous. Look at Terminator II, now over twelve years old, the SFX are still ahead of today's standards.The story is basically a cross-over between the Terminator plot (also Blade Runner and a lot more sci-fi movies with the mankind overrun by machine and artificial intelligence idea) and the Dark City setting and ambiance (trench coats, an artificial city). This lack of originality is why, in my humble opinion, the movie's sequels didn't do as well. The acting is OK but far from good and the directing is the same as most 'hollywoodian' movies from the last ten years (IE lacking personal style. Seriously, what's the difference between a Wachowski bros. flick and a Roland Emmerich one?).I've tried to watch it again on several occasions but usually I end up fast forwarding to the main action scene and then turning the movie off and then I get the feeling that that scene resumes the entire movie; a lot of noise about nothing.",The Matrix

1296,fadedGlory,Disappoints upon reflection,4,2 March 2005,"The Matrix is not a bad film, it keeps you involved because of the slow uncovering of the complex and bizarre plot, the twist and turns as the movie unfolds, Agent Smith as the perfect baddie and of course the pretty wild action sequences. The atmosphere is suitably dark and the special effects are excellent. All good enough for a fine evening of movie entertainment, right? Unfortunately there are some rather big problems as well, and they really bug me the morning after watching the film. Truth is, I am really struggling with the plot. I am quite a fan of science-fiction so that in itself is not what bothers me. I don't even mind the questionable assumption that human bodies can be harvested for power generation without having to input more energy than they produce. No, the real doubt I have is simply: why this Matrix? Why do the machines even bother to go to such lengths as this incredibly complicated computer programme that makes humans think they have an actual life? Why not just let them rot in their pods and good luck to them? What do the machines get out of it? Surely it costs vast amounts of energy to keep this programme running and hook up all the humans to it? Why do they do it? What's the point? Also, why do Special Agents have any limitations at all? If they are computer programs, and the world they operate in is a computer programme too, why are they not simply all-powerful and invulnerable to bullets and other attacks? A computer programme has no physical limitations - anybody with a games console knows this. Why bother shooting at a virtual body with virtual bullets? I realise these are fundamentals required for the plot to work, but I find the problems a bit too glaring to overlook. When you think about it, this film is no more than an excuse for the (in themselves quite good) special effects. Therefore, in the cool light of day I can't give this film more than 4 stars.",The Matrix

To be honest I wasn't really expecting much, and what I saw from trailers etc. I did not think that this film would be to my liking. I thought that it might be high on style but low on substance. How wrong was I, when I watched the film everything all fitted into place, it wasn't about Keanu Reeves trying to look cool, it has got a lot more going for it, including some excellent twists and turns that took me by complete surprise. Some of these twists were so good that I had to evaluate what was going on at least once. One of the very few action films that can be classed as being intelligent as well as good fun.",The Matrix

It was the Matrix. He had rented it from Blockbuster. I was 10.Carrie-Anne Moss kicking ass. Doing weird stuff in leather- killing a squad of police officers, jumping over roof gaps, skydiving through a tiny window. I was riveted. Was she a mutant, or maybe some sort of superhero? Then she picks up a pay phone, and you hear that dial up sound I knew from the internet modem. It was really strange, because a man in a business suit runs over the phone booth with a 8 wheeler truck, but she has disappeared. & so on.

It put a new context to philosophical concepts like ""brain in the vat,"" ""free will vs. determinism"" & ""existential rebellion."" It was terrifying to think about: what if my whole life is an illusion? There didn't seem to be any way to prove it one way or the other. Many people have gone mad trying to think about it.The Matrix was the perfect movie for its time. Neo is the hero of my generation, a computer hacker taking on the machine, a Messiah with punk-rock values. In some ways, this movie is the antithesis of modern Christianity, because instead of 'life after death' the Matrix promotes 'truth on earth.' The hero questions everything, especially authority (Agent Smith). I went to a private Christian School, and I'm so glad I got to see this movie to counterbalance what was being forced into my head.There's so much more to touch upon. Morpheus' character. Cipher. Artificial Intelligence. The perfectly underplayed love story between Neo and Trinity. The big question: Why didn't the machines use a more obvious, easy, efficient fuel source, such as nuclear power? Why go through all the hassle of hooking up human beings to a virtual-reality world?I was very lucky to be born in 1989, right before the peak of Western Civilization. (According to Agent Smith.) I ask myself what was the most formative movie of my boyhood: the way I view society, thoughts about my place in the universe, my approach to love: Fight Club? The Truman Show? Dark City?Nah. It's got to be The Matrix.",The Matrix
1299,NQ-Mobile-Omar-Khan,Mindblown,10,20 January 2014,"When this movie first appeared in the theater I watched it without expecting that I would become so addicted to it. Since then I must have watched it over a hundred times. Why? Well because I couldn't understand it at first, so it took me 2-3 times just to understand what is going on. Not that I'm stupid or something, but every time I watched the movie with a different perspective in mind and ""a different pair of eyes"". This is one of those rare movies that makes you want to watch it again so you can see the beginning one more time and confirm the theory that you concluded in the end of the movie.The casting crew is great, although I don't know what will it have come out if Will Smith played the main character. The visual effects are groundbreaking for the 20th century and have set a standard for the CGI generations to come. Great story line, maybe one of the best futuristic story since... IDK... Star Wars, probably inspired by a bunch of Japanese anime/manga like Ghost in a Shell. That whole recipe mixed with great sounds/music makes an all time best!",The Matrix
1300,spencerallred,the special effects are spectacular,8,9 June 2014,the matrix stars Keen Reeves in a huge action film that has a lot of cool special effects the story in this movie might seem complicated first but it still pushes the plot forward within the first act of the plot. the story has a lot of interesting and entertaining plot points and sequences that we will never forget. the characters are somewhat interesting mostly this movie is sort of like a build up to the next 2 movies. i thought they had a nice screenplay has a nice of use of action. what makes this movie good is that the special effects has gone into a lot of detail to match up the thrill that it gives. the slow motion set pieces were done well and were done at the right time and rate for each frame of shot. i would recommend this movie into people that are action fans or thrill seekers.,The Matrix

1302,arsonistheway,"Some good ideas, some bad ideas, and horribly executed",1,19 July 2014,"Now let me start out by saying I have seen two movies by the Wachowski brothers ""The Matrix"" and ""Speed racer"". While in my opinion these films were both bad I am still willing to give ""Cloud Atlas"" and ""Bound"" a chance, but the subject of this review is ""The Matrix"". Now I will start out by saying the acting is just okay. Keanu Reeves' puts his one talent, looking very confused, to work quite nicely, so I can't believe the original consideration for this role was Will Smith. The rest of the cast does okay, but they don't have much to work with. Seriously, name one personality trait of any character. It's difficult isn't it? By the way I don't mean what the character does I mean what are they like. Next, I am sure the action was cool at the time, but there actually isn't much action. The one good action scene was lifted straight from the movie ""blade"" and bullet time was actually invented by the brilliant director Yasuomi Umetsu, just watch ""Kite"" and you will know what I mean. Plus the bullet time doesn't make the action any more exciting it's just there to look cool. The philosophy is somewhat interesting until you learn that it was all basically lifted from the film ""Ghost in the Shell"". In fact now that I think about it everything in this movie is like ""Ghost in the shell"" the visuals, the story, the totalitarian, but somewhat Utopian society, all of it. I could go on about the countless plot holes and everything else that is wrong with this mess, but I'm done for today.",The Matrix

The movie is very interesting, and keeps the viewer wanting more.  The middle gets pretty slow, or confusing, as they try to explain what The Matrix is and how it works (later on, you come to understand it pretty well).  The last hour or so absolutely blows you away, with some of the greatest action sequences/special effects ever filmed, and its a hell of a thrill ride.  All in all, this movie is a little over long, but it is undeniably worth seeing because of the great action scenes and stunning special effects.",The Matrix
1310,Amblin,"Has its moments, but so very few of them.",7,8 April 1999,"I was looking forward to seeing this flick, but was extremely disappointed when my hopes and aspirations disappeared into cyberspace just like The Matrix itself. Although the Warner/Village action/sci-fi does have its moments, most of the movie is just mindless computer hacking, computer talk, and make-believe environments made by computers. It reminded me of Johnny Mnemonic (yet another Keanu Reeves action/sci-fi). People have been bragging about the visual effects, but I'm thinking ""What is there to brag about anyway?"". The Sydney skyline is ever so recognizable, even though the makers attempted to cover it up by taking out certain landmarks. It's easy to see that the majority of this flick was shot in a studio, because 90% of it is dark and in-doors. It's also funny to note that the bad agents, aptly named Agent Smith and Agent Jones, dress like the MIB and have the same surnames as the actors who played them. The helicopter crash sequence was the only thing (apart from the gun fight in the lobby) that really stood out. You can understand why the ads for this movie just showed that chopper crashing into the building.....because what else is there to brag about?!",The Matrix
1311,Saint Just,Oh my God! This one has a story,10,29 May 1999,"I must admit I went to this movie expecting a lot of special effects with a story written by a two year old. How I was shocked. This one actually had a story to follow. Not the depth of some films, but very impressive for this kind of genre.Keanu Reeves (Bill and Ted) is very impressive in this film, but isn't he always? As for Lawrence Fishburne, well, a superb effort, making his character the best in the film. Australian Carrie-Anne Moss plays the part of the plastic wearing (remind you of catwoman???) martial arts babe with superb acting.What is the Matrix? Well I better not spoil it. But it does remind me of Lucas' 'the force!'This is a very impressive film, definitely tailor made for the big screen.Unfortunately the ending is a let down, there seemed to be something missing in it. Maybe it finishes a little too abruptly.Some never to be forgotten scenes and some good humor. And no action mainstream flick is incomplete with the romance. We wait a while, but it does add something to the film.Around and 7 or 8 out of ten for the Matrix - two marks off for the ending, one mark off for the fact that generally i don't like your mainstream action 'the hero seems to be bullet proof and the bad guys get unlucky kinda stallone or scharzenneger films! If I'm nice I might give it an extra mark for the fact that it had a story!",The Matrix

I read a bit on the net, saw the trailer, and it looked interesting, but I figured it could go either way. But wow... what a great movie.  All of us left wondering how soon we would be able to get the DVD.  This is one of those movies that makes you want to spend lots of money on a better home theater system.  The visuals were stunning and the sound & music were great.  Much fun was had by all!Guns, loud, sci-fi, kung-fu, great story, and killer special effects... what more could you want?

Keanu Reeves gives his best performance since his role in the Devil's Advocate. Carrie-Ann Moss is just plain excellent as Trinity. And Laurence Fishburn's performance as Morpheus is one of his best.

1315,Dantès,How many movies can we cram into one?,7,4 April 1999,"At several points during the film, I found myself thinking, ""hey, this isn't so bad"", but then I realized that I was getting suckered by the special effects and martial arts scenes.This movie is pretty average, with potential to be great, had it not ripped off of every other sci-fi movie there is. It's a great way to entertain yourself, trying to find all the other movies within the movie. For example, the idea of human resistance to the machines? Thank you 'Terminator'. There are also shades of Star Wars, Fire in the Sky, Dark City, Hackers... The list goes on and on.Keanu Reeves gives a typically wooden performance, but it's really just an action movie, so it's excusable. Laurence Fishburne excels in a sadly cliched role as Morpheus, who is essentially Yoda on Pentium.Basically, it's a matter of how you choose to take it. If it's just gratuitous special effects, and comic book-like plotlines, then it's very well done. However, in terms of originality, there is something sorely lacking. This is not a cerebral flick, so don't analyze too much or you'll hate it.",The Matrix

Of course, the kids loved the flick. It was loud and violent, yet full of the most advanced special effects around. As my friend observed, ""It was candy for the senses!""But he liked it better than I did. Albeit, the plot was surreal. (We always knew that reality was an illusion.) But MATRIX presented details regarding the cosmos and its ontological implications in a much different manner. Humans are mere crops being fertilized by machines who have evolved as our superiors.My friend gives the movie an 8/10 for style, creativity, and sensual intensity. I looked forward to going home and listening to soft, soothing music. If MATRIX is candy for the senses, I must be a diabetic.

The plot is far more comprehensible than I thought it would be from the looks of the previews.The film revolves around the character known as Neo (Keanu Reeves). A computer programmer / hacker who suspects that something is wrong with the world, and that something has to do with The Matrix. Unfortunately, he has no idea what the matrix is.I really don't want to give away any of the plot beyond this, because the mystery of it is part of the fun. This movie is well thought out, well acted, well directed, and just plain great. It also has quite a bit of humor in it.

The Matrix was a well thought-out movie, with fair acting and solid special effects. Some scenes reminded me of 'Fire in the Sky', and yes, it probably inspires itself from some other movies, but it adds enough innovation and original concepts for it to be in a league of its own. It'll certainly be a worthy DVD purchase. Check it out, unless you often have problem understanding movie plots.",The Matrix

I could see the word sequel screaming at me as the last scene unfurled. I'll stand in line to see the sequel too.

And, of course, with Kiefer Sutherland's overacting replaced by Keanu Reeves' underacting.The actors do solid jobs, but the film's real strength lies not with its (cardboard) characters, its (silly) plot, or its (derivative) ideas, but with its exceptionally well-executed action sequences, nicely enhanced by some impressive but not overdone special effects.

They have managed to forge the intensity of a top action movie, that would rival any John Woo classic, with the dark foreboding post-apocalyptic sci-fi view of the future. It is being compared with such classics as Blade Runner, and a cross between Dark City and Blade, but it is much more than all of those combined. Reeves finally finds a film to balance his talents without pointing out his limitations. If any criticism can be found, it would have to be that the script limited Fishburne's efforts. He should have been given more dialog to play with. If you see one movie between now and the new Star Wars, make it the Matrix.",The Matrix

This film has got action sequences, where John Woo can be jalous on. The acting is not very good, Reeves normally is pretty weak, but it doesn't matter here at all.

Should I see it as unpretentious entertainment (like wonderfull 'the Mummy')? No, because everyone is talking ssso ssserious all the time. And all sort of life philosophy stuff is thrown to my head. Should I see it as a timeless peace of art (like say a 'Kubrick')? Hahaha. Well it's a pity the life philosophy bits don't go beyond puberty stage then.

1327,Drooch,Essential Viewing,10,14 September 2000,"The Matrix will undoubtedly be hailed as a truly classic movie for years to come, reaching levels close to that of Star Wars. The two films (or sets of films) are both packed with spiritual truth, accounting for their timeless quality. It's the same reason we still love Shakespeare.When I first watched The Matrix something about the central ideas rang true inside me, they really hit home and intrigued me. (I'm aware that many people will read this and think I'm talking c**p but hear me out) in an attempt to find out more I studied various belief systems concerning 'reality' and the implications of fully controlling one's perception of it, eliminating doubt and fear, through pure belief in Self. The whole thing has led me into an intense inner journey and a total reassesment of life and its purpose. So Cheers to The Matrix for triggering the whole thing off. Whenever I watch it now I discover something new.In addition to all of that, the film is utterly stunning as a piece of visual entertainment. The fluid Woo-style violence is a pleasure to watch and the close-shave action sequences staple you to your seat. I love the way the first half of the film feeds you the theory and the second half treats you to the practice. This movie went beyond thought-provoking - I left that theatre a changed man.It may be dressed as a big, fat, money-hoarding, film studio product but the Wachowski's are simply using that as an effective vehicle through which to communicate this spiritual message to millions of people.

1328,CGarcia-2,Great special effects does not a great movie make!,6,3 January 2001,"What can be said about The Matrix that hasn't already been said about every other 90s MTV generation movie? You want special effects? You got it! You want action? You got it! You want violence? You got it! You want loud? You got it! You want characters you'll like? Um, look elsewhere! You want emotion in those characters? Um, look elsewhere! You want to root for the good guy? Um, look elsewhere! Let's face it. Today action movies rely on alot of bullets and computer generated effects, and acting is put on the back burner...Is it any wonder that most characters in the Matrix look and sound as if they got the typical Generation X labotomy before the cameras rolled? So robots are, yet again, at war with the humans who created them. I think The Terminator did it better, even a monotone Arnold shows more emotion than Keanu Reeves. The plot itself takes us into a dark world of reality that tells us our ""real"" world isn't real at all. Who would want to live in that dark world anyway? Why bother to fight the battle at all? I mean any logical person would rather live in this world we've been lied about, as opposed to the dark world that represents reality, and shows no hope for mankind. Something happened to motion pictures about 15 or 20 yrs ago. Fun science fiction programs like the original Star Trek, hammy acting, Romper Room props and all, made way for The Next Generation and brain dead acting, with the scripts to match...Somehow, society has been brainwashed into believing anything with great special effects is worthy of high praise. Sorry folks, I've been around for many yrs, and I know a classic when I see one. The Matrix is just more of the same, throw in a man vs. robot story, alot of gunfire, special effects and martial arts, and Hollywood will have another hit...They were right, but unfortunately, many of us have seen it all done much better before...Terminator's script blows away this rehash. The worst of the Bruce Lee movies gave us REAL kung fu magic(not some computer generated effects that mocks our intelligence). Next time, how about making us care about the characters a little, have a woman cry in a man's arms. Make us believe these people FEEL...Maybe then we'll find ourselves rooting for Keanu, instead of the robots. 6 stars out of 10. Mostly for special effects, that by now only contribute to put us to sleep.",The Matrix
1329,darwin-6,A visually spectacular existential ride...,7,14 November 1999,"This is one of the best movies of all time. How one may walk away from this flick unmoved is beyond me.Everything you know in life, even as you read this right now, is a result of the facts reported to you by your five senses. If life is fated, or a test, or a lesson...there is no need for those in control to actually create a physical world. They could simply manipulate these five input sources to create a world in your mind. You would never know the difference. This movie is a complete trip through the philosophical possibilities of life/reality... it has the audacity to pose big questions, and more importantly, it asks these questions within the scope of a tight and stunning visual escapade.You've never seen a movie like this one, its the antithesis of cheese.

1330,BigDog-18,I'm in the minority,4,12 November 1999,"I saw this film after hearing much hoopla and hype surrounding it's special effects. Always a fan of good Sci-Fi and well done special effects as well as a coherent plot and strong characters, I laid down my $. My first comment is that the special effects were outstanding. Extremly well done and (as opposed to some other films) an intricate part of the story. What was lacking was a coherent plot and strong characters. I was dissapointed that more explanation of the ""Matrix"" and it's reason for being were not explained in more detail. The movie is very dark and depressing. The scenes of Neo in some type of fetal-hybernation state with the tubes coming out of him were downright disturbing. Most of the actors give pretty standard performances and as usual, Keanu Reeves continues to underwhelm me with his ""Whoa"" style of acting. Quite frankly, I left the theater feeling uneasy and eager to see a bird, a green tree, people laughing, anything that would erase the depressing state the film put me in. Other films have moved me emotionally (Saving Private Ryan was gut wrenching to watch) but most always seem to end on a positive note or at least have me contemplating something positive. The Matrix had me grasping for the Zoloft. Action/Sci-Fi films need to get beyond their attempt at ""eye-candy"" entertainment and start providing something more substantial to leave us with. Thank goodness, George Lucas figured this out over 20 years ago with Star Wars.",The Matrix

The creators have imagined a totally plausible alternate plane of existence that these characters exist in and makes you wonder if we are all being pulled by some invisible strings. I for one liked Keanu Reeves performance, it needed to be understated because of what is about to be thrust upon him.

Not only was the acting great, all SFX were superb, like I never have seen before. The Phantom Menace has also great SFX but it's just a fairy tale, with no real story. When I walked out the cinema the first time, the first thing I did was look around....... The fact that the world as we know it is just sophisticated kind of virtual reality and nothing more.

For a whole new generation of movie goers and for older fans of Sci-Fi The Matrix was one of those movies you go back and watch again and again. An excellent mix of technology, acting, and story. How many of us today have not felt or wondered if this is all real? Does the Matrix have you? Classic lines from the movie which ask questions on several levels.Casting was excellent, direction was top notch, and the CGI was over the top. People will forget or have forgotten the new methods and techniques that the Matrix brought to us that we now see on TV and every other movie out on the screen today. A much better product then the next two Matrix movies. I would recommend both of those to hard-core fans of the The Matrix. So if you want a great action flick or a great action flick which will make you think the Matrix is the movie for you to watch.

It's not.  Keanu Reeves' acting is better here than in anything he has done before or since, but that's not saying much.  He does not make a good leading man and is easily eclipsed by the supporting cast (mainly Laurence Fishburne).My suggestion is if you want to see The Matrix then see it and enjoy it, but then go out and see far superior movies like ""12 Monkeys"" or even the ""The Cell"".",The Matrix

And I am not saying it doesn't have good action scenes, either, it has loads of that, and it does them fantastically, with great hand to hand combat scenes, and adrenaline-pumped shootouts.

Morpheus as John the baptist; Trinity as an interesting (though the name ""Trinity"" should have been a tip-off for even the most doltish viewer) Mary Magdala; Keanu Reeves as (gasp!) Christ. Not only is the acting putrid but the film relies mostly on special effects and this ridiculous plotline. If the viewer wants to see action, rent an old John Woo movie made in Hong Kong (The Killer and Hard Boiled spring to mind). If you want a movie with cool effects, catch The Bride had White Hair.

Heck they even have Philosophy courses that use the movie for examples. It's that good. And, of course the Bullet-Time is awesome. Thanks to Sxean Lee-David for helping creating the Idea of using 3 dimensional rotating cameras, the Wachowski's merely had the money and talent to do it, and called it ""Bullet-time"". So there you have it. I must've watched the movie dozens of times. Presently, I heard that Sxean and the Wachowski's are conjuring up a new movie, code named, ""The Axis"".

1344,david-dtn,Open your mind to the matrix,10,21 March 2007,"Im not going to elaborate too much on the plot of the Matrix because there are whole websites and even books devoted to the subject. The story revolves around the main character Neo and his evolution from lonely computer hacker to the savior of the human race. Part of this evolution is the realization that not all is as it seems in the reality in which he lives in. If your any way philosophical or just like a good sci-fi you cannot go wrong with the matrix. There's a strong religious sub text apparent within the story and a lot of Neo's actions and decisions seem to mirror that of Christ. It can also be looked at as an allegory of modern day society and the control governments have over their citizens. Whatever way you look at the matrix it will make you think below the surface of the pretty visuals and the dynamic actions scenes. These range from martial arts face offs against ""agents"" to post apocalyptic worlds inhabited and controlled by strange machine like creatures. The Matrix has a visual style like no other and it deserves its spot in the top 250 films just for the story alone.Keenu Reeves was born for this role and delivers a very subtle but effective portrayal of of Neo while Hugo weaving seems like he was having fun playing the bad guy Agent Smith, Neo's nemesis. The score is high tempo filled with modern dance and electro tracks. They fit perfectly and come alive during the adrenaline filled fight scenes. This is one film you really shouldn't miss. I've seen it at least ten times and each time i discover something that i missed the first time. Its a deep film with its own universe and philosophy that many people (fans of sci-fi or not) will be fascinated by.",The Matrix
1345,pjcarline,"Originality, quality, excellence.",8,10 October 2002,"What is The Matrix?It is the future, and apocalypse has narrowly been avoided following war between man and machine.  Humans are now enslaved; they are merely individual power cells, each kept alive by living' within a computer programme  The Matrix.  Thomas A. Anderson (Keanu Reeves), exists as a program writer by day and as Neo, an infamous computer hacker, at night. Following his curiosity and the instructions of Trinity (Carrie Anne Moss), Neo is lead to Morpheus (Lawrence Fishburne), the leader of a small band of freedom fighters.  Danger lurks in the form of Sentinels and Agents, both programmed by the Matrix to seek out and destroy free human life.  Under the guidance of Morpheus, Neo begins to explore a life of dual existence, discovering the truth about himself and the surrounding world.
The Matrix succeeds in being both intellectually and visually stimulating. Revolutionary fight scenes and state of the art special effects are matched by a high-tempo script, and a comic book style, which keeps the audience on tenterhooks. Although firmly based in science fiction, The Matrix is not limited to this genre, as it explores martial arts, philosophy, religion, humanity and love.  Fishburne is excellent as the profound Morpheus, likewise Weaving as the eerie Agent Smith, and even Reeves convinces as the wide-eyed Neo.  Direction is slick, with impressive camera work, a good supporting cast and a genuinely unique feel.  The Matrix is an influential and groundbreaking film, which deserves to be regarded as a masterpiece of modern cinema.",The Matrix

I was not the only one who had this opinion. The person I was with kept laughing at the same time I did. Keanu just doesn't do it for me. Every serious look that he tries still has an air of Bill S. Preston, Esq. (or was he Theodore ""Ted"" Logan?).I saw it when it first came out and hated it then.

Boy, how wrong was I?! I first borrowed it from someone and when I watched it I thought ""Oh my god I've missed so much!"". I was totally blown away by it!From Trinity's slow-mo kick to Neo's bullet dodging I was exhilarated not because of the film's plot (even though the plot is very good) but because I realised where all the slo-mo and bullet time (especially from Max Payne) came from. The most interesting character (and I'm sure most people will agree with me) is Agent Smith; he is so very suave and cool. Don't you just love that black suit and tie!

What if all what we are living is a lie? What if all what we know about physics and all our life experiences are just an illusion? What if some higher intelligence is using us ? What If all what surrounds us is only a fiction made and maintained by a higher beings we only serve without knowing? What if all our prophets and deity were people who could see that reality and who did give us some indications of the ""truth"". Now how can you top an idea like that. It is over. That's it.

Keanu Reeves is perfectly cast as Thomas Anderson who is sort of a nobody until he meets Trinity. His acting style completely suits his character who is completely lost at first in the world of the Matrix. Lawrence Fishbourne and Carrie Anne Moss both do good jobs as well but Hugo Weaving provides the best performance as Agent Smith who is a character you won't forget.The action scenes are stunning and they owe a lot to CGI but that doesn't ruin the film as it is only ever used when there is no choice.This is a great film that deserved it four Oscars and it shall always be remembered for revamping the action genre.

It is from a completely different era where action and scifi movies didn't require a comic book, or even novel, origin. I love many of those movies, but there is just something about a totally unique plot with compelling characters you've never heard of.I was quite young (which makes me old now I guess) when the movie came to theaters. I only had to watch one trailer that showed before another movie to say to myself... I just gotta see that.I was fiscally challenged at that age and I was already sitting down to watch one of the two or three movies I could afford to go see a year and a new Star Wars movie was just on the horizon and there was no way I was going to miss that. (In hindsight I would have gladly waited for a DVD release lol) Boy was it worth every valuable penny. I told myself, and my date, that I couldn't afford popcorn or candy and encouraged a little purse smuggling if she just couldn't go without. Despite not having any of the usual bonuses that generally improve movie going experiences, including that old fashion mid movie make out session that was a little more common back then, it was possibly the best theater trip I have ever made.It's sad that no one is likely to get to see this movie in theaters again, and even if they did the special effects wouldn't have the same impact that they did at that time. The Matrix gave me the best movie going experience that I ever had to that point, and it has still never been topped. And since the wonder of special effects is almost blase now it is unlikely that it ever will.If you are young and have never seen The Matrix and you think that the special effects and action scenes wouldn't impress you in this day and age see it anyway. You'll likely learn something about what truly makes a movie great. The Matrix isn't modern anymore, but it's a classic now. Watch it and you'll probably agree.",The Matrix

It seems like this is more of a child's version of the idea, rather than a possible sophisticated movie, which could have broken alot of barriers had it not been so simplistic. The movie seems to beckon forward to those pale-faced teenagers who've actually liked the thousands of tired conspiracy episodes on ""X-Files"" - It's all there, and is in fact best described as somewhat of the fantasy of the socially inactive computer-freak. This so-called computer-freak portrayed by kiano is suddenly thrust into realization that he is living inside an unreal world, a world that was designed for him and the other humans, but in fact he is the most powerful in that world, and that in his skills (which actually translate into computer skills, may I add) will help him save the world from obscure ""agents"" which seem to operate under no logic (They are programs, but seem disturbingly unlike programs, especially when existing in a pre-programmed world), hoping to assumingly ""shut-down"" these ""illegal"" hackers into the matrix. I'm not a psychologist, but aren't these the general guidelines of a typical pre-mature male fantasy? So what is the Matrix? In my opinion, a movie with much potential, wasted as an appeal to a certain audience, which will probably misunderstand or misinterpret the deep meaning that the original idea held within.Perhaps I am mistaken, and it was in fact an appeal to the majority, and I simply misunderstood. Therefore I do not presume to know exactly what the majority thinks, and perhaps other comments will set me straight.",The Matrix

1370,mic check,Reality is a thing of the past.,8,17 May 2000,"What is the Matrix? A top-notch, balls to the wall, ingenious, visually expansive and stunning, exquisitely crafted hard sci-fi film that also happens to be exceptionally well made and very entertaining. Questions about Keanu's acting chops aside, The Matrix is jammed with effects, well-choreographed fight sequences, and some amazing acrobatics by Reeves, Fishburne, and Moss. The plot is full of holes, naturally, and the dialogue is typically lowbrow and terrible but who really cares? This is cerebral popcorn at its most highly developed, a plate of eye candy lovingly delivered with gasoline eyedrops.I liked it.Keanu plays Neo, a computer nerd whose life is turned upside down when he is brought into the bizarre world of Trinity (Moss) and Morpheus (Fishburne). He jumps into a classic mind-trip and has to sort out his situation. While it would be very uncool to tell you what the Matrix is, understanding that virtual worlds are involved helps immensely. Essentially, Keanu and crew can bend their reality in one of the worlds but find themselves being chased by computer-generated agents intent on keeping the secret of the Matrix intact in the other.The power exhibited by the three main characters (Keanu, Lawrence, and Carrie-Ann) is explosive and awe-inspiring. The trio of actors did most of their own stunts and the results are striking. They trained for seven months with martial arts experts and it absolutely pays off. With the addition of some dead time cinematography and film speed tweakage, the fight scenes are nothing short of beautiful.In fact, just about every inch of this flick could be framed and put on a wall.The film does have a few faults though. You've got to decide whether the lack of a well-constructed plot and sometimes silly dialogue will bother you. Like Blade, this flick definitely chooses style over substance. Still, it is light years ahead of some of Hollywood's normal drivel. There are frequent moments when you start to poke holes in the plot but the filmmakers quickly remedy that situation with another fight or effects scene. While the film literally drips with Hong Kong-style wire acrobatics, it also has the lovely all-encompassing darkness of Dark City.At the pub last night discussing this film with Gaz and Chen, we started rattling off other action films that were nearly perfect: Die Hard, the first Lethal Weapon, and much of Face/Off. While The Matrix is far from perfect, it is certainly one of the more memorable flicks to come down the action transom in years.",The Matrix

It's the first entertaining movie I've seen in a while (maybe I don't get out as much as I should).",The Matrix
1372,Brain of J,Even better the second time around...,9,1 April 2000,"Just saw it again for the first time since the original theatrical release. I guess the Oscar hype and whatnot got me thinking about it again. Man, those were some crazy special effects. It seems to me that if they are going ahead and making it into a trilogy, then this may become the Star Wars of the techie universe.Good fun.",The Matrix
1373,Snagair,Pleasant Surprise,8,4 April 1999,"First allow me to explain that I had no intention of EVER watching this film.  I try to avoid Keanu Reeves' movies if possible.  He is not one of my favorite actors.  In fact, he is one of my least favorite.  The trailers for The Matrix were horrible.  In a nutshell, they invited you to see the movie for the great special effects.  Whoopeee!!  I hate it when movies rely heavily on one thing to drive the story.  Be it special effects, explosions, sap, whatever, that is not enough to make me enjoy the film.  Sure, Star Wars had some of the best special effects of its time but it is the story everyone loves.  The only reason I agreed to watch The Matrix is because a friend really wanted to see it and offered to pay my way.This is a good movie.  The fight scenes are very well done.  The effects are as awesome as advertised.  Keanu Reeves does an adequate job.  And I am a big fan of Laurence Fishburne.  What did it for me, though, was the background story to the film.  It was an interesting concept and even moderately believable.  Overall, this is a very solidly done movie, one I would recommend.",The Matrix
1374,Manos-6,Perfect 10,10,9 April 1999,"All right, let's get one thing straight. Anytime a movie comes out that gets most of its attention from its special effects, people will start complaining, ""Oh, they did great with the effects, but the story will probably be lame(Twister, for example.) But The Matrix had one of the most original and compelling stories of all time. The Special FX were wonderful and will set a new standard on how to create good FX. The normally terrible actor, Keanu Reeves, pulls off a good performance for once, and Laurence Fishburne is good as always. This movie was perfect and deserves a perfect 10.",The Matrix

There, I've said it. To question the realness of reality is a 400-year old Cartesian idea. Actually, it was explored more interestingly in the old Star Trek episode ""Spectre of the Gun"" in 1969. The rest of the film is an obvious rip-off of ""The Terminator"" and all of John Woo, which are far more interesting movies. The film ponders too long on the central premise, and there isn't enough action to make it a good action movie, either. Still, overall production design is great, but the acting is wooden, and Fishburne makes for an unconvincing guru. All the good scenes were revealed in the trailer, so there's not much else to do than just sit in the theatre and feel patronized by the whole thing. At least, that's what I did. The whole thing just isn't half as clever and original as it wants to be.",The Matrix

It could have been a wonderful exercise in paranoia, a Philip K. Dick kind of tale, but instead the film-makers opted for the Jerry Bruckheimer school of storytelling; there's nothing really wrong with that but I just thought the film had the opportunity to be something more, and I'm puzzled that this film's ratings don't reflect that.Many films now just seem to be demonstration reels for cgi and there should be more to sci-fi films than that. I don't think that people will be raving about this film in ten, fifteen years or so in the same way as they do about BLADE RUNNER now, a film many viewers seem to think is inferior to THE MATRIX.

Here's 1999's: The Matrix.  Whether it's the hokey idea of robots using humans as batteries rather than harvesting power chemically or geochemically, the dissolution of the trying-to-be-hip science fiction movie plot into a typical action/shoot-'em-up vehicle, or the bedamned Hollywood ending, there's much to annoy the serious film-viewer in The Matrix. Its basic plot (human discovers he's in a faked, alien-generated reality/ discovers he has super-powers to fight aliens) was used in 1998's Dark City, a more stylish film that also suffers from a Hollywood-esque ending.

1390,T Sirois,Entertaining,4,5 November 1999,"The move was entertaining... that's about it. I expected bad and (God I hate to use this word, the word that is the staple of any critic, but in this case its so accurate) 'uninspired' acting by Keanu Reeves, and got it.  ""Woah"" couldn't save this movie but obviously special effects did. Hate to break the news to you but Matrix's story line is entertaining but hardly original.  (I'd give an example but it might spoil the plot?) But, take any of the great SCI-FI movies of the 50's most of em have the exact same plot but some still stand out. The acting was dull, it really was, Larry Fishburne tried, VERY hard to make it interesting but it was just so pitiful.  A good actor like Larry F looked SO out of place in this thing. Entertaining though? Sure, very. The action sequences (though I still think there were too few of them) are some of the best I've ever seen.  The CGI effects were outstanding as well. Sometimes that's all you need in a movie.   Take, say, Predator.  Fun movie, I loved it, not a mecca of acting either, but I liked it better cause it set out what it was supposed to do, better than the Matrix. Is it better than Terminator? or T2? No. I don't think so. Actually I can't quite decide, was there not enough action to offset the dialogue? or was there enough action and the dialogue just slowed the movie down too much to make it appear that way?  It could go either way I suppose. With a better actor, and dialogue that didn't slow the movie down as if it had stepped in molasses, it could've blown most any other action movie dead out of the water.  I can't say enough how it would kill me that each time I'd see some of the most complex, well paced, outstanding action sequences (the hotel lobby for one being one of the greatest in a movie ever) to be shot to hell by bad acting in and dull dialogue. The action overshadows that enough though to make this movie worthy to watch at least once, that and the DVD kicks A@@ too.",The Matrix

1395,Jurado,"Philosophy, the Nintendo way.",3,25 July 2000,"This film is easily the most overrated flick of 1999. Okay, it looks stunning and the effects are unbelievably good but the plot and it's sensitivities are on a par with any indistinguishable installment of Star Trek(whatever series). This would not be so bad if this film was purported to be a good action movie (which it is) but it also seems to think it is a valuable and deep statement about the human condition (it is not) and even that would not be so bad if a lot of people didn't think it was. The movie exploits a few fears people share in today's society.  Fear of technology (the machines have taken over) Fear of annihilation (the world is a wasteland, physical or emotional) and plain Fear of being Boring (just a cog in the machine, unimaginative,... et al). Just as  any  average Joe or Joe-ette can for a few hours imagine him or herself to be an invincible starship captain or a bigbreasted, ponytailed woman searching for hidden treasures so the Matrix gives us a picture of how we would like to be, not a simple man or woman trying to get by but someone who can rock even reality itself.  Meanwhile all the fans of this film come out of the movie theatre seemingly feeling enlightened in some kind of way and then go home to play the videogame and then go to sleep to be on time for their job the next day. This is simply an escapist film with a waferthin veneer of depth and almost cynically so. In short I have nothing against the film itself but I do object to the fact that it claims to be more than an sci-fi action film. If you think this is a deep film throw away your gamepad and go read a book (preferably not one of the .... for dummies kind).",The Matrix
1396,magnetic84,Whoa!,8,14 August 2000,"This is a must for anybody. The Matrix works both as an action movie, but also as a thinking man's movie. This is one of the best movies to combine the two together.   The acting is incredible all around. Carrie Ann-Moss, Laurence Fishbourne, and Joe Pantaliano are incredible. Hugo Weaving as Agent Smith is perfect as the emotionless Government Agent trying to find Neo. This was also one of the most underrated roles of 1999 and Hugo Weaving deserved some award for his work. The only acting dissapointment is Keanu Reeves. If only he could have worked at lowering his accent, he would have been better. The Wachowski Brothers wrote an incredible script with likeable characters, especially Mouse, Trinity, Tank, and Switch.

I thought they'd be right, since most of the time they have the same taste as me (or they eventually will get the same taste as me, as for Star Wars, which they didn't really like at all at first, but now they do ^_^) so I thought this movie would be dull and boring.I was positively surprised. The story is actually really good, and so is the acting. I'm not a fan of Keanu Reeves, but he was great as Neo. Same for Carrie-Anne Moss and Laurence Fishburne. The much-talked-about special effects are really great as well.There were some flaws though, in my humble opinion. Much of the dialogues were just too cliché, as were some of the characters (Cypher, Tank). Sometimes the movie got a little bit dull (at about half of the movie) but towards the ending it got better again. Still, as I said, not bad at all.8/10",The Matrix
1411,Cryogenic,Insulting piece of garbage,5,9 May 2005,"Well, OK, not quite.To call ""The Matrix"" an ""insulting piece of garbage"" completely shortchanges its many triumphs: its great hook of a story, its snazzy editing, its addictive style, its clever blend of philosophical tidbits, and last but certainly by no means least, Hugo Weaving and his devastatingly funny monologues as Agent Smith.Still, if you'll excuse the pun, The Matrix has a single scene that makes the entire endeavour a tough ""pill"" to follow.When Trinity and Neo - decked out in full ""cyber punk"" regalia (shades, black clothing, big boots) - arrive in the government building to rescue Neo, they callously pull out their weapons and mow down the security staff in attendance. Normal human beings. Doing their job. And killed for what? A lengthy action montage follows - one of the film's signature scenes - with yet more gun play, wire work, slow motion and highfaluting pseudo Kung Fu action. This is where the film completely loses me.A film in which normal people are killed by another character, even a central character with zero emotion (e.g. The Terminator in the film of the same name) does NOT bother me. A film in which normal people are killed by other characters, one of which we are told is the saviour of the human race and equated with no less than Jesus Christ, does. At this very point, The Matrix crystallises its underlying themes and aggressively punctures them right through the canvas: anarchy is good, order is bad; fear the government; hate capitalism; do whatever is necessary to bring down ""the system"". Neo's earlier life as Mr Thomas A. Anderson is expressed more comically than seriously as it unfolds (a scene of him getting grilled by his boss to the accompaniment of the noise from a window wiper is hilarious) - but once the lobby scene has played out, it and many other elements within the plot line of The Matrix take on a darker tone. Nilhilism is the name of the game; since the simulated world of the matrix is implicitly ""our"" world and Morhpheus tells Neo/us that anyone who hasn't been ""unplugged"" is effectively an enemy, it seems to grant the character a license to do whatever he pleases and to do it to whomever he chooses. Linking real-world violence with entertainment mediums such as computer games and films is a tenuous and possibly futile action; however, one cannot help but ponder what part this scene played in the Columbine High School shootings. Clearly, the perpetrators were warped beforehand: but they called themselves the ""Trenchcoat Mafia"" and committed their crime the month after The Matrix went on release in the USA. No doubt some of the victims had seen it, too, but does that excuse the film-makers for being so irresponsible with their shoddy moral paradigm? Food for thought.All in all, it's hard to accept the film as a genuine piece of Science Fiction when its themes are so one-sided and joyless. There is a palpable contempt for the working man all the way through and the lobby scene only reinforces it. Not once are we shown the importance of earnest employment and keeping society afloat; it's subversion, subversion, subversion all the way. It doesn't help that Keanu Reeves' performance is so lifeless and listless that a dead fish has more personality. The inclusion of a tacky and wholly unconvincing romance between Neo and Trinity just seals the deal. In fact, the romance is proof positive that the movie is completely lacking a heart and soul. There's absolutely no humanity to be had anywhere. And if it saviours I want... I'll take the humane, tolerant, peace-loving, intelligent, charismatic, impassioned man from the Bible who isn't about hurting anyone but also isn't afraid to show some emotion and flip over a bunch of tables over this false messiah any day.When all is said and done, is The Matrix worth watching? Sure. But its overly bleak, dystopic, anarchic view of the world makes stomaching it a chore. Don't let all the hype fool you: this is no classic. The ridiculously overblown sequels, ""The Matrix Reloaded"" and ""The Matrix Revolutions"", are even more soul-sapping.

Perheps the brothers know what they are talking about, after all you should ask yourself : How Do You Define Real. And the answer is simple: If you're talking about what you can feel. . .. . .what you can smell, taste and see. . .then ""real"" is simply electrical signals interpreted by your brain. We are living in the world thats is full of questions. Some of them can be answered many can not. So when You are watching this movie try to except it as something what could be real, if we knew what real really is. The Matrix is an entertaining movie whit a lot of action an CGI. Some people only like those two, but most of us see this as so much more. Things that happened every day are hard to explain so people explain them by saying god had something to do what that, so ask yourself can it all be true. That we are living in a computer system thats been made to keep us under control... Perhaps its not exactly as it is shown in the matrix, but there is a chance because people are so blind to see the truth that they believe anything they are made to believe...Now the acting in the matrix is quite god for a sci-fi. Except maybe Keanu is at his usuall-self. Fishburne was very good at his part, together with Carrie and Hugo. But as is was said it is the story that made this film my favorite.The CGI are a breakthrough. Even the mighty Phantom menace was not up to the challenge. Whit Bullet-time as a trade mark it has been 1 of the most copied movies in the last 6 years. Bullet time has been sine in over 22 movies after the release of The Matrix.There are so many things to see in the matrix, if u only keep your eyes open an look at it as SOMETHING THAT COULD BE REAL, IF WE KNEW WHAT REAL REALLY IS. 10 out of 10",The Matrix
1416,RichardRowell328,True Cinematic Achievement,10,30 January 2005,"In the year 1999, ""The Matrix"" and ""Fight Club"" were undoubtedly the best films of the year. The Matrix was truly revolutionary in special effects, specifically in CGI (Computer-Generated-Imaging) technology. The still cameras that were used to capture multiple angles of a single shot, in bullet-time technology, was a creative new approach. The film is initially suspenseful with people not knowing quite what was happening until Morpheus (Lawrence Fishburne) reveals that Neo's (Keanu Reeves) reality was actually a fabricated world that is an elaborate simulation created by machines. Neo and the majority of the world's inhabitants have been stuck in simply a mental simulation prison. The magnitude of philosophy in sync with special effects make ""The Matrix"" a one-of-a-kind movie masterpiece. College classes show this movie in their philosophy class, and at the same time can prove to be one of the best special effects movies ever. Supplementally, ""The Matrix"" also provides endless action and a pretty solid storyline that influences the philosophical ideas in the movie. There are so many great things in this movie, it is just crazy.The color palette along with the time and effort put into stunts also accelerates this movie on all filming levels. ""The Matrix"" leaves the viewer a sense of pride in the world he/she can live in to just know that people are capable of creating at this level. Unfortunately, monetary and timing motives offset the potential quality of the sequels. ""The Matrix Reloaded"" and ""The Matrix Revolutions"" were just a waste of time and weren't carefully thought out, as was the first Matrix. 10/10",The Matrix

Its execution left me initially bored, then irritated, then frustrated, then screaming for the exit. I guess I'm not de-sensitized enough to be able to get into the casual destruction of life, just because it's not the reality we think we know.There is no reality, I agree. There are truly some wonderful concepts to explore in the initial idea to this film.

Of course, Mr. Fishburne was awesome too! Keanu was his usual good-looking self, not a great actor but not bad either. At least he's good eye-candy! Great dramatic action movie! I have to say Keanu has come a long way from Bill & Ted's Excellent Adventure. Laurence is great in anything he does. Fantastic visual effects! All in all a gripping movie!

No doubt the best film in the Matrix Trilogy, it never fails to keep the viewer interested. The film, despite it's complicated premise, has very few plot holes, other than miutia. Plus it's ideas have never before been explored, so how can we question them. All in all, an amazing film with great performances, especially by Hugo Weaving and Lawerence Fisburn. What can I say?

I find this part of the movie particularly nicely done. A great answer to the question: ""What form would human faith take in a world in which humans are less than slaves to thinking machines?"" I think this also has to do with the fact that the best piece of acting is given by Laurence Fishburne, who depicts quite well a ""man of faith"".The whole disquisition about what is reality and Neo waking up to learn that his whole life has just been an induced fantasy are just too juicy not to love!Some acting in it is not first rate, but the rest of the film (everybody knows that the visual effects set a breaking point in cinema history) carries it greatly.It is difficult to believe that this jewel came from the same minds that gave us the enormously disappointing Matrix II and III.",The Matrix

1423,gamermx-73830,"Master piece, period.",10,20 April 2017,"Today I decided to see this film, the work of the Wachowski sisters. My desire to see this piece of film was born just yesterday that I saw Keanu Reeves in John Wick 2. I had already seen Matrix Revolution in an already non-existent cinema in my hometown of Zacatecas. By that time I was just a boy about 4 years old and all I remember is Neo dodging bullets with his characteristic black glasses. I had heard a lot from Matrix, but I really knew very little, I thought it was a science fiction thing, and I was wrong. Matrix is ​​ something very well achieved, because it has drama, action, romance, suspense and plot in little more than two hours. As the movie progressed, I remembered more of The Fight Club, which is a film starring Brad Pitt that constantly questions the system. Matrix is ​​ somewhat similar, although it has a different approach, the result is the same, wondering about life. What is real? It is the central question of the film. There are Neo, Morpheus and their associates, who are firm in that the real is outside the Matrix, but for their part, there are also Cypher and the agents who defend the Matrix and consider it as real and absolute. The development of the story around this question is magnificent. Leaving aside the explicit in the Matrix, its content goes much further. Neo represents the chosen, becomes the Jesus Christ that can save the world and destroy the Matrix, is something close to the superman. Also in Matrix you can see something about the methodical doubt of Descartes, doubting even of the own existence. By the above, the Matrix could be considered as a philosophical work, which brings philosophy to the ordinary citizen. The reflection and the learning that leaves us the film is important. At the end of the day, one has to try to leave the Matrix, dodging the thousand and one ways that exist to distract us, to manipulate us and make us more flimsy. We must find our way and modify it to our liking, always guided by an oracle, called love, knowledge or religion.",The Matrix

The internet was gaining popularity, the dot com bubble was about to collapse, and Sci-Fi movies were getting better.Fast forward almost 20 years after this movie was released and we have a dystopic future that is just like this movie predicted.This movies main catch was the blue pill/red pill argument. Does Neo take the blue pill and stay a slave to the system or does he take the red pill and break himself free of this slavery that's called The Matrix. The movie is very Orwellian in nature and with technology having come along 20 years after this film was released I think it's safe to say that this movie did an amazing job at guessing what was to come later on.The action scenes, dialogue, and plot are all amazing. The cast is amazing. The soundtrack is amazing. This is probably one of the best Sci-Fi's of all time behind the Aliens and Predator movies respectively.

next movies: good action, but both movies has no new idea and were some how boring to me .the real world was more artificial than matrix , maybe it was better that they wake up in other world and release this world was another virtual world like a game .this short review is my opinion at this time (today i watched this movie for first time ), but there is no doubt that this movie is one of the most influential movies of all time.",The Matrix
1428,flowasis,Very good and creative.,10,6 April 1999,"While not your normal movie, The Matrix provides a very fascinating look at another futuristic standpoint. The movie provides an excellent cast, a very well structured and creative story, and directing that spans past a standard filmmaking process. I'm not a big fan of action movies in that lack of story to give us more gunshot scenes and explosions kind of way. The Matrix, however, is action, gunshot scenes, and explosions movie in a different kind of way. This is not the normal action movie shootout scenes, no pointless or horrendously oversized explosions, no cheesy lines or bored two-dimensional characters. This movie is truly an excellent idea that didn't suffer cutbacks or cliche events to score a quick profit. One of the things I liked about this movie was the complexity of the story line. This isn't a movie that spoon feeds you the information your brain requires to understand what's going on. You do have to think, and that's one thing I liked about it. The movie starts out fast, and ends with goose bumps. This is a movie that wets your appetite for more and satisfies your cravings until you're completely infatuated by its composure.

1437,Wes-26,"""One of the Top 5 Sci-Fi Movies Ever Made!""",10,4 April 1999,"What is 'The Matrix'?  Well part of that you have to find out for yourself, but the other part I can tell you.  'The Matrix' is, by far, the best Sci-Fi movie in the last 15 years.  Do you remember the feeling you had while watching George Lucas's 'Star War'?  If you do, then that is the feeling you get when watching 'The Matrix'.'The Matrix' is a film concept by the Wachowski Bros.  Right from the start you are blown away.  The special effects immediately grab you.  As does the martial arts fighting.  But, the exception to this is that 'The Matrix' doesn't take the fighting or effects overboard.  Right when you think the battle will never end, the film gos right back into the story of discovery. Even the story, by itself, is enough to keep you watching.  And, right when the movie slows down, it speeds right back up again.  This movie is contrast used in perfect form.The stars themselves are an eyeful.  Keanu Reeves plays Neo, the chosen.  To be honest, I have never really liked Reeves.  I never thought he had the talent to be a great actor, and, although his acting isn't perfect, he does play the part perfectly.  Laurence Fishburne plays Morpheus, Neo's guide into the world of 'The Matrix'.  I have always loved Fishburne.  He is smart and plays the knowledgeable leader perfectly.  Carrie-Anne Moss plays Trinity.  Her character, at first glance, is not that important, but, as the movie goes on, you understand just how vital she is to the story.  One more character to point out is Hugo Weaving's Agent Smith.  He is as menacing as he is dark, and that is saying a lot.I won't dwell on this too long, but I must say that this movie is almost revolutionary in a sense.  I don't want to tell you the plot, and to go on and on about the effects would be boring.  But, what you must know, is that 'The Matrix' is perfect from start to finish.  You will not want it to end. You will want to go back for more.  What is 'The Matrix', you ask...Well as in the words of Morpheus, ""No one can be told what the Matrix is, you have to see it for yourself.""",The Matrix

The special effects are top notch, especially during the fight scenes and so is the acting.  Newcomer Carrie-Anne Moss delivers the role of Trinity with enough attitude and sympathy to fit the part perfectly.  Keanu Reeves improves his somewhat hit-and-miss resumé with another gem and excellent role (as Neo) that will open more doors for him and perhaps give him more respect as an actor.

1441,Obsidian-4,Concept-10...Effects-9...Violence-3...Plotting-4,8,27 April 1999,"I think this film presents a fantastic, top-notch, classic sci-fi premise. The truth about the Matrix and how it unfolds is, to me, the strength of this film. It doesn't fully explain itself and leaves one with a lot of questions, especially about the relationship between the different realities, and why actions in one affect the other as they do. But I don't think that these gaps ruin the integrity of the concept. What DOES spoil this integrity is the needless overloading of one's suspension of disbelief. Was it really necessary, and did it further the story in any way to include an unexplained resurrection? Or to allow the destruction of the ship to go on for so long while it's crew and equipment remain totally undisturbed? These are only two of the many instances where, apparently because someone thinks it ADDS to the suspense and excitement, a gripping situation is over-played to the point where it becomes too much work to keep trying to buy into it. The special effects are incredible. The look of the movie is strong. The cast is up to the job, even stone-faced Keanu. My only other gripe is the usual excess of bullets, and of violence that has no effect. I would think that it was obvious to film-makers now, especially after Private Ryan, that the way to make your movie violence effective is to give each and every ""movie bullet"" the action and effect of a real bullet. The choreography is nice, but the pounding music, the cascade of cartridge shells, and the piles of bodies becomes both numbing and boring after a very short while. Is there anyone out there who didn't find the scene on the roof, where Neo dodges a total of maybe a dozen bullets, much more exhilarating and interesting than the carnage in the lobby, where enough bullets were fired to arm South Central L.A. for a year??!!",The Matrix

One of my friends is in the film school here at CU and he loved it. Now we are all pretty sure that Keanu Reeves is not a good actor (for some that is putting it mildly). How ever THIS was his kind of role and for once he actually did a good job. (Personally, I liked Speed too, but it was far from great). This movie had a little of everything. It had the philosophy, the Sci-fi, the horror(those squids were FREAKY and the ""bug"" gave me shivers), a dash of love, martial arts, and of course, action. There were religous references, literary references and more. All in all don't believe me that it's good, and PLEASE don't listen to someone else that it was bad.

1447,Coolflic,Sci-fi perfection.?,9,15 June 1999,"Having read some of the reviews of this film on the imdb I felt there were some doubts over its quality but after a few minutes of watching it those doubts where blown away and I new I was in for a 'trip'.As a piece of science fiction this film can only be described as a work of genius and proof that when it comes to film writing and directing two heads, or two Wachowski brothers, are better than one.What makes this film so good is the mind bending concept in the story of a universal virtual reality, a very simple but effective idea which is portrayed to perfection by the smallest detail. The comic book origins of the sets provided the duo with proven material and they choose well. The outstanding and ground breaking special effects pushed the film to even greater highs and they even had the self belief to include marshal arts style fight scenes that any oriental director would have been proud of. All these elements came together to produce one awesome movie. My only criticism would be a possible continuity fault with some of the 'damage' accumulated by most of the characters.It was a risk to cast Keanu Reeves in a lead role given the public attitude to his acting abilities but thankfully those abilities when not over stretched as you would expect with this type of film and he has done his career a favour. The rest of the cast were equally efficient.This film is labelled as science fiction but it is also an orgy of violence and destruction given a positive twist with music and fashion, a death in cyberspace is still a death on-screen. I think it would it have been far better to have gone the whole hog and included more sex scenes, as was hinted at in the film. This would have made it an over 18 rating and a more rounded piece of work.What is the Matrix.? The Matrix is what we can expect in our theatres for the next millennium. Cool.",The Matrix

The action scenes are in a class all of their own (John Woo should take notes... none of his American films have been nearly this well done). Carrie-Anne Moss and Laurence Fishburne deliver excellent performances, and Keanu isn't half bad himself... all the martial-arts training they took before filming really shows. After the first scene ended (which is absolutely breathtaking), the theater I watched The Matrix in erupted into spontaneous applause. And Hugo Weaving is perfectly cast as the genuinely creepy antagonist.",The Matrix

Even Roger Ebert criticized the movie along these lines.  The fact that the Wachowski's were able to integrate those 3 ""genres"" into a mind gripping, eye popping, heart pounding story is quite a feat in and of itself. ""There is nothing new under the sun"" so you might as well borrow from interesting themes as opposed to mindless ones.

What's more, this plot is ORIGINAL. That is reason in and of itself to see the film.  Add to that stunning special effects (so seamless you hardly notice that what you're seeing isn't real), the aforementioned performances of the actors, creative scriptwriting and work-of-art cinematography, and you've got an easy candidate for Best Film of 1999.There was a reason that this movie took in over $33 million in the first weekend.

1464,likop,"Wildly original, inspired!",10,10 September 2004,"Watching this again on DVD what really impressed me was the special effects in this film which were leaps and bounds ahead of their competition and still some of the best to date, it deservedly won the Oscar.Many people believed that in should have also won Best Picture.But a science-fiction film has never won this award, which perhaps shows that the Oscar Academy Board is still filled with people who are a little behind the times! The film has all the physical energy of an action film: shoot-outs, hand-to-hand fighting, and acrobatic stunts.This is complemented by imaginative visual work that includes the use of shadows, slow motion and quick cuts.But the film does not rely on the special effects alone.As well as a lot of computer generated effects, the film also has great tradition stunt action that put the Bond films to shame! The film touches on many interesting philosophical questions: do we exist? How do we know we exist? Is what we perceive real? How can we know this? In one scene Neo receives a lesson on human perception and reality from a child. It takes place while Neo is waiting for an interview.The child is in deep concentration, using his own mind to bend spoons.He tells Neo:""Do not try and bend the spoon. That is impossible.Instead, only try to realize the truth. What truth?There is no spoon. Then, you will see that it is not the spoon that bends, it is only yourself"". In another provocative scene, Neo has a ""deja vu"": a black cat passes in front of him and arches its back,then another identical cat does exactly the same thing. Morpheus explains that deja vu is really a glitch in the Matrix. Then, what is real?

Unfortunately, the special effects were the only things stunning about the movie, unless you count how stunningly stupid the dialogue was, or how stunningly bad the acting was (even good actors like Fishbourne and Joe Pantalione couldn't get anything out of this script).  The filmakers here took a wonderful concept, filled it with marvelous special effects and left it to die without any substance.

From Keanu Reeves as Neo to Hugo Weaving as Agent Smith, I feel the actors captured their roles perfectly. The plot was so incredible...The whole 'what is reality' aspect had me freaking out. I'm sure it had more than 1 person scared of it being the truth.The visual effects in this movie are stunning, even as compared to many of todays higher-technology CGI effects. The most famous of all of them being the Neo bullet dodge sequence, spoofed in more movies than I care to think of.

In either case, it won best visual fx at the academy (i thought STAR WARS:EPISODE ONE deserved it) and it won best sound fx (FIGHT CLUB should've gotten it without a doubt). The last time i checked, when someone gets kicked in the rib cage, it does NOT sound like a pillow being wipped with a recently used condom! Anyway, this movie is fairly simple; it is very easy to understand because everything is repeatedly spelled out for you. As a matter of fact, I already knew what the movie was going to be about when i first started seeing the commercials for it. And it was so predictable, everything i saw in that movie, i wasn't surprised i saw it because i knew (after seeing the first 10 minutes) that it was going to happen later! Keanu plays an average shmuck who works as a cubicle drone. He knows something is missing from his life as strange dreams echo to him from the real world. He of course uses his computer hacking counterpart named Neo to find an answer. As he gets closer, he recieves a myterious cell phone one day while at the office. It rings. A mysterious voice starts giving him instructions that would eventually lead him to the window ledge 80 stories above the street. To overcome his fears and climb down would mean that he is willing to dive into a dark, dangerous, and mysterious adventure into the unknown of reality. They should have made the rest of the movie the way that window ledge scene was written- MORE ACTION, LESS YAPPING. But why is the rest of the movie so slow moving? It treats as like we're nine-year-olds! It would've been better if they gave us few hints that we can use to figure out the theme of the movie. If i were still seven years old, I would have liked this movie a lot better, but now I'm seventeen and i've already gone way deeper down the rabbit hole than this movie has taken me. It's also formulaic- perfectly designed to get rebelious type teens to empty their wallets at the box office. It is also written based on marketability rather than art so the movie ends in a visually stunning shoot out rather than tying up lose ends or giving a satisfying ending. But what disappointed me most was the characters, they're incredibly dull. None of them caught my fascination and the acting is so weak that when Neo said ""Morpheus was like a father to me"", it wasn't until then that i realized that he felt this way. If the acting is any good, then we would have known that before he said it out loud. Even the Oracle lady was nothing but useless clutter on the screen. I GAVE THIS A 6/10",The Matrix

Maybe it was the cool evening air against my tired head, or the hard ground beneath my sore bottom, but in retrospect I was almost definitely wrong. It is however a really great sci-fi action film.The story revolves around one Thomas Anderson (Reeves), or Neo if for some strange you prefer, and for some strange reason he does. He is introduced to fellow ridiculous name barer Morpheus (Fishburne) by the attractive Trinity (Moss). Oodles of special effects and numerous fight scenes later, Neo has pretty much saved the world.The acting is fair, with the film's best performance coming from Hugo Weaving as the evil Agent Smith. Everyone is excellent in the fight scenes.
The movie is visually astounding. The special effects aren't there just for the sake of special effects, and it is the imagery that they create which makes the film stand out among its rivals. See for example the scene of the matrix as it is in reality, with Neo wired up as a battery.
To get the full-effect of the film, personally I'd advise watching, as I did, on a small projection screen in a tent with lots of people chairing for Carre-Anne Moss and advising Neo `Take the red pill', `No, take the blue pill', `Take both'.9/10",The Matrix

The Matrix (1999) is a clever display featuring the inner reality of a few beings believing they are prisoned in the world of a viciously designed program, a world of numbers which master has designed it perfectly but in which people choose a life of misery and pain, never realizing they are slaves. Morpheus (Laurence Fishburne), the leader of those chosen few, has long been searching for the One and sincerely believes in him in a madness kind of way that is ready to sacrifice his life for him and later we find out that he actually does when he tries to keep one of the 3 seemingly immortal and mastermind agents from harming Neo (Keanu Reeves). Neo, according to his profile, is an alias of Thomas A. Anderson, a law abiding program writer for a respectable software company, whose double life is letting him to also be a professional hacker in an underworld criminal society. At first, despite Morpheus's phone guidance, he gets arrested by cops and gets investigated and bugged by the agents but then Morpheus's group comes to rescue him and as in later, so called free him. They make some changes in his body and give him a second birth to become one of them. After all it was his own choice to be in wonderland when he chose red pill over blue one which would ended the story for him. In his waking up in hover craft, Neo asks Morpheus ""What is this place?"" and he gets answered by a more important question; ""When"". They don't know what year it exactly is but it's almost 200 years ahead in the future. In the white room inside the computer program, Neo faces with more mind twisting questions like ""What is real?"" or ""How do you define real?"" which confuses him even more but are essential to the answer of the question, ""What is the Matrix?"". What is more intriguing to see in The Matrix is the amazing scenes of works of visual effects which are perfectly mastered under the directorship of the Wachowski Brothers who are also the writers for this feature. However, the screenplay is been written in a way that in order to understand the final mission of Morpheus and his left crew, it seems inevitable to follow the sequel of this trilogy but as a friend who believed this movie has much more to say once told me: ""You should read between the lines"". As at the end of the movie when Neo is being shot several times by agent Smith for whose willingness to be free, he must get the codes to get inside Zayan, for a moment the happy ending of goodness's triumph over evil gets shadowed by the fact that everything is already falling apart and nothing is going to make things right again in any possible way. But then once again comes the miracle of love and Trinity's whispering to Neo works out by making him realize that he is the One and that Oracle's prophecy of her falling in love with him (the One) has become true and that brings him back to life; like Sleeping Beauty (1959) a kiss on the lips  and goodness triumphs evil.",The Matrix

Maybe it could've been a little slower at the beginning, and had no explanation. But maybe that's what made this movie so great! Not only is this a classic in the action genre, but in the sci-fi genre as well (although I consider it mostly action). This is an absolute must-see.",The Matrix

It blew my mind. I had never seen special effects like that before and the acting was spot on. Keanu Reeves was the perfect cast for the role as Neo. The directing was amazing and story was out of this world. The editing is flawless. The writing is brilliant with a lot of one liners such as ""follow the white rabbit"" and ""if you take the red pill, you'll stay in wonderland and i'll show you how deep the rabbit hole goes"". I was glued to the screen. This film is an innovation and changed cinema forever. All the groundbreaking filming techniques that were used in this movie has been referred to and copied by almost every successful sc-fi, thriller or action movie that has come out after the matrix. A movie that should be on your bucket list. If you have not seen this movie yet go see it now. You will not been disappointed. Even if you are not a sci-fi fan there's something here for everyone. It will excite you, free your mind and take you for a ride. WATCH IT NOW!!!! ADD THIS TO YOUR DVD COLLECTION.",The Matrix
1495,pdmarsay,Truly a modern classic,10,23 June 2005,"The Matrix is one of very few films made after 1980 which I consider to be worthy of the title 'classic.' This is one of the most original, stunningly inventive, films that has ever been made, I think it should have won Best Picture. If you haven't already, watch The Matrix absolutely as soon as you can, it's simply fantastic. The ground breaking special effects still blow you away almost as much as they originally did in 1999. The music is also something to really listen to, brilliantly fusing with the action and revelations on screen. Don't miss this gem for a million, before the sequels appeared, the Wachowski's appeared to be building quite a claim to greatness, almost overnight, I think anyway. Alas, 'Reloaded' and 'Revolutions', though interesting, and fun, (especially 'Reloaded') they don't come close to the awe inspiring philosophical richness of the original. So if you can only watch one, make sure it's this one.",The Matrix

1497,klv17,Heavily influenced by manga,7,31 January 2004,"Japan is like the shadow of The Matrix, stretching out elusively behind it as a kind of history, more than as a directly illuminating reference such as the obvious nods (should that be bows?) to Hong Kong action movies in the many fight scenes, and the genuflections to Christian themes such as sacrifice and redemption. Nevertheless, like a shadow, things Japanese are responsible for lending a certain depth to the proceedings.The Matrix series' directors the Wachowski brothers have a pedigree that would perhaps find more widespread respect in Japan than the west. They began their narrative work as comic-book artists, working on Marvel Comics' Ectokid. In Japan, manga are seen as an alternate form of storytelling rather than the poor cousin of the novel, something with which the Wachowskis clearly concur. They are on record as big fans of anime, the animated version of manga, citing in particular their love of SF cult classics Akira (1988) and Ghost in the Shell (1996/98), which both began life as manga. In fact, the online Wikipedia contends that The Matrix contains direct allusions to both films:Both a scene almost at the end of the movie, where Neo's breathing seems to buckle the fabric of reality in a corridor he is standing in, as well as the ""psychic children"" scene in the Oracle's waiting room, are evocative of similar scenes from the 1980s anime classic Akira. The title sequence, the rooftop chase scene where an agent breaks a concrete tile on the roof when landing after a jump, the scene late in the movie where a character hides behind a column while pieces of it are blown away by bullets, and a chase scene in a fruit market where shots hit watermelons, are practically identical to shots in another anime science fiction classic, Ghost in the Shell.",The Matrix

1500,enigma43,Dumbest movie of all time,1,26 September 2006,"For all the people who gives this movie a 10, I notice they are usually *young* and living the poor attention span world of the video game. They have no clue about substance, and thus they worship ""The Matrix."" Unfortunately, substance is what the Matrix lacks. It is no secret why the box office has steadily began to fail since the invention of CGI. It has become too easy to do anything you want in Special Effects, thus *substance* is no longer as attractive. In movies such as Jaws, you could not do anything you wanted. The shark didn't work. They had to use orange barrels to show where the shark could be on the ocean. Thus *substance,* that is, the plot, had to take over where special effects could not take us.Unfortunately, the reverse is true of the Matrix. Special effects can take us anywhere now, and unless there is a really good plot, like in the Lord of the Rings (because the plot had been written in a time when splashy special effects were nonexistent) special effects are not enough to hold a story together. Thus, this is why Peter Jackson's ""King Kong"" didn't hold together as well. Find another novel by another good author Peter. Novels have to have substance, and that is what any movie needs, regardless of the quality of special effects.Another thing that bothered me about the Matrix was the contrived way in which it attempted to immerse us into a paranoid world. In just practical terms, it would take far more energy to run a complete virtual reality world, than *any engergy* that could be derived from a human body. Psst! Next time machines, just get a good waterfall and a hydrolic generator, or even just some wind turbines. Much more efficient, and the wind turbines won't revolt against you.Seriously. How much ""electricity"" aka energy can you derive from a human body? I doubt very seriously the energy output vs. the energy needed to submerge all of your ""prisoners"" in a virtual reality world, would work. Let's face it, the ""machines"" would be left with a huge energy deficit.So, I'm sorry, I could not get past that little nugget of factual error. The entire premise left me unable to suspend disbelief.So sorry all those video game lovers who worship this movie. It isn't ""War and Peace,"" it isn't ""Lord of the Rings"" and it isn't even ""Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?"" (aka Blade Runner). It's just an excuse for guys dressed in black to do cool, splashy, special effects, based on a so ridiculously contrived plot, that obviously the plot wasn't what really mattered.Tell me the movie is cool, fine. Tell me it's the basis for a philosophy course and I'll tell you, you need to find another college.",The Matrix
1501,gameplacereviews,A fun and smart sci-fi The Matrix is an action movie that skips out on good writing.,9,6 March 2014,"My god my mind has exploded by the pure action of this movie. I love the action and I think that it is giddily so funny to watch. The bullet time is great. The jumping is great. The shooting is great. The writing is . good maybe. Okay so the idea of The Matrix is good. It's probably been done before. The whole idea is that the Matrix is a reality created in a computer for humans to live in. I found this intriguing and enjoyed this premise. But the writing. It's alright. This movie is driven by action. The writing is in the backseat and the action is driving the car. The movie is full of philosophical talking and one liners. And it's not great. It works, but it's not great. The acting is actually really good for a film like this. Keanu Reeves does a really good job. Laurence Fishburne is awesome as Morpheus. Though there is Hugo Weaving. He is an incredible villain that is benefited by the strong part of the movie the action. He is meticulous and menacing whenever he is on screen. The other cast is good, but not great. However we should really talk about the better thing about this movie. The action. Holy cow. Mind-blowing. Okay the tech is a little bit primitive by now, but it really is effective. I mean the bullet time. The slow motion work. It's amazing. It's so fun to watch. I will say that that the settings of the film are also very creative. The way the Matrix works, the scout ship. I love it. I will say that the costume design is a little bit dated. The black trench coats are fun, but they are a little but dated. I will say that my liking for this film is dampened by the fact that I LOVE the Wachowski's better crafted and amazing Cloud Atlas. Just because that movie is incredible and the fact that this was also the Wachowski's other film I just had trouble with taking this move as seriously. But its good.

That suggested power doesn't come alone, we are in a future near 2200 and machines save themselves against humans, which are literally out, projecting their own reality while providing machines their energy by doing it.I am in love about the characters, I love Morpheus, Trinity, of course Neo, even MR. Smith, such a big love is only possible in masterpiece. Who is Keanu Reeves? And who is Lauren Fishburn, I don't know and I don't mind. And what can be said about action? Simply new, fresh, quick, slow, strong, slight, the same time subtle and brutal, even fine, plenty of sensibility. I know people able to read this has already seen the movie, I did more than twice.

1504,Samuel_Gilbert,One of the best Sci-Fi Action Movies.,9,26 November 2017,"The Matrix was released in 1999 and had an immense impact on pop culture. It's a movie that inspired countless filmmakers and that was widely acclaimed at release. It went on to gross around 500 million U.S.D at the box-office for a budget of 63 million. Directed by the Wachowski brothers (now sisters), and starring Keanu Reeves, Laurence Fishburne and Carrie-Anne Moss, The Matrix is a sci-fi action movie that takes inspiration from Anime and Kung-Fu flicks. Neo, a tech geek who's life revolves computers, is told one day that he's the savior of a world in which robots have taken control and that the reality he believes is true is actually all fake. The real world has gone to ashes and everyone is being controled by robots. Canadian actor, Keanu Reeves who is not known for his acting capabilities, fits the role of Neo very well, as does his colleagues for their respective roles. This movie was revolutionary in it's amazing action sequences which feature dazzling special effects that are to this day very impressive. What The Matrix does, that few other 90's action movies were able to do, is to blend amazing action sequences with a story that challenges the watcher and that has a deep message. This movie is famously known for it's futuristic message about technology and society that's innovative and scarily plausible. Obviously, The Matrix couldn't have been as good as it was without the amazing score by Don Davis and the cinematography helmed by Bill Pope. The score mixes electronic and futuristic type beats that fits perfectly the computer imagery that's central to the movie. The cinematography had a big role in the impact of the action scenes. It's beautiful and really different. The « Bullet Time » sequence is still known as a milestone in cinematography and a great achievement. It's a movie that is more suited for youngsters and fans of sci-fi and action but I would still recommend it to anyone who's a fan of quality entertainment. Sure, the plot of the Matrix is nothing new. We have seen it countless other times, but it has never been done like this and as efficiently. The Matrix is a revolutianary movie that has had an immense impact on cinema. It is one of the very best sci-fi action movie of all time. 10/10 – Amazing.",The Matrix

Remove that ""Action"" title might be a good choice.What's more, there are dozens of useless parts in this movie. For example, the love story is so strange, WHAT DOES THAT MEAN BY SAYING ""BECAUSE I LOVE YOU, YOU WILL NOT DIE""??? I just want to ask if it is necessary? A kiss is a must in movies of 1990s'?In addition to that, is Cypher a necessary part?IS A BAD GUY IN BADLY NEED IN THIS MOVIE??? I don't think so. The storyline can stretch through without this man.Last but not least, I would like to know, what is the significance of the skill of ""jump over a building"" exist? If it would like to tell us that a people know about the TRUTH can do something impossible, why does no one in this movie own the ability of jump straight up to the building instead of climb up it breathlessly?In a word, this movie constructs an uncomplicated world, or as is to say, an world that is incomplete.

The theme is far from new, obviously, going back to Brave New World, 1984 and a host of outsider 'heroes' struggling against a dystopian future.There are also some interesting sub-texts :- The ritualistic rite of passage to illumination, the nature of prophecy and perhaps the most searching question ""Is it better to live 'free' and in squalor or to experience a better seeming fantasy life ?""Unlike many effects driven science fiction movies, the acting, plot and dialogue are all top notch and I heartily recommend going to see this film.",The Matrix

The Action. The Story. The Cinematography.The action in this movie was better then anything put out before its time. For what its worth, the next best action movie I had seen before was The Terminator. The Matrix blew it away. The karate training that Morpheus leads Neo through is some of the most original things I have ever seen. The helicopter crash seen was off of the hook, when the glass broke on the building and the bass starts booming it makes my heart jump a beat.The story is so complex and some would say it has more underlying tones then Pulp Fiction. Over all the religious undertones where so easy to miss with my first 10 viewings, but after reading up a bit on it jump off the screen in later viewings. On the surface it seems this your everyday ordinary man Vs. machine movie. But the factor of Neo being Jesus Christ can not be avoided with a little research. Genius.The cinematography was better (and still might be the best) ever put on film. The cameras, camera angles and views of them are amazing to say the least. The scene when they are in the wet wall was shot from at least 6 different angle, not to bad for a space of about 3 X 3. Visually everything flows into each other. It is as beautiful as any Vango painting I have ever seen.In closing, if you haven't seen this movie then what are you waiting for? Don't expect to catch everything on the first run through.

So often these types of films either forget that they need a plot, or the plot becomes lost in the process of showing eye popping visual effects.  ""The Matrix"" does not have this problem.  It has a complicated plot that twists back on itself and is interesting. In addition the movie maintains an intensity that really kept me on the edge of my seat.Lawrence Fishburne, Carrie Anne Moss and Keanu Reeves (yes he was good in this movie) all give excellent performances.  The visual effects are incredible and yet not overstated.The best part of the movie for me was the fact that I had no clue as to the plot.  This is the best way to go into this movie.

1520,Ron L,"Over-hyped, Style over Substance",5,27 September 1999,"I had high hopes for this movie, being a huge fan of the ""what if none of this is real?"" genre, but I was disappointed.  The film does have a few things going for it - let me cover those first, since that won't take long. The visuals are beautiful and stunning - whoever shot this movie is indeed an artist.  I can't remember a film that was this fascinating just to look at.  The film also has a creative and intriguing premise (which I can't mention, or it would spoil it).  Keanu Reeves, who is a horrible actor, is actually more tolerable in this flick than he has been in most of his others - mostly due to the fact that the role requires almost no acting.  Keanu does look good in the film, and Carrie-Ann Moss looks fantastic in tight PVC pants!  That's it for the good, now for the bad: the story has holes in it the size of Texas.  Is it really so hard to write a story that makes sense, that is tightly crafted?  Total Recall and The Terminator come to mind as examples of tightly written sci-fi films.  I can't go into the details of the many, many things that just don't make sense since it would spoil it for those who haven't seen it.  Did the writers not understand virtual reality at all, or did they just assume the audience was too ignorant to notice the absurdities and non-sensical aspects of their virtual world?  Seems like the makers of The Matrix just got lazy.  They had a great premise and Keanu Reeves, so they just threw in some extended slo-mo gunfights, kung-fu battles, lots of big explosions, a pounding soundtrack, and called it a day - very crass.  About those slo-mo gunfights, kung-fu battles, big explosions, and pounding soundtrack - they came across as very contrived - obviously hacked onto the story to make it an ""action"" movie.  How obviously formulaic!  I can just hear the producer saying ""We have a pretty good story here, but we want to make it an 'action' movie, so stick in these elements..."".  This film had serious potential, but ended up as merely mediocre - what a shame.  5 out of 10.",The Matrix

What I will comment on is the movie it self.It is the kind of movie that won't leave you alone after you've seen it. There are so many things in it that you look at when you see it the first time and say ""Why did this/that happen here?"" and yet the explanation to almost all comes sometime later. Thus seing it a second time gives you all the more information, because you are prepared for the riddles, and are thus able to appreciate the movie better.The plot itself is rather thin, but that doesn't matter, as it is carried nicely in the telling of the movie, The Messiah's personification is perhaps going a bit too far, and is in my mind one of the things that deduct from the movie.Also the image of the ""Agents"", the first time they are introduced, the image that comes across reeks of ""Men in Black"" their clothes, and sunglasses. This is a pity, because it makes it harder to take them seriously.

1525,Robin-55,Real deal sci-fi.,8,23 March 1999,"This is a ludicrous film. Loud, brash and generally bombastic at every turn. Fortunately, it knows this and wears these features on its sleeve. It is knowing and ironic and has its tongue firmly in its cheek. The ideas, which will no doubt be hailed as 'startlingly original', are all stolen from Philip K. Dick, but at least its stealing from the best. It is basically familiar territory, territory mined by Dark City only a few years back. The Matrix, however, is an immeasurably superior film, simply by virtue of the fact that it does not take itself seriously. At times, the characters play their ludicrous lines so deadpan, it achieves a bizarre spooflike quality. Fishburne's performance, in particular, is splendidly arch as he delivers lines like 'Welcome to the desert of the real' with a misplaced Shakespearean grandeur.The effects are also ground-breaking and mostly effective. The use of slo-mo to eroticize the violence is reminiscent of Woo or even Peckinpah but with the use of clever CGI, Matrix achieves the feel of ballistic science. The shootouts do not revel in the familiar 'operatic grandeur' that has been a staple since Bonnie and Clyde. Rather, they play like FBI reconstructions of shootouts. We see the paths that bullets take, the positions of spent shell casings. It is shamelessly fetishistic and utterly irrelevant to the film's central idea but spectacular and exciting nonetheless.I hate virtually everything. Dark City was a nauseating waste of my time. Everything released over the last three summers has seemed despicably lazy film making. Godzilla, Armageddon...these films are offensive cynical money pits without a single grain of wit, a single interesting idea to tie the whole rotten mess together. Therefore, I fully anticipated hating the Matrix with equal vigor. As it was, I was pleasantly surprised. While I would make no claims that it was in any way a classic, it certainly appeared to have been put together with a great deal of love and humour and these attributes go a long way. It was overlong and unnecessarily portentous at times but these are minor quibbles when one is being bombarded by such a wealth of outrageous imagery and ideas. What other film could link Dick, Christ, Alice in Wonderland, Monty Python, Woo, Jackie Chan,  and still find time to make Keanu Reeves look good?",The Matrix
1526,kalashi,Fortune Cookie Mysticism,6,15 April 1999,"Yes, I really enjoyed the effects and the concepts.  However, I expected it to be a little smarter--the haut couture styles got a little hokey (imagine Morpheus going virtual shopping for his virtual suits) and the peppering of the fortune cookie mysticism got annoying.  And let's face it folks, action movie or not, a film with a lot of stiff acting from some of the main characters does not make a great film.Quote that sums it up:  Keanu's ""Whoa!""--duuuude!",The Matrix
1527,Poppa Byrd,Excellent Adventure and Bogus Journey,7,21 April 1999,"Fun movie and great special effects, but not too much more.  Each character dresses, looks, and acts in the same manner; mysteriously hidden behind their sleek sunglasses and black trenchcoats.  The Matrix is over two hours of a Buddha-like Lawrence Fishburne frowning, and a surprisingly tolerable Keanu Reeves kept in a perpetual state of confusion.  Also, many of the film's most exciting sequences were unfortunately drawn out.  However, The Matrix redeems itself with graphic, yet interesting scenes and more developed ideas that are reminiscent of other science fiction films such as ""Fire in the Sky"" and ""Terminator 2"".  The Matrix is easily deserving of a 7/10.",The Matrix
1528,matt-217,WELL worth watching,9,9 April 1999,"This is one of the best movies I have seen in a long while. The cast is great, Keanu Reeves and Carrie-Anne Moss both give a superb performance, and Hugo Weaving is very menacing as Agent Smith. The story/plot was a tiny bit hard to follow at times, but not impossible to understand. Excellent and phenomenal special effects... simply, a MUST see.",The Matrix
1529,Shon R.,A Few Big Surprises,9,7 April 1999,"This film delivers all that it promises.  What is the Matrix?  That is the question the movie answers, and when it does it really surprises.The movie combines elements from the Terminator and  movies such as the Truman Show or TV's Strange World.  Surprisingly, however derivative it is, it is a very well executed movie.  The acting is good, and the plot is very good.  In fact, the story line provoked discussion with friends about living a lie all the way home from the movie theater.  Of course, the FX are fantastic, that goes without saying.Also, for an R rated movie, the Matrix has very little objectionable material in it.  There isn't much cursing.  The only reason I can think of for it's rating is the repeated shootings, and they aren't that bloody.I highly recommend this movie!  Go expecting some surprises!",The Matrix
1530,J.Toner,"Excellent Movie, A Must See",10,6 April 1999,"""The Matrix"" is one of the best sci-fi movies i've seen in awhile, and one of the best movies of 1999 so far.The themes in this movie have been explored in sci-fi before but I was impressed that the movie gives it a new twist and a plot which was pretty sound.The special effects, camera work, and fight sequences are all incredible and well done. I thought the use of slow motion was excellent and added alot of neat things to the action. The martial arts action was some of the best i've ever seen in a movie.-Keanu Reeves did a decent job as Neo, much better then some of his last couple of movie roles-Laurence Fishburne was very cool as the wise and experienced Morpheus. A great performance-Carrie-Anne Moss was the person that impressed me the most, she was excellent as Trinity. She gave a great performance that made me really like her character.-and Hugo Weaving as Agent Smith did a great job as the main villian. He gave Smith such a cold, calculating and menacing look and attitude, he also impressed me.Don't wait too long, go see ""The Matrix""",The Matrix

I was really impressed and stunned by those slow-motion action sequences. They are damn great! Don't expect too much story, expect great action!!",The Matrix
1532,Jack-182,Wow...,10,3 April 1999,This is all I have to say about this movie.  I had somewhat of a low expectation going into this movie but once this movie got going there was no turning back.  The fight sequences and special effects in this movie were well beyond Blade and well beyond Titanic.  If you haven't seen this movie yet...what's wrong with you! I know I will see this movie at least one more time in the theaters before it goes out and I will buy this movie on DVD because this movie is just too great not to watch again.,The Matrix
1533,Prophet-9,Technology and action make for a sweet movie.,9,30 March 1999,"Do you like sci-fi?  Do you like Hong Kong action and Kung Fu films?  Well, welcome to heaven a.k.a. The Matrix.  Like a Japanese anime coming to life, the Matrix is a continuous feast of eye candy; concentrated adrenaline, if you will. The film focuses on a young computer hacker ,Neo (Keanu Reeves), who must choose between two worlds.  One world is an illusion and the other reality. In doing so he will decide the fate of every one on the planet.  Take a little Dark City, a lot of Terminator, and about 15 Hong Kong shoot em' up-chop socky movies and you pretty much have the plot.  The fighting scenes were choreographed by the same man responsible for Jet Li's finest action film, Fist of Legend.  So we ain't talkin' souped up Van Damme.  We're talkin' 100%, grade A, home grown Kung Fu fighting here.  In Hong Kong it is commonplace to get that level of grace and power in action scenes, but in America it's as good as we have ever gotten to that coveted level.  This is probably the best American made Kung Fu movie since Enter the Dragon.  It's that good.

Where are they from?I've been around long enough to know a great ENTERTAINING movie when I see one.  I'm 31 years old.  I saw the original Star Wars the day it opened, as well as all the other ones on opening day.  I think The Godfather is the greatest movie ever.  I think Sean Penn is brilliant.  I think ""Bottle Rocket"" was extremely underrated.That said, I feel like I know a good flick when I see it.  This movie simply ROCKS!  I've never left a movie feeling both intellectually stimulated and energetically charged like this.  It MUST be seen on the big screen, or a great TV with good loud sound.  By the end I was ready to run out into traffic and jump from car to car.  What a rush.So, if you have NOT seen this, give it a try.  Don't trust the reviews in here that are negative.  See it with an open mind, pay close attention to the story, and enjoy.  I've now seen it about 8 times, but the first time is always the best.",The Matrix

My favourite film since its release was ""Blade Runner"" and I class this film as being in the same league of thrilling sci-fi with superb special effects and an exciting storyline.  Keanu Reeves stares perfectly at the camera in closeup, although his actual acting is a little well - Keanuesque (never having thrown the mantel of Bill and Ted) I think. Samuel L Jackson is as cool as cool and Trinity is superb.  I will be going to see this one again and again and await with anticipation the next film by the brothers.",The Matrix

I would rate this hart pounding, not stop action movie a 10 out of 10!!",The Matrix
1541,Number8,A treat for the eyes,7,3 September 1999,"This movie featured some of the best special effects ever. The action was intense and the fighting was superb. Never had I seen anything like it, and I love what I saw on screen, effects wise.But with the great effects came an inferior storyline. I think they had a good thing going with this ""humans enslaved by computers"" plot, but it fell short because they tried to explain this very complex concept halfway during the movie in a matter of few minutes, confusing the audience as well as broken down the pace. It would have been better if they took more time to explain it, or didn't explain it at all. Either of these would make the plot a lot easier to follow.Another bad thing would have to be those instances in the movie where they put some comedic dialogue in, which seemed out of place. I knew it was supposed to be funny, but I just couldn't laugh, kinda like a good joke told wrong. Good thing there were too many of those since they were getting annoying. I also don't like the romance bit a the end where Trinity and Neo. I mean what gives?! The movie was going along just fine then suddenly love becomes a subject. It just seemed so fake and forced. My impression of it was that they decided to put love into the story at the last minute, because it seemed so out of place. Personally, I didn't like that one bit.All in all, an enjoyable film, but it's definitely not a masterpiece. Do see if for the effects though, because it couldn't get any better than this.",The Matrix
1542,NINE-4,Don't Believe the Hype,4,25 September 1999,"I didn't go to see this film because Keanu Reeves was in it,so I figured how good could it be? But then i started hearing what a good film it was,what great sci-fi,what great special effects. I still have flashbacks of Johnnie Mnemonic so I waited for the video. When I tried to rent it the day it was released both video stores I go to were out of it.I rented it three days later-thinking I must be wrong,this must be a good if not great sci fi movie. I might have been a little more impressed with the special effects if they had not shown them before the movie started.The video actually shows how some of them were created.Bummer-I like to be surprised. But even if I had not seen this preview I would have still thought this was a so-so- movie. Keanu Reeves-what can I say--he looked good in this movie.He has better cheekbones than 90% of the models that strut their stuff down the runway-but God love him--he can't act worth squat!Anybody who thinks this is another Blade Runner,or Dark City,forget about it. This could have been a contender,but it falls short in so many ways. The premise of the story is fascinating-people living in a dream universe created by computer,while in reality they are created and used as a source of energy to power the computers. This concept was not very fully explored and I found Morpheus""s (Lawrence Fishburne the leader of the rebels who knows the truth)explaination of the rules of the Matrix flawed. Instead a deep thought provoking movie,the premise demands-what we get is a shoot-em-up,and a Hollywood ending.This movie was mildly entertaining,in spite of Keanu Reeves,but its not great sci-fi. I gave it a 4.",The Matrix

1546,JUuttu,One of the most overrated movies of the decade.,6,6 November 1999,"So there I was, sitting in the theater, waiting to watch a movie I hoped would prove to be A) a great cyberpunk-movie (I love cyberpunk) B) one hellova actionmovie and C) a hollywood movie that has a plot. (Shock!)Did they succeed?To say the least: No.I am never impressed with BIG special FX's - seen all the latest in MTV, anyway. And I've seen some of John Woos actionmovies when he was in Hong Kong along with other HK-masters, so I've grown some appetite for 'larger cakes', if you know what I mean. ;)So what went wrong? There are various reasons that can be read from the various postings who agree with me, but one is the stunts, fights or anything between that. They did not feel real. And that's the problem with this movie! It did not feel real, because when for example, you see when Trinity runs along the walls, you go ""she's wired"".I like my actionmovies with the sense that you can actually relate those outrageous stunts in the real world. But since it did not feature in a Real World - well, most of the time, anyway - you felt as if you were watching someone playing a computergame for you. And that, my friends, is boring.Oh yeah, almost forgot: the speed of the action. They used FAR too much slo-mo, which showed especially in the infamous lobby-scene. Flying debris in slo-mo. While at first glance you go 'Wow', it becomes quickly redundant. Think about it: Keanu Reeves reaches his guns in slo-mo. And he shoots in slo-mo. And bullets go klinka-klink in slo-mo. Boooring. Too much trying to be 'cool' instead of brutal fast-paced action - that's what I like. :)And don't get me started about that thing they dare to call a 'plot'! The 'plot' is full of clichés, a mediocre dialogue and obvious plotholes. It did feel promising at first, but later I became aware of the faults the plot has - not to mention the godawful closecall that shot a bullet thru this movie's head in the end!To say the least, I wasn't impressed with this movie - but I'm not saying it was so bad it shouldn't be watched no matter what! It does have it's strengths - the effects (for what it's worth) and .. er.. that was it. :)All-in-all: if you want to watch a real movie I'd say they would be far superior to this one, even with the lack of special effects.

As a matter of fact, the producers of this thing probably owe its popularity to parents who dumped their kids in video parlors at malls instead of sending them to school.I mean, even if you get past the impressive (for awhile, anyway) whistles and buzzers, ""The Matrix"" pushes the envelope just an inch too far when it asks us to believe Keanu Reeves' MIND is being sought to SAVE THE WORLD!

Ill start with what I like of the film, I like the direction as the use of the camera, the costume design is good but maybe a bit outdated. The action is very good and the effects are good at times, but it was just a fun film but I cant deny the problems with it. The acting is alright however I don't think its really the actor's fault but rather the dull, cliched characters that are really just kind of there at times. The R rating is very misleading, I don't really remember any parts that were too violent or is their were any swears or nudity. This is not a major complaint but something I thought was odd.

In the beginning of the movie, I was on the edge of my seat, even Keanu Reeves' terrible acting couldn't upset me. I thought that the emerging storyline was one of the best I had seen. That feeling lasted untill the now legendary fight scene in the imaginary dojo. After this point the movie takes a huge step away from the style and course they laid out in the beginning. It got worse and worse as the movie wore on, and I seriously considered stopping the movie. I hadn't been as disappointed since Jurassic Park. If the moviemakers had just remembered to keep up the the innovative and awesome plotline, and not let it degenerate into one special effect after another, it could have been one of the greatest movies of our time. If you like to see a movie with excellent special effects, camera and lighting and action, this is clearly the movie for you. If you on the other hand demand that a movie has a complete and thorough plotline and story, just see the first half hour (or 45 minutes, I can't remember). My personal evaluation: 2/10",The Matrix

1565,Rangers_Football_Club,10/10 doesn't respect the standard.,10,9 September 2003,"The Plot: Just a little below the surface, The Matrix begs the question on reality and meaning in life. Almost everyone on earth has been captured as a slave to Artificial Intelligence (AI). Everyone lives and works and carries on with life, not even knowing what they experience every day is more of a dream world, similar to living on a planet-sized Star Trek ""holodeck."" While everyone thinks they are living in the real world, reality is flipped and everyone is really being held captive in suspended animation submerged in slimy womb-like coffins. In a plot more sinister than the classic sci-fi movie Soylent Green, both the AI and humans (unknowingly) feed off harvested human babies. There is only one city left on earth, hidden deep within the core, which knows the truth of the Matrix and lives free from slavery. A small band of these survivors are tasked with finding a ""chosen one"" who will eventually free everyone from this slavery, and show them the truth of the Matrix. They find this person as one whom all his life has been struggling with the big questions in life and has attempted to understand the meaning of the Matrix. They offer him the pill of truth or a pill to go back into his non-reality of dream life in 1999. He takes the pill of truth. Why does this movie resonate all over the world, from people many economic levels and walks of life, after a worldwide release of only a few weeks?How does this movie speak to postmodern relativity in values, morals, and truth? Myths and symbols: (Incidentally, ""neo"" means new.) Neo is then trained and prepared to fight the AI. Then, through a series of events, he gives up control and accepts his fate. He fights the AI. The Matrix"" is a movie that for the first time in recent memory displays such astute visual brilliance within a story that tickles the mind with a vivd array of complex, thought-provoking twists and turns, all of which leaves its viewers befuddled in such fiendishly gleeful ways. Then we're introduced to Thomas Anderson (Keanu Reeves), a computer software engineer who happens to be a nighttime hacker. More events too complex to describe come to pass before he is introduced to Morpheus (Laurence Fishburne), a man of one tone of voice who reveals to him a secret: ""The Matrix is the world that has been pulled over your eyes to blind you from the truth."" ""The Matrix"" is the first science fiction movie in years to weave these intricacies amongst a vast arsenal of blistering visual effects that transport us into a world that becomes utterly real and truly frightening. In a genre where movies like ""Virus"" and ""Deep Rising"" are dominated by weak plots that serve as outlets for effects work and routine action (not that there's anything wrong with that), this film takes a different path. One of the most memorable shots of the film showcases a damaged helicoptor slamming into the side of a skyscraper in the Matrix: the impact causes a ripple effect before the fantastic explosion, as if the fabric of the program is being ripped at the seams. There is one scene in which Morpheus remarks, ""Throughout human history, we have been dependent on machines to survive. Could it be that man's advancements in the world of computer technology went overboard? This calls into question just how exactly Neo came to question his reality. Had Morpheus been trying to make contact with him in times before the film's opening? If Neo begins to ponder his world, are there others like him who spend their lives waiting to wake from their dream? Could there be a bug in the Matrix program that provides such an outlet?For me, ""The Matrix"" is a movie that doesn't really need a concrete ending. That the Wachowski Brothers have chosen to avert any solid answers or clues only serves to enhance the overall meaning and quality of their work, and it remains the most intelligent and immersive factor of the film. The Matrix exploded onto the Sci-Fi scene. It redefined special effects, and more importantly to its fans, it combined its action/sci-fi plot with that of a very complex story with well-developed characters. Morpheus (Fishburn) is an elusive legend among hackers. One night Neo (Reeves) receives a mysterious message on his computer, meets one of his companions - Trinity (Moss), and receives a call from the man himself. Something didn't feel right with the world. Morpheus believes Neo is ""The One"". In order to show Neo what he believes to be true, he must show him the door. The Door out of the Matrix.You take the red pill - you stay in Wonderland, and I show you just how deep the rabbit hole goes.""The world as he knows it is an illusion. Neo joins up with Morpheus and his crew to find out about the real world, and who he really is. The Matrix is a computer generated world used in the future to keep humans alive and mentally stimulated - because they are living in a perpetual state of sleep where machines are growing them to use as energy. Once awoken, Neo is in for the shock of his life as he realizes his entire life was a simulated lie. Spoon boy: Do not try and bend the spoon. Neo: What truth? Spoon boy: There is no spoon.

1567,AnimatriXZJ,A cinematic masterpiece,10,1 July 2021,"This is one of the greatest movies ever made in the history of filmography! Groundbreaking CGI, brilliant storyline, awesome fight scenes, and an incredible music score! The perfect action movie!",The Matrix
1568,drake blueskull,"An astounding, intelligent & exciting film! My numero uno!",10,31 March 2002,"Brimming with mesmerising action sequences, a taut narrative, neat performances and an ambitious plot, The Matrix is a film that has redefined the sci-fi/action genre. It is the kind of film that makes one think and appreciate the sheer genius employed to create it.The film is the story of a hacker, Neo/Thomas Andersen (Keanu Reeves), who discovers that reality as he & everyone around him knows it is actually an elaborate illusion constructed to keep mankind oblivious of the truth of its existence. The truth is that the real world is controlled by machines. In order to reap the energy resources of the human body, mankind has been fooled into living in a dreamworld, a world which has them so absorbed that they can't wake up from it believing that it is real & in which they can never naturally evolve. Neo like everyone else would have been oblivious to this plan had he not nurtured a gut feeling that there was something wrong with the world & had not a team of rebels led by Morpheus (Laurence Fishburne)acquainted him with the truth. Along with them, Neo embarks on a mission to overthrow 'The Matrix', as the dreamworld is called, to free mankind and in the process challenge his own limitations & doubts with the sheer power of belief.The Wachowski brothers' canvas of man against machine draws a subtle reference to the irony in the fact that man, the creator of machines, is so dependent on them. In a world that is at the brink of a revolution spawned by the advances made in the field of artificial intelligence, the film offers a harrowing but concrete possibility of men being slave to machines & functions as a plea to re-examine the relationship between men and machines. But the film's content is not restricted to projecting a world under mechanical control. Where the film actually excels is in dismissing the basis of our limitations, doubts and fears by offering a better notion of complete, limitless  freedom. The film with the strength of its ingenious and often metaphorical plot tries to bridge the gap between the possible and the impossible, and between thinking and knowing. Throughout the film, the character of the protagonist goes through a rapid transition from a vulnerable man who is coming to terms with the truth of his existence to a confident hero who's finally understood his purpose and in the process himself. The resilence of the human spirit is reflected in Neo's belief, Morpheus's faith and Trinity's (Carrie Ann Moss) love.The film's other high point of course is the ingenuity employed in action choreography. The Lobby scene and the bullet dodging scene have already attained classic status and I'm yet to see a film that has sequences that could surpass the standards set by The Matrix (Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon included). Characters in the film are quite well etched and every actor delivers in a 'I-was-made-for-this-role' fashion. Keanu Reeves is perfect as the believable hero and perhaps turns his best performance since 'Speed'. Laurence Fishburne is excellent as the precise, wise and charming Morpheus. Hugo Weaving as Agent Smith is amazing in portraying villiany in a slow, deliberate & mechanical manner. Carrie Ann Moss does justice to the vulnerable yet dangerous Trinity. The dialogues in the film, especially those of Morpheus, make their presence felt and have a faint but certain rhetoric ring.All in all The Matrix is everything i could have asked for in a film. And apart from being just a film, it is an exciting experience as well, no matter how many times you watch it. Of all the mindless films that are being dished out today (especially in the sci-fi genre)The Matrix comes across as a refreshing example of a film that has genuine content and vision that goes in tandem with its chic looks. So powerful is its impact that it keeps the head buzzing even hours after you have watched in. If you haven't watched this film, then watch it. I could go on and on about this film which i deem perfect in every manner, and yet i won't be doing justice to it. For as Morpheus says 'Unfortunately no one can be told what The Matrix is. You have to see it for yourself.'Ten on Ten",The Matrix

1570,moviebloke,A classic in the making,9,22 February 2002,"As we have already seen, The Matrix has been imitated and satirized for its ground-breaking cinematography. This movie is, for lack of a better word, astounding. During the first half of the movie, the audience is drawn in to find out what the matrix really is. When we find out, we certainly aren't disappointed. This film takes existentialism to a new level in visualization. The Wachowski brothers and Joel Silver did a magnificent job making this film. Keanu Reeves' minimal lines proved to be a smart choice in that his low quality acting didn't interfere too much with the movie. The only real weakness of the film, was that ending the movie with a love story was sappy and ill-timed. I wouldn't have minded if Carrie-Anne Moss' character simply protested her love to Keanu Reeves' character, but the fact that it brought him back to life was a mistake. With all things considered, no one should miss this movie. See it! All of you!",The Matrix
1571,JollyG87,THE BEST MOVIE EVER!,10,23 January 2004,"Look at the subject and look at my profile and you can tell what I'm about to give this movie. 10/10 babe! The characters are set up great and the action was just so freakin cool! It was way better than the next two because this one had emotion. Emotion makes fighting cooler; that's why I love revenge movies. When Neo walks into that lobby and starts kickin ass you're rootin for him! When Neo is fighting a bunch of Smiths in Reloaded, you're thinking ""Well this will be cool,"" but you're not rooting for him as much so it takes some of the fun away. It also had a really deep story. Any movie with AWESOME characters, AWESOME story, and BEYOND AWESOME action deserves to be an instant classic. The story itself is not original, but the approach to it is, so it feels like a completely different movie when you see it.The Matrix- 10/10",The Matrix
1572,Rock1984,"A good movie, 7/10",7,30 December 2002,"*Minor Spoilers*I have to say that this was pretty good for an action movie. It had a rather original approach (although it's nothing new - the ideas HAVE already been there, although many people don't know or believe)and GREAT special effects. But it also has the same flaws as most action movies: flat characters (Neo is the only person we get to know at least a bit), a terribly boring last twenty or thirty minutes, which have no story and are just there to display more off the special effects (and even the bullettime gets boring after you've seen it once), and an absolutely stupid ending with Neo coming back to life after receiving a kiss by Trinity (OH PLEASE!!!). Anyway, I think this is nearly as good as an action movie can get, so see it if you have the chance.",The Matrix
1573,super_keeper,Poor film with good action,6,12 August 2002,"The Matrix is a classic special effects movie in a similar way Jurassic Park is, it has ushered in a new age of special effects that will rule the cinema for the next decade but the actual film is below average at best. Everyone now knows about the lobby shoot out and the 'I know Kung Fu' sequences (now surpassed by Crouching Tiger') and they deserve all the praise they get its just a shame that they're ruined by the dull and lifeless characters. How Reeves gets acting work in Hollywood I have no idea, every-time he speaks you want to point and laugh at his blank expressions and awful line reading, there is more charisma in a dead fish. Moss (who is so good in Memento) is not much better and Fishbournes philosophies make you wish Agent Smith would just kill him and be done with it. Dialogue that wouldn't be out of place in Dr Strangelove ('Its a killing machine designed for one thing') and good plot with some first rate ideas is wasted by the directors, the cool of people in suits doing Kung Fu in slow motion wears off pretty quick on repeat views. It is however a landmark in action cinema if only for the last 30 minutes, it is destined to be copied for years to come by second rate action and science fiction movies and for that I give it 5/10.",The Matrix
1574,hamillon2,the matrix 'really' has you,10,17 January 2003,"Unfortunately no one can be told what the matrix is.. u have to see it for your self .. an awesome film with outstanding special effect and one of the best scripts of all time. Wachowski Bros show how a pretty common SI-FI story can make a lot of difference in the theater.Without a the simplest of redundant dialog, the movie flows like a smooth velvet. And unlike many other films, I guess they didn't try to give any arbitrary special effect or anything. Even  I felt, the room number of Neo, 101 sounds a bit like Neo, and 303 sounds a bit like Trinity.. :).. which is kind of cool.. when the smallest things look finer, it feels great..
It leaves a loads of mystery to uncover in the sequel, like ""Zayan"", the only human city, and the love-story of Neo and Trinity, what happens to Oracle and her spoon-benders.. and surly the 4 of them can't fight against all the AI's. So.. who would be the other people to fight with them...

It's a great science fiction movie, good action sequences and a fantastic plot / concept which will (REALLY) blow you away (if it's not already spoilt)I've had a hard time writing this review, retyped it 3 times now, but I've decided to go with that above. The only way I can do this movie the justice it deserves is to make sure others got the same experience out of it as me, I'd be sorely disapointed if someone else missed out because someone spoilt it for them.

1577,jayarava,Still the best,10,20 July 2009,"2009, and the best sci-fi movie ever made is still The Matrix (1999). Let's forget about the sequels, the less said the better, but the original had everything: mind blowing special effects, awesome concept, gripping plot, breath-taking action sequences (with knowing nods to the Hong-kong Kungfu genre - e.g. signature moves from Bruce Lee from Jet Li), gnarly sound-track, and engaging characters. Though many aspects of the movie have been copied, nothing has come close to it. Never has one movie raised the bar by so much.When one considers the nature of speculative fiction one sees so few movies that come close to the complexity of thought and concept as the print medium. Only The Matrix and a handful of others (e.g. Bladerunner, Close Encounters, 2001 A Space Odyssey) really do justice to the genre - the books are more about humans adapting to unfamiliar situations rather than monsters and terror. So few sci-fi movies require the audience to think or evaluate what they are seeing. With The Matrix one cannot help but reflect on reality and what it means to be human.

Morpheus is a master that we all long for in our miserable daily life and Neo is an ideal path-follower who will become a hero soon.
This film can answer all the expectations that you may have. Maybe it will be outdated some 15-20 years later or maybe it will be understood that every little thing that is told in the film is the TRUTH itself.

The script is solid enough to cover for Keanu's acting pitfalls and keep the audience into the plot.  It also does a great job of keeping a very complicated story simple.  One can walk away from this movie for up to 40 minutes, come back, and still be able to follow what is going on.  Some may look at this as a negative, but it is essential for a action film to be easy to follow and pick up quickly.  Its like History class in school.  If your off in one chapter, it wont kill you, you can pick it up right at the next chapter.  A very entertaining and exciting film, although the sequels are a bit of a disappointment (especially in plot) they become far to complicated and far too dependent of CGI.

1582,Jarv1,I know this will be unpopular,4,23 February 2004,"OK- don't get me wrong this was a groundbreaking movie. However I have some serious problems with it.First the good. The action scenes and special effects are awesome. They really did set new standards and knocked that hackneyed load of tripe The Phantom menace into the bin. The ending is also fantastic- there is no way that an ending this perfect was meant to be followed by two mediocre sequelsHowever, The plot is more full of holes than a fishnet stocking. For instance- I know this is nit picking- but how can Cypher be betraying the crew when not only do they have to plug him into the matrix for him to go and meet the agents in the first instance, but are also monitoring said conversation.Secondly- the philosophical parts. The matrix basically asks the question is it better to live the dream. The flaw comes in that in this case it is quite clearly better- great, so mankind is not ""free"" but each person lives a sufficiently realistic existence inside their own head for it not to matter. If the alternative is living in fear and squalor, dodging sentinels whilst eating what looks like congealed semen then I would frankly rather live inside my own dreams dining on fine food etc.Next up, the acting. Could someone please explain to me how Keanu Reeves is a leading man. He single handedly trashes all the good work put in by the supporting cast- especially Laurence Fishburne and Hugo Weaving. Anyway how can I be expected to take a film seriously where Keanu is effectively god?Overall, a reasonable film but not the second coming of Christ so many people think it is.",The Matrix

It has Japanese fight techniques, spectacular special effects, great characters, computer's theme... Everything is just mixed in the movie, along with the human issue of freedom and machine control, in order to make one of the best movies ever. It's incredible how the Wachowsy brothers could come up with such a great idea. I was amazed about characters like Agent Smith. I truly is one great performance by Hugo Weaving. He was the one that designed the whole character, and it just came out with all the qualities you would like in a character such as Smith: a leading machine. Also there's Morpheus (with Laurence Fishburne, which is in my opinion one of the great actors Hollywood has) or The Oracle (Gloria Foster). Keanu's part was also good, thought I don't find him to be that much of an actor. Anyway the fight sequences were breathtaking and the plot could't be any better... It's one of the best movies in my list and it over tops any of the sequels. Although the other two movies are still great they can't be compared to the one that started it all. The real center of the story is here. The Wachowsky brothers weren't even considering a sequel, so the whole movie was here...

1586,bender-bender,Now where is the reality?!,10,3 May 2017,"Now that's my first movie review in a long time, and it happens to be Matrix. I'm writing this review 18 years after the film was released, but that's because I'm almost as old as the movie. Well, the time sure does pass by, but the axioms of this life never change. And one of those axioms is that Matrix is and always will be one of the best sci-fi movies of all time. That's my statement and I know that I'll have 100% support. There is everything gorgeous about the movie: the scenario, the music, the actors, the whole dark future atmosphere, the combat choreography, absolutely everything is mind blowing. It is such a revolutionary film that I just can not remember any other science fiction movie or a movie of any other genre that could at least stand on the same level (guys I'm Lord of the Rings fan too, so I did not mean to offend anyone).Now I'll be just a bit more specific. The plot is set in the world where machines have enslaved mankind and tried to use them as an energy source. Well, who would of thought that creating an AI could turn in such a horrible tragedy. In order to keep human beings under control, the machines have created the virtual reality called ""Matrix"", where the world is still not destroyed by the war between our two species. Enough with the spoilers (though I know that there is no such human who did not see or at least hear everything concerning the plot of Matrix in 2k17), lets head to the rest of the components of the movie. The music. It is really stunning. Don Davis made a huge work. The soundtrack is catchy and does drag you into the reality of Matrix where you feel for our main heroes (especially when they're fighting with agents), hope they will be fine and will carry out their mission to the end. Also great tracks by Deftones band (""My Own Summer"" is my favorite) that suite just great for combat situations.The characters are diversified and complement each other to make the picture look even more realistic and splendid. Laurence Fishburne (Morpheus) always surprised us with his wisdom and tenacity, Keanu Reeves (Neo) played his role of a chosen one with great dedication and coldblooded exposure, Hugo Weaving as Agent Smith was very logical and really made me believe that he was not a human being, but a machine with one purpose only – seek and destroy all human resistance. Got to give it for stunts. They are just awesome, not to mention that Keanu Reeves made it all by himself.The basic idea along with the atmosphere are one of a kind. I must repeat myself – the is nothing like this picture and there never will be. It is an absolute masterpiece. Because such a concept of a whole new reality, such a vision of possible future problems that mankind can (mostly will) face, and such a creativity in tying all these strings together (to make it feel that this is the verity and the whole bitter truth about our reality) is a work of a genius. Breathtaking job by Wachowski Brothers (now sisters) and a bow from me.And today, as I look at modern movies I think I might cry next time re watching Matrix, because a God's work can be only seen once in a lifetime and that my dear friends, was it!",The Matrix
1587,urface958,An eye opening experience,10,7 March 2015,I personally love this movie and if you have not seen it you are missing out because it is for sure a must see. It's about a man (Neo) who keeps hearing rumours about a revolutionist by the name of Morpheus and Neo decides to meet with him. Morpheus explains to him that he must come with him on an adventure. Neo wakes up in a space ship surrounded by people he had met and they explain to him that he was in a computer world called the Matrix. Neo was now introduced to the real world which was overrun by machines that rose up and claimed the earth and the humans went underground in order to survive. Morpheus then tells Neo that he is the one who will save earth and create peace with the machines and stop the Matrix from destroying the real world. The incredible story line and dialogue along with the incredible action sequences and stunts made this movie an incredible film experience that really opened my eyes and made me realize that it's a possibility we do live in a fake world run by all of our thoughts.,The Matrix

Example: One guy does the punching while the other guy just stands there absorbing the hits, Then they switch and the OTHER guy does the punching while the original guy just takes it. The martial arts scenes are so bad...I mean....don't rip off Bruce Lee from decades before and then produce WORSE kung fu fight scenes than he did. Supposedly set in the future but conventional weapons, aircraft, architecture etc seem to be the only things available.

The reason for this was that it is very confusing. That's part of the beauty: in the beginning of the movie, you're as confused as the main character, but in the end everything becomes clear. The story is a reference to the ancient-Greek philosopher Plato, who believed the real world was actually a cave, and that the world we lived in was a dream. In ""The Matrix"", they say the world we live in is just a dream, a computer, that the machines have programmed for us. The villain in the movie is just so deliciously creepy! He talks extremely slowly that it sends cold chills down your spine. This role is played by Hugo Weaving. Bravo, Weaving! Another character I rather liked was Trinity, a tough kung-fu fighting girl who has an extremely cool introduction. She is played by Carrie-Ann Moss. The movie has some religious themes and classic, possible one of the best, special features ever done in film history. If you are easily offended by sci-fi violence, I would recommend that you skip this movie. But in other cases, I say put it on your list and invite some friends!

What if the we are all under government control, being drugged to stay asleep and a program is having us all dream this same dream we call ""life""?In the Matrix, Neo wakes up and finds a world nothing like the world in the dream he has been having all his life and he is ""born"" again into the real world and reprogrammed.",The Matrix

In the beginning I loved it for the amazing special effects, bullet time, martial arts, gun fights, score and soundtrack. As time went on, I also began appreciating this film from other perspectives. The story, the filming techniques, the philosophy and much more. Within this film a genuine hero/villain contrast is excellently established. The struggling Neo (Keanu Reeves) as he is faced with the revelations of The Matrix, and his capabilities there within. The formidable Agent Smith (Hugo Weaving), who forces his way on screen with his calm demeanor, wall smashing strength & bullet dodging speed. Smith's presence demands attention & is accompanied by a genuine ""Uh-oh"" feeling when he appears. You only have to hear the term ""Agent"" to know that someone is about to start running. The Matrix is a film that has had a profound impact on me on many levels, and will always have a special place in my heart.

Yes, the story was mildly interesting (What there was of it). But as Independance Day famously proved, you need more than that to make a good movie; but not, apparently, to sell one. Besides the hugely cliched and excruciating dialogue, Keanu Reeves continued his tradition of lending no personality whatsoever to his character, much as the rest of the 'actors' in this terrible, terrible film. The only chap with even a small measure of integrity and personality was the great Laurence Fishburne, and he certainly was far from at his best. I didn't care one jot who lived or died when I was watching this movie, although I must admit it was rather satisfying when the infuriatingly smug agent was finally dispatched. Anyone who genuinely liked The Matrix is nothing more than a conveyor belt mass-production social drone who'll swallow any old hype and sacrifice any amount of dignity for the sake of a few nice effects. Just a normal Keanu Reeves film, then.",The Matrix

Like most of you who saw it in its first week running, I had no Idea about the plot and just assumed it would be a good Special Effects Movie.  Man, was I totally wrong.  After about 20 minutes into the movie you are asking yourself ""Hey, is Keanu Reeves really acting this well?"".  I sat and stared in awe, at the screen, the plot was deep, the story had meaning, and Keanu actually put serious effort into this one.  He didn't seem like the normal Wooden Soldier... and Laurence Fishburne, man he is totally under appreciated, he played a heck of a part.  All in all, one hell of a movie, I give it a 8.  Most Def. with going to see, and don't make the mistake of waiting till home video, this one has to be seen in the theaters, and make it a Sony digital theater.",The Matrix

Just pay attention to the way the movie uses the terms Zion, Trinity, Nebuchadnezzar, the Oracle, the very first Matrix, sacrificing one's life for another, and especially the resurrection of the Chosen One.

Matrix presents us with new camera techniques, Hong Kong style fight sequences that some may complain of being unoriginal, but they are in a league of their own.

He invented not only cyberspace, but also the Matrix; the place in which you interact with information in physical form. This his hero Case did in Neuromancer (1984), and this is something Johnny Mnemonic did.
What the Wachowski brothers have done is to take it to another level, give it a little twist: What if the physical manifestations of information started to question their own existance? What is reality?When the people in Gibson's novels are trying to get in to cyberspace, the people in Wachowski's movie are trying to get out. This is a pivotal thing that not many have cared to take notice of. People have been so busy declaring The Matrix so unique that they cannot see that Gibson already did it, and Philip K. Dick before him.",The Matrix

It gets better because you pick up on things that you missed the first time. Anybody notice what the title of the chapter that was in the book that he stored his ""illegal"" discs inside.  The chapter was called ""nihilism."" Defined as :""An extreme form of skepticism that denies all existence.

The premise of the movie is terrific, and like the Truman Show did, makes you wonder if this just might be true. The special effects are astounding, and while they appear a lot in the movie, aren't over done in the least.  And I hope that Keanu Reeves finally discovers that Sci-Fi/cyberpunk is his thing.

What sets this movie apart from all others is the visual effects.  I have never seen anything like the action sequences in The Matrix... Stunningly original.  From the opening scene of the movie, we are given one breathtaking sequence after another.  Word of warning, though -- it is a bit campy.  I think it would have played better as straight action, but if a little corniness is expected, it can be enjoyed, so realize that going in. If you are expecting a profound movie about the meaning of life, you're at the wrong movie.

And don't try to give me the line ""oh well, you just didn't get it!""  I got it.  A two year old could follow that plot.  That doesn't make it good.  Case in point, near the end of the film, Neo is dead.  But wait!!!!  Trinity then bends over Neo's corpse and tells him that he has to survive because a fortune teller has deemed her to be the one who would fall in love with The Chosen One. Then to make things worse, he actually does come back to life.  What a crock of...  I think you get the point.  If you really want to see a great movie about a man who has to fight against an unbeatable enemy, watch Dark City!

The pace is fast, the visuals are simply stunning, but most of all the set piece action sequences just took my breath away.There is lots of homage to all the great action directors: the plot is basically Terminator, there is much use of John Woo's 2 guns crossed over, the shootout scene is reminiscent of Heat and the whole design concept is somewhere between the 5th Element and Brazil. But don't be fooled into thinking this is just a rip off: the Wachowski's are clearly influenced and pay tribute to these directors, but have a very individual style of their own.And everyone wears sunglasses!

Once it finally came out, I walked into the theater with high expectations. The movie far exceeded my expectations. What we have here is a masterpiece of filmmaking. It is visually, as well as intellectually, stimulating. It's a special effects ride with a storyline, an actual plot. The special effects don't get in the way of the story, they enhance it. The action sequences were amazing. The slow-motion technique used throughout the movie gave me chills. The Jackie Chan/Bruce Lee-like martial arts sequences will leave you smiling and wanting more. I felt myself tensing and holding my breath throughout the whole film. And the bullets!! They speak for themselves! The cinematography was perfect. I loved every camera angle, every shot, every extreme close up-fast out, in this movie. The acting of everyone was very well done. Say what you will about Keanu Reeves' acting ability, he did a good job with this movie. He had the perfect look for the character he played. This movie is highly recommended to anyone who is even the smallest fan of sci-fi, cyberpunk, film noir. It will blow your mind.",The Matrix

I would like to see another movie try to copy the plot of this one, because it would be impossible to do it.

It's not written by Gibson, but seems like it could have been.  The virtual reality is almost perfect.I had read that the plot was thin and the middle third slow.  The plot is just fine for an action film and the pacing throughout was just right in my opinion.  I wish it had been longer.  I hope it makes a fortune so more like it will be produced.My eleven year old son and his friend also thought it was great.   My son's first comment was; ""Dad, we have to get this video when it comes out.""  I agreed.  To put that in context, when we saw ""Wing Commander"", his comment was - ""That sure was boring.""The movie is rated R and there's quite a bit of video arcade/action style violence.  There is also a scene at the beginning that I thought might produce nightmares for a kid - shoot, maybe even for an adult.  So don't take children much younger than 11 or children who you do not want exposed to violence.The evil guy, Mr. Smith, is nearly perfect for the role and the role is just right for the movie.

Laurence Fishburne and Carrie-Anne Moss were awesome! I loved the kung-fu and the way they all looked so cool fighting! I also thought it was soooooo cool when they would freeze an object in the air or on the ground (the water part when Morpheus got shot in the ankle) and then they would take the ""camera"" and rotate it around the object! Like when Trinity jumped up at the beginning and when Neo and the head agent guy jumped at one another!

1628,Z B Brox,A well balanced Sci-Fi,10,1 June 1999,"Yes, the Matrix wasn't completely original. There were plot elements that were similar to Dark City, Terminator, Total Recall, The Truman Show, and Greek Philosophy. However: It blended aspects form all of these movies into a single story that grabs the viewer both intellectually and visually. First, the plot was neither ""non-existent"" as some claim, or ""overly-complex"" as others do. It was fairly straight forward, but posed many questions. They were, for the most part, answered in the film, but *only* in the context of the film. It is not a film that tells you, it's a film that asks you. Second, It has become far too ""cool"" to be uncool. Pretentious twits who harp on movies for using special high-tech special effects, having action sequences, or giving the main characters sunglasses don't seem to realize that these things all serve the same purpose as the half-baked love story inserted into ""Titanic."" They are there to give the audience an emotional response as well as an intellectual one. They inspire excitement and awe... Which is at *least* as valuable as any masochistic desire to cry at a sad film. Emotional response, in whatever form, is valuable, and the Matrix pulls off these things exceedingly well. In short, The Matrix is an excellent balance of intellect, action, style, and awe. If you give the plot half the attention you give the effects, you won't be disappointed.",The Matrix
1629,bennus,Market Forces win the day,2,26 June 1999,"While watching the Matrix an image suddenly came to my mind. I pictured a man, late 50's wearing a smart suit & puffing on a big fat cigar. He sits at the end of a table addressing a number of similar persons who all listen tentatively to every word which the man says. The man takes a big puff on his cigar & leans forward & says ""what we need is something for the kids"".Watching the Matrix you suddenly realise that it is probably the most precisely made film since the Studio System was in force, every aspect is made to appeal to a young (15-30 yr old) audience, & market forces have been well taken into account. The lighting is neo-gothic similar to that found in Seven & The Crow, The camerawork is so John Woo I'm surprised he did'nt sue for plagerism. & it's a story about the internet, & hey, the kids 'dig' the internet, don't they? add a metal/big beat soundtrack & hey presto, a film the kids will loveThe Directors have in fact taken so much time over including enough cool effects (as well as advertising Nokia phones) that they have seemed to have not worried themselves over simple features such as plot, amount of holes left in it are worrying, for instance why are the rebels (I use Rebels in want of a better word) stationed in a space ship? why do we never see Zion? & also how come they can defy gravity yet they are unable to jump off buildings/fly etc etc?The acting is also bottom rate, in fact it seems that the Directors realised that Keanu can't act, so did.nt bother asking him to. However Laurence Fishburn & Hugo Weaving are both good actors yet little is asked of them. Carrie-Ann Moss as Trinity is poor, although her charcter is supposed to be deeply in love with Neo (played by Reeves, also do you notice Neo, anagram for....I won't spoil it for those who have'nt seen the film yet) the lack of chemistry between the two characters is so un-reveling that the situation has to be spelt out by a third party. However it should be acted that the Script is one of the worst I've seen, full of the Cliches & Remarks which movie executives think are cool & funny yet often fall flat, indeed most of the script is so cringe worthy & predictable that only someone who has'nt seen a Big Budget Shoot-em-up in the last 10 years would be surprised. In fact many people have commented on how the film tries to tackle a new imaginative ide, however all I thought was that it took an idea from 19th century literature in man against Machine & put a few philisophical theories in tow, add technology & hey presto. That's not imagination, that's reading books.However the film does offer some pleasures, for instance the Kung Fu sequence between Neo & Morphius (Fishburn) is the most camp fight sequence since Jacky Chan became a star although campness is'nt something I think the Directors aimed for, Indeed the clothes (lots of leather) is realitively camp once again yet you get the feeling that the Directors thought that their dress sense was 'cool'. However, apart from this, the film falls apart falls apart, Indeed some of it seems too long, with the fight sequences & gun battles often being too long, in fact over emphasise in a Tarantinoloveofgunsandshootingthingsisreallycool way. In fact the only thing that amazed me about the sequences was how it was shot, the amount of flying debris must have injured two or three cameramen in the process.On the whole The Matrix is dumb, unimaginative, & poorly made & shows why Hollywood has suffered against an independent film industry able to produce much better & imaginative films than Hollywood. Seven & The Usual Suspects are far better films & even though the love affair with guns is similar to John Woo, at least his films (at least earlier films) had a bit of characterisation, Indeed, it seems that the directors believe that the main appeal of Tarantino lies in the gun fights, not in the far better developed realtionships between the characters which I find interesting.

Of course, some of the innovative special effects of the time have since been over-used in just about every movie that followed this one. Otherwise, the characters and story-line are utterly uninspired and unoriginal. Repeated viewings have been rather painful Keanu Reeves is within his element by playing the utterly clueless protagonist (see Bill & Ted). People have often praised the story for raising such existential questions, but I feel the same question was approached and done much more effectively in movies such as The City of Lost Children and Dark City.

It is, of course - there are plenty of fresh and genuinely entertaining sequences in here.But if you pay attention, you'll notice the real brilliance of the movie - the underpinning themes.  There are a lot of messianic and Taoist (""there is no spoon"") hints; just look at IMDB's own trivia.It continues.  The Matrix seems to be an allegory for issues of race; notice how all the Agents are white, male, and middle-aged, and how they're the ones in charge of creating an illusion?  Notice how the Nebuchadnezzar crew is dominated by minorities (but not afraid to include Caucasians), and they prefer the real world?  Neo is ultimately able to thrive in both... so I would argue that they're relaying the concept of accepting both white and non-white as a part of your universe.And it goes on...

Forget about all the blue pill/red pill, ""What is the Matrix"" nonsense, which is all just a badly plotted excuse for some action.  And that is where the film excels.The camera work and effects blend together beautifully, sweeping around people in the air and such like.  The dialogue is wonderfully cheesy at times (""We need guns, lots of guns"") but you really forgive all flaws when the music kicks in and the next big action scene begins.There is one flaw too far though: Keanu Reeves really is awful, he couldn't act hurt if you kicked him in the groin.

Everyone who says Keanu Reeves can't act probably just saw Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure or Bogus Journey (which, by the way, SO totally ruled) and didn't bother to even watch this movie before bashing it.  Hugo Weaving was by far the best villain of the late 90's. Joe Pantoliano is a great hidden enemy, and the rest of the cast is no less magnificent.The Special Effects were amazing.  I was in  shock when Isaw just about every scene.The action was no less spectacular as it was ample.But the best part was the plot.

Even if you watch it with the sound on mute, the film looks absolutely amazing.  It is drenched in such superlative cyberpunk atmosphere, with slick cinematography, sets, and costume design.  The direction by the Watchowski's is full of vision.Additionally, the action scenes themselves are so over-the-top.  No action film before has filmed action sequences this way: frequent slow-motion, off-the-wall (literally) choreography mixture of martial arts and gunplay. The lobby scene toward the end of the film is perhaps the best action sequence of any film, period.The story is also competent, with many mind-blowing moments.This film will definitely be a cult classic.  I hope the sequels are as good (but it seems like it will be difficult to top the original!

It's a must see for all sci-fi fans and even if your not a sci-fi, it's still a great watch.What is The Matrix? It's story is set in around the year 2199, where computers/machine/AI have enslaved the entire human race and are using us as a power sorce for them. The AI (Artificial Intelligence) have plugged all humans into a somewhat Virtual Reality computer program (The Matrix) where we live our life in the year 1999 unaware of the real world.Morpheus (Lawrence Fishburne) leads a team of would-be heros to find The Chosen One, who is capable of changing The Matrix to his liking. Keanu Reeves plays Neo, The Chosen One, who with the help of Morpheus and his team try to save the world.I won't reveal too much of the story for you but it's a great movie that all must watch.

Well.I could tell you the answer to that question, but then I would have to kill you.  You understand?The Matrix, besides being abundant in awesome special effects (mainly computer generated) also has quite a fictional tale to tell.  The story, without giving too much away, was very computer orientated, a little confusing if not paid attention to, fast moving and a little frightening to wrap your mind around.  Unfortunately I don't think I can say much more without giving too much away.  ""Oh, come on,"" you're going.  No, sorry, I really can't.This movie was shot in Sydney (so my friends tell me) and quite a few Aussie actors make appearances, including Hugo Weaving (Jurassic Park) and Matt Doran (ex-Home and Away).  Keanu Reeves (even though I don't really think that much of him) was pretty good in the leading role and depicted his character as a type of enigma, probably leaving most of the audience to wonder if.right until the end.After seeing this film and walking out of the theatre, I took a look around me and couldn't help but think, ""Is this real?""  Definitely one of those movies that leave you thinking, ""But, what if it's real?""If you were pondering the thought of seeing this movie, I would definitely suggest that you see it in a large theatre, with a huge screen and surround sound (or whatever you call it), definitely adds to the atmosphere.I give it 4 wide, uncomprehending eyes.

It is well-deserving of the acclaim it has received for these. If it it were based only on these, I would give the film 10/10.Yet looking at it closely, there are certain parts of it that ruin the film for me. First and foremost is the horrific dialogue, usually from Laurence Fishburne. How much cryptic trash must he spout before he gets rid of all those clichés? It sometimes feels like a failed attempt to turn an action film into a philosophical message!Not that the plot was bad though. It may have been taken from any number of movies, yet it was an interesting twist on the average action film. I wouldn't call it the best sci-fi film ever, or the one from which all others must follow, but it is certainly well-thought out.I gave Matrix a 7 because, despite the interesting story, it still feels like an attempt to make an action movie into something more intellectually challenging. At first glance it is a very enjoyable and is very impressive. However it's appeal comes more from its action and stunts and really it should have been left as that.",The Matrix

The plot of the one's journey is a brilliant story, the special effects and the free ideas of these effects are astounding, the martial arts, the style of the film is cool and the sounds and music chosen fit nicely. As much as you could criticise Keanu Reeves acting it was his performance and look in the movie that made it work and I couldn't see anyone else playing the part of Neo.

Film looks amazing with CGI that age really nicely and tone that's interesting. World is very interesting with lot of great ideas in how the Matrix works and in how a lot of abilities work. Not everything is explained but that adds to the iterpretation which i like. I love themes of destiny mind and metaphors fir Christianity and how film will explore them. Actors work for their characters and especially Hugo Weawing who is excellent as the villain and agent Smith is a great villain in an of itself. He is intimidating and cool and powerful so you're scared of him because he just doesn't show his weaknesses at all. Neo has a great setup for an arc in that he is a savior. 3rd act adds a lot to the world and also to the Neo's character as he destroy Smith but knows that isn't the end ready for things to come. Dialogue is really fun. Some characters I like like Smith and Morpheus and arc for Neo characters are very weak. Even Neo and Trinity are bland. Supporting characters are just here to die and Cypher began okay and I like his motivation but then they just killed him off. Characters weren't that well defined. Pacing was weak. First act is kinda too short and second act goes on maybe tad too long and also at points film will be pretentious even though it has many plot holes and logic fails.

I remember the trailer showing such different visuals then what I was use to at the time, like, why and how is that girl in a black leather suit jumping from building to building. This was 1999 by the way before the comic book superhero adaption film frenzy. So at first I was just curious about it. I remember leaving some other film and on my way out of the theatre noticing it was playing down the hall. I just wanted to have a look at it to see what it was like. I opened the theatre door and slowly sat in with the crowd already viewing the film. You could tell the film was near its conclusion and I was in awe, when I seen the slow motion camera work and advanced special effects. Once I seen the movie from start to finish, it was officially my favorite film. I think this is the action film that defines my generation. The film was bold and daring, and pulled off more than it's creators probably meant to. It completely redefined action films from then on. I can't count how many films and video games, bullet-time has been featured in after this film was released. The Matrix is truly one of kind.

From start to finish you're on the edge of the seat, the plot is surprisingly original (the TV adverts don't give away much). The opening scene is very good, an action packed scene with the mysterious Trinity and the equally mysterious ""Agents"". The whole film has this 90's conspiracy theory feel to it, the scene in the interogation room is a bit dark and intimedating, 1984 style. The scene where Neo meets Morpheus is also very atmospheric and dark. The effects are, well revolutionary, the use of bullet time photography is incredible I hope this technique is used more often in films, it really improved the fight scenes. Even without BT photography the fight scenes still look incredible, the govt. lobby scene to mention but a few. The plot is very good, without spoiling it its a kind of alternative reality type plot, the closest film that is similar that springs to mind is The 13th Floor but its only vaguely similar. There are however a few inconsistancies in the plot which reduce the credibility which is disappointing. But those aside its still a terrific film a must see for any action fan. 9/10.",The Matrix

I enjoy watching movies like this when you have the option to except the entertaining value and also have the chose to be able to look deeper and gain some profound life perspective.I enjoyed one specific scene, in which, Agent Smith (Hugo Weaving) is talking to captured Morpheus (Laurence Fishburne) and comparing humans to viruses I thought that was interesting when I first saw Matrix in 1999 If you look at today's situation with global warming I think Agent Smith did make a pretty good case.The special effects in Matrix where the best at that time but for me I don't get caught up into special effects because it always get outdated but a good story never does. You can still enjoy movies like Amadeus, The Godfather and Schindler's List without worrying about how cheesy the special effects are on the screen but I feel that Matrix story is strong enough for a viewer to be more forgiving in the future.

1666,cleanbullfrog,Searching for the Messiah,10,14 January 2002,"Besides just being a stinkin' cool movie, The Matrix is a story of the coming of the Messiah.  The film has references to many religions and philosophies, both Western and Eastern.  That said, I believe The Matrix is primarily a mixture of Judaism and Christian themes, used to make the average moviegoer ponder his/her existence and reality. 	First let me explain why I consider this movie a story of the Jews.  All of Jewish history is of their oppression and the anticipation of their Messiah. In the film we are presented a race held as slaves by a stronger force. Those who realize they are in bondage talk of the prophecy of the coming of their Messiah.  This Messiah will be a warrior who will overcome the oppressor.  There are also references to the city of Zion, a place of refuge mentioned frequently in the Hebrew scriptures, and the ship is named Nebuchadnezzar, a king of Jerusalem found in the Old Testament book of Daniel. 	In a sense the movie follows also bears the influence of Christianity. Besides the obvious reference in the name Trinity (only Christians believe in a triune God), they are some subtler hints as well.  When the camera shows the Nebuchadnezzar's name plaque you may notice the reference to Mark 3:11.  This verse from the Christian scriptures reads, `Whenever the unclean spirits saw him, they fell down before him and shouted, You are the Son of God.'  This is an interesting allusion to the Messiah and his power over evil forces which are hinted at during the film's final climax.  Of course there is also Neo's death and resurrection which parallels that of Jesus'. 	I also thought that this film was an interesting, though probably unintentional, knock against Gnosticism.  Rather than transcending the physical to be only a mind, the goal in the film is to realize that to be truly living you must be more than just your thoughts.  You must a whole person  the body is as important as the mind. 	It seems the Wachowski brothers gathered pieces from many sources to create this fantastic work of cinematic art.  This is a film that will be examined and speculated about for years to come.  I wait with baited breath for the sequel.",The Matrix

1670,zbrak,This movie took the Blue Pill,4,14 July 2003,"I have heard so much about the Matrix and finally watched it for the first time this weekend.Boy, were there lots of action sequences. Lots and lots and lots of action sequences. You can feel the filmmakers just trying to top the last sequence instead of doing something like advancing the plot or developing the characters. Unless you think the action sequence is the be-all-and-end-all of movies, all that action just gets boring after a while. I have nothing against whiz-bang special effects as long as they do something worthwhile to move the film along (the Lord of the Rings films are good at this). But this is just not happening with the Matrix.The Matrix concept itself is thought-provoking. Why isn't it developed more? The fact that this monumental struggle for the soul of humanity ends up with a shoot-out, a helicopter-dangling rescue sequence and a martial arts fight is almost laughable. It's like saying the mysteries of the universe can be unraveled by watching beer commercials. If you want to see an ending that leaves you with something worth chewing on, you'll be sadly disappointed (as I was).As for other elements of the movie -- Keanu Reeves, as much as I usually enjoy watching him, was extremely wooden. Fishburne and Moss were good at what they did, but their parts were pretty two-dimensional. I couldn't get emotionally involved with any of the characters, which is ultimately the fault of the writers. The cinematography and ""style"" of the film and the sets is pretty cool to look at. However, the whole black clothes and sunglasses motif is just a little bit hokey after a while. And the agents -- I swear they look just like the bad aliens in Brother From Another Planet -- I kept expecting them to shriek at each other.I look at it this way - people who think that sitting in front of their tubes and playing video games is a worthwhile way to spend their lives will probably love this movie. People who want something more will think it's pretty hollow. It's a shame because the concept had a lot of potential, but the filmmakers took the easy way out.",The Matrix

The Saga started smoothly, with Style, almost shining and vibrating with energy and...you get the idea.It has good action scenes(and helped with many special effects) it makes it interesting to watch over and over. Main Protagonist its Keanu Reeves(Neo), with the help of Laurence Fishbourne(Morpheus) and Carrie-Anne Moss(Trinity) has to find the truth behind the Matrix he was living. Shocking truth.This world is something virtual!oh the humanity! We actually live on ships, on a Huge Sewer! Well...anyway, the movie has everything: Weapons, Kung Fu, Bad Guys , a shocking story, a predictable love...simply complete. Too bad.Neo's ""The Chosen One"" Fate...would affect the quality of the next 2 movies. Still a piece of Art.Buy it.

It's a brilliant movie on a number of different levels - the directing is excellent, the camera work is great, the visuals are stunning, the kung-fu is A+, acting is executed with style and conviction, and the plot is truly inspired. It's really hard to use enough superlatives on this movie!It'd be a 10/10, except for the ending. Having Neo do what he does at the end really lets it down, in my opinion. However, there's a couple of sequels on the way, so let's see what the Wachowskis can do to make up for it.Other than that, (and like I said above) the movie is operating on so many different levels that each time you watch it, you pick up something new... this isn't by accident, either. The Wachowski brothers had the actors read a number of definitive works (Simulation & Simulcra was one I believe) in modern literature and psychology, and applied liberal dashings of aspects of the major religions to provide the best sci-fi movie of the decade, if not ever.I'm yet to meet somebody who hasn't enjoyed it.

It was so creative and interesting that I didn't want it to end if there is such a thing. I was addicted to it for like a week. They never should have made those degrading sequels. I hate them.

There are at least two features of the Matrix that are truly unique, iconic, epic even - the visual side and the philosophical side. The visual: every single shot of this movie is so beautiful, every second of it! The green-black background, the whole cyber-punk feel, the latex, the shabbiness of the interiors, the action scenes with bullets and water... And then the second philosophical part: watch closely where Neo stashes his cash - a book by Jean Baudrillard (Simulacra and Simulation, chapter on Nihilism). The theories thrown out there: humans are a virus (agent Smith), humans are slaves in the matrix (Morpheus, the name of the god of dreams). It challenges the nature of our reality, reminding us of being mindful of our lives. There are lots of analyses that have been written on the background of it all, so i won't be delving into that here.

OK, the special effects are maybe good, but what's the use of it when the story is as far beyond realism as you possibly can get? People that liked this movie have said that this could be the reality in 100-200 years from now on, and even earlier. Excuse me, but how stupid can you get? Nothing of it will even be reality in a billion years. It is impossible to ""fuck up"" brains like that.

The place where his revelation occurs is a ship with the name of ""Zion"". I don't have to further it. It kicks off with some noir atmosphere seasoned by disconnected and encoded dialogs; it might prompt you believe you are watching something serious. Don't fall for that. Then it goes downhill. You never get to know why these aliens are on earth ?!!? what is their angle after all ? The so-called Zion ship flies from nothing to nowhere with some fights with robot-aliens to help them pass the time. The story-telling is sketchy, more riddled than a fishnet.

It has a huge issue though: it doesn't understand human nature at all. The story wouldn't work if it was true. The problem is that if you have reality and a virtual reality, and the latter is actually exactly the same as the real one, and you can't tell the difference, then leaving the virtual reality to live the same life in the real world is a useless act. You can say you'd be free in the real world, but if you can't tell the difference, then you would be as free in the virtual one too. So why bother?
And since the real world is a wasteland, only ruins and aliens, and you would need to fight to have the same life as in the Matrix, many people would happily go back to the Matrix than chose the suffering and fighting.
So I say it is a very nicely done pulp fiction. Easy to enjoy and very spectacular. Only it doesn't make any sense. :D",The Matrix

Instead of reading my boring prose, go and see this movie first and then if you want come back and read what I have to say. I am hoping what I write is a little obscure compared with anything else you may have read before about the Matrix Trilogy.The core concept behind the story clearly comes from a combination of Neuromancer by William Gibson and Neal Stephenson's Snow Crash.The scene in this movie where Neo first wakes up in the real world is pretty much completely taken from the first chapter of ""To Your Scattered Bodies Go"" by Philip Jose Farmer.The wire work, you see in the Matrix and many modern Kung Fu movies was I think first featured in the daddy of them all namely Hsia nu aka A Touch of Zen, 1969.The Jesus and resurrection allegories are too numerous to mention even down to the Neo minutes vs Jesus days prior to their respective resurrections.We have billions of people living their lives in the Matrix and its always the 20th century. So you may have asked yourself how come no one in the Matrix notices that hey 50 years have gone by and we're still in the 20th century. All credit to the authors if, as I believe, they hint at the answer in the next two movies namely that the Matrix is on an infinite loop with infinitely many Neos.No English movie versions of Neuromancer, The Foundation Trilogy, City, Tiger Tiger, A Roadside Picnic and many more greats but instead we have movies of Battle Field Earth (the only book I ever binned) and Johnny Mnemonic.

1693,jeremychan-63517,Technologically stunning Masterpiece,10,1 January 2018,"Matrix has been regarded as ""A technologically stunning movie that furthers the genre and features crowd-pleasing performances to go with the frequent scenes of gunplay and violence."" (Hollywood Reporter,1999) . It gained 8/10 in IMDb (IMDb, 1999) ,with a score of 87% in Rotten Tomato (Rotten Tomato, 1999). Matrix has won 3 award in the total in 72nd Academy Awards for the Best Visual Effects, Best film editing and best Sound mixing. (72nd Academy Award Winner) The story itself is inspired from several Japanese anime and manga comics, along with several authors, Issac Asimov 'I, Robot' and Philip. K Dick 'Do Androids Dream of Electric Ships'. These stories are all about how the development of A.I leads to human extinction and how A.I dominantes humanity.  Matrix is a movie illustrating Thomas Anderson, later called Neo (Keanu Reeves), being unplugged from the simulation to the real world, after digesting the red pill given by Morpheus (Laurence Fishburne) which enables him to learn everything about the real world. He is believed to be 'the one' who owns superhuman power to stop the the machines, but is later to be told he is not by The Oracle (Gloria Foster). After a few battle scenes between Morpheus's crew and the machines; Neo and Agent smith, the movie ends with Neo defeating Agent Smith with his superhuman powers after being revived with a kiss by Trinity (Carrie-Anne Moss). To determine whether it is a good film or a bad film, the answer always lies in the script. The script by the Wachowski brother is seamlessly written. Includes what should be displayed in the set or not. The Matrix might have set the benchmark for the future sci-fi film in terms of how computer generated imagery should be used.Due to its use of visual effects, The Matrix won the academy award over Star Wars for Visual Effect in 2000. Comparatively, Matrix has more innovative and creative visual effects, including the use of different computer generated imagery to create a very dystopian atmosphere. Bullet-time technology (Madison Horror, no date) might be the most remarkable feature in the movie, in which Anderson stops the bullet and a still camera captures multiple angles in a single shot in circular motion, creating mind-blowing perspectives for the audience viewing the scene. 
The visual effects are so groundbreaking, which have set a new era for CGI technology to grow. Still today, The Matrix hold their ground against new science fiction films . The Matrix is a masterpiece , influencing the development of sci-fi films afterwards. For example. Wanted (2008) and Inception (2010)",The Matrix

1699,JohnI-2,Hold on a minute...,6,8 August 2001,"When I first saw this film the week it was released, I thought it was more entertaining than most, and I felt my admission price was justified.Then a few weeks later, I went and saw it in the theatre again, because a friend hadn't seen it. The second time around had to be one of the least pleasant moviegoing experiences I have had. During the second viewing, the movie seemed to drag on and on, and I had a strong desire to be elsewhere.
As I try to think about why this occurred, I believe it was because the movie was propelled by action scenes and suspense, but little else. Once you know what will happen, and have seen those scenes before, the movie becomes boring. Quite often I do like watching movies repeatedly, often into the double digits with the movies I own. But those movies have a rewatchability that the Matrix lacks.I believe fellow members of my generation are enamoured by this movie because of how it portrays the hyper-cool existence. By this I mean an existence where even the slightest things are portrayed with a profound mysticism and awesome beauty; a slick, hyper-mtv universe. This may result from a feeling of dull clumsiness and utter unsignificance present amongst many of today's under 30 set.Then there are those that say ""oh, this movie is deep, because it has 'philosophy'"". Maybe so, but it is philosophy of the absolute worst kind! For more on this, look to Nietzche's ""Twilight of the Idols"" and ""The Anti-Christ"". This movie has the most contemptible philosophy since ""Bicentennial Man"".As a final statement, I will say this. The Matrix is entertaining for its unusual premise and interesting action, however once you get over these and find out what happens, it loses all flavour like old chewing gum.",The Matrix
1700,G.P.,THIS MOVIE KICKED ASS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,10,4 April 1999,"I loved this movie.  The special and visual effects were mind-numbing.  The Wachowski Bros. paid (completely deserved) homage to the some of the best directors and pictures made this decade.  Movie hits like The Truman Show, Dark City, Terminator 2: Judgment Day, Hard Boiled, Hard Target, and The Crow.  Legendary directors like John Woo, James Cameron, Peter Weir, and Alex Proyas.  This movie had it all.  Great effects, kick ass (and expertly directed) martial arts fight scenes, exhilarating gun battles, an unbelievable plot (carried out to perfection), and a paranoia-driven message that the wool has been pulled over our eyes blinding us from the truth. Every actor does the role to perfection.  The fight scenes could not get any better.  I personally didn't want it to end.  The movie was well-done and the Wachowski Bros. should be proud because this movie was the best sci-fi action film I've seen since Terminator 2.  If you're looking for an awesome effects and digitally stunning movie, see this movie as fast as you can.  It doesn't disappoint.  But don't see it in a cheap theater.

If those effects aren't nominated for an Academy Award then I'm sure that everyone in the Academy is drunk or in serious need of a good butt whooping!  I liked the way all the characters and actors seemed to cliche with each other. And I wouldn't be surprised if in the next couple of years we would see ""The Matrix 2"" out at theaters.

This movie pretty much has it all, and it does it all well. Keanu was good in his role, basically because he didn't have to do too much acting, and was able to carry off the action scenes.  And what action scenes they are!  The cinematography is great, every shot is well set up and thought out.  The special effects more than live up to their advance billing.  Most action movies today would be content to stop there.  However, The Matrix also has a very good plot, one that keeps you guessing till the end as to what will happen.  One element that I feel makes this movie better than the usual action movie is that you actually care about the characters, and whether they will live or die.  The opening scene will hook you, and will also introduce you to the ""freeze time"" camera effect.  This effect appears throughout the movie, so get used to it.  I guess the highest compliment that I could give this movie is that i didn't want it to end, I just wanted more action, more effects.  All in all, I highly recommend this movie.",The Matrix

Despite what the previews have been showing off for the past few months, I wasn't sure about the plot, or of Keanu, for that matter.Well, all my reservations were for naught, because this likely is the best action flick since ""Terminator 2,"" and it is easily as groundbreaking technologically now as T2 was back then. 5 minutes into the movie, I thought I was doomed to an overly complex plot, but all was duly explained, and the pieces fit nicely.Keanu Reeves, along with the rest of the cast were superb, especially Laurence Fishburn, who was better than ever. Another performance in need of mention was that of Hugo Weaving as the ruthless Agent Smith... he was just a kick-ass antagonist.And those action scenes... as I mentioned before, they are as groundbreaking today as the scenes in T2 were 8 years ago. They truly must be seen... a feeble description on my part will gravely under-rate how spectacular they are. An awesome soundtrack by such artists as Massive Attack, Rage Against the Machine, Propellerheads, and more, only adds to the overall package. ""The Matrix"" is a phenomenal movie in many aspects, and I'm definitely going to see it again...and I'll be happy to pay for it.",The Matrix

I haven't heard of one person that hasn't liked it. The effects are incredible and near-photorealistic. The plot is thick, inspiring, and gets better the more times you see it. The action is the best I've seen. More guns and kicks then you'll ever see in this rare plot-and-action movie.",The Matrix

The beginning of the movie is long and drawn out, I actually had a person snoring behind me. But, after the first hour the movie starts to rock, until the end.  The end of the movie seemed rushed.  In my opinion, I believe that the story had too many different plot details, and they couldn't resolve all the issues, so a lot of issues went unresolved.  That is why I believe the end sucked.",The Matrix
1711,wrtrmike,"Great Special Effects and an interesting plot propel ""The Matrix""",8,6 April 1999,The Matrix is an exciting and very interesting movie.  It combines great special effects with an interesting story line.  It's only down-side is that some of the exposition is heavy-handed and takes too long (there were parts of the movie where I was just bored).  But the next fight scene more than made up for the slow parts and the idea behind it was compelling.,The Matrix

The previews were perfect because they enticed you enough to see it without giving away anything. I recommend that anyone who likes action or sci-fi or even just weird movies, this is the one for everyone.",The Matrix
1713,Zephyr-9,What is the Matrix? A terrific movie.,10,3 April 1999,"It may sound like cliche now, but you have to see the Matrix, you cannot be told.  Partly, because of the obvious reason, if you're like me, you hate spoilers and you want to see it for yourself. Partly, because although it's in a way a simple enough concept, it has to be seen to be really understood.That said, let's get to the meat.  If for no other reason than to see some great visual effects, this movie is well worth seeing.  The effects are wonderful and innovative without becoming a ""look what we did with CGI"" movie.  The sound is also great, well worth looking for a Dolby Digital theatre to see it.  This is one that will likely be snapped up quickly once it's out on DVD by people who want to showcase their 5.1 systems.As for the story, as I said, it's a simple yet intriguing concept of the future.  There were a couple minor plot holes, but nothing you can't overlook.  I won't go into what it's all about since I'm sure you've either heard it all before or want to see it for yourself.  Rest assured though, it's good.Character wise, the movie holds its own.  I've yet to be disappointed by anything Laurence Fishburne has done and he certainly doesn't disappoint here as the enigmatic resistance leader Morpheus.Personally, I'm not one for Keanu Reaves bashing, he has become somewhat typecast as the brooding, strong-silent type and he pretty much sticks to that character here.  I know, everyone's thinking about Johnny Mnemonic (Moronic), frankly, the suckage factor of that movie cannot be entirely laid on Keanu's lap.  They could have put anyone in that role and the movie would have still out-sucked Electrolux.The supporting cast supports well, even though the only characters you really get to know to any degree are Neo (Reaves), Morpheus, and Trinity (Carrie Ann Moss).It's hard to really critique this movie further without lapsing into spoilers and cliche, so I'll leave it at this;  The Matrix is an entertaining two hours and well worth the price of admission.",The Matrix
1714,Soma-6,you don't want to miss this,10,5 May 1999,"I must say I'm a sucker for movies that make you think. The idea that one is not in control of one's life may be a little over-used, but nevertheless, this movie gives you the visual details you need.I must say though some of the jokes were cheesy (humans being made into Duracell batteries for one), which produces several points of anti-climax, it's not bad enough to make you not like it. The kung-fu was one thing that really kicked ass. First time I must say where kung-fu is used well. Also incredibly imaginative at times in terms of the special effects (I mean, I've never seen anything like this!). The fast dodging of bullets etc etc. Though I must say the sound tended to be too loud at times for my pleasure.
I love the scene where Trinity finished off the Agent .. I mean, yeah, girls, this is one woman to look up to! However, I must say the movie didn't explain how the hell the little system which the aliens destroyed recovered and how Neo managed to get back to the Matrix after that destruction and what happened to Morpheus. I hope this is not a ploy to do a sequel.At the end of the movie, let's just say, I felt as though I was in The Matrix. Let's face it, reality sucks without split-split-second kung-fu...",The Matrix

What are the qualities of The Matrix ?The subject itself is interesting and the directors managed to make the story both complex and captivating. I think that this film really shows what science fiction can be at its best.And of course, the film is highly spectacular. The action sequences are very well-made, and there is an excellent use of the special effects, as they really serve the script, making us enter an incredible but finally believable world.In brief, thanks to the Wachowski Brothers for this clever action flick. I would give the film between 8 and 9 out of 10.",The Matrix
1717,marcalan-2,Stop the insanity-This is not a good movie! Where did the script go?,2,9 January 2001,"I really can't understand all of the accolades that this film continues to receive.  Has the entire world gone insane and forgotten that what makes a good movie is its script.  Has everything become about special effects, special effects and more special effects?   Sure, if you want special effects, this is definitely the movie for you.  If I was writing this entry for the Special Effects Message Board, I would have given it a 10/10 rating. But frankly, I need more than great visuals to have a movie work for me and as this film has nothing else, it gets a 1 rating.I know my rating won't dissuade the masses from singing the praises of this movie.  I know that my rating won't stop the inevitable outcome of Matrix II becoming the highest grossing film of all time during its opening weekend. Perhaps the only thing this review will do is lead like minded people in the direction of other movies that deal with similar themes yet actually have characters that you will care about.Let me make clear, that the core concept of Matrix is a great one.  The whole idea of our world being part of someone else's imagination is something that has fascinated me for as long as I can remember.  When Matrix originally debuted, you couldn't have paid me to stay away from the theater. Someone had finally put one of the great philosophic debates into movie form and I knew that it had to be incredible.   Instead, the only thing incredible about the film (beside the special effects) was how wrong I had been.There on the screen was a movie without any real screenplay.  No matter how much I tried, I couldn't bring myself to care about these characters because they just weren't real.   You would think that in a film dealing with reality-as-you-know-it crumbling around the main characters, that there would be some exploration into how the newly revealed reality affected their psyches.   But that doesn't happen here.  Instead, we are given a movie where the emphasis is placed upon stocking up on as many guns and other weapons as possible so that the bad guys can be shot and killed.   Give me a break!!!I think what has happened in these type of movies is that the producers are handed a great idea and then spend their entire budget on the actors and special effects.  They don't bother to spend anything on the screenplay because they have realized that good ones aren't necessary anymore.  Just give the public some nice CGI and they'll flock to the theatre. Unfortunately, they seem to be right.   Movies like Matrix and and the Jurassic Park series continue to sell out even though the stories are horrible.  Give us a cool CGI Dinosaur running around a city or make the lead characters do CGI kung-fu moves and we'll go home happy.   Never mind that we have absolutely no insight into who the main characters are.  We don't need to care about them as long as they are involved in computerized situations!   (Did anyone actually give a damn whether Jeff Goldblum's character lived or died in Lost World?)Anyway - my point is that you can certainly make a film exploring ideas and concepts similar to those in these mega movies and still have the audience care about the characters.In the case of Matrix, for those interested in a good ""reality-as-you-know-it"" type of movie, I would suggest Josef Rusnak's 'Thirteenth Floor' or even better yet, if you can handle sub-titles, Alejandro Amenabar's ""Open Your Eyes"".   Both of these movies manage to give you an incredible story, with characters you will remember long after the credits have rolled.  Believe it or not, you'll actually find yourself wondering about the characters' futures rather than simply commenting on how cool that CGI generated flip-in-the-air was.Good movies are supposed to leave you with questions. They are supposed to make you think.  You didn't really have to do that with Matrix, and its a shame because the movie could and should have been so much more than it ended up being.In my opinion, Matrix was a waste of both time and money.  I will just keep praying that one day the movie going public will give up on these special effects monsters and turn back to the days of enjoying movies with plots. On that day, films like ""Open Your Eyes"" will finally get their due and Hollywood will stop giving us mere eye candy like Matrix and similar ilk.",The Matrix
1718,gregg-18,ok,4,8 May 1999,Interesting idea and excellent special effects.  But I found the movie somewhat confusing and too long.

1719,PaxNox,Noir-punk at its finest!,7,5 April 1999,"If John Woo and James Cameron (pre-Titanic) conspired to make a film, it would likely look like this!  Noir-punk at it's finest!  The martial arts and gunfights are strictly Hong Kong visual poetry.  The special effects and action stars are in-your-face Hollywood.It is an interesting mix that has failed before because of the diluting effect each genre has on the other.  (The Replacement Killers, Hard Target, and The Corruptor come to mind.)  But The Matrix has the good sense to keep the genres in their own sphere of expertise.  When it's a martial arts scene, the action is pure Sonny Chiba or Sammo Hung.  When the special effects occur the audience gets served a helping of eye-popping big-budget CGI.The Matrix is sure to become a sci-fi favorite like Terminator 2, Predator, or Blade Runner.",The Matrix
1720,Steve Liu,"Stunning effects, technically brilliant.",8,24 November 1999,"The Matrix is an incredible package. It will forever be remembered for its pioneering effects, which are simply breathtaking. The first expanded use of ""bullet time"" creates visually stunning scenes where time and motion seem to compromise reality. The action and fight sequences are reminiscent of Chinese action films, using many of the same wiring techniques.The story, while somewhat far-fetched, is quite original and enthralling. Everything we know is not true, everything we see is not real - a very interesting concept. Watching Neo mature into the ""savior"" is very gripping. It lacks some aspects of character development and the relationship between Neo and Trinity is not well defined and somewhat abrupt. While not a ""Casablanca"" story, it must be lauded for its originality and the Wachowski brothers did a wonderful job with the story. They also hit the jackpot.No matter what happens, this film will be remembered for its effects, for they are brilliant. The fashion and wardrobe is also very unique and fitting, particularly the sunglasses. Hugo Weaving as the villianous Agent Smith is one of the best characters in the film and the groundwork is laid down for what will prove to be an intriguing trilogy. I give the film an 8 out of 10, based on dazzling camerawork and computer effects.",The Matrix
1721,ZEKE-18,The Future is Retro,8,17 May 1999,"The amazement on everyone's face... the future retro world, if it exists, set into play by the fuzzy logic of the king computer.  It's all hard to swallow for some, but I enjoyed the ride thru this amazing landscape.  It was a surreal experience to be sure, but the technical expansion of special effects into this landscape of ""unreality"" makes it believable.  The concept isn't that far off the mark from any time travel adventure or fairy tale. Sit back and enjoy this film for it's fresh look at the good guys vs. the bad and reel-in the sonic and visual stimulation of the many effects sequences.  It's going to have precedence in the many copy-cat films to follow, using these highly original techniques for presentation of landscape, the fights and flights of our heroines.  See this film soon and pay attention to the faces... as you leave the theater!",The Matrix
1722,Cheetah-8,A good film that works on many levels,10,21 June 1999,"After having seen this film for the second time around, I think that although perhaps not as forceful, it was worth seeing again. As some other reviewers have mentioned, the ""reality"" idea that the film is based on is not particularly new. However, I feel that this film should be given credit as - for what is at face value just another Hollywood action movie - it has brought many interesting ideas to a new audience. The film starts off very nicely - it doesn't assume the audience is completely stupid and the full backdrop to the story is only revealed after you have already been hooked and reeled in by the intriguing events. Although the films justification for the central premise is somewhat tenuous to say the least. There are also a few cheesier moments in some of the action sequences which I think would have been better left out as at some points you are uncertain as to whether or not you should be laughing at them. Apart from these admittedly minor grievances, I think the film is extremely well directed. The camerawork is excellent and the chases and gunfights are the best I have seen for a long time. The acting from Keanu Reeves is competent, but not outstanding. What makes this film so good is that the filler scenes are also extremely good - Hugo Weaving is brilliant as the intimidating agent, and Laurence Fishburne puts in a good effort as Morpheus. The script is good although a little cliched at times, but then that's par for the Hollywood course. The film is in a similar vein to Twelve Monkeys, only with a more Blade Runnery feel, and although I think that both of these films are ahead of The Matrix, anyone thinking of seeing an action or scifi film should definitely watch it - there hasn't been anything this good on in ages. It definitely beats Existenz into a smoking pulp.",The Matrix
1723,Surlyboi,"If you don't like it, you probably didn't get it.",9,9 April 1999,"I expected The Matrix to suck.I had seen the commercial during the Super Bowl, and the first thought that crossed my mind was, ""Oh god, another Keanu/poseur-cyberpunk flick. I've never been so glad to be wrong. This film was amazing.The majority of the people I have seen that disliked this film, seem not to have gotten the point of it. The Matrix bids you take a long, hard look at our perceptions of reality and the absurdities therein. If you're willing to follow it, and take that leap, then this film opens up to you. If you don't, then you'll just look at it as another example of where ""Hollywood went wrong""Most sci/fi fare of late has been like an id software game, about three minutes of story to support two hours of action and special effects, and technological wonders. Not so here. The effects do what they should do, enhance the story. The slow time and bullet tracing effects have their places and a reason to be there. The action and effects are there because they further the story, not because they ARE the story. The backstory and the world the Wachowski brothers have created here are deep enough for a million other stories with or without the principals in this one. (As evidenced by the website, if you haven't already, check it out and read the Gaiman story.)The acting is generally good, yes Keanu is blank and sort of dazed through most of it, but hell, if I could manage blank and dazed after experiencing what his character experienced, I'd be doing pretty damn good in my book. This script and the character play to his strengths. Fishburne's turn as Morpheus, the ""reality pusher"" is great.Yes, the dialogue can be corny at points, so what? I have yet to find a person in real life who could snap off a witty line in any situation without one falling flat every now and then. And when was the last time a throwaway line made you scratch your head and say, ""Damn, I always wondered why everything tastes like chicken.""All-in-all this film has a whole lot going for it, its strengths far outweigh its weaknesses, anyone who didn't like it probably didn't want to like it.

1725,ABCgirl,impeccable and satisfyingly complex!,9,11 April 1999,"I went into this movie expecting ""good,"" and I was pleasantly surprised to find that it was excellent!  Invigorating scenes left me breathless with the sleek set and costume design, flawless choreography, and deliciously bad-a** feel to the whole film.The story itself is wonderfully complex and there are very few loose ends in the background and plot, which are usually a big problem in sci-fi/action movies.  The philosophy behind the story is well-expressed by Morpheus and Trinity, and indeed fits nicely with the big picture.  In fact, there are several parallels between the story and religious faith, but that is a whole other can of worms.Keanu Reeves is a stroke of casting genius as the rumpled, fly-by-the-seat-of his-pants Neo, whose true purpose, identity, and talents are yet undiscovered until he is tapped by the Resistance.  He has only recently begun to earn some of my respect with an excellent performance in Devil's Advocate, and now the Matrix.  However, I am still rather scarred from his ""Dracula"" farce.  Carrie-Anne Moss does quite well in this role; a nice change from her ""Models, Inc"" days, and a terrific showcase of her chiseled features.  Laurence Fishburne is perfect as the omniscient, eloquent and always-composed leader, Morpheus.Several instances of subtle comic relief were appreciated--the activated sprinklers that drenched the agents as well as Keanu's Bruce Lee tribute in his fight with eerily articulate, 10-words-per-minute agent.Storyboards were put to good use, and the action was easy to follow throughout the movie, even with all the trans-dimensional activity going on. Lighting in every shot was exceptional, conveying a sterile feel about the whole environment. Sound design was also exceptional; it put the audience amid all the action on camera.  The soundtrack fits perfectly with the film--the silver bow on a beautiful package.Highly recommended, but not for the faint of heart. A terrific show with an intriguing and insightful plot.

Fear?  Greed? (Which is the guiding principle of the 21st millennium).  If there boundless and infinite possibility upon the destruction of logical sequence, will metaphysic becomes the faith?  I can just jump into the conclusion.  What is evil and what is good?Scientists are debating the projection that Sun will not be the major energy source today, and the emergence of hot spots in the oceans redefine the thinking of the only source of life.  But this movie is based on the premise that the ultimate energy source will be the human itself as it generates energy and being harvested in energy farm.  This premise is illogical, even if we multiply the human during the time of the movie (say 2199, say population at 20B) then each human being is to produce at least a thousand BTU equivalents to replace the Sun.   We need the episode2,  e=Mx2 to give us the replacement for formula e=mc2 to explain the unexplainable of Mx1, let say Neo is now equal God and he is  The second coming prophesied by lot of pseudo-religions.

The concept of altered realty/art. intelligence was thought provoking, but the movie was ""ruined"" by the silly, overdone characters and bland script. What is up with the goofy sunglassess? Why can't these humans, who supposedly have incredible technology and intelligence, at least illuminate/properly light their environment? Why is everything so dank and gloomy?

On the other hand, if you are interested in an good all around film, keep looking. This film wishes it was half as good as the extremely underrated Dark City. This film wishes it were deep, hence all of the not too subtle reference to Alice in Wonderland. This film wishes it had clever writers who did not come off as stealing every mediocre idea from much better sci-fi flicks. Finally, (and most of all) this film wishes that Keanu Reeves could act his way out of a paper bag.

The Matrix shamelessly steal its story line (and not too well) from Dark City (a much better movie that makes sense). The costume designer has no doubt seen Men In Black. The central man v. machine story was also done better by Stanley Kubrick in 2001: Space Odyssey. I have to admit that I liked the movie though, but only for the special effects.

1734,Super_C,"A really outstanding movie with an extremely original, twisting plot. I give it a 9/10.",10,11 October 1999,"My opinion: I absolutely love it.My reasoning: Outstanding plot - This brilliant plot keeps your eyes and mind glued to the movie for the entire 2+ hours.  It's a really great (if not mind-bending) feeling when your brain puts two and two together and you discover what the matrix really is (a short time before the actual explanation).Outstanding visual/special effects - Filming styles never-before-seen in a movie, seamless CG constituents, and outstanding ""classical"" special effects add a tremendous amount of eye-candy to an already great movie.Good music/sound effects - The music's very well-done (not quite ""great"" but close).  The sound effects are great and, at times, quite innovative (the metallic distortion of Neo's screams, for instance).Overall, it's a really outstanding movie with an extremely original, twisting plot that really keeps you guessing and continues to make you think long after the movie is over.  It's a bit on the cerebral side so people who just like pure action and no thought may not be completely impressed (more than likely, you'll at least like it, however).  It will definitely appeal to geeks (like myself).  There may be a few slightly, over-dramatic shots, not bad - but made me chuckle a couple of times (usually facial expressions by Keanu).  Believe it or not, Keanu Reeves actually does a decent job (could've been better, but definitely the best he's ever done).  I saw it multiple times in the theater (very rare) and also bought the DVD (a very good disc with a lot of features - BTW).  I give it a very enthusiastic 9/10.",The Matrix

Have you seen _The Big Hit_?  The action is similar: there's nothing like breakdancing assassins.The truth is, however, that for as interesting as the plot was, they left little to the imagination, and in fact, it seemed way too mainstreamed and given in too many nice, chewable bite-sized snippets for the recreational viewer.  For a hot concept like the world as a matrix, the fact that this came as such a mainstream attempt may further prove the existence of the story in our world.How about the campy, uninspired romance that we would have been better served without?  How about insufficient fancy slow-mo FX?  How about more, more, more in-the-matrix interactions?With all of this said, it was a riveting and compelling big-balls action flick, and the best I've seen in the genre, but its failings show through where the whole genre falls through: ditch action-flick conventions for better swagger and ego.

This movie may well supplant Austin Powers as my all-time favorite.",The Matrix
1738,holigor,disappointing,6,30 November 1999,"I wanted to see this movie for a long time. Ads that claimed it to be a movie of 21th century. Now, I've seen it at last and it did not live to the expectations. The movie is made to show visual effects but all they had to show was in the ads already, so nothing new. Plot is absent, idea is ridiculous (feed humans to use the body as the batteries, less efficient energy production cannot be thought of). OK, it can be seen once but it does not deserve a place in the top 250. Comparison with The Phantom Menace is natural here. And not in favor of The Matrix.",The Matrix

Keanu Reeves is adequate, it still remains to be seen whether the boy can actually act.HOWEVER, there must be more clever ways of achieving your objective than dressing in lots of black and blasting away at your enemy with a huge arsenal of guns, a la Terminator, or kicking his face in a la Jackie Chan, even if your enemy is created by the most powerful mainframe on earth. Perhaps on-line chess?  OK OK, but you know what I mean.Why is the future always portrayed as being so bleak? Even a computer-generated future seems to be colourless and void of all beauty. If The Matrix was a better place for us holographic human batteries to live in, maybe there would be no dissidents for the computer to worry about, so it can't be that clever.Then again, what do I know?

1741,ben-181,We are all in the Matrix,8,29 July 1999,"I have read in magazines that this has taken the mantle from Blade Runner as the best sci-fi flick ever. I think Matrix is good (best film in 99) but I don't think it is better than Blade Runner for a couple of reasons.
1. The story in the matrix was in the end pretty much find special kid, train him up, he wins the day. 2. The sets and the acting on Blade Runner were far superior3. The bad guys in the matrix were not particularly scary and to be honest their were pretty boring 4. Blade Runner had more levels to the plot and the characters than Matrix which was just an action flickBut this is not to say I didn't like the movie I thought it was great, although I didn't understand what happened at the end. They use music in the film excellently the acting is pretty good and the fighting and action scenes are some of the best put to film. The slow camera feature is used to good effect in the film and because this film was a hit expect to see a lot more of it.",The Matrix
1742,Ronny-11,This film is PERFECT ! ! !,10,21 July 1999,"This one got everything: an awesome cast, good director's to handle the film and a plot that really makes you wonder of what's going on in the film (and in this world;-)). When I first saw the trailer, I thought ""Oh, once again one of these popcorn-boom-boom-actioneers"". I was wrong. All pictures from the trailer appeared within the last 20-30 mins; the ""rest"" of the movie was pretty quite instead. And that is exactly what this movie makes so good: It is not the typical ""Hero-saves-world""-stuff; it is the story, the plot that catches you and takes you deeper and deeper into this topic that our reality might be a perfect illusion. When I attended school we had the issue of ""What is considered to be real"" in our philosophy-lessons and it really sucked. This movie offers a way to follow the ideas it shows.So on the one hand you have a disturbing and scaring plot and on the other hand you have techniques of making films that offer you a view into the next millenium. I have never seen so beautiful pictures, none have I seen so cool special fx (Bullet Time) or such a perfect green-screen keying.

The effects are not overdone but are executed in a manner that accentuates the mood in an extremely appropriate way.Plot has a couple of good twists and some of the actors' performances are appropriate for the genre (I wouldn't say Oscar material though).Not perfect for me but, oh, so close with 9/10",The Matrix

I made the mental mistake of going into the Matrix with very high expectations after having heard so many rave reviews about the movie from my peers.Pleasantly enough, my expectations were met ten fold.  I'm glad that there is finally a movie since the original star wars series (note: I say original), that fantasy and sci-fi fans can point to with pride.  The movie makes you think in a way that I believe I can safely say that you have never thought before.  As you step out of the theater, or press 'Stop' on your remote control, you'll question the reality that you live in.Maybe.  I did at least. =)  For the arguments against this movie.

It has spectacular stunts, stunning visuals, a wild yet intelligent storyline and a little bit of the unbelievable. Give credit to all the people in the special effects department for coming up with unusual, unique, and hair raising stunts and scenes that will excite the senses. Also kudos to Keanu Reeves for a very believable performance as Neo. As usual Laurence Fishbourne is outstanding and Carrie Anne Moss is very sexy. For people who like to challenge their minds and don't have faith in the current state of the world. Watch the Matrix and let your mind go.",The Matrix
1748,wolf_beautell,This is what sci-fi is all about.,10,26 October 2001,"On May 1999, I read on a Spanish specialized magazine some info about a sci-fi that was cracking the US box-office. It was the second film of the Wachowski Bros., unknown at that time, and Keanu Reeves starred. It included some amazing photos, but it reminded me of another Reeves' movie, ""Johnny Mnemonic"": a sci-fi with a good premise and presentation, but irregular and not very hooking...That film, however, had the abstract and yet attractive name of ""The Matrix"". And it had to have something special to smash the box-office so heavily.July came, and I discovered that you mustn't make any judgments or comments about something you know very little or nothing about. Because after watching this movie, I just couldn't believe what I had just seen.After having watched the film almost 15 times, I can list all the excellent aspects of ""The Matrix"", but the plot and the Visual FX (Oscar) obviously outstand. And it is after watching the Wachowski's first movie, ""Bound"", that you can explain many things.These brothers really have a lot of talent. They have kept the style of their debut in ""The Matrix"", but, what's best, it is a style that's easily distinguishable. A sophisticated directing, in which cinematography is their best support. The film is actually decolored, and that matches perfectly with the film's spirit. But also their conception of thrilling stories with a touch of film-noir, that make the viewer think and wonder about the plot or message. I came out of this film with a certain paranoia, asking myself if this apparent reality is not what we think it is.And I OBVIOUSLY know it is only fantasy, but that's one of the successes of the film: transport the viewer, and activating his brain to think for once in his life about what a film can tell us, developing in some way our imagination and getting him away from this world for at least a few minutes.That's what's sci-fi all's about: making us think in what we know it is not real... or it's still not real. And this film can conceive hundreds of ideas and thoughts in our heads, which would be impossible to list. At least mine's...The script as I said is original and polished, and containing its correct doses of action sequences and, what's best, a great majestic ending as I hadn't seen in many years. I'm not telling nothing about the plot because I hate spoilers (I don't want to be one), but trust me if I say it's amazing and incredible. The film keeps an excellent rhythm thanks to the Oscarized editing. There's an excellent, superb example of editing that maybe most of you haven't really recognized: the bomb arming sequence. That's editing made art. And you can see there is a good production design for the whole lot.The directors make their part then, and also the actors do. Because unlike many other supposed great production films, such as ""Lost In Space"", in which actors are secondary, here they don't get absorbed and wiped out by the Visual FX department. Keanu Reeves may be considered by many people as a cold actor, but that's just because he doesn't fit in many comic or romantic roles he's played since ""Speed"": he's a natural born action actor. And in ""The Matrix"" he does quite a very good job indeed as Neo. But the best is Laurence Fishburne, giving Morpheus all throughout the film the mystery, patience and wisdom that surrounds the role since the start, when he's just known as a myth. Other characters are OK, but I want to remark Joe Pantoliano's job (haha, been naughty as usual!).About FX... I am a great ""Star Wars"" fan, and ""The Phantom Menace"" and ""The Matrix"" were nominated both for 1999's best FX. However, I wanted the second one to win (another Oscar), because of their innovation and originality. Fantastic. How could someone ever imagine a man dodging bullets? Wow... The greatest thing about them is what I said before: they don't overtake the whole film, they INTEGRATE in the story, they are necessary for the plot to progress and transmit the story. The action sequences (the kung-fu training, the Hall cross-fire, the heli blast...) are superbly sequenced and and are massive. Please don't watch the film on full screen: get the Widescreen version or don't watch it. Simple and clear.In the musical aspects, there is a correct balance between Don Davis' score (a pity it's too short) and the songs, some of the best metal, hardcore anthems of the last years, which are present because they fit with the film's spirit (they all belong to a determined genre), rather than as a mere compilation of big hits, the typical soundtrack  ""structure"" these days... Sound and FX were carefully worked out, and watching (or better say listening to) it on theaters was a real pleasure...No better end for this comment than the label many have given to the film: the perfect End Of Millenium movie, as it reflects many of the fashions of the 1990's (comic book homage and manga, Hong Kong cinema influences, cyberpunk and computer technology... ) as well as that apocalyptical sensation society experienced at the gates of 2000 (don't forget the many biblical references in the film). ""The Matrix"" apart from satifying and impress, will leave you with a quite sweet taste with the powerful epilogue gloriously accompanied by Rage Against The Machine's ""Wake Up"". Don't you dare missing it.Thanks to the Wachowskis for reviving a genre that was almost devalued in the 1990's.No doubt my vote's a 10 ;)",The Matrix
1749,acsjacks,"Twisted, Spiritual...Or simply, it rocks!",10,24 November 1999,"This is one heck of a movie. Sure, Keanu Reeves has little if no acting skills, and quite a few parts of the movie run slowly...This movie is still a landmark to movie making skills by the brotherly directors. Packed with philosophy, action, mystery,and break through special effects this movie can not hold itself back. The sequels should be really interesting, and I think it would be great if the movie would explain more about the theory of the matrix more (but keep up the action, boys!). Overall, you are in for a fun treat packed with all of the above. Oh and a little note to whoever will cast the sequels: The new female action star of the matrix...who else but Buffy!

1751,paul_bender,Amusement Park Ride,4,1 March 2000,"Like a roller coaster, ""The Matrix"" is a visceral thrill ride.  Also like a roller coaster, once the ride is over, you don't take anything home with you and there isn't much of substance that needs to be said.I really enjoyed this ride.  I think it is among the best of its genre.  But calling it ""one of the greatest...etc, etc""--that's a leap I'm not willing to make.  The acting styles and dialogue are campy, and I the plot certainly can not be supported by any rational argument; rather it is something that, like religion, requires a leap of faith to buy into. Examples:1.  Everyone, including the ""agents"" evidently, can be killed by a single bullet.  If this is not true, then why (other than the visceral thrill of it) all the gymnastics to avoid them?  If it is true, then it is absurd to think that their bodies could withstand even a fraction of the pummeling they receive at each other's hands.  Everyone gets punched, kicked, hurled, and driven into (occasionally through) plaster walls, only to emerge unscathed but ready to dodge that next damn bullet. 2.  <<SPOILER FOLLOWS!>>  The energy delivered by the captive human embryos to support The Matrix must, of course, be less than the energy required to support them, making their use illogical.  (Reference: The Law of the Conservation of Energy.) 3.  The function of The Kiss at the end is really getting into the shaky ground of Dramatic License.  I know that the film is chock full of Jesus symbolism, so it is required that <<SPOILER FOLLOWS!>> Neo dies and then comes back to life.  But, as in the case of Jesus, it does require a major leap of faith to embrace the idea--and drama is not religion. Personally, I get the impression that the writers just wrote themselves into a dramatic wall, and required an unmotivated miracle--literally--to get out of it. In the context of the action/thriller film genre, I think the examples I've quoted above are really trivial.  But when an attempt is made to glorify The Matrix as a film masterpiece, that changes the yardstick entirely.Really, I liked The Matrix quite a lot.  As an action/thriller film, I think it is about as good as they get.  But it is an amusement park ride and little more.  When the ride is over, you either get off, or get back on for another go; but you certainly don't claim to have had a spiritual experience in the process.",The Matrix

There was a story, but a small one.  Not enough for me to see.But still, I recommend this film to teenagers and adults.  Kids too, but yet there's quite a bit of violance (not much gore).

I never saw anything like it.Yes, it did have a ton of special effects, but the whole movie did not rely on them. No one could have directed this movie better thatn The Wachowski Brothers. It was a little confusing at times, but at the end it pays. Thank you, The Wachowski Brothers, for directing and writing this great movie.This is a must see. It's not only the special F/X guys.

1755,Jonny T,The best film ever made!,10,7 January 2000,"I used to think that there would never be a film that would leave me so completely overwhelmed and astonished on so many levels as a good novel could.  No other movie can compare to such books as Sphere and The Hobbit. However when I saw the Matrix this belief was instantly quashed.  It is amazing in so many ways that my comments could not possibly do justice to it.  I guess I'll start with the obvious.  The special effects.  These are the most apparent on the first look.  All I can say to describe them is: ""WOW!""  The effects range from realistic explosions to surrealistic, futuristic slow motion types of effects that create a feeling of excruciating suspense while also pumping out fast paced action!  And what action.  The actions scenes aren't those dull car chases and pointless shootouts that turn me of 99% of action movies.  The action in this movies has never been seen before.  Sure there is a ""gunfight"" but it isn't like any gunfight EVER done before.  I'm not a big action fan because I find action movies repetitive.  But the Matrix is anything but.  Whether your John Q. Action or a despiser of action movies you'll probably be on the edge of your seat.  The next place that this film scores is in the philosophical and dramatic areas.  Many action movies are devoid of such sensibilities but the Matrix scores a direct hit.  It is amazing to me how a movie can incorporate such intellligent themes into an action environment without dragging on.  The Matrix is NEVER boring, even if your looking for a pure action movie, and yet it encorporates so much higher thought that the actions seems to be only secondary.  Finally: the biblical alusion.  Well, when this was first suggested to me I thought it was just some crazy freaks looking for biblical allusion and finding it because they wanted to.  Boy was I wrong.  The Matrix has biblical allusion out the wazoo!  You can believe me because I'm a registered skeptic, and if I think there is biblical allusion, there is biblical allusion.  I'll let you all figure it out for yourselves, but for all you Christians out there, the many references to the bible make this phenominal movie even better.  In all this film is so unbelievably good that I had to put it at the top of my list as the best movie ever made.  If you like action, drama, sci-fi(by the way this movie IS NOT science fiction, at least not in the traditional sense), or movies that make you think the Matrix is for you.  It is a very intelligent, thought provoking action movie with many Christian overtones.  You should absolutely, without-a-doubt see this movie.  You will not regret it!",The Matrix

My only complaint is that Laurence Fishburne's character spent a great deal of time explaining exactly what the Matrix is.  I feel that these explanations got a little bit dry after a while.  Still, the concept of the Matrix is so different from reality that I suppose some explanations were necessary.  Overall, a good film.  8/10.",The Matrix

The real contents seem to be: impressing the viewer be revealing new facts about the amazing Matrix-world. But after having caught in which way the Matrix works it is just boring seeing Laurence Fishburne explaining and explaining what has already been explained. His never ending monologues nearly ruin the whole movie. It is not that interesting hearing ´´it is like this´´ and ´´it works like that´´ for half an hour.

I like that they didn't bother with character development at all because that would have wasted time. Some of my friends liked the philosophical side to this movie. I didn't really care for that though. They kind of threw together some eastern philosophy with a whole lot of Christian imagery and wallah! I don't know though - it seems like that may have been just a device to make the movie seem like more than it is... But how could they make this movie any more rad than it already is?

1763,nettojoh,Entertaining replay of old sci-fi themes,6,17 August 2000,"This movie was entertaining, but I must say I'm baffled by all the hype and enthusiasm.  The movie rolled along with lots of action and violence so you weren't bored.  I've seen comments on this being a thinking man's movie, it's not even a thinking producer's movie.  There are basically two ""ideas"" in the movie (I won't spoil, because they are the movie).  Both of these ideas are simply grabbed from other science fiction writing without any sort of original twist, except for combining them.  When you first learn about these two main ideas it's surprising only because they come from nowhere, you're not really expecting them, but you are trying to figure out a few things.  Up to this point in the movie it's pretty neat, but lacks any subtlety, they just throw it at you.  After they introduce the two main themes just sit back and watch the action, nothing else intriguing happens.As I said before, the movie keeps moving so you don't get bored. But after a while the gaps in logic and inconsistencies get a little overwhelming. Part of fantasy stories is the creation of a universe where certain rules apply that may be different than what we are used to, whether it's in space or software.   This movie makes no attempt at explaining anything, and with the stuff they throw at you, they need to explain it (for the thinking man at least).  Science fiction doesn't need to be believable, per se (it is fiction), but it should be believable within the boundaries set for that story.  It's seems like they wrote the plot as a first try and didn't bother with details.  For example, what's up with the phone thing why not just click you're heels together three times.  ""The body can't live without the brain"" doesn't mean you can just sort of makeup arbitrary rules throughout the story.Another thing I can't figure out is why in this universe they have to walk around with stone faces all the time.  Perhaps that was just too make sure Keanu Reeves didn't stand out as a bad actor.  It worked, this was the least annoying role I've seen him in.  A movie without any dialogue is a perfect fit for Keanu.Despite the shallowness of the movies and the bad acting, I did enjoy watching it, but not as a thinking man.  If you just let the movie unfold in front of you it has enough action and graphics to be entertaining.It does sadden me how such a one dimensional movie can overwhelm the minds of people.  Maybe you all need to read a book once in a while to understand what real complexity is.  Just throwing out someone else's ideas with computer graphics does not make a genius, although it can be entertaining.",The Matrix

The Matrix is a ground-breaking motion picture that not only raised the bar for all the science-fiction films to come after it but also redefined the action genre with its thrilling action sequences and revolutionary visual effects.",The Matrix

1771,SkyGirl3,A bit dated and Keanu let's it down,7,7 July 2012,"The movie itself is unapologetic postmodern science fiction, which means that it rips off every sci-fi source in existence. This is because most of its target audience doesn't even know the Enterprise had a captain before Picard. This is lucky for them, because when Morpheus (Laurence Fishburne) tries to convince Neo (Reeves) that he has the ability to control his reality.This whole Matrix thing seems a lot like ""Dark City"" in both story and theme. In order to convince Neo that he's crucial in their battle to reveal the Matrix to everybody, Morpheus and Trinity (Carrie-Anne Moss) take him to an Oracle. Constant references to the Oracle reek of the constant references to The Force in ""Star Wars,"" which means that after about five minutes you hope the next person to mention the Oracle is accidentally decapitated.There's also a ton of John Woo gun fights and Jackie Chan martial arts-type stuff, except that Reeves looks so stiff in the fight scenes you wonder if his next gig might be Tomb Raider IV.Not great but for its time this film was good.",The Matrix

This film certainly is not among the top 100 films of the 1990s, let alone should be ranked 40th as it is at IMDB.com.The script is poor as the writer and director did a poor job stealing parts from other films.Keanu Reeves performance is poor, which is to be expected as his performances usually are.Besides the special effects, Laurence Fishburne and Joe Pantoliano were bright spots in the film as they give good performances, especially considering the poor script, direction and acting from those around them.",The Matrix

It may take more time to watch it and I've watched it at least 30 times before you can understand it all because it's so complex and a well backed-up film. Aside from great storyline and philosophy The Matrix delivers unbelievable action still is in line with the story, amazing feats and new things can be performed in The Matrix because The Matrix is our world. For all of those who haven't seen the movie The Matrix is about a hacker named Neo (Reeves) is sidetracked by his normal job as a hacker, who doesn't get much sleep because all his life he has suspected something odd about the world he lives in and he has absolutely now idea what it is. The only thing he knows though is that he wants to find an answer. Finally, he meets a man named Morpheous (Fishburne) who shows him how and what Neo has always suspected which is the world is flawed. An amazing story showing that earth or the world everyone lives in has been manipulated by machines and the real time zone we all live in is in about the century 2199 A.D. Neo has a hard time adjusting to this new thing he has discovered after being unplugged by the neural interactive simulation (Earth or The Matrix) and discovering all the world is, is everyone communicating with each other is a fake world. After, Morpheous teaches Neo that in the world he has been living in, he can do almost anything that he was taught wasn't possible in the world he used to live in. Providing amazing action and special effects that are absolutely incredible! Cinematography, shows he these amazing stunts are pulled off at the end of the movie, anyway I could go on forever, but you have to see The Matrix.",The Matrix

Its wrongness would be able to be passed if perhaps Jean's point on 'the real' was a bit weary but there is no need to 'read between the lines' to find his point, there is not distinction between the real and the imaginary which the movie lacks (blue pill v red pill scene). Seems more focused on small concepts of the book like man becoming machine rather than laying out the foundations for these smaller concepts.

1783,dingusrev,so damn overrated,6,17 November 2001,"ladies and gentlefolk let me give you the biggest pile of overrated nonsense in the history of film.  Let me start with the plot:- great, superb, GENIUS....shame about the execution.  Some great GREAT ideas, but when you get the tree-bark esque acting skills of keanu reeves to carry them off, you just know, somewhere inside of you that this film will be somewhat..IFFY.Ok now onto the acting.......ok so we're done! (im sorry but who the hell pays keanu reeves $20m dollars to act....please keanu, if you are reading.....lend me a tenner mate!!).Ok so the effects.......oh my.......the effects are stunning, simply gorgeous, rippling bullet effects, that wee spinning camera job.....FANTASTIC, i suppose you wont feel cheated spending money on seeing this title as the effects are worth admission price alone.now, this does NOT deserve to be in the top 50 greatest films of all time, oh no!, how it gets above such underrated classics such as AMERICAN PSYCHO and HEAT is beyond me.so in short, THE MATRIX isnt a BAD movie, its just so highly overrated.  I think for me, the feeling I got after watching the matrix, was the same feeling when i spent $1 dollar on a lotto scratchcard and won $1! that little feeling 'oh!! ive won!!...oh wait...'THE MATRIX - 6/10 (ok so i rated it five!!....shoot me!)",The Matrix

I personally like Trinity and Morpheus over Leo. Trinity gives me a feeling of longing to be close to her, and Morpheus project a big brother/master figure. 5) The theme about faith really comes across to audience. Your faith can eventually determine your destiny, Amazing. 6) Last and the utmost factor, LOVE. It makes me keeps on pondering it.This film deserves to be one of my collection.

1786,eduardozg,Or when special effects DO have a reason,9,26 January 2002,"Matrix may not be a critic's classic, but surely it does differentiates it clearly from the typical action movie. If you think otherwise, I'd like to challenge you to watch more closely.Two things I'd highlight in Matrix: 1) it's script, which is one of the few in movies to get the myth of the machine takeover and the possibilities of 'cyberworld' close to a real and clear plot (being a systems engineer, I can tell very few movies ever got near), 2) it is visually fantastic, and not because of the now widely copied slow-motion kicks, but because it aids in explaining the story and telling a lot of the double world you are experiencing. Just like the 'half floor' in Being John Malkovich helps the viewer accept the idea of the strange world the movie depicts, the high contrast - highly iluminated scenery when entering the matrix reminds of a 3d simulation; the excess of gunfiring could easily be taken out of DOOM games, and the slow-motion, multiple angle camera in action scenes reminds that, at last this matrix is a virtual world, where one can really control the evolution of the game.In summary, I'd say it is very worth watching over and over and discovering new things about it. As someone said here, after watching it, one cannot help but think how much better all those expensive-budget Hollywood action movies could have been.",The Matrix

That's why I think The Matrix is not a philosophical piece of cinema but rather an allegorical one. Also, What Morpheus did was not a religious act, even if he hadn't known it yet. Yes, there is a fate that is to be destroyed. But that fate comes from AI. When you are no longer born but rather genetically engineered and grown by elaborate machines, and you live your entire life in a simulation whose rules are built by the needs of AI, this is no longer a fate that we used to phrase in everyday life; this is a fate that is built and controlled by the physical authority. That's why a program called the oracle has the calculation power to predict the future of Matrix and the individuals connected to it. The connection between humans and AI fortunately brings a hopeful way out for the humans namely an anomaly or Neo. Somehow a human called Neo has the power to control The Matrix. I interpret this as an error caused during the growing process or the lifetime spent in Matrix which resulted from a special code that is written to his DNA or in the other case to his mind.For me, entire film is about accepting the possibility of lack of free will and the relentless war to restore it.After all;What is the Matrix?Control.",The Matrix

I don't think Keanu reeves I a real good actor but in this movie the did it very well. He really put his character neo good on screen and with the combination of Morpheus and Trinity in the scenes the had a good overall effect in the movie.

1792,laratringem,perfect,10,4 June 2002,"I have seen this movie dozens of times (you must have the DVD) and each time I come away entranced and wanting to be Keanu Reeve's girlfriend. (I know kung-fu too, ha) Anyways... Carrie-Anne Moss is gorgeous and Trinity is very strong, yet feminine character- she plays her beautifully. Morpheus played by Lawrence Fishburne provides a solid character, I think he is only character who does not undergo a change throughout the movie. At points, he seemed a bit odd, but after watching the movie several times you can decipher his strange way of expressing his thoughts and how he delivers his speeches, and see that it holds a greater meaning to the story- when he says he knows something, he really knows it. The guy who played Cypher did a great job of turning himself into a little weasel that everyone wanted to slap and spit on- you can tell he's nasty the first time he appears on screen because of the look he gives Neo. And even before that in the conversation with Trinity ""We're going to kill him...""Along the lines of ""Hollywood""- the special effects, kung-fu scenes, and dialog work together perfectly- there is no wasted energy in this film. Beautiful dialog lends to rememberable quotes from virtually every scene in the movie.I cannot say much anything bad about this film, except the concept may be a bit hard to grasp for some people the first time around- most people will have to give it another go in order to figure out what's going on in the plot. For first time viewers a bit of advice: don't ask questions when you watch the first time, you're liable to miss something important!!! Just take it all in. Also, I would have liked to see the characters of Switch and Apoc developed more before they were knocked off. Oh well.The ending of the first movie is actually perfect. According to the plot of the next movie, The Matrix: Reloaded, Neo and Morpheus have already commenced releasing people from The Matrix at the start of the movie- and The Matrix leaves us with a scene of Neo contacting the next person to be released and shows us how well he has mastered the workings of the Matrix (he flies). I cannot wait for the next installment, and as of today there are only 345 days left until May 16, 2003. My only regret is that I never saw the first one in the theater.Overall= 10 stars.

I think all movie fans know this title and they never forget it. Do you remember when you first time saw it? I remember very well this stunning visual effects which they looked like real. I was so excited watching this film. Every second of this movie is worth seeing. The story told in ""The Matrix"" is really important to this world because no one knows the future and it shows how could it be and how A.I. may be. It's a warning to humanity.

1794,nemo21i,"Matrix, The ... shivering timbers!",10,8 February 2003,"This is a movie that people either adore or disregard totally... but I haven't found (though it is statisticley possible) someone who actually hates The Matrix. This, in itself, humours me since this movie IS about hating the matrix and alot of people around me agreed that if it was up to them, they'd probably take the blue pill. WIERD, MAN!I, of course, think completely otherwise.Yet, this movie, like many others, has what seems to be an anti-technocracy attitude. I disagree with that observation too, because this film is all about how bad choices can make things go wrong, and how good ones can make them better. Not because technology is bad, but because those who weild it has ""the smell"", and I too feel, sometimes, ""saturated"" by it. it is obnoxious and it is our greatest and foremost weakness as a specie. Yet the movies shows that there is a diffrence between knowing the path and walking on it.As a determinist, I do not belive in free choice. I do agree that the illusion is mighty, and the movie depicts exactly that. What is important, after all, is to feel good about yourself and accept your fate. Don't mind the reality - stick to what you are and embrace what you consider is good and true in yourself and then, things would SEEM righter.So THAT, in my part, is the greatness of this movie over thousnds of others.

1796,indraya,film is a masterpiece,10,30 August 2002,"Words like 'classics' and 'masterpiece' might be more convenient alongside titles like 'Casablanca', yet they are not incongruous with 'The Matrix'. Sure the ideas used in the film were not new in science fiction (and philosophy). Of course, there were lots of plots about ordinary people getting familiar with troublesome job of saving the world. There were audio-visually astounding movies with inventive fights and action sequences. There were self - ironical movies. Maybe even cinematographic inventions of 'The Matrix' were not completely new. But perhaps never all the elements were fused together with such a skill to produce so impressive entity. Every detail of the film, while beautiful on its own, is integral part of the whole, occupying exact place and performing exact function. Generally, I'm offended by violence on screen. But in this film, all the brutal scenes are there for a reason, and they are delivered in aesthetical way. Dialogue might seem unrealistic, yet it is perfect as a part of the whole. It is amazing how quite sophisticated ideas are translated into simple, yet metaphorical language. People don't say 'as far as we have materialistic explanation of subjective idealism here...'. They say 'there is no spoon' instead. The acting could be better, but it is not bad. At least, Laurence Fishburne and Hugo Weaving really do act.Last of all, there are few words on effectiveness of the film in my case. When leaving the cinema after the 3rd viewing a month ago (yes, one can watch 'The Matrix' in a packed theatre 3 years after its release!) I thought that, at last, the experience was more like of having fun rather than being hypnotized ... just to find myself on the wrong trolleybus going to the wrong end of the city afterwards.

I can only think of a few who could possibly have pulled it off: First and foremost is Edward Furlong. I have to wonder whether the WB's even considered him, but in my mind he would have been a fantastic choice. He may have been a little too short, however, if you were casting Carie-Anne Moss as Trinity. The other choice, and this will seem strange until you really think about it, is perhaps Donald Sutherland though I believe him too old (at least old looking). Jake Gyllenhaal might have been able to do it, but he was not known in 99---and might have been far to young. Does anybody else have any ideas?

1804,BiLLTheBUtCHER231,Best Action Movie Ever!!!,10,12 April 2004,"****Small Spoilers****I first saw this film when it aired on TV some time ago in 2002. The plot started fairly normal (and no, I can't be bothered writing it) but then took a huge (and well placed) twist. All I can say is that there are actually two worlds involved, The Matrix, which is the computer program that is meant to blind and keep humans under control from the real world, which is earth as it is in the future, ruled by giant robot squid thingies. The first time I saw it (the crossover to the real world) I was confused and frustrated because I wasn't sure what the hell was going on. DON'T let this turn you away. If you stick with it and use your imagination, you'll enjoy the best action movie EVER made (apart from T2) What everyone who's seen this film liked the most were the combat scenes. Things like slow-motion Kung-Fu, Ju-Jit-Su, shooting and bullet dodging are all here. The classic point of this film is when Neo (Keanu Reeves) dodges all those bullets while leaning backwards. Sound familiar? Everyone knows that scene, like everyone knows Hugo Weaving's classic line, ""Goodbye Mr. Anderson"" Allover, this movie is a classic, and my favorite movie to date, combining an action, adventure, thriller and sci-fi in one. The acting is good as well, with Hugo Weaving doing a terrific and the most outstanding job as Agent Smith, Neo's arch enemy. While Reloaded and Revolutions were good, The Matrix stands out as a revolutionary and refreshing concept and the best in the trilogy.An absolute classic, 10/10. Definite purchase.",The Matrix

There is no flow in the movie. The writer of the movie seems to have got a few ideas running in his head and has managed to write the story. The direction is mediocre at best and the performance from the cast was pathetic especially the ""Morpheous"" character. Keano reaves looks aged and tiring and lacks the actual charm needed for the character.Like I said what lets down the movies is that :- a. It is unrealistic. b. Bad acting. c. Bad story. d. Mediocre direction.If you allow me to say this then the movie simply lacks a soul.The 3 stars are for the special effects which are spectacular.Oh and by the way before anyone criticizes me I truly do appreciate real sci-fi movies - Avatar and Spiderman being a few among them that have substance.This movie has no substance according to my opinion - period.

1806,jake-alfg,Top-Notch Science Fiction,10,6 August 2012,"The best reviews of this movie I've ever seen are the ones in Jim Davidson's ""Being Sovereign,"" and in the online video by Stefan Molyneux ""Free Range Humans."" The movie is clearly an allegory to the modern nation state. We are all used against our will, with most people never even comprehending this. The Federal Reserve steals all of our labor and redirects it to what Thoreau called ""the machine of government."" Only libertarians are even aware they are enslaved, and only those who have ""woken up"" are free. The comparisons are obvious, and the movie is a tribute to individualism.Just like in real life, conformists' eyes are all informant's eyes. If a conformist sees a drug deal, a firearm, or anything outside of the ordinary happening, he gets on his cell phone and reports the prohibited activity to the police (the police state). The same is true of the uncomprehending conformists in ""The Matrix,"" whose faces bubble outward and morph into the ""agents"" who defend the matrix.My vote/ranking is for the entire trilogy. They are all excellent. Don't miss Geoff Darrow's amazing design work. The Wachowskis are geniuses.",The Matrix
1807,opheliac306,Overrated....definitely not made easy to understand,2,8 September 2018,"I really don't know where to begin with this. Disappointed is a word that keeps coming to mind. After years of being told I HAVE to watch The Matrix (I know I saw it as a child when it first came out but honestly couldn't remember anything more than the green coding) I've come out of this feeling confused, frustrated, and stupid for not understanding half the movie.Some good casting choices. A handful of good performances. However the movie far longer than it needed to be, far more confusing than was necessary, and all in all has left me feeling it's wildly overrated.

I am not going to write about artistic performance here. What have we learned from Matrix?Matrix shows us the life we are living that we ought to think as civilized and well advanced being blindfolded by the modern day advancements that are eating up the roots of humanity and the purpose of living.Until Neo got a clear picture of the way the world is living and his life which he thinks is real, he too was blindfolded in same way like the rest. When once he got enlightened, then he understood the real meaning of his life.Matrix simply satires on the modern day living of mankind. It's just a wake up call for humanity before it sinks deeply in this so called modernization.",The Matrix
1810,allcarpedium,great movie. one of my favorites,10,13 May 2005,I never saw an ad for this film. I just heard from one person that it was a good movie and that I should go see it. I went into this film having no clue what it was about and I didn't know what to expect. I was completely blown away. This is one of the best movies I have ever seen.When released in 1999 it was a revolution for the movie industry because it gave birth to visionary special effects. This movie joined the ranks of those before it that contain visionary special effects for its time including; the wizard of oz (1939) the star wars trilogy that began in (1977) the terminator (1984) and terminator 2 judgment day (1991).Along with it's never before seen effects the matrix has a mind blowing plot. This movie perfectly illustrates the mind control of conformity and the importance of rebellion to create a diverse race and a sense of reality from individualism. This movie deals with the power of mankind and most importantly the power of the human brain. This movie makes me feel that I can become truly powerful by harnessing the raw power within myself by tapping into the unused power of my mind. But most importantly this movie has taught me to believe. As if the power of believing will set me free. (I think that it illustrates that anybody can achieve their dreams if they truly believe. That if we set our minds to something we really can make a difference in our lives and in the world.),The Matrix
1811,The_Crys,"A modern, futuristic masterpiece",10,19 March 2006,"It was 1999 when I walked out of a theater in my hometown, feeling this insanely big urge to read philosophical books, re-read everything of PKD I owned and dodge imaginary bullets while doing cartwheels against walls.THE MATRIX is one of the few (if not the only) movies that, I believe, forces people to think AND is of great entertainment value. If you're looking for a movie to both show you a good time and give you something to think about, look no further. It is Philip K. Dick and William Gibson made cool for the masses, without ever losing even a fragment of its intelligence as a picture.What more can possibly be said about two --back then rather unknown- directors who managed to craft a film whose each and every aspect is a delight to witness on screen? There are very few film-makers in the industry today who can create a film that flirts with pretentiousness so wonderfully and actually manages to leave you off not bothered by that fact one bit. Science fiction, underlying philosophy, symbolism that is so vibrant you simply cannot miss it, beautiful cinematography, sensational score, the greatest action scenes ever seen up to that day (which have been since copied mercilessly) and a wonderful cast of actors and actresses. Can it get any better? The story takes us along the journey of one Thomas A. Anderson, a hacker known in cyberspace as Neo (KEANU REEVES). Thomas leads a rather dull life anywhere outside his own computer, until the day he is heaved out of anonymity and boredom by the mysterious TRINITY (CARRIE-ANNE MOSS), subordinate to the legendary man Thomas/Neo has been searching for years, Morpheus (LAURENCE FISHBURNE). The plot soon thickens, as Neo gets more than he bargained for and comes to discover 'just how deep the rabbit hole goes'. The male, aloof version of 'Alice' in this phenomenal film gets thrown into a 'Wonderland' that proves to be cold, alien and terrifying, but more real than anything he had so far witnessed. Or is it? I will come out and state that I am a very big fan of KEANU REEVES. Although fully aware that he is not among the best actors out there, I am prepared to give him a chance to prove himself as an actor in any of the projects he gets involved in. When I later on heard that the original choices for Neo included Will Smith and Tom Cruise, I cringed. KEANU becomes Neo in this film. There is a certain style he has adopted for many years now in his acting, and for this film, it works incredibly well. Venturing into the film alongside him, you can feel Neo's insecurities, his hesitance to become what he is allegedly destined to. A reluctant hero is all his glory, and KEANU is very effective in conveying that. He pulls off the part of the leading man wonderfully, and is framed by an equally capable cast. CARRIE-ANNE MOSS counters the slightly feminine (or rather asexual) look and softer personality of the leading man, and does so brilliantly. As Trinity, she moves with the grace of a woman and the discipline of a mercenary. It is no stretch to assume that two-thirds of the leading trio were cast as such purposefully. The third person to complete the hero triad is played by LAURENCE FISHBURNE, an actor for which, I am certain, no words are needed. Strong leader, caring 'father' to his crew, unyielding mercenary. LAURENCE slips into his part effortlessly.But surely, the greatest treat of this movie casting-wise is the awe-inspiring villain, Agent Smith, played by HUGO WEAVING. What a find! I have since then followed the man's career and was pleased to see that he does as incredibly as he did in THE MATRIX. Although fully convincing you the he is naught but a part of the machine world, HUGO breathes life into his robotic character. A machine with personality, you'll ask? I assure you that it is later on justified.THE MATRIX is well on its way of becoming a jewel of a movie for the young ones to get to know, and the older ones to fondly remember.I urge you to watch this movie again if you have already seen it and enjoyed it; you'll discover something new with every single viewing, since the amount of detail in this picture is almost insane. Kudos to the crew that worked so hard to achieve this result. If you haven't seen it, rent it as soon as possible.This is not just a movie for people who (like me) enjoy comic books, Sci-Fi, computers and Kung Fu. It's a movie for people who enjoy well-crafted cinema. And if it gives you something to think about when the credits roll under the booming tunes of Rage Against the Machine, all the better.Love it or hate it, THE MATRIX is a revolution. One certainly not to be missed.",The Matrix

1815,hans_moleman_31,Originality Explosion,9,4 July 2005,"Before the overuse of slo-mo, before the Wachowski brothers screwed themselves over, one movie changed movies for the new century. Bullet time had no yet been put to use. Wire work had not come into frequential use. And Sydney remained an untapped resource of film production. Whilst the technological aspects f the Matrix are what drew people in, that didn't mean that plot was neglected. Indeed it was not until the third viewing that it all fell into place. Lawrence Fishburnes' voice is as iconic as James Earl Jones now, and Keanu Reeves finally found a place for...woah.... to fit in properly. He's still as wooden as timber though, but he needed to be for this role! With some of the best action scenes mixed in with one of the most complicated scripts, The Matrix defines itself as the beginning of a movement of action films, that none live up to. Not even its subsequent below par sequels.",The Matrix

I asked her how come you hate a thing that you do not know, and I told her to give it a shot, and asked her to watch the first 10 mins , only the first 10 mins, the deal was if you did not like what you watch, then hate it as much as you can for the rest of your life, and after 10 mins only she was gazing at the screen without blinking, I am a writer my self, and I guess we all have to learn something from that movie. If your work is well made, and skillfully crafted, then you will get the audience or readers attention after 10 mins or maybe less.That is why this movie is the bestrix for me.",The Matrix
1817,gamesj,"It'd be a 10/10, except for the ending",8,20 June 2017,"The Wachowski brothers really did excel themselves with this movie. It's a brilliant movie on a number of different levels - the directing is excellent, the camera work is great, the visuals are stunning, the kung-fu is A+, acting is executed with style and conviction, and the plot is truly inspired. It's really hard to use enough superlatives on this movie!It'd be a 10/10, except for the ending. Having Neo do what he does at the end really lets it down, in my opinion. However, there's a couple of sequels on the way, so let's see what the Wachowskis can do to make up for it.Other than that, (and like I said above) the movie is operating on so many different levels that each time you watch it, you pick up something new... this isn't by accident, either. The Wachowski brothers had the actors read a number of definitive works (Simulation & Simulcra was one I believe) in modern literature and psychology, and applied liberal dashings of aspects of the major religions to provide the best sci-fi movie of the decade, if not ever.I'm yet to meet somebody who hasn't enjoyed it.

1819,greatwarrior01,the modern age star wars,9,25 August 2005,this is obviously the best out the three by keeping it more real then the rest of the three. This movie excels in every category a great story with many layers. even though the ideal of a real world and dream is completely stolen from Buddhism. But applying it in a way that that puts an unlikely hero as the one (neo) and makes every one in the audience think and wonder. There are classic scenes ( my favorite) the red pill blue pill. Also the beginning with trinity having audiences stunned by the effects. The effects are some of the best in cinema. The way the Wachowski brothers play with the effects of time were untouched and never thought of before this movie. And just for the record this movie did not create bullet time it was used in blade before the matrix but the matrix defined it now any action movie has to have it now. This movie didn't have to go 3000 years to the future to find sci-fi. Also In my opinion it created the best enemy ever as a suited agent who is unstoppable to the end. And at last my only problem now this is only probably me but it created this realistic sci-fi thriller then to come out with neo as a super powered superhero from just being a desk jockey didn't appeal to me because he was already a supreme fighter. With the jaw dropping martial arts and at the end where he flew makes no sense even in a fake dream world and that over the top comicbooky style launched the the rest of the prophecy like superman series but this movie is the best out of all 3 for keeping a realistic possible sci-fi world Because we could be in the matrix right now,The Matrix

Not since the original Starwars trilogy has a science fiction film reached across almost the entire population and gripped it with awesome special effects, great sound, and a overall feel of ground breaking movie making magic. It also serves up a good dose of paranoid delusions we all need in our lives every now and then.With that, I leave you with the fact that I've seen more different types of people liking this one film than most other films to date.

1825,cookd-90583,A Groundbreaking Masterpiece that defines what the term Sci-Fi means,10,2 November 2018,"What would you think if I told you the people who directed this movie have only directed 1 movie before this? The chances of a movie this spectacular being made was slim to none, let alone in 1999. This movie defined what the movies of the 21st century were going to be. (Okay, I'll stop fan-boying and actually review this now) To start, the characters are all well developed, and almost all of them get a memorable scene. If it's Neo and his incredible martial arts skills, Morphias in his red pill-blue pill scene, or the welcome to the desert of the real scene. Or Trinity kissing Neo at the end bringing him to life. These characters all stand out and make any scene enjoyable, and leave you wanting to see more from these amazing characters. It also raises the question ""what is real?"" into the mainstream. It's obviously not the first time it has been brought up, I mean take Plato's Allegory of the Cave for example. But adding this along with a great cast and script, drilling this into the head of anyone who has seen this movie. But, of course, you can't mention the Matrix without talking about the special effects. In my opinion, these effects hold up (for the most part) even today, and are sometimes better then the special effects you would see in modern day films. It did for CGI in films what Star Wars did for practical effects in 1977.

The absolutely beautiful style and feel of the movie work wonderfully with the computer graphics, the action is well directed and choreographed, and the story has enough sci-fi to satisfy hardcore audiences but still entertain the masses. Keanu Reeves still Ted Theodore Logan's a few lines, but manages to pull of the character. The Matrix could easily join the cult sci-fi status that Bladerunner holds.

The movie had a great idea, great visual style, and an interesting, twisting plot... if only they had gotten rid of the many bad parts to leave us with the unbelievably great stuff in between, we could have had a truly wonderful film.The fight scenes were like a super-stylish mix of Woo-style gunplay utilizing (and well, too) the new spin-around-a-still-scene technology seen in those Gap and Coke ads, and Hong Kong style kung-fu (Not a surprise since they got Yuen Woo-Ping, a veteran Hong Kong director dating back to the original Drunken Master in '78, to choreograph the fights).  And those scenes are amazing - really.  The high-speed photography was absolutely beautiful, and mixed with the unreal camera movements, gave me an action experience unlike any other I've ever seen, from  America's greatest action/sci-fi flicks, to Hong Kong's recent gunfests and kung-fu extravaganzas.  It's new, it's exciting, it's great, and it will copied unabashedly in the future (best to see it while it's fresh).Add the audio/visual perfection to an interesting plotline and passable-to-good acting from everybody, and you've got the making of a great show.Unfortunately, there is some pretty downright lame dialogue, a rather slow expository section in the middle, and some ""bad CG creatures versus the CG spacecraft (or whatever) in the CG set"" scenes that are totally passable, but I've seen a million times before and detract from the completely novel, brilliant fight scenes mentioned earlier.

That's your privilege.It just about functions as a crass action movie, provided you can sit through the tedious first hour, and the terrifyingly non-existent justification for something that (as several other reviewers have observed) could actually have been sensibly reasoned if anyone with reasonable intelligence or knowledge had been on the writing team.As it is, this mediocre script using an old, old, old idea has nothing to offer fans of sci fi who can read and were awake in the eighties, and considerably less to offer action fans than John Woo's Hong Kong films. The framing plot, when revealed, requires more than just a willing suspension of disbelief, it requires that you dismantle all your critical faculties and just content yourself with wallowing in the faintly entertaining special effects.It tries to be cool - and evidently succeeds in the eyes of many of the people who see it - but it seems to me little more than another soulless product of committee thinking and appeals to the lowest common denominator - and it doesn't get much lower than this.If you wish to see the same ground covered with more intelligence and visual flare, try the better-than-average film 'Dark City' (also mentioned by another reviewer) or the less accessible, but more stylish 'eXistenZ'. Not that I feel 'The Matrix' stole it's one flimsy idea from these films. This old chestnut has been around as long as cyberpunk has, and probably longer for all I know.Still, bread and circuses, I suppose.

The action, acting, story are great but by far, the most amazing aspect is how it parallels that of a Christian walk of life, from realizing what the world really is to dealing with it all and letting others know.  From the Matrix being the world as we know, one which is filled with things from worldly obsessions to keeping busy.  Both the ""Matrix"" and the world keep us blinded from the real truth.  Neo represents a man who has realized that something is wrong with the world.  At first he wants to know what it is, when he realizes it he finds that he doesn't want to believe it.  He's been tricked his entire life.  The story goes on through his transformation. Other parallels would be Agent Smith-Satan, the tempter (as we all know he does in the movie), Sypher-betrayed everyone as did Judas Iscariot.

In today's film industry, many films are just distorted versions of other films. The story of the Matrix does not follow suit. On the other hand, this is only true for the story.  Of course the action sequences are very difficult to be original, but several other visual elements were familiar, because they have be used before.Many scenes in the film made me comment to myself in a sarcastic tone, ""Yeah right.""On the upside, I hope that someday I myself can walk though the metal detector with many fully automatic weapons strapped to me, if not only to see the expression on the officer's face.",The Matrix
1844,JMW4UT,How DOES Morpheus keep his sunglasses on?,10,4 April 1999,"Strange as it seems, I went to his movie wanting desperately to NOT like it because I knew it would be wildly popular and occasionally, I like to swim downstream when everyone else chooses upstream. Or is it the opposite of that,  and where did that saying come from anyway? Was it just programmed into our psyche at birth? Strange. This movie was incredible, not only was it visually a treat but it also explains, to my satisfaction,  some mysteries of life, such as that whole ""deja vu"" thing.I liked the fact that I wasn't really sure who the good guys and the bad guys were for about the first 40 minutes.The humor was subtle and very dry. There was one cliched line of humor but it was placed so well that I didn't mind it and, in fact, found it to slightly relieve some tension-watch for the line, ""the door on your left, no your other left.""Keanu was great. His facial expressions made me believe. He can speak volumes with just his expressions and two simple words like ""whoa"" and ""okie dokie."" His progressive attitude change, as he learns more and more about the Matrix and his role in it, is exquisitely believable, and then when he finally sees the Matrix for what it is, you just know that you would follow him anywhere.As far as fashion goes, check out the footwear. Everybody has just great footwear. Don't put away your black clothes for summer, especially those long black coats, they look great when you're doing those anti-gravity cartwheels. Those sunglasses will also be a ""must have"" item for all of you swimming with the crowd.One final question, ""How DOES Morpheus keep those sunglasses on?""I highly recommend this film for a complete escape from your cares. It is also a repeater. I saw it twice, and am planning to go at least once more  so be sure to hit the matinee, they're cheaper, and you WILL want to see this movie again. Also, I don't know if there are plans for a sequel, but I would go, and go and go...",The Matrix
1845,supermandenver,"What can I say? It kicked ass. (and ribs, and head, and...)",10,25 March 1999,"I just saw an advance screening of the Matrix tonight, and I've gotta say this: this movie is a good excuse to get a HDTV and DVD - when it comes out on those media, that is. (and home theater, if you don't have it, of course. =)It's a solidly good flick, borders on great at times. It's a action/thriller, a cyberspace-based nailbiter that borrows snippets of plot element and/or scenes/similarities from such movies as The Terminator, Aliens, Star Wars, Empire Strikes Back, and a small handful of others. *But* only snippets. It's still a *fairly* original story/adaptation. The main stars are Keanu Reeves and Laurence Fishburne, and a handful of other fairly talented people (Joe Pantoliano - been in a bucketload of fairly popular movies over the last 15 years - and Carrie-Anne Moss).Now, anyone who made the mistake of forking over $X to see Keanu Reeves in his last cyberthriller role, ""Johnny Mnemonic"" [an adaptation of a William Gibson (read: the god of cyberspace) ] short story, might run screaming from The Matrix. Johnny Mnemonic was a *real* dog.  This film is better than that. By a *huge* margin.It's a solid  flick, with good non-contrived acting, a pretty unique and decent storyline, and it was actually very cool - without trying to ram it down your throat that it was cool/cyberspace is cool/wearing all black is cool/everything we do is cool. It just *was* what it was - and it did so very proficiently. It's got good guys (albeit somewhat darker-tinged in mood than you normally think of good) and a strong heroine part in it; and it's got very bad, evil, insidious dark forces too...it's worth the $X.I'd give it....somewhere between an 8 and a 9.5. I guess a 9. That'd be fair.(I just wish ""real life"" was that easy...I'd say more, but then I'd have to divulge spoilers. :) Just being able to do a whole bucketload of things that people were able to do in that movie. :)",The Matrix
1846,Beatle-2,HELLO YOU VICTIMS OF THE MATRIX!!!????,9,10 April 2000,"I am sorry to add such sadness to the comments but this movie is much more the running on walls and shoot-out scenes.  This movie is revolutionary not for its ground breaking effects but mostly for its principal. It says to the world that what we are doing and the way we live is WRONG, or at least it could be.  It does say that living as drones and following the system makes you nothing but a battery to those in power. I get upset to read your reviews that only discuss acting, cinematography and how cute Mr. Reeves is. Didn't this movie make you think. This wasn't like Con-Air that was just about blowing things up and causing havoc and then saving the day at the end of the film. This movie was brilliant because the thoughts it provoked, its fluid story, and constant questioning of what we've been taught. I give it a nine and say to those who haven't seen it please do so but look further than the million dollar shots and even more costly actors and look for the meaning within.",The Matrix
1847,llu,A Sci-fi Pulp Fiction Oozing Cool Styles,9,11 April 1999,"The Matrix is a sci-fi pulp fiction oozing cool styles. People with limited imagination and tastes may prevent themselves from thoroughly enjoying the film. Elements of the plot are derivative from a LOT of previous works (Dark City, Blade Runner, Alice in Wonderland, religions (esp., Christian and Buddhist) and etc.). However, they are combined and executed with finesse and originality. Style-wise, it reminds me of Kubrick's' ""A Clock Work Orange"" and Tarantino's ""Pulp Fiction"". Keanu Reeves is a best fit for the role, where explicit emotional acting is NOT required. Certain premises in the plot may not be scientifically convincing, but they are irrelevant. The matrix PROVOKES your imagination while overwhelms you with stunning visual effects (CG and camera works). I expect it to be a huge box office success. A solid 9 out of 10. Go see it on a big screen in a modern cinema. A definite DVD collector's item.Open your mind.",The Matrix
1848,Danno-9,"ok, but a lot of tricks from other directors used",7,14 June 1999,"The Matrix is a good movie, no doubt. A lot of action, good camerawork, great storyline. But what annoyed me was that the action scenes were made almost the same as John Who (Face/Off) would have done it. More than half of the storyline comes directly from 'The Terminator (2)'.  Especially the part where Keanu kicks the sunglasses of an agent's head. Maybe the Wachowski brothers also liked 'Highlander'.",The Matrix

I saw the commercials like everyone else, hit the web page, and decided the movie didn't matter, I just wanted to see the effects.  I thought ""the plot sounds a little like Tron"" so I wasn't expecting too much of the story.  I remember Keanu Reeves in Bill and Ted's Bogus Success (that is the name of that movie, isn't it?) and I REALLY didn't expect much from the actors (I held out a little hope because of Laurence Fishburne's presence).  I was thinking too far back.  I should've thought about 2 years ago when I saw the Devil's Advocate in which Keanu turned in a great performance, which he matched if not improved upon in the Matrix.  Fishburne and Carrie-Anne Moss completed the triumvirate quite effectively to show us a very well performed movie.The movie is about these people who live in a simulated world - oh, but I've said too much.  Go see it.  It's a sci-fi plot I've seen hinted at but never fully formed in this fashion, which I find to be truly unique for this genre of movie.All elements necessary to give a film a 10 were here...excellent acting, writing, directing, and story-telling, great action scenes, and of course, the sweetest eye-candy ever to hit the silver screen.

1851,steve-33,About as deep as the Teletubbies,3,6 October 1999,"A terrible film.  Completely unoriginal.  And what's this fascination with just one special effect which isn't much more exciting than slow motion.  I like action, and I like fancy effects, such movies don't require plot, dialogue, nor acting.  Unfortunately lacks in every single area.  Although I know that hype carries through lots of films, I can't believe the hype blinded so many people into regarding this film as anything but a cheap and nasty B-rated imitation of so many great, visually stimulating, and thought provoking films.  As with previous comments, I recommend Dark City for the original movie plot.  And just about any Bruce Lee film for the Kung Fu. In hindsight though, the popularity of this movie is making me think that the theme in the Matrix could indeed be the truth, except that in reality the ""Matrix"" is the Hollywood Movie Producers...",The Matrix

The special effects are......*thinks*.....I'm not gonna even try to name what the special effects are like.  I guess the closest that I could to is - New.  Amazing!!!Sure, I was going to the show with some REALLY high expectations -- What I got exceeded these expectation four times over!The plot:  Well, I found it a little bit rough to get in to - the beginning of the movie has you searching for a meaning - ""What is going on"" you ask yourself.  But, as you quickly find out, is that this ONE question is what propels the story the majority of the time. It's okay if you don't get it at first - neither does the main character.  As the story progresses, so does your knowledge of the plot...and ""what the MATRIX is"".  It's a bit hard to describe - but then so is the effects that accompany it.The effects :  Well, I had NO idea....  I am a GREAT fan of John Woo and all of his masterpeices.  The effects of this movie is like taking Woo's fairly recent ""FACE/OFF"" - the ""super high octane"" gun fight scenese, and then add about five - ten more minutes to them.  Also add in a HEALTHY dosage of new effects and great (suspended cable) work and Whammo - you have one of the coolest fight scene movies ever to be viewed by the movie goer!!!Well...I guess I better stop drooing now....[ I think I'm gonna go see it again!!!

His decision to further investigate the source and meaning of this message would irrevocably change his life forever.This fast paced and rather complex plot is entertaining on many levels. While most viewers will be content with just the stunning visual effects and unbelievable martial arts sequences, others will enjoy the clever references to Lewis Carroll and Douglas Hofstadter.Unusual camera angles combined with a viewpoint that is rarely stationary make this film a visual roller coaster ride.  The plot is equally fast and filled with turns and twists to keep most viewers on their toes.While most eyes are on Keanu Reeves, the sleeper of this film is Lawrence Fishburne.  His compelling performance as the enigmatic Morpheus is outstanding.  He plays it so well that the viewer is not sure if Morpheus is a good guy or a bad guy, a Zen master or a blind faith fool.  Or just maybe, just maybe, all of the above.  His performance is worth serious consideration.The film, by tackling the sacred cows of philosophy and offering an unconventional scenario, will stimulate and amuse most viewers yet may offend or upset others.  Take the scene where a little boy, dressed as a Far Eastern monk, bends a spoon by just looking at it and explains, ""the spoon does not exist.""  While this works within the context of the film, it may offend those who take their Far Eastern philosophy seriously.In the end, the film forces the viewer to ask if one would accept a horrifying, uncomfortable and disgusting truth over a pleasing, comfortable and attractive lie.

""The Matrix"" sums it up in a nutshell, a two and a half hour nutshell. Every possible question you could ask derived from the movie is answered. The basis of the movie is interesting, but it is how they pulled it off is what makes it INTENSE. A suspenseful sci-fi for the open-minded. The ideas generated are as intense and as cutting edge as the graphics. Not many films capture you beyond special effects, but ""Matrix"" does and beyond. It's the graphics that hit home the ideas. If this were attempted in earlier years the intensity generated would have been minimalized. A fantastic performance by every actor makes this a very believable and breathtaking window to a different perspective of the world. It leaves you with an aftertaste of hope.

Keanu Reeves delivers a fine performance along the lines of his work in ""Speed."" Carrie-Anne Moss makes the perfect freedom fighter alongside him, and no-one is cooler then Laurence Fishburne.

I only saw Keanu Reeves, who hasn't had the most consistent acting career, running around with Lawrence Fishburne asking ""What is the Matrix?"" However, this same question drew me into the theater, and I was not disappointed. The Matrix has it all.  A great storyline, which causes viewers to question their own realities.  It also has a pretty good acting crew.  Reeves tops his previous best in SPEED, portraying the confused, reluctant Messiah of Fishburne's movement.  Also, the movie has complete control over the audience.  In one scene, Fishburne (Morpheus) asks Reeves (Neo), ""Do you think what you're breathing now is air?"" The entire audience stopped breathing, and then recovered to congratulate the film with scattered ""whoa's"" and ""ah's.""  Another similar instance occurs when a bullet comes whizzing directly into the camera, making everyone in the audience instinctively blink. Oh yeah, I forgot:  The movie is absolute eye-candy!  Although it is overdone at times, the computer enhanced stunt sequences are unbelievable! I won't give anything away, but you're about to see something incredible as soon as Neo and Trinity (Carrie-Anne Moss) attempt to enter the Agent headquarters! All in all, the movie combines the best of the most classic sci-fi films to create a story to wrap around their visual marvels.  The plot contains allusions to The Terminator, Alien, and others.  All of this makes the Matrix an incredible experience that you won't want to see end.",The Matrix
1859,sangreal-3,FANTASTIC! .... FOR PHILOSOPHY *** WARNING!!! POSSIBLE SPOILERS****,10,19 October 1999,"Possibly others have written this before, but I was swamped in all those recent comments!I think the Matrix is not only great for the action scenes, the mise en scene, SFX, stunts, art direction, cinematography, manga style direction, soundtrack, plot, sense of wonder, style, and yes, even Keanu's acting and the tongue in cheek humour about his proverbial airheadedness (""your other left!""), but also for the philosophical side behind it.Even if we do not consider seriously in a literal way that we are ruled by machines, and kept happy with a computer image of the world, we should consider that maybe in fact... we ARE kind of batteries in our economy and social structure. Morpheus tells Neo: ""you see the Matrix when you go to work, when you go to church, when you watch TV..."". In all the examples he mentions, we are part of a system, with its own values and needs - and we are not free. At least, not as long as we do not see it is a system that uses us to perpetuate itself. Think on it.So... enjoy the movie if you didn't, and enjoy it again if you did!
By the Way - watch agent Smith very closely... what is it that he really wants? I only saw it after a second viewing in the theatre, and then I was used to the whole concept of the film... Watch him.

The best thing about it is it has some PLOT, (actually, a more complicated than it appears at first) and some thought went into the way things were organized.During the showing (about half way through) three teenaged guys in front of us got up and walked out.  I guess that too many people these days are afraid to put any thought into watching a movie and would rather just have the world thrown into their laps.

1867,ed-160,"The Matrix a Visual Treat, But Not Much Else",7,5 April 1999,"What if the world in which we live wasn't real? This is the scenario that the writing/directing team of Larry and Andy Wachowski (Bound) take on in their ultra-paranoid new sci-fi flic, The Matrix.  The film takes place in the near future, where Paul Anderson, a hacker who goes by the name of Neo (Keanu Reeves), stumbles upon an immense computer program, The Matrix, about which nothing is known.  Neo quickly gets intrigued by the mystery of The Matrix, and in his quest to find out what it is he meets Morpheus (Laurence Fishburne), another hacker who claims that he can reveal the secret of The Matrix to Neo.  The catch:  once Neo finds out what The Matrix is, his life will never be the same again.And so begins the adventure for Neo, who must put aside his own disbelief in order to defeat the Gatekeepers and the traitor Cypher (Joe Pantoliano) save Morpheus' life, all while falling in love with Morpheus' second-in-command, Trinity (Carrie-Ann Moss).  Not bad for a lowly software programmer. Admittedly, the plot for The Matrix sounds a little weak and the dialogue is pretty cheesy (we're given lines like `Hold on Dorothy, cause Kansas is going bye-bye.'), but the film is able to pull it off, mostly with the help of some brilliant special effects.  And they are brilliant.  Mass.Illusions, LLC, the same parent company that achieved technical wizardry with What Dreams May Come, once again shines through here with some impressive freeze-frame motion special effects. Keanu Reeves (Speed, Johnny Mnemonic) still can't act, but, Bill and Ted's aside, this is probably the least horrible of all his performances. Luckily, his stone-cold serious character is given little to do besides blow things up and utter one-word exclamations such as `Whoa!' and `Cool!'  It was almost as if Neo was written with Reeves' limited talent in mind. Unfortunately, however, none of the other actors are given too much to do either.  For all of his talent, Laurence Fishburne (Just Cause, Hoodlum) is only given so much to do, to the point where he is neither a plus or a minus in the film.  The same holds true for Carrie-Ann Moss (Sabotage, The Secret Life of Algernon), who seems too preoccupied with her love for Neo and so comes off as being an extremely one-dimensional character.  Even the film's most interesting character, Agent Smith, as the leader of the Gatekeepers, is overdone too the point of being annoying.  This is a shame because the dry, cynical way in which Australian actor Hugo Weaving(The Adventures of Priscilla, Queen of the Desert, Reckless Kelly) portrays him is for the most part a welcome deviation from the robot-like interpretations of every other character in the movie. The bottom line is that The Matrix is worth seeing if for no other reason than to be blown away by some really cool visual effects.  Because, honestly, there is really not a whole lot more than that.  One wonders just how good The Matrix could have been, if only the script could have been revised just a few more times, and the cast had been chosen just a little more carefully.",The Matrix
1868,Kire,The Matrix = the film of my dreams,10,8 April 1999,"Some of my favorite movies include Dark City (great original sci-fi plot), Rumble in the Bronx (incredible fight scenes),  Hard Boiled (slick action direction), L.A. Confidential (superb direction and dialogue), and Dead Poets Society (forces to examine your own existence).  What happened if you threw all of these movies into a melting pot?  A big jumbled mess, right? WRONG.Somehow, someway, the W. Bros. have figured out a way to combine all of these elements to create a film that sparks the imagination and dazzles the eyes simultaneously.  Never before have I seen such a film that could cover this many genres at once.  Throughout all of the masterpieces I've seen in my days, only The Matrix has brought me back to the same movie more then once.  The quality of this film is so overwhelming, that I've now seen it 3 times in 6 days!Star Wars is known as having one of the most intricate ""universes"" in sci-fi history.  The trilogy spawns books, comics, tv shows, and video games.  The universe created in The Matrix is SO detailed, it has the same potential. You learn an incredible amount about the world which exists in the film, but you don't notice it because you are being distracted with cinematography, acting, action scenes, and special effects that are undoubtedly Oscar worthy.The characters, you ask?  The Matrix creates genuine personalities that seem to have been made for each actor/actress.  Believe it or not, Keanu Reeves as Neo plays a great sympathetic hero we can all relate to.  His reactions to odd events are on the money, and Neo can sometimes have a certain playfulness about his abilities (look for it!).  Lawrence Fishburne triumphs as the enigmatic Morpheus, delivering powerful dialogue exactly the way it was intended.  Carrie Anne Moss's emotionally bottled up Trinity fills the gaping hole that Linda Hamilton left with her performance in Terminator 2.  Finally, the return of the butt kickin' woman!  The biggest surprise, however, goes to Hugo Weaving for his portrayal as Agent Smith. So many other actors could've made this another bland antagonist, but instead they fished out Hugo from the land down under to give movie goers one of the most memorable bad guys to date.  I know I'm leaving some other interesting characters, but I'd be here forever.One criticism I hear over and over about this masterpiece is that it borrows from this movie, that movie, blah blah blah... All I have to say is EVERY movie borrows from many different sources.  In all honesty, there is no such thing as originality!  You could easily say Star Wars stole from The Bible, Shakespeare, Cereno de Bergerac, midieveal philosophy, and pirate movies...so I could say, ""Star Wars?  hah!  how unoriginal!""  If you think it hasn't been done before, chances are you're just not looking hard enough.Are you one of those people who skip to the last paragraph?  If so, here's my review in a nutshell: Go see The Matrix.  Then go see it again.  If you still don't understand why we'll remember it for years to come, see it again.  I apoligize for any other intricacies of The Matrix I forgot to mention; you usually don't come by a film with so many.  For the first time, I can say this movie ""has it all.""  Such an over used cliche doesn't deserve it half the time, but trust me, this does!10 out of 10, without a doubt.As far as sequels / prequels go, I want more Matrix, but I fear that poor installments would detract from the sheer beauty this film possesses.

1871,Heyzus,Dark City with light and unbelievable special effects.,9,2 April 1999,"If you enjoyed Dark City as I did I am quite sure you will love this movie. Dark City is one my all time favorites list and now so is The Matrix.  The special effects in this movie were out of this world.  They really leave you pining for more in the end.  I just wanted to watch the movie over again to catch all the special effects.  As far as acting goes nothing spectacular was done.  I am quite happy that Keanu did not have many lines in the movie because he is not the best actor.  In fact, he pretty much sucks (when he speaks) but the darkness of the movie allowed for his lack of acting abilities.  Not much dynamic was needed in acting in this movie.  It was your typical hard ass acting role movie.  IE. there was one absolutely horrible line in the movie. (maybe more than one) When Keanu is in the car after being contacted the girl in the front seat (I think switch) tells Keanu ""take your shirt off"" Keanu responds by saying something to the effect of ""no way"".  The girl then says ""Listen buddy, it is my way, or the highway"".  She then orders the car to stop and Keanu opens the door like he is going to take the highway.  This is one line they definitely should not have included so early in the movie. I thought it was going to be a flop of acting after I heard this, but thank god it was not.  This movie turned out to kick some serious ass.  It is definitely worth your time and money.  (5 buck up here in Fort Collins). The only main thing I recommend is to find a theater that has a huge screen and awesome sound.  The theaters up here in Fort Collins really stink and I probably would have had a better time with a good home stereo TV setup.  So get up off your butt and go see this movie.",The Matrix
1872,Cacciato,I'm guilty of kinda liking it...,7,29 April 1999,"This movie had everything that I hate in a movie.  Special effects that's supposed to make up for a lack of plot.  Poorly developed characters.  No meaning whatsoever (except for some cliched, hormonal message I guess).  And Keanu Reeves.  It was one of those movies like ID4 and Armageddon than may be a fun ride in the theater, but you leave feeling cheapened... and guilty. Guilty because its so utterly stupid.  This movie had a cool idea, a pretty awesome one I might say.  The special effects were incredible.  But, those two qualities (the only good qualities this movie had) do not make a good movie.I'll give it this -- In the long line of stupid movies, this one's probably the best.",The Matrix

The first thing that attracted me to the movie was that the word ""Matrix"" was already used in one Doctor Who Episode: Trial of the timelords which I enjoyed too.But let's stick the comments to the movie.  It features Keanu Reeves a well known actor and Laurence Fishburne which I first saw him in Event Horizon. 
The story is well done, good plot, as in many US Hollywood movies, they always try to tell people everything in details.The second thing is: Why do rebels always need to look cool(refering to their black clothing except for Oracle)?The third thing: It made me thought too much to Dark City which I saw months ago.those are the only reasons why I rate it only 9 out of 10.This is a film that will dazzle, amaze, disturb & even confuse the viewers.Good entertainment.",The Matrix

But I really need to speak on Laurence Fishburne's powerful performance!  I do not expect any less of him, based on most of his other character portrayals.    He is definitely the force behind the strength of the message of the movie.  The supporting cast had extremely good chemistry going.  This was a great adventure into the past, present, and future all at the same time.  Thanks for the memories (i.e., Bruce Lee, Superman, Snow White(reversed)).  Thanks for the eye candy.  Thanks for the philosophical stimulation.  Thanks for 'The Matrix'.  Can we go back there sometime?  I hope so.",The Matrix

Laurence Fishburne also did a great job playing Morpheus.  This movie has everything from action to thrilling special effects to a little romance.

1876,thehumble1,"Zen, Christianity, and holes the size of Kansas",6,10 April 1999,"I went into the movie with several preconceptions, but I was surprised.  I was astonished both by the thought that was put into the plot, and the lack of thought that was put into the theory.  The combination of the second coming of Christ and Zen Buddhism was nifty, but one would have to leave their logic in the car outside if they are going to follow the plot without gasping for coherence.  I thought that Keanu did a fine job, acting the less like Bill S. Preston Esq. than ever, but it was a bit telling when the entire theater laughed at his attempt to look stylish while fighting; he isn't a martial artist.The major holes in the plot may pass by some people, which may be a good thing, but I think that in a movie which tries to present a possible future, challenging the mind of the patron, it is sad when there are such problems in the actual presentation.  There was a definite lack of continuity in thought that left me feeling insulted, as if the producers thought that I would not notice that nothing fit together.  I think that if the movie was written and presented to a publisher, they would get rejected because of the lack of thoroughness.But wow, there were a lot of scenes that just amazed me.  I was captured.It has a good story line with poor world design, a great presentation, and lots of eye candy.I kind of hope that people could look past the problems, but I also would be saddened if people didn't see the big logical errors.  It would mean that people don't think about and thus can't learn from movies.  If they don't get the problems with the movie, they probably don't get the point of it either.",The Matrix

So, just to be sure that I hadn't missed something significant, I watched it again on DVD last night.I should have slept through it again.Sure, the special effects are out of this world, the mythology is interesting, and the production values are superb. But the characters are cardboard, the plot has thousands of holes, the dialogue is horrible, and the casting director really needed to get a clue about casting; Keanu Reeves?!? Come on! Didn't Johnny Moronic (excuse me, MNEMONIC) prove that Keanu just doesn't fit into these cyberpunk leading roles?!?Anyway, I can not in good conscience recommend this ""film"" to anyone.

Well I am happy to say I was mistaken about this movie! From the opening scene the whole way to the end of the movie I was captivated and in awe. The FX were great, the acting above average especially for Keanu Reeves who I have found in the past to be bland and dry as an actor, but he really excelled with this part. There were a few plot holes, but they did not take away from the movie at all, overall it was a great movie and after you get done watching it you will be asking yourself lots of questions about what is really real in this ""world"" we live in!",The Matrix

The fight scenes were the best I've ever seen in an American movie. Hopefully the bar has been raised enough that other film makers will be held to this new standard.The movie also had good special effects and an interesting premise.  The acting wasn't great, but why should we even pretend to be disappointed? We all know Keanu isn't great.  Give him credit for taking such a physically demanding part.",The Matrix
1883,stigoftdump,Weird!,8,10 July 1999,"I went along to this film expecting to see a run-of-the-mill, standard the-big-guys-are-out-to-get-me affair - it's all been done, hasn't it? Wrong!The baddies are bad, the goodies are good, and there is no grey area. It's a perfect film in that way, in that you don't have to think for it to tumble along. That leaves it open for the ratehr complicated and frankly terrifying concept at the heart of the Matrix to come to the fore, and it does, with electrifying pace and sparkle.Yes, it's deep. Yes, it's intellectual. But hell, what cool fight scenes! The plot works in such a way that people can do Nike-ad-style jumps over buildings and the sort of martial arts moves that aren't usually seen outside of Mortal Combat, and they look SO cool!This is one of the few films I've seen that affects you for a while AFTER leaving the cinema. All films affect you in some way - but this film made me look about and go ""Is it all real?"" It's great, and very enrtertaining.Incidentally, be prepared for the Star Wars blags. Most notable of these are when Morpheus is talking about the Matrix ""It binds us, and holds the universe together"" and ""It also obeys your commands!"", as well as the obvious ""You must go to the Degoba system for your training!"" These get laughs when they're not supposed to, but only for me, 'cuse I'm like that!Bad points? Well, It may be a little slow for some people - I personally didn't think so, but it takes a while to get to where it's going. Mind you, when Keanu wakes up in that tank - it's just such a shock that it's worth the wait.All in all, a very good film. At the time of writing, it's rated as the 20th best film EVER on the IMDB rating - a bit high, but it's understandable. I found myself humming Strawberry Fields Forever ""Nothing is Real"" through the film - when I start humming tunes, you know it's a goodun!In summary, go watch this film if you like to think a bit, but like cool fight scenes and plenty of drama.

1885,El Tel,Have a philosophy debate and get your blown off simultaneously,10,20 August 1999,"I've seen this film three times on the big screen thus far and I'm already thinking of planning my next trip. This film just blows you away with an all out style fest and a decent plot which while borrowing elements from loads of other films (Terminator, Dark City and Total Recall spring to mind) still manages to retain an incredible freshness over proceedings. I can't criticise anything about the film, except possibly the cheesy Kung-Fu poses that Keanu Reeves manages to maintain - whether this was deliberate or not I'm not so sure. The action is incredible, the effects are fantastic and the whole sound just hits you full on. I also loved the peculiar diction of the enemy agents - very cool. All the main characters evolve as the film developes, making the film much more than just a 'beat em up'. The plot, while relatively easy to grasp is still 'there', it's not as complex as a lot of people seem to make out but is just about right for an action movie that has got so many other things that grab your attention, like Carrie Ann Moss's (Trinity) figure hugging outfit and immense first fight scene. This is probably THE film which will make me go out and buy a DVD / Widescreen TV home movie set - it deserves never to be watched on anything less.......",The Matrix

If I had to say anything about it is one word: unbelievable. The plot is superficial and the pseudo-deep-philosophy all of you are talking about is bad builded (have you any idea of the electric potential of human neurones? My God! What a poor energy source for the Matrix!). All of you thinking that an Sci-Fic movie doesn't need logical don't know nothing about GOOD Sci-Fic.I admit that the first part of the movie is decent: while Neo still ignores all about the Matrix there is an enigmatic atmosphere that gives suspense to the film. But the second part is boring and stupid. Just a lot of shot-sounds to turn everybody deaf. The fighting scenes made laugh all the theatre (suspension of disbelief? Ja! ) and when Carrie Ann Moss says she just needs a lesson to pilot the helicopter was ridiculous. However, I think Moss was the better of the cast. I've found Keanu too cold and Fishburne was as his character's name: Morpheus, that is, made me want to sleep. And the Oracle! Who casted that horrible actress?The only good of the film was the a-la William Gibson cyber-style of costumes and the FX. Of course, nothing to be in the 26th place of top250. This film should *NOT* be neither in the top250 nor in the top500.And how can you compare this with Philip K. Dick's Blade Runner???? Are you joking, KIDS?I give it a 5 of 10 out and only for the FX.",The Matrix

I even think that he did a decent job in Much Ado About Nothing, but I was very disappointed in his performance in this movie.  His acting was so wooden that I rarely sensed any well-conveyed emotion.Also, what was up with the writing?  I remember when I first saw the trailer for this movie, I laughed for weeks over the fact that the shot of a supposedly amazed Keanu saying ""whoa"" in a breathy voice was the highlight of the 30 second advertisement.  There were several points during the ridiculously absurd and unbelievable movie that caused both my date and me to guffaw when we saw it on the big screen.One thing I do have to say in the Matrix's favor is that it looked pretty damn good (this description does include Keanu, by the way, who looks excellent in the wardrobe they gave him).  Lately a lot of bad computer generated effects have made their way into movies, but this one was nearly visually perfect.  Some of the scenes involving the twisting of reality were pretty amazing.  If only the actors could have been as convincing as the effects... and if only the plot they had to support wasn't so silly, I might feel differently about this film.",The Matrix

The innocent, playful, comic book style of the film covers it's heavy themes beautifully.  The notion of the willingness to see truth as an indicator of morality was purposefully portrayed as the Hero is willing to witness the truth regardless of the consequences, while his Judas-like human enemy takes the path of least resistance and opts for pleasure over truth. Thankfully, these motifs never become heavy-handed and the film rock'n'rolls along nicely with spectacular violence and special effects.

Of course, Neo and his buddies whoop up on their enemies; I won't tell you how... I will let you be blown away by the direction and wire-work, not to mention the special effects (Bullet time! You have to see it to understand it completely).I can't wait for the sequel, but it looks like I'll have to (come on, 2002, get here quickly! I also need to watch SWEp2!

Lawrence Fishburne adds respectability to the cast, and the plot, though confusing at first, is pretty cool and original.The best thing about the movie is the special effects and the impressive martial arts fights.  The two main ones, where Fishburne and Reeves square off, and where Reeves meets one of the agents, were choreographed by the same guy who does the Jet Li scenes, were some of the best work i've seen done in an american film.All in all, a very entertaining film, i don't think sci-fi flicks were meant to be criticized.

""The Matrix 2"" can't arrive in cinemas quickly enough.As far as Keanu Reeves' much-derided acting is concerned, I believe that people are being too hard on him - He has a welcome bravery and lack of cynicism, taking far more chances in the role of Neo than his peers would. He's not afraid to embody an irony-free innocence and to play the whole film's journey towards discovery and identity with great honesty - In essence, he's being true to the Wachowski's material.The rest of the cast are fantastic - Fishburne is a total Zen master, Carrie-Anne Moss a goddess and the great Joe Pantoliano gets another welcome chance to shine.Quite simply, ""The Matrix"" takes you to a completely different world for two hours and that's kind of the reason that I go to the cinema for - To see something new and exhilarating, which this film certainly is.",The Matrix

You MUST see this movie to experience it. Also, another great thing about this movie is the religious discussions it can bring up (after the movie). A must see. Kat rates this film, ""An excellent must see for everyone!!""",The Matrix
1911,JerichoholicDS,Too Good To Be Called An Action Flick,10,16 August 2001,"I would warn anybody reading this that there might be a few spoilers in here, but if you're one of the four or five people on the planet that haven't seen this movie, you deserve it. I hate to call this an ""action movie,"" because THE MATRIX is so much more than that. This movie has more to it than can be described in a single paragraph. The special effects are groundbreaking, the acting was surprisingly good, but both only served the purpose of getting people to see this movie. The true greatness of THE MATRIX lies in all its underlying themes: the apocalyptic nature of the film, the myriad number of Biblical references (e.g. Cypher being a play on the name Lucifer, or the name of the hovercraft being named the Nebuchadnezzer after the Babylonian king who freed the Jews), the faceless evil that was the machines running the planet, and the incredible feeling of hope within the film that perpetually touches the audience. This movie has it all, and I have yet to come across somebody that didn't put this in at least their top 2",The Matrix
1912,Lokii,very cool movie,9,4 March 2001,"Overall, the matrix is a powerful film. The plot is wickedly creative and almost shocking the first time you see this movie. The directors are obviously very talented, and the atmosphere of this movie is very, very cool. The acting was decent but nothing fantastic, although I really liked Laurence Fishburne and the main detective. I normally dislike Keanu Reeves, I think that he is a very mediocre actor. However, in this movie his lack of acting skills fits the clueless Neo role perfectly, so he's all right. I have to say that the first half of the movie is amazing, then it starts to taper off a bit. Unfortunately, the last 15 minutes are truly disappointing. Throughout most of the movie I was amazed at how original everything was, but the end was full of cheesy clichés. Although it is a low-point, the ending is still good enough to make this a truly great movie. It is surely one of the best action movies of the 90s. I give it 9/10",The Matrix

I really don't think I could sit through it ever again, there is only so much you can get out of people in sunglasses doing cartwheels while firing two Uzis at the same time. What really p*sses me off is when people go 'oh it's sooo confuing, it's just soo intelligent, the story is just sooooooo mind-boggling!' YEAH RIGHT! It's not like you need to be Albert-feckin'-Einstein to work it out!! The acting is unbelievably corny and whenever the script calls for any real emotion (which doesnt happen often in this music video.. oh sorry .. film) the actors arent upto it. Unless it gets amazing reviews then I will not be going to see the sequel- save your money for Star Wars Episode 2 and The Two Towers (lord of the rings part2). p.s- and the effects aren't all that.",The Matrix

This was one of the few movies that I came close to shutting off out of shear boredom.  The first hour was a snorefest.  Thankfully, the movie redeemed itself at the one-hour mark, providing some of the sweetest actions scenes that I have ever seen.  The movie satisfied me on numerous occasions in the second hour or so.  The plot itself was very slow towards the beginning, but picked up along with the action at about the half-way point.  My vote would have been significantly lower if it hadn't been for that second hour of viewing.",The Matrix

Keanu Reeves and Laurence Fishburne were fantastic. Carrie-Anne Moss and Hugo Weaving as Agent Smith were also great. For me this is one of the most remarkable films in the last years. Many people just see another action, science-fiction movie in it. But matrix is different. It has also a magnificent story. If you have never seen this one you'd really missed something.

1921,ryanmeray,"An attention-grabbing film which successfully weaves gunplay, martial arts, and explosions together with a screenplay possessing both excellent dialogue and deep symbolism, all thrown together with a fine ca",10,21 February 2001,"Looking for an action movie with white-knuckle gunplay?  How about a movie with absolutely beautifully choreographed martial arts?  Or maybe one which is set in a future of unimaginable decay?  Or even a movie which contains deep symbolic subtexts?There is only one movie which possesses all of these qualities, and that movie is ""The Matrix.""  Think of it as a feast for the eyes, ears, and mind.From out of almost nowhere, this movie debuted in theaters.  There were TV ads, a few magazine ads here and there, but for the most part, there was no anticipation.  None, of course, until critics began publishing reviews one week before the movie came out.  All of its finer qualities made it the surprise smash of Spring 1999.On the action movie level, you have Keanu Reeves as Thomas ""Neo"" Anderson, a computer software engineer who finds out he is the savior of the world, and the only things in his way are The Agents (led by Hugo Weaving).  Of course, the Agents are basically invincible, almost all-knowing entities, and the number of rounds expended as Neo and his freedom fighters battle probably reaches up into the ten thousands.On the martial arts level, Woo-ping Yuen, veteran of the Hong Kong martial arts movies and highly acclaimed fight choreographer, keeps you on the edge of your seat as Neo, Morpheus (Lawrence Fishburne), et al. battle unarmed with the Agents and their underlings.  All of this is helped along by superb wire effects, which allow the actors to perform complex aerial maneuvers which defy the laws of gravity.The plot is one thing which shouldn't be revealed prematurely, there are myriad surprises which must be viewed rather than spoiled.And finally, the religious and symbolic subtexts, the references to Christianity and Buddism, all of that provides your mind something to think about while your eyes are enjoying the candy.The Matrix is a movie to be seen over and over again, preferably, on a large-screen TV, with a booming audio system hooked to a DVD player, and with no distractions whatsoever.If you haven't seen it, see it.  That fact cannot be emphasized enough.",The Matrix

And yes, the first part of film was excellent, while the other, from moment when Trinity kissed poor Neo, which was slaughtered by ruthless agents, and he stood up, starting to butcher them all, totally sucks! It's just like some cheap stupid action movie, where, after he had been beaten for some hours, main hero suddenly gets ""angry"" and beats up his enemy with ease. Well, and yes there are a lot of things, which haven't thought through. Robots should know perfectly, how matrix works, so they could make their agents unbeatable, as well they should know any human current locality. (At least, this should be true with any of current computer programs, but I can't believe someone should make such a powerful computer prog without not less powerful protection against any intruders / fugitives.

1924,whendeicidelives,Typically over-rated film,2,28 December 2006,"I saw this film on its release, and I have to admit, i was impressed with what I saw. But, this was 7 years ago, I was but a young, impressionable teenage whose questions had to be answered by the latest quasi, pseudo relevant material that certain elements of the media decree are 'good', and so champion it beyond its 'merits'. Looking back at it now, i have to wonder at what seems to be somewhat dangerous religious overtones. The last surviving outpost for 'free' humans is a city called Zion. Everything about the characters reeks of 'discipleness'. You have a Jesus figure (Morpheus) who has 'freed' a number of humans (akin to disciple's with their belief in his infallibility). Then, rather bizarrely a second Jesus figure emerges in the guise of 'Neo'. Then, a prophet, or 'oracle' turns up just to mystify things further (or rather, to make it plainly clear that the plot has lost all sense of direction and purpose). The idea that we are 'controlled' by others, or that we are submissive slaves to a higher 'power' is neither new nor thought provoking, and especially not so when represented in such a pitifully weak manner. Are we expected to believe that 'our saviour' will just happen to be 'born' and has our best interests at heart? Sound like a familiar story? (I haven't seen the sequels and don't wish to.) The film tries to marry breath taking visuals (which I have to say, although technically good, lack originality! See movies by John Woo and you'll know what I mean) with the undertone of religious martyrdom, with the intention of? I'm not sure, because upon second viewing the movie left me with a bitter taste (a pill I couldn't swallow if you like) in my mouth. Nothing was resolved, the characters hadn't developed into anything, you got the impression they were all waiting for Neo to 'burst' into action, and it looked on screen like Keanu was waiting for it too...All in all, a very underwhelming experience, sometimes worrying in its subliminal undertones and allusions to religious archetypes as saviours. Unlikely that the masses who heap acclaim on this movie as 'trendy' and 'cool' will see past its hollow questions and non-existent answers and continue to believe that its 'mindblowing stuff'. Which, in a way, is even more worrying because its seems that people no longer want an engaging cinema experience, just cheap thrills and 'hip' style is enough these days...",The Matrix

1935,eoreill,Still great after all these years,9,30 May 2020,"It's always a little bit sad when you watch a movie that you loved when you were young and discover that you no longer love it, or love it less. That happened to me recently with Fight Club. The social rebellion that inspired me at 17, while still somewhat attractive, now seemed reckless, selfish, and irresponsible. So when I decided to watch The Matrix for the first time in, probably 15 years, I was prepared for a similar experience.It was a happy surprise then that The Matrix seemed just as excellent post-graduate school as it did pre-high school. The possibility that what is perceived as reality is actually a false construct seemed perhaps even more likely, and the call to abandon that construct equally enticing.Visually, the film is still striking. The use of vertical streams of eerie green digits to depict the virtual reality that constitutes the Matrix is still effective, and Morpheus, in his black leather trench coat and pince-nez sunglasses, still looks cool. The aesthetic of dilapidated, poorly-lit buildings fits the dystopian setting perfectly, and each space, be it the Oracle's apartment or the interior of the Nebuchadnezzar, makes the world of The Matrix seem that much more diverse and vivid.By the end of the film, temporary suspension of disbelief has become increasingly necessary - say, when Trinity's whispered declaration of love in accordance with the Oracle's prophecy brings Neo back from the dead - but my disbelief was, by that time, completely suspended. The Matrix had drawn me all the way in. I had swallowed the red pill.My next fear is that the following chapters will let me down -- I remember them being good enough, but not on the same level as the trilogy's first entry. And I should probably stop here, satisfied that the movie I loved as a teenager did not disappoint me as an adult. But it's too late for me now. I'm hooked on the world of The Matrix once again, and I want to spend as much time there as I can.",The Matrix

If you're an action movie fan you'll still love this movie. The Matrix, not only has razzle and dazzle for the viewer's eyes, but plenty to chew on for the viewer's mind as well. There's a lot of philosophy brought into this movie that left me more than just pleased. This movie is almost seamless (is perfection ever achieved in art... especially in the medium of cinema?) with the technical aspects, story and underlining philosophical social political implications that are brought to the table. This movie has made it's deep footprint on cinema, and if you've ever been curious as to why that is, you will not be disappointed when you discover The Matrix. Note: you do not have to watch the sequels to be more satisfied with the original. In fact the original stands on its own two feet better than it does with the help of its successors.

1937,ino_mart,Rather good,7,8 September 2006,"Normally I do not like action movies with many scenes that are impossible in real life.In this movie it is acceptable as it is all going on in a virtual world. Neo and co are like ""computer viruses"" that are breaking into the system.Although: Dialing in with a regular phone seems a bit odd to me. Of course Broadband and ADSL connections were not usual to use by the common public in the time the movie was made (and it existence was not known well). The idea that the injuries you get in the virtual world ""gets over"" to the real world is good (otherwise all battery-men in the real world will only die due to aging). But it does not explain why Neo arises at the end of the movie. If the Matrix-guards are able to change building from one moment to another, why do they only use guns to kill people? They must be able to change other things too (like eg water flood, sickness, ...). But I must say if they did that, the movie would be too complex.",The Matrix

Now Morpheus takes neo to a training programs where he learns all this cool fighting styles. After that Morpheus takes neo to the oricel. But when they have left her agents come and they have to escape. There is one of the guys who escapes but he is a traitor and kills the guy who lets them in and out of the matrix.

Having said that, it is definitely not perfect.
01. Keanu Reeves's performance is underwhelming and at times comically bad. There's a great video on YouTube called 'Keanu Reeves acting badly' that highlights this. I have nothing against the guy, but he isn't a good actor. Will Smith was originally offered the role, and I think he would have done a much better job.
02. Some of the dialogue isn't realistic and is kind of...cringey. E.g. when Neo flips agent Smith off near the start of the film.
03. Most of the special effects hold up to today, but some don't and are laughable, but to be honest this doesn't affect my opinion of the film, just don't expect the effects to be perfect.I would give it a 10/10 if not for some of the dialogue and Keanu Reeves's acting.

So, its a very intelligent piece of art-work which catches the eye of the class as well as the mass.The movie isn't just another sci-fi flick with a bunch of cool action sequences. There is a lot of research behind the story. The writer-director duo has made sure it stays in the minds of the people till Armageddon.

It's a movie of a genre which doesn't ask much from the actors. It has more of a technical inclination. Keanu Reeves was perfect as the soft-spoken messiah. Carrie-Anne Moss was mesmerizing as the beautiful love-interest of Neo. Laurence Fishburne demanded respect as the inspiring leader. Hugo Weaving was brilliant as the elegant Agent Smith. All other characters did total justice to their respective roles.Considering all the technical aspects of the movie, it is no less than a pioneering effort. Yuen Wo Ping is the undisputed champion of action choreography and he proves it once again with his work in 'The Matrix'. Bill Pope's perfect cinematography is a good lesson for any upcoming cinematographer. The SFX team of the movie is one to look up to considering their usage of bullet-time technology. The editing, music and set design are highly praiseworthy.To end it, I'd say that if there is one movie in your life which you would not want to miss, it is 'The Matrix'. Even if the conceptual dialogues and philosophical aspects are out of your reach, you'd be more than happy to witness the sheer brilliance of technology. Its the best there is.

1951,MyLightie,"""What is the Matrix"", an overrated movie, thats all",8,6 April 2002,"The Matrix was a very good, original film, but thats all. People go on by saying that it is an ""absolute classic"" ""one of the greatest films ever"" ""unbeatable"". Its all just a lot of undeserved praise. People took the film too seriously - leading to the formation of cult groups on the net and all over the world.I recommend that people watch this movie, bearing in mind that it is just a movie. If you want to watch some truly ""amazing"", original films, consider The Usual Suspects, Fight Club and Gattaca.8/10",The Matrix
1952,p_h_a_r_o_a_h_e,"The Matrix is pretty good, but overrated.",2,28 August 2008,"This is a very good movie. Visually, The Matrix is pretty much at the top of the Sci-Fi genre. The plot is solid, Keanu Reeves doesn't suck, and it's a unique film.But, why is it overrated? Just because I said the acting doesn't suck does not mean that it's particularly good. This movie is good, but it's certainly not in the top 100 films of all time. There are much better movies out there that rely on clever story telling, have better actors, and there are some with equally as cool visuals. If you know what to look for, the plot is pretty predictable. All of the foreshadowing in this movie insults your intelligence rather than adding to the tension. Also, the slow motion sequences become stupid after watching the movie a couple of times, and they are in an abundance.I used to be a fan of this movie, but once I saw Dark City I realized how much room for improvement there truly was.",The Matrix
1953,ephestione,Fav movie of my whole collection,10,27 April 2002,"I had the luck to watch it in english, Morpheus voice is what gives you the feeling of ""I know it all, just listen to me""; the italian dub is somewhat horrible instead.Yet, the REAL reason I liked the movie really very much is it's ""fidelity"" to the real thing: the theme of AI and technologic progress has been abused during all the cinematographic history, but this story includes it in a fashionable and belieable way. You never find yourself telling ""Hey c'mon, this is impossible to happen"", at least you can raise up some doubts about the ""energy cycle"" thing explained by Morpheus.The costumes are most original; black is a trendy color, sure, but the long raincoats, the cool sunglasses, and the military boots combination makes up a sort of ""brand"" of the movie.**ATTENTION: SPOILER FOLLOWS**Example of what I am telling above about the credibility: we are in the 2099 in the movie: mankind obscured the sky during the war against the intelligent machines, to prevent them using the solar energy as power supply; big mistake I say: no sun, no water cycle, no chlorophillian synthesis, no basis for the feeding chain... you need to artificially lighten the plants. How? Using the supposedly already depleted combustble sources? Machine have taken up the energy production after winning the war... why didn't they choose atomic fusion? Can it be possible that in 100 years we weren't able to find a way to contan that reaction? They choose humans instead, and use them as batteries fooling them about the real life and making them falsely ""happy"" to be more efficient. Hey, the movie wouldn't have seen the light if it weren't for this escamotage, we agree. But then again: how is it possible to feed humans with their own deads? You cannot reuse the old to power up the new, expecting there is a 100% effectiveness. Some energy is lost during the process, thus being the remnant insufficient to supply the whole system.This is the ""only"" thing really messed up in the (still the best for me) movie: the energy cycle.",The Matrix
1954,Anaximenes,Philosophy of the Matrix,10,21 June 2002,"SPOILER ALERT.  I love the great action, the look of the film, the sound, the music, the detail, the DVD commentaries, and certain particularly fabulous scenes of the Matrix.  But after that, I love the philosophy and theology built into it.  Do a web search for Matrix and philosophy and you will find that several philosophy teachers use it in courses.  Some even have a course something like Philosophy in the Matrix.
For those of you who have had an Introduction to Philosophy course, you will find in the Matrix (though perhaps unintended) references/parallels to Berkeley's rejection of matter, Plato's allegory of the cave, etc.  Also, The Matrix Revisited DVD says that there will be much more philosophy in the next two films.There is also, of course, a very strong messianic storyline.  But notice that Trinity (God) is the one who raises Neo (the One) from the dead. After he is resurrected, he is all powerful and is able to see things for what they truly are.  The enemy thought he was defeating the One by killing him, but that only provided him an opportunity to win the war.  Further, Zion (commonly used in Judaeo/Christian literature metaphorically for heaven) is the ideal place, the oasis for human beings.There is more to it than this, but consider watching The Matrix again with these thoughts in mind.",The Matrix
1955,inago,An Important Philosophical Allegory,8,30 November 2007,"The Matrix is really a bit of ""Plato's Allegory of the Cave"" or the original Chinese ""Frog in a Well"" allegory. It centers mostly upon the more Buddhist idea of Two Truths, whereby the conventional reality that we live in is often shaped by our own prejudices, fears and insecurities. Perhaps there is also a touch of modern Situationalist Philosophy: ""life is a spectacle"" mostly contrived by the status quo, or powers-at-be and marketing forces around us.I must admit I am surprised by the number of negative ratings of this movie. A bit over- rated, yes; but the movie hardly falls into the category of 1 to 4 star reckless, low-budget movies (such as Manos; The Hands of Fate) that have to try to be so bad.Philosophical messages are best conveyed as allegories. This movie is a simple, yet important, allegory stretched out over 2 hours with enough basic symbolism, special affects and action to appeal to almost all audiences. The movie is designed to be thought provoking, and touches upon basic philosophical questions that are rarely addressed in modern movies. I have to wonder if audiences are somehow offended by the intent of the movie, or if audiences are simply so stuck in Plato's cave, the bottom of a well, so stuck in ""the Matrix"" as to totally miss it.",The Matrix
1956,Count_Dooku,A really good movie with plenty of action,10,22 May 2002,"I must have watched this movie about 15 times, and each time it only gets better.

This is a brilliant movie with plenty of action and acting talent.",The Matrix
1957,gross4eva,SO OVER-RATED!!,1,27 June 2002,"This is a terrible movie and I don't know how it ever got to be so successful.  Its no wonder that all the computer nerds who sit around and rank movies on IMDB would give the Matrix a high score, but if you disregard the hoopla, you will see that its nothing more than a bunch of noise sometimes interrupted by bland lines from Keanu (""am I the One?"").  I hate this movie!!!",The Matrix
1958,keels84,Fantastic,10,31 August 2002,"I have so many favourites, but 'Matrix' has to top them all.

Don't let me down.",The Matrix
1959,lrahm,Wonderful! Nice-looking criticism to the System,10,16 October 2002,"Right now my top movie of all time.It may change, but this really is a good one! It's very well done. Everything just looks perfect, and is well coordinated. The  actors is also doing good, and I can't really say anything negative about it,  except may be some scientific things seems a bit far-fetched... Anyhow I think this is a really good way of criticise the modern system of today,  where we don't see that we just control their self in a system where people can  not be free.  Where the machines take better care of the environment (isn't that  sick?), and so on... The only thing we have to do is: FREE YOUR MIND!",The Matrix
1960,volleyball,The Matrix compared to the Bible,9,3 December 2002,"I believe there are lots of similarities between The Matrix and The Bible.  First of all characters from the Matrix are similar to people from the Bible.  Neo is like Jesus, Morpheus is like John the Baptist and Cypher is like Judas. Both Neo and Jesus were born into the world and then born again, Neo from that red goop, and Jesus after he was baptised.  Also the both are resurrected Jesus 3 days after he died on the cross and Neo, after he was shot numerous times by agent Smith.  Cypher also betrays Neo like Judas did to Jesus all though they both new the truth. In the Matrix the characters are in the world(the matrix) but not of it, just like Christians should be in the world but not of it. There are also many other biblical references in the matrix like the verse Mark 3:11 inscribed on the plate which has the name of ship The Nebuchadnezer.  Also in the beginning of the movie the man that comes to Neo's door calls him his own personal ""Jesus Christ"". This is at least how I interpret it, and i'm sure I could find more comparisons by watching the movie again.",The Matrix
1961,andr31,a chef d'oeuvre without any doubt,10,12 December 2002,"The matrix has marked a milestone for cinematography. Not only the story is brilliant, but also the direction is great and the movie makes your andrenaline level raise.The Matrix was the pioneer of movies when talking of ""is this the real truth?""",The Matrix
1962,Andrew_Greenbay,Almost underrated,9,18 January 2003,"I have to say that I've loved this movie from the first time I saw it, and I've seen it several times. But, the last time I saw it, a few days ago, I actually liked it even more(don't know how that happens). I really thought about the script, and realized that it's truly magnificent. The movie is so incredibly original. I might nowadays be tired of the ""Matrix-effects"" that appears in almost every single action movie made nowadays, but you have to remember that it was Matrix that started these beautiful ""freeze-sequences"" and that everybody loved them, otherwise they wouldn't have been imitated by so many other movies. And the best thing of all in this movie is the ""WHAT!! HOW INCREDIBLY SMART!!!""-scenes when you realize what the Matrix really is. I mean nobody could ever guess what the Matrix was until you were shown. For those of you who's seen it, you've got to admit you were stunned when you saw what the matrix really was. If you take some time to think about it, it seems like a thing that actually can occur in the future. The movie is really fast paced, and sometimes it gets a little too much. It's almost too ""cool"" but I mean they wanted to make a comic-like cool movie and really succeeded in those aspects, though for some people it just gets too much. Anyways it's a stunning movie, and I'd even advice it to those who dislike action-movies because the Matrix is very well written, and it's based on a very interesting thought the Wachowski-brothers came up with. Mostly for the originality I'll give it 9/10. Can't really tell if I think it's a masterpiece or not, but It's certainly not far from it.",The Matrix
1963,slerby,not only is the acting awful,1,21 May 2003,"the movie's plot, storyline among most other things are some of the worst I've seen in a movie in a long time. I wouldn't pay 10 cents to see it again. the only thing about it that was remotely ok was a few action sequences. Even now those sequences have been surpassed by many other movies.  It certainly wasn't a standard precedent for movies of that nature and the way they were produced or filmed.",The Matrix
1964,bringonthelucie,An excellent sci-fi/action film,10,25 November 2003,"The Matrix was a film i did not get to see until much after its theatrical release, after hearing excellent things about i checked it out and liked it a great deal.The Matrix has a lot of little homages to many other sci-fi films, but still the plot remains interesting and somewhat unique, the film is also very interesting and entertaining with incredible visual effects. The film is only watered down by some bad performances, specially from Reeve's part and some bad dialouge, but no film is perfect and this film isnt ruined by these flaws.Highly recommended. 9/10",The Matrix
1965,FelixVanNorden,A movie about FX,8,6 June 2003,"The more I watch this movie, the less I appreciate it.The first time I watched it I was very impressed: the FX had hidden the rudimentary semi-intellectual plot from my eyes.But now I know better. The matrix isn't about philosophy and stuff, it's about action and FX!!8 out of 10",The Matrix
1966,The_Protagonist,"Excellent film, deserves a standing ovation",10,6 April 2003,"This hugely influential film depicts the life of a man named Thomas A. Anderson (Neo). He lives two lives, one being that of a computer programmer for a major company. The other life is spent committing crimes of all kinds on his computer. His life is turned up and over when news of the world being a fake- a computer programme that uses the human body to give energy to AI (watch the film to completely understand (its very interesting)). After being released from this world by a group of people seeking ""the One"", living on a hovercraft with some obscure name. Neo is trained and taught to fight and survive in the world of the Matrix. Many supremely exiting action scenes follow that will have your mouth gaping and your eyes glistening in awe. This film was ground breaking in its use of ""bullet time"" and ""Japan-imation"". its only downfall, that I can see, and no doubt many people would disagree with me, would be on the casting of Keanu reeves as the lead role, and though it is easily his greatest role and the performance of his life, i cant help feeling that another actor would have been more suitable (I'm not entirely sure who this other actor is), but on past performance, how the Wachowski brothers came up with the star of such tosh as ""chain reaction"" and ""speed"" I shall never know. Never the less, this is definitely one of my favourite films of all time and deserves to be a lot higher up in the rankings of ""top 250 films"" than it currently is",The Matrix
1967,adrnathms,An original!,8,12 April 2003,"It's not the acting that makes this movie good (obviously) but the concept itself.  Definitely an original.  The movie puts you in your head and really makes you think.In addition, the effects are awesome and have set a standard.  Great movie when you're in the mood for more action, less reality, which we all need at one point or another.LOVED IT!",The Matrix
1968,The_1,Opens Your Mind,10,4 May 2003,"Even before The Matrix was released 1999, most of the concepts and ideals presented by the movie were already floating around in my mind. I, like Neo, had many questions and doubts about the world we live in. Most of the time, things just don't add-up and it always seemed to me that there was something much bigger than Mother Nature that was influencing, or perhaps controlling, the universe. Being a Catholic, I understand that this higher force is, of course, God. But also being someone who is prone to outlandish theories and conspiracies, I enjoy pondering on the fact that what IF there were something else out there, controlling the System, our minds and, more importantly, our fate.When I saw The Matrix in cinemas in 1999, nothing really made sense. It was like getting knocked-out after one round with Tyson and remaining in shock for what seemed like days afterwards. It wasn't until the DVD came out later that year that I slowly began to realise the significance and deeply personal meaning this movie meant to me. It took perhaps a dozen additional viewings to fully understand what The Matrix was fully about, and still, every time I continue to watch it, I learn something new.This movie is not your average cheesey, nerdy sci-fi flick. Despite how ground-breaking the special and visual effects were, they are dull in comparison to the concepts and ideals brought up. The Wachowski brothers, who are the directors, are Catholics (I presume) and to me, this movie is like their expression of their faith to the world. The most important line in the movie is ""Free Your Mind"". Indeed, the majority of the world's population has their mind locked-up in rusty, uninspirational cages, perhaps explaining why so many people always seem to settle less for than what they are truly entitled to. The history of the world has taken it's toll and people don't know any better than to just jump on the bandwagon and fall victim to the routine of civilisation. People are no longer curious, nor driven, nor innocent enough to believe in something so much stronger than their environment: themselves.This movie attemtps to show people that all is not what it seems. The world is a solid, unalterable place; the human mind is completely at odds with it. People don't realise the power they have. Though the world isn't changeable, the power their minds have can change how they view the world, thus making it something unique in the eyes of each and every human being.A person should search within themselves to find their strengths and use those strengths to contribute something to humanity. Every single person was born with a gift, completely unique to the billions of other people on earth. No matter what it is, it is invaluable in playing an important role in the progression of our future.Neo's gift is the ability to free the human race. The movie is about self-belief. My belief is that there is a little Neo in all of us.",The Matrix
1969,chris-m-tew,Good food for thought for the oxygen starved pseudo-intellectuals out there,3,31 December 2011,"It was truly bizarre seeing millions of stupid people who literally disliked intellectual pursuits suddenly become enlightened geniuses practically overnight...This film had an immense effect on the population and it should be remembered for that, not for being a good film, which it is not.The plot: Let me see... Have you ever heard of a thing called history? Yes, it is a bunch of things that have already happened ,things in history are already ""old hat"". This film takes one of the most basic ideas from history, the idea that what we perceive as reality might not actually be what we think it is. Yeah, that's deep, right? Yes, kind of deep but not too deep, we don't want to scare anyone off now do we? This film takes this idea and runs with it, it is the whole film, without it it would just be a bunch of bondage enthusiasts running around like weirdos. It takes something that is already a major cliché and beats it so hard into the ground that it comes out in China and even they don't want it because they practically invented it to begin with! This old, yawn-inducing idea from ancient history is portrayed as cutting edge thought that the Wankoffski brothers came up with because they are mad geniuses and the whole aim of the film is to make the viewer buy more of their films by making the viewer feel like an intellectual.The acting: Have you ever seen what happens when people pat each other on the back so much that nobody stops to say ""Hey! Wait a minute, this is ridiculous!""? Well that is what Hollywood is missing, that guy to tell people where the line is drawn. This film is ridiculous, along with the boring old ""deep"" plot (with aliens!!!) the actors are like a bunch of coke-heads running around practically ejaculating on each other the whole time. It is scary stuff but it is what millions of people expect to see. Are these millions of people intelligent, tasteful people? No, they are not but they are who this film is for. The grunts, the social whores, the mind numbing dinner guest who only talks about cars, the McDonald's employee who HASN'T got a college education... Nobody else could take this acting seriously.The special effects: Wow, when this film came out the effects were amazing and even though it is void of any merit outside of the effects, they should be remembered for being very impressive. It's just a shame that there wasn't a single scene where these effects weren't rammed down your throat, making you choke on them. This could have been to distract the feeble-minded from the other points above.Well, there's my ""review"", I loathe this film and I loathe even more the pseudo-intellectuals it created out of millions of complete and utter morons. How so many people can have so little to say and to say it so loudly is just staggering... I give it 3/10.",The Matrix
1970,shantaram,Little Buddha Conquers The Matrix,10,24 June 2003,"Minor spoilers herein.Never before have I seen a movie so influenced with buddhism (or vedanta for that matter). Keanu's role in Little Buddha was almost further from oriental mysticism than this one. Well, almost.Here, Reeves portrays Neo, the Buddha (or Christ for that matter) of the machine ruled world of the near future. Yet the story works on multiple levels. It is the stuff mythology is made of. As in such ancient texts as Ramayana of India or Jesus' Sermont on the Mount, both the exoteric as well as esoteric explanations are possible.My personal view of the esoteric text is such: Neo gets the awakening when he's chosen to 'destroy' the Matrix. Matrix is a concept close to Maya of Buddhism and Vedanta. The illusion that what is perceived by the senses is reality. Yet it is not so. However this has to be experienced in person. Morpheus, Neo's Teacher (Guru), is close, but not quite there. He feels Neo is the One. The Oracle feels that Neo is also close but may have to continue his quest for Reality in his next life. Yet the kiss (obvious symbol of Love), given to him by Trinity, produces Neo's Nirvana, which signifies the end of a Matrix ruled, enslaved mind. The agents of the Matrix, which IMHO symbolize the minds inner demons - all the thoughts that bind the mind into seemingly endless slavery, are hereafter helpless and must fall ultimately, conquered by the strength of the Enlightened One. ...But can be also enjoyed simply as a great combination of Kung Fu and Sci-Fi. :)",The Matrix
1971,hoochiemoochie,I can't even explain how horrible this movie is,8,30 July 2003,"Maybe it's not that bad, but what makes it all the worse is how highly acclaimed it is. I had to keep slapping myself to stat awake during this movie. The storyline for this movie is sooooo modern and overplayed. This is in a way just a hyped up and sci-fi version of the truman show. I will never understand how this movie got to be soooo well liked. This is one of the only movies that everybody seems to disagree with me on. So if you're wondering why i'm writing this it's just to prove anybody wrong who thinks that there is nobody who hates this movie because i do. Also if you're a fellow matrix hater then i feel you're pain especially this year now that 2 of them are coming out at the same time practically. I'm just glad the second one failed moneywise so that hopefully the third one will get hardly any money and all this talk about the future Star Wars trilogy will be thrown out the window.",The Matrix
1972,n-rouillard,A true concept movie,9,8 July 2003,"People often forget that Science Fiction does not have to take place in the future, or to involve fantastic weaponry or special effects. All it needs is to work with a conceivably possible concept in a ""what if"" scenario (Hence the rather excellent ""Fatherland"" is Science Fiction despite being set in the past)This movie is all about concept. It asks many questions behind the seemingly pseudo philosophical ""What is the Matrix?"" questioning the nature of reality; is reality what we perceive it to be, and if not, does our perception not make it real? destiny, and fate (fate and destiny are not the same thing. Fate is what will happen, and destiny is what you will do) Of course, the mind bending visuals did their part in selling this to the audience.This movie has it all; strong plot, fine cast performances, and one hell of a visual ride. Few will go away disappointed from this, and at the very least you'll look around you and notice things you might have missed before.Definitely recommended viewing.

It is the perfect mixture of action, sci-fi, thrill and philosophy, so it is something the motion pictures did not show earlier on. John Gaeta made the most incredible visual effects ever, especially the ""Bullet Time"". The Cast is just perfect. Keanu Reeves, Carrie-Anne Moss, Lawrence Fishburne and Hugo Weaving express those cool and wild characters of the movie. And this question, ""What is the Matrix?"", that opens us this new world, this whole matrix motion picture revolution. It is awesome. The Wachowski brothers made a movie full of perfection and details you cannot find by watching it once or twice. I saw the movie several times (8 times to be exact), and every time I see new details, especially when you saw the whole trilogy it is good to see the first one again, then the second again, and finally the third, because only then you will understand some links that otherwise would be hidden. To understand the whole Matrix World it is also recommended to use all the other helps the Wachowski Brothers give you, like the Animatrix, the game Enter The Matrix or the comics. It is a deep hole, and you need to follow the rabbit, if you want to be able to rate this movie. I think, that I have understood the most things of the matrix, but there are still some things that are hidden, especially in the last part of the trilogy, where many questions remain open.

But I bet they cant.A truly magnificent cast, with the likes of Keanu Reeves, Laurence Fishburne, Carrie Anne-Moss and Joe Pantoliano, not to mention the superb Hugo Weaving as Agent Smith.And the expertise of the Wachowski brothers in directing a new era of computer animated graphics is second to none.A[art from the Godfather, possibly one of my all time favourite films. 10/10!",The Matrix

Rent the DVD, or better yet the Blue-Ray and watch it! The plot is fast and comes crashing down on the unsuspecting viewer from the very beginning. The music is excellent and matches the pace of the movie. Plus the special effects (considering the film was released in 1999) created a school of their own!

Not many movies can boast that.The bar has been raised to a new level in sci-fi.

1979,MagusYanam,Philosophical drama meets science fiction (again),10,23 November 2004,"The best science fiction films always seem to have solid groundings inphilosophy. Star Trek is the classic example, and Star Wars also ventures into some philosophical grounds. The Matrix follows that tradition, and yet it still manages to be fresh.Thomas Anderson is your average decent person who goes to work, pays histaxes and helps his landlady take out the garbage. Yet he dreams. He dreams sometimes so vividly that the dreams become almost real. He is confronted by mysterious hackers named Morpheus and Trinity who tell him that what seemsreal to him is in fact little more than an illusion - and they free him into a post- apocalyptic world in which machines are in complete control, harvestinghumans as power sources while keeping them sedate with the illusion of theMatrix. And he finds himself, along with the few free humans there are, charged with the task of freeing those still trapped inside the illusion.Not a new idea, to be sure. The notion that all we see and feel is an illusion dates back to Shakyamuni Buddha. But the film is nevertheless engrossing and edgy, even when produced on such a limited budget. It incorporates specialeffects that give it almost an anime-like feel (slow-motion and changingperspective) without making it seem tacky, and gives rise to what is sure tobecome one of the most memorable action scenes in the history of sciencefiction films. The acting by Keanu Reeves, Laurence Fishburne and CarrieAnne Moss is spectacular in some areas though overwrought in others (thefilm's only drawback). Overall, this movie gets a 9/10.",The Matrix

Not here to second guess what the writer/director's philosophy or what they're trying to point out with this movie, but, at least, together with another movie they also made, Cloud Atlas, they're two of the people who really know what's going on in this ""Real World"". This ""Real World"", in fact, is a Matrix, we're all souls incarnating here to experience, and we all come from this ""ONE"", the consciousness, regardless different religions. Unfortunately Cloud Atlas went away from the basic rule of story telling, show don't tell, the mini stories of different character's ""fate"" not justify what they're telling, the Oneness and how we are all connected, at all, and it sank in the box office. Hopefully the brothers will bring more movies like The Matrix, with messages that inspire the audience Personally, the Matrix made me realize the incarnation, it was a mile stone on my re-awakening journey of putting all puzzles together and found God. Thank you very much, the movie The Matrix.",The Matrix
1981,CopperFrightful,Overrated and brimming with convenience,1,23 May 2005,"I didn't like The Matrix. I thought it was an alright movie until I saw it again, then it just got to be annoying. I know only pseudo-intellectuals use this term, but it was pseudo-intellectual. I thought the characters were wooden, the dialogue was pretty bad, and it was all too convenient for me. When a character skips over the growth and learning process because they just downloaded the skills, like flying a helicopter or learning kung fu, I see that as a flaw in the story and writing. Then where does it stop? I was expecting a character to actually say, ""Well...yeah...I know how because I uh...I downloaded a...program."" Nobody's fooling me with the whole ""it's about computers, they can do that"" bit. Save it for the 13-year-olds that ""understand"" the plot. There are smarter and more creative ways of conveying this idea. I hated the fight scenes as well. CGI on almost every fight, especially when everything looks like a game later does not mean its good. Far from it.",The Matrix
1982,vmenv,Great film - great story,9,4 January 2005,"What makes science fiction good? Its the story. Not knowing where its going. Being surprised - relating it to the life we live. This is why the Matrix is so good. This is why Matrix 2 and 3 were so disappointing. This story could have evolved to so many places and yet instead became a comment that has been made before and better in old Star Trek episodes on television. The idea of life being only a reflection of reality was lost on the old man vs. machine/good or evil question we've seen again and again (Minority Report, Bicentenial Man, AI, need I go on?) What made the Matrix so good was not the story about the machines but about Neo - the chosen one - prophecy fulfilled - the savior of mankind. Now there's a story to make you think. Can we go back and make Matrix 2 & 3 and develop that idea?",The Matrix

But Dark City is amazingly better. This one is about to be just as good as Dark City, but instead of plot, they made it into action. Dark City only has two action sequences. The action is very stylized and better than most though. Despite not being my favorite it blew my mind. I believe that it should have taken the path of Dark City and ended it with something conclusive. I still want to see the sequels. Its a darn shame that it went with the style over substance at the end.79%",The Matrix
1984,cyrusaazam,Excellent Sci-Fi!,10,19 November 2013,"The Matrix is still one of the greatest science fiction movies of all time and it changed that genre of movies forever after it by being so far ahead of the game with the visual effects it used and also it had great story telling. Bullet time was brought about in a big way in this movie and it can be taken for granted now but it is hard to remember how huge and groundbreaking it was when this movie came out, it looked amazing and seemed like magic! The fact that it seems old now is due to the fact everyone uses it all the time now and the reason they do that is because it was so damn good! The acting in the movie is great with a very good job done casting the movie, one of the only movies I can stand Keanu Reeves in as he is cast perfectly in a role that suits him, very good at doing the fight scenes too, all of the fight scenes in this movie are a cut above the rest, with some really all-time great scenes in this film. Action, great story, great effects, good acting, groundbreaking and unique, it all adds up to a perfect sci fi movie experience!",The Matrix
1985,sawaat,My Favorite Movie Of All Time,9,4 April 2014,"Visually entertaining, thought-provoking and extremely well executed. The Matrix has been on the top of my favorite films list for quite a few years. I've heard a lot of people say it hasn't aged well, and I have to strongly disagree and say that this movie was ahead of it's time, making now (2014) a perfect time to watch it! While it's sequels struggle to conduct a clear plot and fumbles around with countless loopholes in logic, the original film doesn't have a single story mistake (at least as far as I can think of!) and manages to follow through with intelligence and cleverness. Style! Did I mention this movie has style? In more ways than one. Not to mention a dozen pop culture references, a solid cast, and unforgettable special effects. The whole movie is laced with dialogue that becomes a brain game for the audience, forcing them to think and ponder about whether or not their own world is real or not. I know when I first watched it, I started to get a bit paranoid! The overall atmosphere of the film is one of awakening to your surroundings, the struggle between what people tell you to feel, and what you truly feel. Rebellion, the challenging of authority, being creative and the survival of human life. Overall, the film is basically one big action packed, mentally stimulating and gratifying present wrapped with a bow that is trying to say in the biggest way possible: You can do anything if you believe...""Don't think you are, know you are"" - Morpheus",The Matrix
1986,elliott_hudson,Classic no doubt.,10,3 March 2005,"This movie is so good. I don't know where to start but let's see when I first saw it I didn't know much about it. I knew it was futuristic and had cool special effects. I didn't know the effects were to that extent and I also didn't know who was starring in the film. So I went into it thinking I'm gonna watch and see. And what did I see something that I haven't stopped watching to this day. I ended up knowing some of the cast Keanu Reeves, Laurence Fishbourne and Joe P. Carrie-Anne Moss was a nice surprise and the script is addictive. The kung-fu is awesome and the shootouts are everything video games are made of. All in all this might be my favorite movie to date.",The Matrix

I would recommend seeing this one.I think that without Keanu Reeves being Neo, this movie wouldn't have been as good. He really brought the feel of the character to the movie.The 'Bullet Time' was a ground breaking new special effect, after this movie i couldn't believe how many other movies decided to rip it off.One of my favorite movies, and will probably be for a long time.",The Matrix

It is profoundly spiritual, and profoundly practical. The story is so powerful because it connects with humans in the heart of our struggle. Things are not as they seem-there is more to life than what we see. There is something happening behind the scenes. We are more than we know. We must search for answers, or be satisfied by giving in and giving up and blending in with the system.This movie and story is a profound narrative of a greater reality we are all a part of, and really gets you thinking if you'll let it. Plus, the acting, action, characters, and execution are highly effective to draw you in and help you live it out as you are watching it. I'm very grateful for this movie.

Virtual reality is currently been substituted by news media fallacies.Yet we will someday wake up to a very similar world than Matrix.

1991,MaltinsBeard,"Nice effects and sound, average (STOLEN!) movie, 7",7,16 June 2005,"I give this a seven because so many people (especially fan boys and star wars fanatics or the ordinary children) tend to grow up and see this as their new religion, as I happened to see up close and way too personal with people all around me.This is not a great movie!!!!Depth: If you think the matrix is the fulcrum of philosophy, I think you should never be allowed to read any other book than Bob the Builder builds a house. If any of you who have seen the Matrix, have also seen the totally superior Dark city or Ghost in the shell and understood the story, you will hopefully know what I mean. Those films posses depth, as every scene has a story to tell, a point to clear out. I leave the exploring of those 2 films (you have to watch them more than once) to you all. In the matrix this is not the case. The movie is base. It's simple storytelling ground is a bad soil for the pretense it gives by shrouding itself in mystery and greater questions of society/humanity. It's not a bad movie! Hell no, I enjoy it a lot, but it remains just an action flick with a nicer story than most action films, say Soldier, hehe. This is not a brilliantly designed film though. It is a great action film and it's IMDb score can only be justified in that sense, but never in a way in which people say that it is an intelligent movie. A film that has 50% of it's screen time having people fighting kung fu and shooting bullets has a really hard time to fill the other half with challenging matter, if you understand what I mean.so, lets talk film:Originality: Most of it is stolen, so less points for that originality thing anyway, but, better stolen right then created poorly. The plot: basic, but interesting with a nice open end, which is not put to good use as we all would find out later with the horribly flat and mind-degrading sequels The acting: Keanu defines cardboard pinnochio's on strings, no surprises there, Moss is not put to use, Fishburne is cool... his simple role requires him to have only 2 expressions (not his fault), Weaving is good for he is the only character with interesting lines and a little depth and puts that to good use. The graphics: Very good, great use of special effects some sets literally stolen from dark city. Check green intro in Ghost in the shell for more info on how to steal ideas as well. (No, the green alphabet is not an homage, trust me) The camera work: Apart from the new world shaking bullet time technique, actually quite basic. Some camera angles literally stolen from dark city. Nice use of the then still new digital camera filters.Well, that's all actually. It's more just a call to the mostly teen audience (and the few elder retards) to see other (better) movies as well. If you just like action films I suggest you stick with those, no offence, I like action movies too, but don't confuse the films with depth with action movies with pretences.",The Matrix

It has good SGI especially for that time. Even people who don t like action movies can still enjoy it because of its riddles. My only flaw is with characters choices maybe, there were few of those.

1999,allenquanobi,"Original and great, but with one important flaw",8,19 November 2017,"Released in a time of ground-breaking CGI advancements, the Matrix notched itself above the rest of the competition in terms of film- making. Visually stunning, thought-provoking, and fun, The Matrix is a near-perfect film for any sci-fi fan or any movie fan. Let's start with the plot and writing. The plot revolves around a hacker named Thomas Anderson who acts as a somewhat ill- explained hacker named Neo by night. One night, he gets contacted by a mysterious internet group led by the omniscient Morpheus. One step leads to another, and Neo, ""much like Alice"" goes tumbling down the rabbit- hole, leading to a world-changing (quite literally in this sense) discovery that will cause him to question his very own existence. Right from the start, the plot hooks you, making the viewers themselves feel like Neo, questioning their own existence. Interwoven with the thought of questioning one's own existence, is a religion intertextuality with Neo and Christianity, making the depth of the film felt even more. The writing is fantastic and philosophical, particularly with the dialogue between Neo and Morpheus. It eclipses in the scene with the Oracle and the famous line ""There is no spoon"", which is where the movie takes a sharp turn. For about ¾ of the movie, I was locked into the originality of the plot and storytelling. However, in the film's final act, specifically around (spoilers) an incredulous scene involving a lobby, the movie collapses onto itself with the most unrealistic and bombastic endings that one could describe as Michael Bay-esque. The final half hour of the movie, while entertaining with fight sequences and explosions, seems pulled out of a video game. You don't feel that the characters are in any real danger at this point, and it all leads to the ending, which is satisfying, but left a sour taste in my mouth because of how unoriginal and cliché it is compared to the rest of the movie. Despite the problems I had with some of the plot, the film- making is amazing. Never before has a film influenced future movies as the Matrix did. With its famous bullet-time sequence, and choreographed fight scenes, the Matrix set an industry standard that few films have accomplished or eclipsed since then. Finally, let's talk about the acting. The performances are mostly perfect for their characters. Fishburne's enigmatic performance as the audience's guide into the world and Weaving's subdued acting as the monotone and (spoiler) robotic antagonist. However, the one that confuses me is Reeve's performance as Neo. One could argue that due to Neo's character of being Zen-like and unknowing, Reeves is the perfect actor for this role. However, I think any actor of the same age as Reeves could play Neo and the character would have been realized the same.Overall, The Matrix is groundbreaking in both film-making, world-building, and storytelling, a must-watch for any movie-goer. However, the ending, while satisfying to most audiences, will disappoint those who would expect something different and bold from a truly original movie.",The Matrix
2000,oskhen,Hate/love - Hugo Weaving for ever,7,4 December 2005,"I've quickly seen through some of the comments and marks gain to the Matrix on this page, and I think it must be because of all the hype that people seem to either worship or hate it. For me it has been a little bit too long since I saw it, but remember that I liked it. Okay, it's not perfect, but got good action sequences and message that may not be extremely deep, fantastic or intelligent, but at least it got one, and it's not a bad one.Yes, it is a rather good and entertaining movie, even though there must be little doubt that the effects have done much to its rumour. The effects are much of the film, but no too much. It does have some brain too.To me it has been a really influential movie, mainly because of one of the absolutely coolest bad guys in the history of movies. Hugo Weaving's agent Smith is way up there among Jack Nickolson's Joker and Darth Vader. He really became one of my top favourite actors only because of this movie. I don't care very much about the roles of Keanu Reeves, Laurence Fishburne or that gal-person, and I really don't why so many people do - Hugo Weaving is the really interesting character here. I see him way to rarely, and he was a bit of a disappointment in LOTR.Loved to read that he's going to play in V for Vendetta (why care about that bimbo then?), but it's a bit too bad that he's going to wear a mask.

Methinks, to completely comprehend the concept a viewer has to see it at least four or five times.Great movie, without a doubt.

The main protagonist is a hacker named 'Neo' played by Keanu Reeves and the film follows Neo and the team are the main rebellion against the antagonist 'Agent Smith' played by Elrond from Lord of the Rings. This film is futuristic and innovative. The film created technology called 'bullet time'. This is where loads of cameras are panned around a shot capturing frames in all angles. It gives the viewer a new visual perspective detaching the time and space from the camera. This technology is now used in many video games for example.

2008,Hannahlfunnell,Well.... what is it?,10,3 May 2006,"The matrix has to be seen to be understood, and you can't multi-task when you watch it. Apart from anything else, if your doing something like cooking or ironing you'll find that you've burnt something. The whole idea of the matrix brings up a lot of questions about the human existence, and of life itself, of what is actually real. When people tried to describe the movie to me it didn't sound good, it sounded rubbish and illogical - after all how can a movie about bending reality and gravity to suit you be interesting? But it is, the idea that one must work to understand the matrix and to control it both confuses and enlightens you. There are so many questions raised, ones that humans have been trying to answer since the dawn of time. It does in the end come down to good vs. evil, in fact at points you can see where the story coincides with religious belief, but this simply makes it far more interesting. Then there are the fight scenes - and although they look more like the actors are dancing rather than fighting are still pretty good, and I think that was the effect they were going for anyway. Most of the fighting is either a blood bath of guns or some form of martial arts, and of course the material arts is perfectly timed like it is in all Jackie Chan movies. The actors are brilliant and fit their characters well, especially Hugo Weaving who was probably my favorite. The dialog was deep and interesting, the jokes witty, if not somewhat sarcastic and all in all the whole thing is incredibly deep.

For those who like ""date"" movies, tear-jerkers, and the like, this may not be your sort of film. However. If you enjoy action and/or sci-fi...this movie's got it! If you can stomach the first six minutes, you're ready for the rest of the rollercoaster. Keanu Reeves does a good job in an understated role, and Laurence Fishburne is excellent. I did have problems with focusing on Joe Pantoliano a bit too much. He does a good job, but the subject matter demanded that less time be spent on his machinations. Hugo Weaving was great! Put the man up for best supporting actor! It was great fun to watch him be the bad guy. The rest of the cast did well also.

It is densely packed with ideas and questions as to the meaning of ""reality"".  Of all the SF films I have seen in the last 50 years, I have to put this one in the top 10.Yes, it is a complicated story and, yes, you have to pay attention, but it is all tied logically together.  The fight scenes are choreographed as beautifully as a ballet. (The actors trained for 4 months just to ensure that they used the minimum amount of fight doubles.)  The special effects are seamless and greatly enhance the story.   The enemy forces lead by Agent Smith (Hugo Weaving) are fascinating, dangerous, and remorseless.  All actors hit their marks and deliver.It is a ""dense"" movie with many layers and literary and cultural allusions. Example, Neo (Keanu) apartment number is 101.

We are told by the big wigs, that we are too stupid to get it, and must be spoon fed what a movie is trying to say. Here is a film that breaks the mold thoroughly. The story line is very taught and well developed, (kinda the greatest story ever told meets dark city meets hackers)and the effects are a tool to further the telling of the story. In this kind of movie clearly fancy effects are required, but we are left to use our brains to figure out what is going on and what its implications are to us.

2015,Maarten68,The worst movie ever,1,23 January 2000,"I had never given a movie a 1 at IMDb, until I saw The Matrix. What a terribly bad movie, lousy actors and a hopeless story. I´d given this film a zero, if it was only possible. A complete waste of money, and please Hollywood: Mr Reeves can´t act!!!!",The Matrix
2016,raider-5,The Matrix-best science fiction/action film in a while,9,18 April 1999,"I loved The Matrix.  It was a visual ride and didn't condescend to its audience for a moment in its plot, in the questions that it posed to its audience.  However, the film could have been made even more compelling and exciting with characters who were better developed and a stronger human element to the story.  Still, it is the best science fiction film since Strange Days (an underrated science fiction masterpiece) and the best action film since Face-Off.  (By science fiction, I mean true science fiction that uses technology to explore some question of human existence, not straightforward action films that happen to take place in the future or, as in Star Wars, the distant past.)  It is the more compelling human stories and well-crafted dialogue of these two films that give them the edge on The Matrix.",The Matrix

I saw it once on Friday(4.3.99) and again today(4.4.99).  Matrix is my new favorite movie. If you haven't seen it yet, drop whatever you're doing and get yourself to a movie theater!  Every aspect of this movie is wonderful!  The martial arts sequences are INCREDIBLE!  (NO STUNTMEN, ALL DONE BY THE ACTORS) The SFX are unbelievable.  GO SEE THIS MOVIE!",The Matrix
2018,redhand-2,"""Intellectually stunning""? It's just another martial arts flick",4,19 June 1999,"I didn't expect to see a hyper-violent wannabe-Neuromancer kung fu fest that mixes the worst of scifi and fantasy with ideas cribbed from William Gibson and Philip Dick... but that's what it is. It's like a rehash _The Three Stigmata of Palmer Eldritch_ as written by a cloned Gibson gone mad with Hong Kong fight movies and superficial Hollywood scifi films.This is a film for people who like to see their heroes walk in the front door and mow down all the evil guys with a huge machine gun to a blaring techno soundtrack._The Matrix_ is all show, eye candy, no brain. Neat effects, no content. It has the intellectual sophistication of a video game, senselessly throwing out ""deep"" stuff like ""What is real?"" like the filmmakers even cared. Such questions only serve as an excuse to show all sorts of neat special effects and stunts._The Matrix_ will appeal to a lot of little (mentally as well as physically) boys, and the huge number of tactically placed gratuitous Keanu shots will likely please the girls as well. This is a film that is presumptuous enough to begin by asking ""What is real?"" and end with a martial-arts fight between Good (as represented by Keanu as the originally named ""The One"") and Evil (as represented by three guys dressed in black). Spaceship-sized plot holes abound. Good acting doesn't save a horribly clichéd script ridden by stereotypes and comic reliefs that we've all seen before._The Matrix_ reminded of three films: _Event Horizon_, an exercise in morbidity and stupidity (over which _The Matrix_ towers, not that it says much), _Dark City_ (which has similar problems but manages to be stimulate the intellect at least part of the time, the rest of which it makes up for with sheer style; at least it offered a very intriguing premise, one that in turn reminded me a lot of Brian Aldiss' sublime novel _Non-Stop_), and David Cronenberg's _Videodrome_ (one of the most daring and challenging, and at the same time visually overpowering, depictions of alternative realities put on screen so far).I look forward to, at some point in the future, we'll get an authentic science fiction film that doesn't believe in stupid audiences, hackneyed cliches, or box-office success, and dares to ask important questions and then deal with them. But that's wishful thinking, I guess. Outright science fiction, as it were.",The Matrix
2019,garfield-10,It is awesome...and seeing is believing!!!,10,13 July 1999,"I must confess that I had the highest expectations for this movie and I walked into the theater with this in mind. The movie exceeded everything I had expected!!! After the first escape/running scene I was already addicted to the fast-paced, incredibly realistic effects that were being hurled at me and longed to be bombarded with much more. Again I was not disappointed...Torn between this effects galore and trying to mildly comprehend the complex plot of this movie, I was glued to my seat motionless for over two hours. As one famous character once said *That was definitely a 9.5 on my weird-s**t-o-meter!* I did something I usually try to avoid, I gave the movie a 10. I would probably have to watch it 20 more times to actually find a glitch big enough to scratch at that vote! Aside from the effects, the choice of characters for the movie was uniquely brilliant! Reeves and Fishburne are brilliant in both acting and dressing (special note to the clip-on sunglasses) and adapt fantastically to the speed with which the plot evolves. Weaving as the infamous agent Smith who lurkes around every corner gives the *bad guys* a very unique and humourus touch. His slow articulated form of speaking streches the suspense in a very unique way and makes the viewer want to shove a boot down his throat every time he opens his mouth! Enough said. If you have not seen the movie yet for whatever reason, watch it!!! If you have seen it and are convinced you have the whole thing down cold, watch it again, because I assure you there is more to be experienced!!!!",The Matrix

What they call entertainment. The Matrix is a cheerful exception. It shows, through its metaphors, that humankind is being enslaved by the system: religion, corporations, capitalism, media, etc. It's more like an awaking call to a worldwide spread unconsciousness that is being kept by, also unconscious, greedy power-addicted few. All that and much more is wrapped up in this brilliant feature which you probably should watch more than once to get a better grasp of its abundant content. My favorite movie of all time.",The Matrix

And only in Hollywood could a typical, derivative, way-too-long shoot-em-up action movie get such good reviews.Ladies and gentlemen, I hate to burst your bubble, but there were maybe ten minutes worth of eye-popping special effects.  The rest?  Ponderous clap-trap about ""The Martix"" and ""The One.""  Most of the ""action?""  Typical gun fights where for some reason twenty ""bad guys"" with automatic weapons (on their home turf) cannot shoot two intruders.

The previews that were shown on talk shows were really cheesy, but I gave it a shot.  I have to say that Matrix is one of the best movies I have seen in a few years. The special effects are very special and the acting is surprisingly great. I loved the concept of the movie and best of all, it made me think.  If you don't like to think while watching a movie, then don't see Matrix.  But... if you want to see a good movie that makes you care about the characters and outcome.... Then see Matrix.  It is worth your 7 bucks.",The Matrix

Rescued from the low of Johnny Mnemonic to play the role of his career, ""Canoe"" gives a slick performance as Thomas 'Neo' Anderson.If you're reading this, you know the plot by now. All that remains is for me to add my praise to that I've already read here.Quite simply the best movie of this genre I've ever seen.",The Matrix
2025,Gargoyle-4,"Charming piece, makes me want to see it again soon",9,4 July 1999,"I admit it, I went to see The Matrix because the trailer showed an action-movie with beautifully choreographed action sequences and at least somewhat interesting idea. Well, the movie did have those action-sequences plus some neat special effects (and couple bit lousy ones as well) and the attitude, which saved a few scenes from looking totally ridiculous.With that treat, The Matrix gives us also a very interesting view of the world and a good story. Even a brief look into the world would be a crime for those who haven't seen the movie, but I'll say this. Many of the people who have been complaining about the plotholes and problems apparently haven't really gotten the answer to the question ""What is the Matrix?"". The world and the story are charming, interesting and they actually are quite possible, from just about any point of view. Tho' frankly I think that there was a lot of wasted potential in the story and maybe for the first time in my life I'd really like to see a sequel where they'd really get into that potential.Oh, and acting wasn't the best but it most certainly was good enough to keep the movie from falling apart. Somehow I get the impression that people are complaining about Reeves just because they're used to seeing him give a bad performance. Personally I think that is pretty much okay as long as he doesn't have to get too emotional and in The Matrix, he gives perhaps his best so far.",The Matrix
2026,Liquid-5,"A modern Blade Runner, a sci-fi milestone",9,1 April 1999,"The Matrix is one of an increasingly rare breed of sci-fi films: it delivers in every department. Most of the hype surrounding this movie was built on the word that the special effects and action sequences were unbelievable. And, as sometimes happens, the hype turned out to be true. The fighting scenes in this movie leave little to be desired, as they exhibit a flow, choreography and elegance that evokes images of the John Woo style Hong Kong action genre at its best. And the special effects are so seamlessly fluid and well-done that one would be inclined to wonder if Star Wars may have a run for its money. However, the movie does not follow the all too common formula of simply relying on the action and special effects to keep an audiences interest. Instead, a solid and complex storyline backs up every bullet and punch thrown at the audience. And to make the story believable, top-notch performances from every cast member, notably Laurence Fishburne, Hugo Weaving and, surprise surprise, Keanu Reeves. The cinematography also shines in this film. Many of the shots are simply so iconic and beautiful that you marvel at how it would look in real life. All in all, this film is a truly amazing piece of work, and one not to be missed.",The Matrix
2027,Happycat,Fascinating and flawed example of cinematic art.,5,2 April 1999,"This film excels at being a movie.  It is filled with images and concepts only possible in today's cinema.  I've been waiting for computer imagery to finally lend itself to films which were impossible before.  This is such a film.However, certain elements detract.  The filmmakers obviously became very involved in the universe they created.  So much so that they tend to either delve into meaningless details or worse; Explain the mystery away.  At a point about a third of the way into the film the curiosity that kept me involved was quickly dispatched with filler dialogue.  ""What?"" I thought, ""How can they cripple this film so easily?"".Regardless, the action scenes are involving.  The dialogue is largely tolerable (compared to recent fare), the cinematic style is interesting, and the effects are sometimes subtle and sometimes breathtaking.  Keanu Reeves seems to have settled for a much more subtle approach here, an improvement in my mind.Personal peeve... When did Laurence Fishburne go Michael Jackson on us? Obviously the the cinematographer did not know how to handle the exposure of dark skin.  In almost any given shot Fishburne appears to have had his ethnic heritage stolen from him.",The Matrix
2028,witt-dog,"If you are a true fan of movies, you're obligated to see this one.",10,18 April 1999,"The Matrix is the best movie I have ever seen.  It was amazing for the special effects.  It also made you think.  Can we choose our own path in life or are we pre-destined to do certain things and make certain decisions. Reeves deserves some props for portraying the reluctant hero, Neo. Fishburne as Morpheus almost gets lost in the shuffle because the role he plays is not as flashy as the others.  Hugo Weaving did a great job as agent Smith.  His relentless search for Morpheus was reminiscent of the search for Richard Kimble on the series The Fugitve. Carrie-Anne Moss also deserves a shout out for her portrayal of Trinity.  Best of all, however, was when Reeves realizes that he is ""the one"" and you recall the final fight scene in The Last Dragon.  This is one of the few movies that is worth the price of admission two or three times.",The Matrix

Plenty of neat special effects to distract the audience from the flawed and empty re-telling of the age old ""what is reality"" story. A few interesting bible references, great blue-screening (better than Episode 1 by far), but with stone-like acting from every cast member, everyone ends up looking like part of the machine. If you want to see a movie that really deals with the issue ""what is reality"" see Darren Aronofsky's ""Pi"" (1998). If you want to see a bunch of fake kung fu, slapped together on an Avid machine to impress you, then see the Matrix, but most of these reviewers are mistaken (no offense); it's really just filler with a bit of truth.

This action/sci-fi film combines the best aspects of action with a psychological and philosophical edge sharp enough to cut through the fabric of reality into another dimension. Cutting edge special effects make this movie all the more ethereal, pulling the audience into a world we never knew or imagined. Definitely a must see. The only downer is that the movie is another shot at a humanity that will destroy itself with technology. Nonetheless, go see the movie!

With their chilling, dark film ""Bound"", which they directed and written, I knew I was going to expect another fantastic presentation. ""The Matrix"" completely blew me away.I got the announcement about this film over three years ago, and I was curious to see what ""The Matrix"" really was, but information was far too limited, leaving me only the names of the people behind the magic. However, it creeped up through the neighborhood and slapped me in the face, yelling, ""Damnit! Look at me!"" Look at it I did, and I am stilling pondering about ""The Matrix.""""The Matrix"" stars Keanu Reeves, Laurence Fishburn, Carrie-Ann Moss, and Joe Pantoliano, among others. I have tracked Fishburn's acting career since his infamous role on ""Pee Wee's Playhouse"" as ""Cowboy Curtis,"" and I must say, I am amazed once again. Fishburn with the rest of the actors/actresses perform stunningly, and leave you wanting more.But what is this Matrix I keep rambling on about? Well, as Fishburn states, ""Unfortunately, no one can be told what the Matrix is. You have to see it for yourself."" That is exactly what you need to do to decipher ""The Matrix.""Although I promised myself not to let out too much information on this film, I have permitted myself to blabber on about what this film has done. It has done far past my expectations in technology. The slick movements by the characters, and the martial arts are amazing. Obviously, a lot of work has been put into this film, and work has done it good.Another point about this film that may be brought to your surprise. The actual fight scenes, twirling about, action scenes, and so on, were conducted by the actors themselves, not stuntmen, which also adds another nice touch to realism. The training that the actors must have gone through has to be appreciated from this film.Now, after viewing this film, you may decide, ""Oh jeez. I thought I was in for something. This is just another Hollywood show-off of an old, repetitive storyline."" Well, may-be, but ""The Matrix"" has an insightful and nice touch to its storyline. It brings it out in a unique way that no film has brought before. That is why it stands out.""The Matrix"" is a marvel among movies. This may not get an Oscar or two, but it definitely stands out among other films. ""The Matrix"" cannot be explained unless seen, so for you to discover the mystery behind ""The Matrix"", you have to see it, to believe it.",The Matrix

As a genre film I was prepared to call it a near-masterpiece... until what is perhaps the most contrived, most used solution to solve the hero-in-big-trouble crisis moment appeared... then it took 10 minutes to forget that moment... during the climax. Ignore that ultimate-cliche moment and it's a great story. The bad guys are the ultimate 'Men In Black,' Reeves comes as close as he ever has to credible acting and Fishburne is solid as always.

The fact that the humor springs from scenes where the actors deliver their lines in serious-as-a-heart-attack dead-pan makes it all the more funny.

I went after tons of my friends told me it was ""awesome"" and I wasn't disappointed.  The effects - which LOOKED real - only added to the development of the story, and like any good sci fi movie, man's relationship with technology is one of the main themes of the movie.  The literary & mythological references were great & the general plot and its underlying theme about man's place in the world were solid.But let me say this - if you want to go to a movie that rocks, this movie is a must see!  It's not just for the thinker, either.  It just plain rocks, or as some of my friends would say ""It was tight.""(And you'll never look at deja vu the same way again...)",The Matrix

But I also thought it would be a horrible film, mostly because of Keanu starring in it.  I was pleasantly surprised.  Other than a relatively weak premise, the Matrix delivers astounding visuals, intense action (great hand-to-hand combat scenes), tasteful to skilled acting, and (most surprisingly )a thought provoking story-line.

2038,TWSG,The most visually breathtaking film it's ever been my privilege to behold,10,4 April 1999,"There is only one word in the English language that I feel can sum up the impact The Matrix has on any viewer who beholds it: WOW!  This movie is quite easily the most visually innovative film I've ever seen, a comic book come to life, with sprawling digital landscapes, amazing digital creatures and fight choreography that rivals anything Hong Kong can muster.  The story, thankfully, keeps pace with the visuals, making the viewer think (a feat which few Hollywood big-budgets accomplish).  Now I'm aware that many people will compare this to Dark City, or maybe even City of Lost Children, but this movie goes above and beyond anything those two films accomplished. Dark City was a great film, however it was plagued by it's MTV editing, not allowing the viewer to take in the vast expanses of incredible set design. Thankfully The Wachowski Brothers don't go overboard on hyper-kinetic editing, allowing us to intake the landscape.  And City of Lost Children, although a visual delight, was slightly disappointing story-wise (btw, this is not to say that I dislike either of the two films, all three of these films are easily on my Top 10 list).  So, to make a long review short, The Matrix accomplishes what it set out to do, which is enthrall.  See this film if you truly want to see what Special FX and creativity are capable of nowadays.

2040,jwh-2,worth every cent I paid (I saw it for free),4,30 March 1999,"There are few words that describe ""The Matrix,"" but derivative, loud, painful, and disappointing would be a good start. From a plot straight out of a Dick or Gibson novel, to the agony of watching Laurence Fishburne recite pages of truly awful exposition, this is a film that tries really hard, but often misses the mark. To be fair, the film is aiming high and the middle third works really well. The sets, costumes and effects are terrific and the stunts and fight scenes are pretty wild. There are also some nice metaphors playing out, and there is a serious parable being told here. The dialogue during the middle is also sharp and witty, and makes me wonder who wrote the rest of it, particularly all the scenes where Fishburne and Keanu Reeves play Obi Wan and Luke Skywalker. (""The matrix surrounds us, it penetrates us...."" And I thought the next Star Wars movie wasn't coming out until May.) The film can't decide if it wants to be Aliens, Johnny Mnemonic, a Borg episode, a John Woo film, or a Gap ad, so it borrows lots from all of them and ends up being too little of each.

It's fantastic and one of the best sci-fi thrillers of the decade. Like Blade Runner, it's a real big movie. I hope a sequel will be made soon. It will rock the box office.

From the character names (Trinity, Neo [new man], etc.), the plot (this world is not fully real; arrival and actions of a messiah), to even the title (""matrix"" is an old-english term used in the Old Testament for ""womb""), this spectacular cybertale is grounded in the old and still-relevant central story of scripture.Also interesting is that this is the third film (alongside The Truman Show and Dark City) in a year that feature our hero discovering he lives within a false reality, and struggles to escape.

2046,TheHun,GOOD OLD GENRES SPECTACULARLY STYLIZED,9,2 April 1999,"Bound was a smashing debut by The Wachowski Brothers in which they took up film noire and brought it into the hip world of the '90's. It was a perfect example for the indies in that The Wachowskis had never made a feature, they were in their mid-Twenties, and they were gutsy. Above all, it was clear that Bound was a labor of love. Now, these enfants terrible pour their love and passion of movies into a sci-fi thriller and stylize the themes and genres such as the Western, film noire, Asian martial arts and epic cinema in a post-modern cyber world. An out of this would-be hodgepodge, they create a mini milestone in an explosive manner. All the innovative special effects aside, The Matrix has a plastic texture interwoven with sufficient character depth that is a delight to watch. And the eternal subject matter of our subconscious, what is Reality/Truth, that it tackles with elevates this smashing pop-art onto an intellectual level. No, we are not talking Kubrick/2001 here. The Wachowskis may not have his genius but they have a perfect cinematic vision, full commitment to each and every detail, a talent to put together an impressive cast and crew, and above all, a total devotion to the magic of movie-making. Talking about the subject matter of The Matrix and its few shortcomings is secondary at this point. It is a movie you see to devour its feel, its balance and its presentation. Go and see it. You will recall The Blade Runner, The Dark City, Terminator II, and the themes from the classics yet wonder how refreshing they are put together. Clearly Bound was no accident.",The Matrix

First chosen for Keanu Reeves, followed by an interest in special-effects and computers, this movie was a visual treat. The martial arts scenes were spectacular, the use of stop action to pan technique was not overused.  The contrasts between the inner world of the Matrix and the 'real' world were effective.

2051,eshank,"superbly crafted zen-like ""experience"" affects perception of time",10,9 April 1999,"We usually judge media by its presentation... this movie goes beyond presentation to manipulate the viewers perception.  Many movies do that to some extent (usually via the soundtrack), but this film takes the manipulation of perception to new heights.  Its almost a ""ride"" more than a movie.For several hours after I left this movie my sense of time felt much faster. I felt highly alert, my movements were precise and my thinking sharp... like drinking lots of coffee but without the jitters.  I almost believed I could exist outside of time...  fascinating and dangerous.  Be very careful driving home after this movie, or better yet, have someone else pick you up.",The Matrix
2052,Gramero,Sci-Fi Thriller,10,23 April 1999,"The Matrix is an outstanding example of special effects.  The movie can be slow at the beginning, but be patient, it's worth every minute.  If you're slightly confused at the start, wait because it will all come together by the end.",The Matrix
2053,espenw,BOOOOOOOOOOORING!!!!!!,1,7 November 1999,"My girl and I went to the theatre too see this , what we thougt, fantastic movie. What a waste of time!!!! I should had stayed at home to watch some ""Teletubbies"" instead. My girl actually fell asleep during the movie, and I just hoped this torture would end as soon as possible. OK, the special effects was rather good. I can give one star for the effects. This is just one of the films that nobody dares to say loud what piece of shit it really is. Wake up people, there is so many much better films out there.",The Matrix
2054,Ecuador,Very good - not excellent. Just a question of originality.,9,6 September 1999,"I saw ""The Matrix"" a few days ago. The film is quite good and received much attention (and publicity) as it promised stunning special effects around a sophisticated and compelling plot.Well, the effects were as expected for a contemporary, expensive sci-fi adventure. My only objection are the monitors that presumably display the undecoded ""Matrix"", it is quite a disgrace for those who know a little about computers (a hint : about how much data do you suppose a text screen can contain? Enough to describe a virtual world or even small portions of it?)As for the plot, it is based on the idea of people being enslaved in a constructed world by an other race, without being able to realize it, until there comes ""the chosen one"", a human who learns the truth and eventually discovers and puts into use powers and abilities that exceed those of the ""dominant"" race. This all sounds interesting enough, but the basic problem is that the above exact lines of text can be used to describe another movie. This movie is ""Dark City"" by the creator of ""The Crow"". If ""Dark City"" was written prior to ""The Matrix"", then the later lacks originality. The new elements in ""The Matrix"" scenario make it seem more complex and more hi-tech, so as to appeal to the audience. The scenario is also more pessimistic, which is the easier way to ""move"" the viewer, in contrast, ""Dark City"" achieves the same (or more) just by its dark and gloomy ambiance. So, both movies present a human nightmare, with ""The Matrix"" being the more colorful one. The more complex scenario, which features more technological concepts, such as Artificial Intelligence and Virtual Reality therefore drawing more hi-tech addicted audience, bears one major weakness : an abrupt and unfulfilling ending. The plot arrives to a point where it simply cannot continue, as the hero becomes almost a ""god"" but ONLY for the virtual world. A scent of victory is the ending, but we immediately realize that it is virtual (not actual) too.There is a lot of action in this movie. It's a pity the director used too much of the old-fashioned ""slow motion"" technique in most of the fight scenes, which holds back the fast action; in a few scenes the technique was essential, but in others it was just ""easier"". The sound is excellent and I can say the same for the soundtrack. Keanou Reeves performed his best (along with ""Devils Advocate"") and the rest of the cast does very well in delivering a stylish (remember ""Men In Black"") and very entertaining film.So, go watch this film, but first watch it's darker flip-side by Alex Proyas : ""Dark City"". As for me, I enjoyed the film, but I believe it was not worth such a high place in IMDb's top 250. If the plot was conceived before ""Dark City"", then I would rate the movie a 9/10. Otherwise, a 7-8/10 would me more appropriate.",The Matrix
2055,Chet!,Er....,7,8 July 1999,"Having read as many of the comments below as is humanly possible, I would have to say that I agree with all of them, positive or negative. The effects and fight scenes are, of course, flawless, but any pedant worth their salt will find plenty wrong with the plot and character motivation. But seeing as it attempts to deal with some intellectual concepts (semi-successfully), it would probably be wrong to criticise it too much, existing in a Hollywood where directors usually do as much as possible to keep the docile masses from exercising their grey matter. The Matrix is flawed, but as an action film it is (like T2) a step in the right direction.",The Matrix
2056,Vashni,Awsome movie,9,2 April 1999,"Saw the movie yesterday, and it kicked! Anyone who enjoys a good sci-fi movie will love this. Good visuals, plot, and acting (it's all been said before)However, I felt a number of echos from William Gibson's works such as Neuromancer (Let's face it, the discs to teach the people skills are basically Gibson's microsofts). In fact, I believed at first that the Matrix was a film based on one of Gibson's stories, considering the title (if you've read any Gibson, you know what I'm talking about). It's interesting how one author can have such a rippling effect on an entire genre of work. I'd go into detail, but I'd probably spoil a lot of this excellent story.Down sides to this movie? The ending left me wanting more... something else than what happened, but that's just the breaks with movies. Also, most of the forshadowing was rather blatant (the fact that Neo is a hacker springs to mind, and let's not forget his name means ""new"" which is basically what he is in more than one way) Chessiest foreshadowing? Finally, I wanted to see Neo manipulate the Matrix a whole lot more than he did... I didn't feel compelled to ""believe"" like the characters did.Overall, this movie really whips the llama's a**. Pumping soundtrack (I am listening to it right now actually) combined with stark, moving visuals and a fresh twist on an old idea all helped give the action scenes depth and meaning. Go check this sucker out. It's worth another trip into the Matrix, just for the visuals. I give it a 9.0 on the cult-film-o-meter. Sure to be haunting your movie collection for years to come.",The Matrix
2057,RobAx,You have to see it to believe it!,9,16 November 1999,"I went into the movie theater to see The Matrix because I had nothing better to do.  I really had no idea what the movie was about, and didn't care for that matter.  I especially hate most of Keanu Reeves' movies outside of a couple.  So I could've never envisioned that The Matrix would have been one of the best movies of the year, second only to Fight Club. The plot is just about impossible to explain.  The buildup for the movie included nobody saying what the matrix was, that you had to see it for yourself.  I thought this was a catchy tagline, but it ends up it was true. A truly intriguing plot, that makes you think and a great soundtrack combine to make a great film.  It also contains one of the greatest action sequences of all time.  If you are a fan of sci-fi or action, you have to see The Matrix.",The Matrix
2058,ohhjayy,"Simple, but rigid.",10,5 April 1999,"A superb storyline backed up by the toughest neural network of special effects seen to date.  Keanu does not wreck this movie at all, the writers/directors brothers controlled him well and got him to lose necessary weight.  Even the potential contradictions within the story are so mysterious that they could make sense after all.  What do I mean?  You simply have to see the Matrix to ""know"" what I mean.  Got any wine?",The Matrix
2059,whitsonj,The coolest film I've seen in years.,10,5 April 1999,"Nearly every aspect of this movie was impressive.  The plot was internally self-consistent, there was no problem with suspension of disbelief, and it had a workable premise.  As a pure SF movie, it worked well.  As a cool story it flowed nicely.  As an action movie, there was not a pause in the rush.  It had no gratuitous sex, and all the violence was an integral part of the plot line.  The FX were entirely apropos to the story, and worked seamlessly.  I intend to watch it again this week, and to purchase the DVD on its release date.I expect the critics panned it because it either disagreed with some aspect of their personal taste, or (more likely) because it wasn't simplistic easy to swallow pablum.",The Matrix
2060,El_Duderino,See it!,9,6 April 1999,"This movie is cool!  It takes a lot from it's Sci-Fi predecessors but puts new spins on everything.  The real reason for seeing this movie though is the visuals.  Go see it, the SFX will blow your mind.",The Matrix
2061,DVD-4,An amazing film-going experience. . .,10,6 April 1999,"One of the best, most invigorating film experiences I've ever had.  This film hits on all cylinders: it has an inventive, ingenious plot; well-developed, sympathetic characters; and never-seen-before effects that will blow you away.  I had to see it twice in two days just because I couldn't get it out of my mind.The best thing about it is that the effects, plot and characters all work together in perfect synergy.  This is not simply one of the countless big-budget FX extravaganzas that have the stock, cardboard characters and the swiss cheese plot (i.e. not only cheesy but full of holes) that exist merely so the film-makers can impress you with their effects prowess and show off their bells and whistles.In THE MATRIX, the characters compliment the plot, which compliments the effects, which compliment the characters.   There are no more effects than necessary and no less.  Everything fits perfectly.  This is seemless, kick-a** entertainment, populated by characters to root for and care about. Further deepening the film is its Christ-like parable about someone prophesized to save humanity, which works to great effect.Some will say that this movie re-uses sci-fi ideas from other films, but the truth is there are no new ideas in stories anymore, only fresh ways of presenting the old ones.  This movie does that in a big way. It is a serious leap of the imagination (not to mention its some of the absolute coolest stuff you'll ever see on film or anywhere else.)",The Matrix
2062,Jeremy-37,This one is a must see...,10,7 April 1999,"This is the best movie I have ever seen.  Hands down.  I have a lot of old favorites, and it takes a lot for a new movie to even come close to displacing them, but Matrix blew them all away.  If you like the ""what is reality"" aspect of Total Recall, this is for you.  Matrix has a couple of other references to other movies, but I don't want to spoil it.  This was the perfect role for Keanu Reeves, and for those of you like me that have been disappointed in some of his past movies, this is fully redeeming.  A great cast of characters, a strong plot, and a smoothy flowing storyline insure that you never get bored.  In fact, I'd say it was the fastest 2 1/2 hours of my life.  The special effects are top notch, but not overdone. You become fully immersed in Matrix and it is truly exhilarating.  Personally, I don't get that much of a thrill off of roller coasters.  Overall, an ""A+"".",The Matrix
2063,Alfinx,Fantastic!,9,9 April 1999,"If you see only one movie this year, see ""Phantom Menace"". If you see two movies this year, see ""The Matrix"". It really was way above my initial expectations. Intelligent, captivating, intriguing, mysterious... the way sci-fi should be.The special effects were cool, but they pale in comparison to the brilliant plot and script. My only minor complaint... fighting scenes looked too fake. None of them seem to put much force into their punches & kicks.I'll give this one a 9.",The Matrix
2064,DaveH-8,Awful movie,2,12 June 1999,I'm afraid I fell for the hype on this one.  Proof yet again that a film cannot survive on special effects and flashy direction alone The Matrix died within an hour.  The scenes that relied on neither of these (ie the scenes where the characters had to TALK to each other) were very boring and exposed the film's complete lack of emotional core.  The characters are shallow and artificial and you don't care what happens to any of them.  Reeves' acting is as bad as ever.  It clearly has pretensions to being an 'intelligent' movie - lots of scientific and philosophical references in the script but it's just name dropping (or idea dropping). A miserable experience.,The Matrix
2065,Seiyuu,"the Matrix, the biggest rip-off of '99",3,13 April 1999,"I hated this movie.  Half the story line was stolen from a Star Trek episode called ""The Thaw"" and the other half was taken from the movie ""Dark City."" The only orignal touch was the Kung-Fu fighting, which isn't original at all.  I gave this movie a 3, don't see it, instead watch Star Trek, Dark City and the Terminator and give credit to the people who came up with these ideas in the first place.",The Matrix
2066,Ed-165,One of the best sci-fi films in years,10,9 July 1999,"A rare example of great special effects, a seriously fascinating concept, and a well executed plot all in one, The Matrix is far and away the best film of the year so far.  After three viewings I feel that I can grasp the majority of the themes presented in the film, but I'm sure I'd pick up on more upon a fourth viewing.  Many of these themes have already been expressed in other of these reviews, but some have not (although I haven't read all 1000+ of them):Fate: at first I didn't understand what the Oracle had to do with the plot - it seemed to be a mythological/religious reference that detracted from the Christian theme running through the film.  I eventually realized that the presence of the Oracle raises the question of fate, or more accurately, whose reading of fate we should trust, i.e. that determined by the machines or that determined by the Oracle.  The Matrix is a computer program and thus, given all of the facts, the future, or fate, can be determined.  We are not inclined to believe that about the real world, given Heisenberg's uncertainty principle, etc., but Morpheus and the Oracle suggest that fate works here as well.  If both worlds are controlled by fate and thus deterministic, then what is the difference between them?  If the actions of the rebels in the real world are predictable like a computer program, then why could not a computer program be written to describe the real world as well?Mind: the agents attempt to ""hack"" into Morpheus' mind, much ""like a computer"" as Trinity says.  So what is the difference between his mind and a computer?  In fact, the film treats the mind much like a computer - i.e. ""uploading"" martial arts training into Neo's mind and entering the Matrix (""downloading"" your mind?).Music: the techno music played in the film again raises the question of the difference between man and machine - if this music is completely produced on a synthesizer/computer, then what makes it human?  I may be incorrect, but I only recall hearing the techno music in the Matrix scenes, not the real world scenes.  [Sidepoint: why does the music on the soundtrack have to be inevitably different from the music played in the film?  This really disappointed me, and it's not the first time either - check out Moby's ""God moving over the face of the waters"" in the film ""Heat"" and on the soundtrack.]Anyway, with a couple of exceptions (Keanu Reeves' acting, the way he ""saw"" the Matrix at the end of the film) this is a truly great film.  It's better than either Terminator film and sits right up there with Metropolis, Star Wars, Blade Runner, or 2001 as the greatest sci-fi films of all time. What makes all of these films great is that they come up with an interesting concept, have an enjoyable plot and great special effects, and give you a lot to think about when the film is over (which is where the Terminator films fail, the second to a lesser extent).   If this film gets nominated for Best Picture it will restore my faith in Hollywood.  See it.",The Matrix
2067,bazina,tentatively: an SF classic,9,14 April 1999,"This film has planted a fever in my brain - was there a subliminal message throbbing out of the screen telling us 'you must see this again'? I feel like an invisible thread is luring me back to the cinema to immerse myself again in this glorious fiction. Even though its premise is dystopic, the action/fight/gravity defying sequences are truly exhilarating and may make the unhinged among us think for a brief moment that maybe they can fly too.I can't tell you how strange it was to watch the familiar buildings and streets of Sydney (my home city) constructed as part of a computer generated illusion, and then to drive past many of the filming locations on the way home. Disconcertingly dreamlike to say the least! Go see it - I promise that it will show you things you've never seen or maybe never dreamt before.",The Matrix
2068,shmuck,PPL still think!,6,16 April 1999,"Despite Keanu, despite the plot holes, despite the horrendous ending, the Matrix was a good movie.  The story made no sense, but at least they didn't try to explain anything (which would have been disastrous), and with the special effects and pace they almost got away.  I am just happy to learn there are still people out there who do think when they watch a movie!  Too bad for the Matrix, the more you think, the less you like it.  But IF you can just stare at the screen and enjoy the moment...  Ah ignorance is bliss! Hmm, maybe ""the Matrix"" does has some social commentary to it, what a thought!",The Matrix
2069,sheelpi,what the hell?,5,23 April 1999,"The thing I still don't understand is how so many people like this movie enough to give it a 10.  The dialogue was corny to the point where I literally laughed out loud more than once.  The acting was ok, except for Fishburne which is disappointing because I loved him in his other movies. Of course, with lines like his, its hard to pull it off without sounding cheesy.  The concept was great, and the story unfolded with pretty good execution.  But this is an effects movie pure and simple.  When you're watching a movie, and you can pinpoint exact scenes stolen from other movies, there's a problem.  All the action sequences were bit off John Woo and Mortal Kombat, the love story was ripped from Far and Away, and Neo's triumph at the end, ""My name... is Neo"" is from Roots.  GIVE ME A BREAK!! Is it not enough to pile on the cheese, but you have to rip other movies off so blatantly? I don't recommend this movie at all.",The Matrix
2070,Renn,Woah!!!!!!!,9,18 April 1999,"I was terrified of a let down as I walked into the stadium seating theater to see this film.  I was disappointed in a few of the last movies that I went into with high anticipations for (Dragonheart, Spawn and a few others). I was not to be left wanting this time.The Matrix is a ground breaking film with outstanding direction and cinematography, a sold story and good acting.  Even Keeanu Reeves nay sayers shouldn't be able to really pick his performance apart that badly.This movie will do for the cyber-punk genre what Star Wars did for Fantasy/Sci-Fi, especially with the rumors floating about that this is the first in a trilogy.  From start to finish, I was on the edge of my seat, riveted and throughly entertained.  The last two minutes of the film wasn't the strongest ending ever, but after hearing the trilogy rumors, I forgot my complaints about that.  This wasn't your typical Hollywood, leave it open ended for a sequel, it was planned.The Wachowski brothers are the new hot shot directors in the biz.  Between the independent Bound and now The Matrix, I see an innovative genius in their work.  They know how to blend classic themes and techniques keeping everything fresh and exciting.  I rank them with the short list of directors that I will draw me to a movie by name alone (Ridley Scott, James Cameron, David Fincher, Steven Spielberg, Francis Ford Coppela among others on said list.)Lawrence Fishburn is solid as usual.  He looked like he was having fun during the filming which will always increase the quality of an actor's performance.  New comers to big budget features Carrie-Ann Moss and Hugo Weaving were great.  Moss was far more than just eye candy (though her patent leather costumes were to die for) and Weaving was truly sinister. Both should have a bright future in Hollywood.The special effects are top notch.  While I'm sure the Phantom Menace will amaze even more, the reported 60 million dollar budget makes what they did in The Matrix just that much more impressive.The Kung-Fu.....  Wow.  The choreography was amazing.  It was very apparent of the long hours of training that the actors spent during pre-production. They made Keanu, Lawrence and Hugo look like they had been doing martial arts for many years.All in all, one of the best movies I have ever seen and easily the best movie of recent years.  Not since Braveheart have I seen a film that has drawn me back for repeat viewings so  many times in its first few weeks of release.I give it a nine only because tens are ratings that I have only given out once or twice ever.A MUST SEE for any fan of the genre.",The Matrix
2071,sorend,"Enter ""The Matrix""",9,27 May 1999,"I really must say this movie surpassed my expectations. Actually  its one of those rare movies that I want to watch a second time. First of all: I thought ""Keanu Reeves is featured - oh no he's gonna waste a perfectly good-sounding plot again"", but he didn't manage!This film may not have first class acting, but it has a very interesting plot. Indeed it would be unfair to compare it with ""Blade Runner"", because Keanu Reeves is not Harrison Ford - but enviroment-wise, they both have this futuristic ideas about man and machine and how things have developed. The plot is less subtle than that of Blade Runner, but the special effect are (of course?) better, quite impressive actually.I would say its a must-see, and I have, with a lot of consideration, given it a score of 10. Keanu Reeves has risen a few levels, and is actually not bad, Laurence Fishburne is very good, and I like Carrie-Anne Moss a lot - nice to see her in a real film.",The Matrix

Incredible persons who perform incredibly, with thousands of bullets flying and none of them reaching the targets, a story almost immaterial and a lot of deja vu worse of their predecessors: Keanu Reeves quoting himself in Little Buddha when he meets the other possible elects, the Blues Brothers or Man in Black for the black glasses, Butch Cassidy and Billy the Kid for the scenes of Reeves coming from behind a column with two guns blasting and so on. What did I forget ? Yes, some indirect advertising of a famous cellular telephone producer (the kind used is so particular .), perhaps not so common in 2199 (when is supposed to be the story), a software house where your chief tells you will be fired if arriving late working (while it is known that usually software houses are opened nearly 24 hours a day).

There is also a lot of stuff you'll notice from other films, not least Star Wars. The Marix is a wonderful movie with a pretty straight forward plot, but with some AMAZING effects and a really good feel. The director and the cast are superb in this movie, which could have been based on a William Gibson book. The Characters are very typical William Gibson characters and the level of violence is typically Gibson as well.

I am a big fan of Bound, and of the directors' visual style.  Still, what was promised in the previews did not actually occur until 30 minutes before the end of the film.The concept is intriguing, if not totally original.  Half way through the film I kept saying to myself, ""When this becomes clear, it will be really neat.""  Unfortunately, after it was over, I was still unclear about many things.I know that a movie like this should be experienced, if not completely understood, but the experience was dark and the style was too late.Still, I loved the flo-mo effects, and the visual effects were TERRIFIC.

2078,messiah-6,Matrix Vs. Star Wars and quotes (spoilers),10,17 May 1999,"Hey, if you haven't seen this movie yet, you really don't get out much. People who say this movie sucks like hell, really don't get the concept. It shows how dense they are.  I saw the movie about seven times and it got better everytime because I caught some things that I haven't seen.  I also read the real script, and screenplay, etc. and caught so much more.  So for all those of you who say this movie sucks, you have a real problem.  Okay, so The Matrix may not be an original movie, but it sure makes the other movies look bad.  For those of you who'd rather watch Star Wars than this, you really don't know the truth.  First of all, the two movies are alike in so many ways.  Anakin Skywalker is kind of like a messiah and so is Neo. There's the dark force (the matrix itself is the dark force) and there's the good force (the rebels).  They both use a lot of computer graphics, too. But there is a very big difference.  The Matrix is the red pill and The Phantom Menace is the blue pill.  The Phantom Menace is directed to younger children, believe me, why else would it be PG-13?  And The Matrix treats you as a smart adult.  The Matrix has a lot to talk about and some things you have to find out for yourself.  Not only that, but some of my friends went and saw a special screening of some sort and said, ""It sucks!  Don't waste your money on that movie, watch The Matrix instead!""  She said it was too cutesy, unlike The Matrix.  She also said that The Phantom Menace basically treated the audience as if they were stupid, brainless people.  The movie didn't make her think like The Matrix did.  Strange isn't it?  The movie is so hyped up, but probably won't live up to it like The Matrix did.  Not only that, but the trailer for The Matrix is far better than The Phantom Menace. I would also like to add my favorite quote from the movie: ""Dodge this!""",The Matrix
2079,messiah-6,The Matrix vs. Star Wars. . . . .,10,30 May 1999,"People who are waiting in line for Star Wars are missing out on one of the best movies of the year.  The Matrix is a must see!  In my opinion, I think The Matrix and Star Wars Episode 1: The Phantom Menace are very similar. Anakin Skywalker has the force unusually strong with him (Star Wars) and Neo is supposedly ""the one."" (The Matrix)  There's a lot of good force and bad force in both these movies.  But, there is one thing that's different. The Matrix treats the audience as an intelligent group of people, having many hidden facts in it for people to figure out themselves (i.e. names, etc.), but The Phantom Menace explains ""everything"" as it goes along.  It treats the audience as a group of brainless children.  Don't get me wrong here, I loved both these movies, but if I had to choose the best out of the two, it would definitely be The Matrix.  Sorry Star Wars fans, but it's my choice! NOT only that, but The Matrix is a kick-ass, action, thriller rollercoaster while The Phantom Menace is a mild, kind of thrilling, joy-ride.",The Matrix

A movie that could almost be labelled ""forcefully entertaining"" and definitely a very thought provoking creature. It has something for every modern sf fan. Digital fuzz and cyberculture are well in the mix.The basic ideal of science fiction media is that it should make you think. This film made me think. In modern moviemaking special effects should be used when required, but not to a point where they prove distracting. The effects support this film very well. In fact they are original and at times groundbreaking.There are definitely some bad points. No movie is perfect. The acting and characterization are weak and detached - like Star Trek:Insurrection, but unlike Insurrection this film has a mind of its own and massages your brain cells regularly.Particularly, Fishburne is the biggest culprit of mediocrity in this department, someone who tries to be the modern/cyber Buddha but ends up lacking any kind of personality or genuine warmth whatsoever. But you wonder if this is just Fishburne as he is - certainly watching interviews prior to seeing the film he appears at best ""disinterested"".Some have said that this movie is confusing. Perhaps these people arent really confused, maybe they just ""dont get it"". Maybe they are trying too hard to ""answer"" what the film is about. But I dont think this movie is meant to answer all those little niggling questions, it poses questions and leaves you to figure them out. Very much like Chris Carter's The X files tv series.Some have said this movie borrows from other movies. What movie doesnt ? Like much of modern media, nothing is completely original these days, certainly most of the original sf based movie ideas are long gone. The sf book market is a prime example of rehash and sequel overkill.Some laugh at the special effects. Particularly the fight sequences. Oh that's silly ! How can he/she just hang in the air like that ? Why do those characters talk like that ? Thats not very realistic ! All I can say is that these guys are either completely missing the point or arent really sf fans. Firstly this movie is sci-fi not sci-real and secondly follow the story god-dammit !This film washes over you. It submerges you in its world. Its beats you into submission. Its cooler than anything you can possibly imagine. It blows you away and before you have recovered asks you the meaning of life. Catch my drift ? Its a movie with a statement purposely built to be customised into what *you* want to make it.Its not eye candy because it pokes your mind too often.",The Matrix
2082,MrTrees,The Matrix: Battle Against Sleep,2,26 December 1999,"I hate to be completely negative about a film, but this was truly, truly, truly awful.Remember how Bound looked like the Coen Brothers had cross-bred with David Lynch and some how lost their film making talent on the way? Well, this is like James Cameron, David Fincher and John Woo mixed in a blender with The Terminator, an old Doctor Who story about people on trial in a computer generated world (which was called The Matrix) and some really bad ideas.Where can we start? The plot is a mess, the acting is terrible all round, the directing is plagiarized beyond belief, it lacks any new ideas, the atmosphere is about as enjoyable as the pause following a doctor telling a patient they've got a terminal disease and - the clincher, because you can get away with most of those things - it is truly boring. At no point did I actually believe Keanu Reeves was in any real danger.As for Keanu Reeves new found (according to some) 'acting' skill, the only reason he looks good is because the rest of the cast is so bad you could make coffee tables out of them.This is quick fix blasting action for the idiot generation. To say that the two people next to me fell asleep about half way through says it all. I just wish I could have joined them, and missed out on the terrible, macho ending.",The Matrix
2083,Observer-12,Awesome execution of a fundamentally flawed concept.,9,26 May 1999,"If you like science fiction then this film should definitely be on your top ten.  I give the movie a 9/10 rating.  The special effects were good (but not nearly enough of them) and blended extremely well with the scenes.What I like most about The Matrix: Laurence Fishbourne; Well-thought out story; Better execution of the story than any movie of its genre ever attempted.What I like least about the Matrix: Too few action scenes and special effects;  The premise--I still don't think that it is possible to virtually generate ""reality"" down to the level required.  After all, reality is a very individual experience; so you would have to fake it for everyone.",The Matrix

Well, I thought this movie was much more believable overall.  Not a bad feat for a sci-fi flick.  I've read several negative reviews by other imdb members, notably one that said the matrix was trying to be a William Gibson novel movie.  I found pretty much everything this person wrote to be unsubstantiated gibberish.  I'm not sure what the author would have done differently had he/she (I don't know any females this bitter) been given the script and budget... but I bet it would resemble ""Wing Commander.""",The Matrix
2085,Bruno-54,"The perfect mix between ""Alice in the Wonderland"" and ""T2""",10,30 May 1999,"I see no use in describing the story of ""The Matrix"", so let's jump straight to the point. I didn't expect ""The Matrix"" to be that good. I just walked in to find a very thrilling movie, full of action and amazing visual effects.The actors are doing pretty well too, and Hugo Weaving is the ultimate perfect villain... I haven't seen such evil character since Darth Vader and, more recently, The Fratelli Family (""The Goonies""). There are also good and sharp quotations from The Bible, showing Neo as the savior and Morfeus as John Baptiste, the annunciator. It's also a point showed in ""Bram Stoker's Dracula"", where Renfield shouts the arrival of his master, the AntiChrist. So, if I were you, I would follow the White Rabbit to the closest movie room and watch ""The Matrix"". You won't be disappointed.",The Matrix
2086,Nadal;-),this is the one,10,22 June 1999,"keanu reeves is the one, and i'm telling you that this film is the one. Just imagine combing the best gun fights with good kung fu and a gripping plot, and you have the matrix in a nut shell. the film is made by the most amazing special effects you'll witness for a long time, and it is these that make the gun fights seem in a class of their own. For those in the know, you'll be happy to hear that for raw creative inspiration, john woo still has better gun fights, but it is only through the massive budget and presence of computer generated special effects that the matrix seems to have better gun fights.this is the best film ever",The Matrix

First of all, the direction and camera work was extremely well done - the changes from slo-mo and back work very well. The story is good, entertaining, and insightful. But, I hear you say, what about Keanu Reeves? The man can't act! Well, I wasn't even thinking about Johnny Mnemonic, but it doesn't matter because he helps the film superbly. The action sequences are great, but the fight scenes are just mindblowing. A great film, go see it now.",The Matrix

For a vastly superior film with virtually the same plot, check out Dark City, starring the marvelous Rufus Sewall and William Hurt.",The Matrix
2090,rhomp,"""The Matrix"" left me speechless.",10,17 June 1999,"Having read many positive reviews of ""The Matrix"", all of them intelligent and succinctly written, I feel that I am finally able to put my own feeble thoughts into words.First off I should say that I absolutely LOVED this movie!  I've seen ""The Matrix"" four times and still can't get enough of it.  Going in the first time with little expectations of a plot, I was pleasantly surprised to find a compelling and thought-provoking story.  Initially, I chalked up my enjoyment to the fact that I got a little more than I'd expected, and had been temporarily overwhelmed.  Upon second viewing, however, I was struck by it even more.  It seemed so plausible because everything 'fit' so well. The story, the mood, the actors, the dialogue.  It just grabbed me as a whole. Made me want to be there.  To believe it.  To experience it for myself. And I realized, any movie I've ever really loved, I've never been able to say why in any coherent fashion.  ""The Matrix"" left me speechless.  It just blew me away.One specific thing I'd like to comment on, which only occurred to me after viewing number four, seems strange even to myself.  The main characters, for all their Kung-Fu training and gun-wielding antics, seemed hauntingly, and somehow appropriately, gentle.  As if they were compensating for, through their interactions with each other, the violence they had to endure - and even perpetrate - elsewhere.  The juxtaposition of human emotion and technological horror during the final climax was especially poignant. Although I'd be inclined to give the lion's share of the credit for this to the actors, the Wachowski Brothers provided them with stunning material to work with and through.Just another of the many twists to ponder in ""The Matrix"".  So go see it a few times.  It's well worth the $8.75 several times over.",The Matrix
2091,Glenn-44,"Forget what you think you know, and follow the white rabbit...",10,30 December 1999,"Released at the same time (ish) as Star Wars Episode 1, it was predicted that the Sci Fi effects fest of star was would capture the imagination of all people. But no - the real star of 1999, and the best Sci-Fi film of the 90's is The Matrix, a fast moving, heart stopping visual treat, which keeps you on the edge of your seat. Buy the DVD, there are some great extras on it. Top film, and it's not a NO BRAINER",The Matrix
2092,dan-310,Very slick and very cool,10,23 June 1999,"The Matrix is one if not the coolest movie of the millennium providing the audience with plenty of high adrenaline action and spectacular SFX, also the new flow cam technique adds to the coolness! Unbelievable!!",The Matrix
2093,Neo-99,"""There is no spoon.....""",10,14 July 1999,"One of those films that you just have to see again straight away, (or as soon as is possible).  What can you say about this films impact on the Leather market and what it has done for Erricson phones?  The soundtrack, remarkable.  Laurence Fishburne, astounding.

Definitely a film for our generation!",The Matrix
2094,Minook,an intellectual masterpiece,9,10 July 1999,"this film is magnificent. it makes you drop your jaw, it makes you cringe, and it makes think. the special effects in this movie are extraordinary. on the downside, it does lose some of its audience due to complication. but if you have any brain power, and enjoy using it, then i definitely recommend you see it. you'll be disturbed, amazed, and quite possibly, paranoid as a result. either way, this is truly a wonderful thrill-ride of a movie worth giving a look. i give it a 9.",The Matrix
2095,ChrisC-8,"So, is the biggest action films of the summer really that good?",9,12 July 1999,"""What is the Matrix? You have to see it for yourself."" And he's quite right, you do. These words spoken by Morpheus (Lawrence Fishburne) were what convinced me to see the film, unsure of what to expect from it. Braindead summer blockbuster it is not - far from it. It is one of the most thought-provoking films of it's kind that I have seen - well written and directed by the Wachowski Brothers with some really impressive visuals. Thomas Anderson, nicknamed Neo (Keanu Reeves), a computer hacker, is tracked down by Morpheus, a well-known terrorist and is offered a chance to discover the greatest conspiracy ever imaginable. But, he is told, he can never return to his normal life and must help to save the world against the agents who are concealing the secret. That's all I'll say about the intriguing, if somewhat far-fetched plot, because to say too much would ruin the experience. This is one incredibly fast-paced film, boasting so much action it'll blow you away. At its heart, it is a science-fiction thriller, but The Matrix is much more chic than you might expect. Complete with black leather outfits and dark sunglasses, Neo and fellow world-saver Trinity (Carrie-Anne Moss) fight their way through many an action sequence, some unbelievably over-the-top, and manage to look so calm at the end of it. Although quite a dark and violent film, the script allows for some humour to lighten the mood every once in a while, and with a climax with more guns, bullets and explosions than any war film, this has got to be the best action film of the year.",The Matrix
2096,Daniel-107,Bondage and Freedom,10,17 July 1999,"Not that the film needs any help -- it's a masterpiece -- but still it does help to see Bound by the Brothers W.  They lay out their themes there, plain to see.  Trust, for one.  How can two people trust each other?  The Ws say, if they feel they're the same person.  Bondage and freedom, for another theme.  But that's developed more in The Matrix.  Here we have a captive humanity held in check by the AI -- the government, essentially (in Bound, the oppressor's name is Caesar) -- and freed by the forces of Zion (a spiritual reality that frees the mind from illusion).  Neo and Trinity, who look alike (the One and the Three, reminiscent of ""one God in three persons""), share a trust and a love that gives them the final liberation. The conceptual structure builds out from there with remarkable discipline. Now, can the Ws keep this up for the two remaining episodes of the trilogy?",The Matrix
2097,JrLaw,Could it be any better?,10,24 July 1999,"This movie is marvelous.  The effects are unbelievable.  The sound is excellent.  The action is great.  Even if you don't like Keanu Reeves (I know so many who make fun of him), you would probably still like this movie. The story is one of the most original I've seen in a long time.  The theme may not be entirely new (boy meets girl, girl loves boy, boy saves world). About time actors finally did their own stunts, it makes for a great and seemless movie.  No need to hide the actors, or digitally replace faces. It also makes the fight scenes that much better.  Seen it more than 10 times now, and only found one thing wrong with the film (usually find many errors in most movies).  Definitely see this one, I know i'm getting it on DVD as soon as it comes out.",The Matrix
2098,Maverick-90,There is no spoon,10,21 July 1999,"A speed-fuelled, retina-bending sci-fi juggernaught that proves why films have to seen in a BIG screen. The plot is almost insignificant compared to the riot of flashy visuals, flo-mo and Zen-lite dialogue but provides a semi-original concept that the Wachowski brothers exploit to the full. Keanu is superbly confused as the hacker seeking a higher meaning to life and unable to believe he can be the One that Carrie-Ann Moss, Laurence Fishburne and crew have been searching for. Hugo Weaving matches them well as the obsessed Agent/program, leading up to a genuinely inspired face-off finale with plenty of visual fireworks and striking imagery. Even better the second time round, this sets a new standard in the genre and must be giving George Lucas pause for thought when he starts coming up with his next prequel.",The Matrix
2099,Patrick-84,"Nothing new, except bad acting",3,22 July 1999,"I went to see this movie based on the ratings and comments at IMDb. I can't believe this movie got as high a ranking: there's no originality at all (everything in it has already been done). Above that there's the (in my opinion) very bad acting. I was so bored I even fell asleep for 15 minutes. And on top of all this we get the usual 'message to the world', which seems to be obligatory in every American movie nowadays. I do admit: some of the special effects were not bad, that's why I rated it 3. The other theater was showing 'The Mummy': I think I should have gone there.",The Matrix
2100,KAOsinsk,A special effects outing,3,29 November 1999,"An interesting premise which fails to live up to its promise. The apparent super-human abilities of the film's protagonists are a result of human will-power overcoming the machine.Unfortunately, the script is predictable, the design not as stylish as the ads would have us believe, and the visual effects inappropriate. It relies too much on special effects. The film gives the impression that it is simply a vehicle for someone to show off a new technique. The resulting scenes are pretty, but fail to maintain the suspension of disbelief so essential to the successful use of visual effects.It tries, but fails miserably, to be thought provoking. Instead, it is merely irritating. A disappointing film which would have been better aimed at an older audience.",The Matrix

2102,Morfeo,Have you thought about it?,10,1 August 1999,"The movie is great.  There are some details, hard to understand, that make the movie even better.  For example, for us martial arts fans,  it was incredible to see how Neo's kung-fu related directly to Bruce Lee's (for example, the part when he gets the blood off his mouth, and moves his hand. Its the exact move Bruce does in the movie ""Enter the Dragon"").  There is another example:  Has anybody thought about why is Morpheus named that way, just as the ancient Greek ""Dream God""? These are the kind of things directors introduce, and not many people see.Another great thing, is the clothing. Its excellent!  I think it got most of my attention.",The Matrix

Personally, I watched The Matrix over 10 times, and watched particular parts of it many more than that. It made me start acting out scenes from it, in an almost obsessive manner. This movie, in short, was a movie that really touched me. It has great action, so it's good as an action feature alone, and it's also deep, which is a quality many other action films don't have. Two specific things I'd like to say about The Matrix: 1. It presents a problem that could exist here and now, in our world, without any way to discover it, which makes the viewer face this as a deep philosophical problem. 2. It presents the journey the hero goes through, from ignorance to full awareness and power, in a way that makes you ""connect"" to the film and to the hero very much.I liked it, go see it :)",The Matrix

Lead by a solid story and excellect direction the film goes from jaw dropping effect to stark thought.It's good to see a film which was lauched UK side with minimal promotion make such a huge impact, I had heard so many rumours of this script and it's effects it made the films a must go, now I am just counting the days until Matrix 2, Then Matrix 3 completes the story.

And also Keanu Reeves' and Laurance Fishburne's performances were perfect, especially Fishburne's, He was excellent,I admired his talent. The Matrix is unique,it fits no other category, it has created its own category.

2126,ericksondj,"Bring on Matrix 2 and 3, Andy and Larry!",9,30 May 2000,"THE MATRIX is an masterful blend of Hong Kong-style Kung Fu, William Gibsonesque cyberpunk, and hyperkinetic John Woo gunplay -- with a generous dash of the existentialist paranoia of Philip K. Dick and Franz Kafka just to keep things interesting! THE MATRIX is the most compelling, mind-bending, and entertaining movie I've seen in years, one of the few films of the 90s I've seen more than six times, each time revealing a deeper level of complexity. The cast is pretty good (even professional wooden Indian Keanu Reeves, who's actually -- and surprisingly -- above-average in this film), the special effects are dazzling and beautiful, the direction is amazing (a synthesis of the best techniques of John Woo and James Cameron, it seems), and the over-all look and design of the movie is attractive in a dark, ominous kind of way (the world outside the matrix reminded me of something H.R. Giger of ALIEN fame might have designed).The film isn't flawless, however. In the interest of constructive criticism here are some of my pet peeves: dialogue which rarely transcends the perfunctory, minimal character development, and Trinity's diminished (and subordinate) role in the second and third acts, which was surprising to me considering Bros. Wachowski's excellent treatment of female characters in their debut film, BOUND (another excellent movie, IMHO).Bring on Matrix 2 and 3, Andy and Larry!3 1/2 out of 4 stars / 9 out of 10 / Thumbs Up ...

Maybe people like bad acting, cheesy and crappy (also boring) fight scenes, a plot that isn't carried through at all, horrible scripting, and visual efffects that are far from original (check out blade runner if you want good visual effects).  Personally, this film was just ok, but the way it had been over-hyped and everyone saying its the greatest movie ever, it just made me give the film a 1 on a scale of 10.Keanu Reeves looks like a gimp wearing a cast around his neck, and still can't spout a convincing word of dialouge, in this film.  Lawrence Fishburn gives the worst performance of his career, but he gets praised for it. the wakouski brothers claim themselves as original, but the film easily ripped off John Woo films and Blade Runner.The worst thing about this is, is that everyone's IQ dropped ten points after watching this load of garbage.  It plays you for an idiot.  It actually tries to make you think that Keanu's not ""the one"" so it can try to keep some sort of suspense.  But when you start falling asleep through scenes that could have been cut out, it throws in an action sequence not needed just to keep you awake.

Sure, a few visual and plot devices were used to represent a society being operated by a totalitarian remote, and that may constitute symbolism, but the principles are at work in the world around us every minute of every day.  I am slightly concerned that this movie leads people to believe it was more a sci-fi story with a social commentary, than it was a simple observation of society and how it actually works.The whole post-apocalyptic messiah story is more than a bit tired, it's on life support, but that detracted little from the movie for me - Keanu needs to be the chosen one, aw, let him pretend.Where the movie disappointed was in its degeneration from a thoughtful and interesting and visually spiffy romp through the concerns of the oppressed masses into a string of Starsky and Hutch chase scenes climaxing in a hail of gunfire.Is a yank movie somehow incomplete without that seemingly requisite ""only the NRA has the final solution to save the universe and that answer is limitless ammo"" message?  Chucky ""God loves guns"" Heston must have creamed his jeans when he saw all the big bang-bangs.If you can forgive the individualist-supremacy hammer that the end of the movie hits you in the face with, it's great.Fortunately, I can suspend that disbelief just because of the quality of the story, concepts, observations and execution of everything =up to= the denouement.

2134,dkf-2,Great concept - movie fell short on the execution,4,16 December 2001,"The special effects in ""The Matrix"" were spellbinding.  Keanu Reeves and Laurence Fishburne weren't exactly suburb actors in the film, but they weren't exactly bad either.  But I feel this movie lacks one principle that makes a great movie: great writing.  Laurence Fishburne as Morpheus walks Neo (portrayed by Keanu Reeves) through a lot of discussion of what the matrix is, in the middle of the film.  This fits into the category of 'exposition', a definite problem with script writing.  It would have been better if the character Neo would have been involved with more drama while actually figuring out what the matrix is.  In a movie like ""Star Wars"", the characters are placed in a setting unlike our world...""In a galaxy far, far away.""  The action in ""Star Wars"" moves from one scene to another without the characters stopping whatever they're doing, then sitting around and explaining how the Millennium Falcon jumps to light speed or how the Death Star destroys planets...the viewer actually sees the stars race across the screen as the Millennium Falcon gets away from the Empire fighters, and see how Princess Lea painfully watches her own planet get destroyed.  In ""The Matrix"", besides the long scene that gets bogged down by exposition, there isn't much to character development.  If you take away all the amazing special effects, there wasn't that much in the script to hold the characters together.  I am bothered how this movie is considered a ""thinking man's sci-fi thriller"".  After all I just said, I really didn't feel this movie lived up to that promise.",The Matrix

(the future controlled by robots, where have we heard that one before?)Its a great film for the visuals, I've seen more thoughtful films and it isn't perfect, I think some things are overrated, I don't buy into this c**p that it makes you question your existence and is the most intelligent film, but I think that people who say its the worst film they've seen are just coming down harsh on it because it was more impressive then Episode 1, or because of the hype, don't believe the hype, go and see the film and make your own mind up.

I should have discovered that it stole too much from other genres. (Like ""The Ghost In The Shell"" which is an Anime movie (really great!) from 1995!! And it contains the ""greenish"" program code all over the movie.)Or i should have discovered that these very cool (i mean it!) special effects WERE actually stolen too, because those were animated in those manga (or call it Anime) films before. All they had to do is to make it real, not pencil drawn.I'm a bit disappointed, because Matrix was my favorite movie (and still is) but I give it an 8 out of 10 now, after seeing ""The Ghost In The Shell""... Man, the flying scene, where the agent lands on the rooftop, and stands up, that's EXACTLY what Major Kusanagi did in ""The Ghost In The Shell"".4 years before The Matrix... And I think.. That's a shame. :-)Matrix rocks. It's still very good. I'm just asking myself: Why can't a REALLY good looking movie contain original ideas?!There are 10 out of 10 films out there...

2149,andyterry,An annoying sermon,5,6 March 2011,"I guess everyone has once seen a church service young American denominations-style. It's like female choir is singing, someone's playing synth or guitar, and a priest in front of them shouts ""God is love"", and ""Jesus loves you."" The lambs shout back these things and all other stuff which is familiar to everyone who has heard something of Christianity.""The Matrix"" has very much in common with such ceremonies. An action movie with an original aesthetics and slow motion can be interesting to watch, just like listening to gospels is sometimes an unalloyed pleasure. But the problem about ""The Matrix"" is its annoying sermon. With an incredible solemnity and wannabe-prophetical intonation we're fed with an alloy of the most common places philosophy knows. The famous ""There is no spoon"" phrase - Neo's pupils widen, now he understands everything. A stupid watcher is supposed here to make two or three thinking operations and feel satisfacted for being smart. The intention is simple - or I give too much credit for Wachowskis, maybe this half- philosophy is really the ultimate one for them.It's possible to associate solipsism and platonism with a modern virtual reality concept cleverly and softly. Wachowskis, however, do it boldly and pushily. Even the spoon quote is not enough, they also use messiah figure, i.e. Neo himself. Now it's a serious business. Neo's gonna show people what they don't wanna see (quote-unquote). The film starts to fail in amusement at once because Neo hogs the story's blanket; however, film's grandiloquence increases to an unbelievable level.Thus, ""The Matrix"" is an example of movie which is trying to seem what it's not. Wachowskis try to insert their simple story of people in stylish black coats into as many classical contexts as possible: here we have Nebuchdenazzar, and messiah, and also Morpheus, - whilst the ideological concept is more like of a high school student's essay on a subject of philosophy, compiled in one night before deadline. That's what is the word ""tedious"" exists.Nevertheless, it occurred to be the rightest thing. (By the way, effectiveness of such model is well-known: in literature it's exploited by Richard Bach and Paolo Coelho, to name a few.) More than ten years have passed, and still millions of Wachowskis' lambs singing and dancing, and repeating whatever the siblings say. ""There is no spoon,"" chant Wachowskis. ""There is no spoon,"" echoes the congregation deliriously.",The Matrix
2150,Ashrith26,"Good, but highly overrated.",7,17 April 2021,"First of all, the movie isn't that bad to watch. It would be a genuine delight to sci-fi lovers. But I don't think it deserves a 8.7 rating and a place in the IMDb top 20.One thing that doesn't delight me is that the main strength of the movie which is about the computer simulation isn't an original idea. There have been lots of theories regarding it. And the plot is very simple with many plot holes. Neo as the chosen one isn't portrayed correctly. I see no special abilities in him.Fights were really silly and were too long where you get bored and just want to skip them and I see no reason why trinity fell in love with neo when they didn't spend any time together at all , just because a fortune teller told her that she would fell in love with the chosen one , is it how emotions work? Well , I don't think so.Apart from these there are a bunch of positive things too. Special effects were awesome considering that this movie came out in 1999. The idea of the story is innovative for Hollywood and matrix came out in era where there isn't much interest in sci-fi among filmmakers while the thrillers ruled them. So these things made it highly rated back then in 1999.

2152,TheRealErtai,Incredible Depth.,10,13 August 2001,"""The Matrix"" is a must-see for anyone who has an interest movies.  `The Matrix' has excellent acting/cinematography, a deep plot, character depth/development, suspenseful/thrilling moments, incredible action sequences with great special effects, and loads of symbolism.The plot revolves around Neo(Keanu Reeves) who `lives two lives'.  By day he is Thomas A. Anderson, a program writter for a software company.  By night he is Neo a computer hacker who has broken many laws.  It all begins when Neo is contacted by a mysterious man named Morpheus(Lawrence Fishburne), who is the leader of a rebel group.  Neo is then told the true nature of his reality.  All of the characters are portrayed excellently and are in no way your ordinary heros and villains.  Contrary to popular belief `The Matrix' did NOT rip-off `Dark City'.  There are a few similarities but not enough the mean anything.`The Matrix' proves that plot can aid action sequences.  Similar special effects are used in different movies but never had an explanation.  The martial arts scenes are done rather well considering none of the actors actually knew much martial arts.  The wirework is done excellently with only one noticeable flaw: the characters go flying back too slow and their feet shake.  All of the fight scenes are choreographed to near-perfection.Overall `The Matrix' is a masterpiece. Almost anyone who sees it with an open mind and understands the plot will like it.  I've heard various reasons why people say they didn't like it.  Many say they don't like it because it is too fake or unrealistic.  They need to realize that it's a science fiction movie and that nothing said `Based on a true story.'  Others say the plot is bad.  If they say that I doubt they understood it.  Many don't like Keanu Reeves. Well true that he hasn't had many great performances but his performance is exceptional in `The Matrix'.In the end `The Matrix' is probably the deepest, most entertaining, and most exceptional movie you can watch and will keep you captivated the whole time, then keep bringing you back to watch it again and again.",The Matrix

Its a dark future for humanity where we created a AI that we ended up fighting a war against, a war we lost.The main character is Neo, a normal person who has a strong belief there is something wrong with the world he lives in. He cant put his finger on it but he is searching for something, what is unclear to him.The antagonist is a agent who hates humans, he see them as a virus who contaminate everything they touch.

I heard such comments as ""man, this movie will mess with your mind!"", ""I still don't understand it"", ""you have to watch it a few times to get it"", and many variations on ""the special effects are awesome!"".  I consider myself to be a fan of mind-benders, and the occasional sweet special effect is always welcome in my book.  So I go and see The Matrix.  In my first viewing, I literally fell asleep.  Now, you must be wondering how a person could possibly fall asleep watching such an action packed film.  It was easy.  The action just doesn't do it for me. You might also wonder why I would write a review for a movie I didn't see in it's entirety.  Actually, I rented it on DVD and sat through the whole thing months later.  I have many large complaints with The Matrix.  Let's start with the whole ""mind-bender"" thing.  A psychological thriller this is not. In fact, the fairly unoriginal concepts behind the story are presented in the first 20 minutes or so, and then pretty much never mentioned again. This movie will not keep anyone thinking unless they are incredibly stupid and can't get past the first 20 minutes.  The special effects and the visuals in general are indeed spectacular.  Good for them.  That doesn't do a whole lot for me when there is no substance to back them up.  The Matrix, as a whole, is an exercise in style over substance.  In all fairness, it is very stylish.  Here's the main problem: the movie does about 20 minutes of posing as a psychological thriller (as the trailers would have you believe), and then drops you off into the realm of sci-fi and video game violence. The characters basically just start fighting, running, and shooting things. It feels every bit as stupid and pointless as the next action movie.  The only saving grace is the fact that it is much prettier than the next action movie.  Once again, eye candy is the key to this movie.  Although it seems to easy, I will rail on Keanu Reeves performance in The Matrix.  Well, actually, the only thing that can be said about it is that it was weak (like all Keanu's performances, I suppose).  Fortunately, it won't distract most viewers from all the cool explosions, gun shots, and camera tricks.In summation, don't go in expecting an intelligent movie, you'll be disappointed.  However, if you enjoy action, special effects, or sci-fi stuff in general, then I find it hard not to recommend this movie to you. I guess when it comes down to it, special effects and action aren't my thing. I need a little more substance.",The Matrix

What differentiates it from your typical, run of the mill, enjoyable action movie?  Nothing, except maybe that horridness that is Keanu Reeves....  The action sequences are pretty nice, I'll give you that. But if you want to watch really good action sequences go rent some old-school chinese movies.  Or even new ones.  Those have the coolest fight scenes imaginable. And the special affects, they were nice, oo, aah...  But all they were was eye-candy.  They were not the kind of special affects that are so good you don't notice them.  Those are the best kind of effects, they mesh with the movie so well that they don't distract from the plot, of course The Matrix doesn't really have a plot. The movie tries to be Cyberpunk, it's based on the novel by William Gibson who is a fantastic writer, so I have to assume that the novel is good.  But this movie tries to sort of ask about virtual reality and ""where are we headed?"" and so forth, but it does it so poorly where so many others have done well.  Try reading (that's right, _reading_ Gasp!) Otherland, or Neuromancer, or the Diamond Age or Snow Crash or any of the great cyberpunk novels if you want to know what this movie should have been. Or even some movies, like eXistenZ which is not really as like the Matrix as some people would have you believe.  Anyway, that's my two cents.",The Matrix

Only at the end of the movie does he become the strong savior that so many other movies thrust at you within the first few scenes. Oddly, despite the fact that this movie rates among my top 10 of all time, I don't consider any of the individual performances to be Oscar quality.

2175,dhyvdking,The Must-Watch Film for Thinking Minds,10,5 February 2008,"Believe it or not, in 2008, I still know people who have never watched The Matrix (released 1999). Well, just one person... who may not even be human, but that's part of my point: all thinking people should watch this movie.It popularized ""bullet time"" special effects, which would then be used in movies such as Swordfish, and video games such as Max Payne and, more recently, Stranglehold.Although not directly related to William Gibson (the coiner of the phrase ""cyberspace"" and one of the more respected English-language Cyberpunk-genre authors), he would go on to comment that the virtual reality portrayed in the matrix was as exact as he could have envisioned it when he was writing his novels.Thusly, people who think about life and the ""digital era"", will tend to identify on some level with the story, characters, and even virtual worlds presented in the series, but esp. is this the first one (I'm not a fan of the two sequels, but that's another story).Although I marked this as containing spoilers, I'm not going to really go into the plot... but if you haven't watched it yet, then my description may make it seem more philosophical than it appears; the beauty of this movie is that it is, superficially, an action-packed drama where you care about the characters, and can admire both the ""good guys"" and the Agents.Moreover, the fun and freedom of interacting with a virtual world is well presented; as are the consequences of becoming too ... attached, or sympathetic, with a game-world (or perhaps, even reality).On another level, this movie is about how the ""new world order"", which is really just the same old Imperial world order, just with shiny computers to dazzle the mortals, imprisons the minds of the ""mature"" (it is mentioned that people over a certain age usually cannot ever truly adapt to seeing the world as it truly is), and also makes them skitsophrenic (i.e. potential Agents) and prone to flashes of violence against free-thinkers.This and Fight Club are very deep movies, on some level... but this is also an intense action and special effects masterpiece which still looks great even after almost a decade. It sounds great too; the ""lobby scene"" is a standard for testing surround sound systems subjectively.",The Matrix

The story is none existent and full of rhetorical nonsense that's randomly placed and stolen from philosophers, the acting is pathetic, and I still believe the only reason people like this movie is because they are hypnotized by its ""dazzling"" special effects.  People consider these ground-breaking special effects...no.  Star Wars was ground-breaking, The Matrix is just people fighting for no reason other than to show off their ""great"" CGI.

2178,blake-234,A Sci-Fi Classic.,10,21 December 2011,"The Matrix, some may say the most profound science fiction film in history, we have all seen The Matrix I assume, so we all know how amazing it is and how it can leave you one edge of your seat, with its outstanding cast and ground-breaking visual effects. This film is in my all-time favorite films because of it being so superlative and well basically, entertaining and extraordinary. So for the repulsive, cretins that have not seen this fantastic film, I'll give them a briefing of what it's about.The Matrix starts off with an action-packed scene that leaves us scratching our heads, on what the movie is supposed to be about, but it gradually all comes together. The star of this film is Keanu Reeves, who plays an estranged lost worker in New York, Thomas Anderson, but goes by the online alias Neo, this is all 'supposably' set in the year 1999. Look I won't give too much away but I will tell you this; Neo thinks that something has always been 'different' in the world but he can't explain it, we soon find out the truth about this world and discover what the true reality is.Laurence Fishburne is great in this acting as the all-wise Morpheus, in his comeback performance, alongside some brilliant co-stars such as the Subtle and intimidating Agent Smith played by Hugo Weaving, Carrie Anne-Moss as the prevailing Trinity, Joe Pantoliano as bad guy Cipher, who you may remember as 'Guido The Killer Pimp' in Risky Business.Concluding my review I would like to say that if you watch this film and thoroughly enjoy it, do not, and I repeat do not, watch the sequels to this film, for it will ruin your experience of the original. Nevertheless I give The Matrix 10/10 B-Train Stars. Classic.",The Matrix

With it's intense plot and die-for action, this movie has it all.  For those who are worried about missing good parts of the movie because of those nature calls, you need not worry...you've got a whole hour or so.  The beginning is quite dull, actually so dull, you might wonder how some people can even live through the first 5 minutes of it! After they are done explaining what the whole matrix thing is, then the real action actually starts. This movie is one that is used in many movies (hence the bending backwards and dodging move, not to mention the jump into the air when time seems to stop and then the bad dude gets a bad butt-kicking) Surely, the Matrix Reloaded will be every more exciting then the Matrix for they won't have to go through all that boring junk all over again and can get straight to the action!

The movie takes place in two different worlds.  The real world, which is dark and evil, and the Matrix, which is a computer generated modern day world, which normal people think that they live in.  The only people who know that the Matrix is fake are Morpheus, his band of helpers, the Agents, and now Neo.  The incredible scope and depth of this movie is somewhat overwhelming.  The 'good guys' transport between the two world by way of telephone, which confused me and most likely everyone who has seen it. However the action, the special effects, and the cinematography are beyond amazing, making this one of the coolest action films of all time. Keanu Reeve's acting is definitely not Oscar worthy, but he looks good in his sunglasses and trench coat while flying through the air and taking out tons of guys in the process.  The movie does have a corny ending that then, to some extent, leaves you hanging, however because of the amazing special effects, actions scenes, and creative plot, it's definitely a great movie.",The Matrix
2185,MiguelSoaresMiranda,The Matrix & The brains in a vat,10,12 May 2010,"The Matrix is a really complex movie in which every names and sentences have their metaphoric meanings. Until I was explained about the movie, I didn't really understand it,honestly it was simply kung fu! However,I can see now its truly depth.The philosophic idea ""Brains in a vat"" says that we can never be aware whether we are human beings with corpse and mind who live in our lovely planet, or single minds connected to computers that send to our brains all the information to cause on us feelings and emotions. By taking in consideration the latter explanation we fall into a skepticism since we have no idea of how we can find the truth, moreover, we've no idea which reality is the truth. This idea is also quite similar to Descarte's malin génie. According to the philosopher we can't be sure of anything since there is a sort of an evil genius capable of making us falling into mistake and also willing to do it. In this case the Evil Genius (aka malin génie) has the same role as the computers in ""Brains in a vat"".The movie The Matrix explores the same idea. Thomas Anderson (Neo) was a computer hacker who thought to be living in a real world. However, Morpheus and his crew come to the fantasy world (called the Matrix) to rescue him. In this recent version the human beings are prisoners of Artificial Intelligence in order to supply energy to the machines. Humans are connected to computers who integrate them in a fantasy world or a dream called The Matrix. The machines are the computers and the Evil genius simultaneously who make us living in dream. After Morpheus rescuing Neo (anagram for the ONE), he explains him how Matrix works and how to survive inside it: the more you believe it doesn't the exist, more are the rules you are capable of breaking. If you believe you're living your own dream you can do whatever you want. This is how Neo learns Kong Fu, stop bullets and reborns after being killed. This idea is also present in the classic Alice in Wonderland. After some research I started understanding most of the movie but the Smits were still a mystery for me... I didn't take much longer until i figure it out. The agents are the ones who avoid people of finding the truth. As soon as someone starts to ration the agents interfer in order to kill them and keep the ignorance around.What else can we say about the movie? Well a lot more apart from it being a trilogy which includes a lot more information and symbols. Definitely this is a must see movie who will provide you a wonderful time as it has the perfect balance between action, plot and philosophic context.",The Matrix

Yes, the special effects are incredible, and the plot is very unique, and the action scenes are good, and the acting is surprisingly good for this type of film.

And for those who don't like it, the fact that a violent movie is actually good for once causes one to overlook the violence and appreciate the movie for what it is.

On release I was merely a teenager, ironically not completely unlike 'Neo' as I was subjected to the hype from other hackers online since I were a programmer and hacker, at least by night. Student by day although I can't say I didn't do some hacking in school from time to time! I'm not talking as much about the character depth development and I'm not looking for hidden philosophies when I admire the perfection I experienced when I first watched this film.

Not even realism (usually important for a geek like I) was in doubt as this aesthetically, cinematographically* and technologically groundbreaking Platonistic masterpiece surpassed all expectations and turned into something above and beyond what is possible to dislike as it's more likely close to a life-changingly ecstasy and truly original. Most certainly capable of being inspiring, you want to watch it over and over again.

The style, atmosphere, cinematographic techniques and thoroughly thought trough yet somehow tastefully, sexy minimalism is present in almost all major films produced today. To break it down in components:
Aesthetics Camera work and post filming techniquesThe use of music that fits the atmosphere of the scene whether you like that particular music or notThe digital ""feel"" that often isn't that digital and often is when you wouldn't believe it.The absurd level of detail and dedication put into every aspect of every part of the production. From props, dust, textiles and filter to the spotless chrome or endless seemingly roofless places.An innocent yet particular likeness to both the architecture, clothing, and so forth of the NSDAP (Hitler's party in Germany) and Hugo Boss timeless designs, then as now. The list goes on but a lot of these points were unique to The Matrix and the original film that used them all together impacted the world. 
Actor performance?
Few actors have impressed an audience, colleges, directors and crew the way Keanu Reeves have.I'm talking about Reeves amongst extremely well performed actors such as Laurence Fishburne and Hugo Weaving. 
 Both in terms of thespians with an intensive presence and the art of mastering complicated choreography, partially thanks to the Martial Art Institute representatives such as the ""kung fu team: Hong Kong"" members: Yuen Eagle Shun Yi, Woo-Ping Yuen, Daxing Zhang. They did an extraordinarily good job on such a short notice and that's probably partially because of the actors dedication to aim for perfection. I should know. I am a Wing Chun Kung Fu examined and graduated certified trainer and I bow in honor to the KFT:HK as I acknowledge their superiority in their ways as trainers, showing I have yet more to learn.

The cinema had two parallel shows; The Matrix and The Mummy. We debated for a while which one to chose (he was more than twice my age at the time), he voting for the Mummy, since he knew that story (he thought) from his own matinées growing up. I had heard just rumor about these two movies, and only knew that I wasn't very keen on a classical matinée (being 29 at the time). So we went to see The Matrix...When we left the cinema two hours later, we were both silent. What had we just seen? Slowly we started talking about the movie experience we had just had, or rather, I did. My older friend was very confused, and I think regretted a little that we hadn't seen The Mummy instead. I on the other hand, got more and more excited. My first impressions were of course the special effects, what I learned to be the so called Bullet Time, in the movie. But the more we talked about it, the more the story of this fantastic action movie became the center of discussion.Yes, the STORY. It spoke to me in so many and interesting ways, I don't even think I understood on that walk home from town. An action movie with so much dialogue, it just doesn't compute! And with so many layers of philosophy, religion, science (fiction) and just pure intelligence, it's not supposed to be in an action movie. Period. Never before (maybe once, with Baraka) has a movie added to and completed my view of life, the Universe and Everything...

Some famous quotes have made their place in literature about this concept. (Such as 'There is no spoon' or 'If real is what you can feel, smell, taste and see, then 'real' is simply electrical signals interpreted by your brain').

It actually represents a realistic probobility of what would happen if dependence on machines increases. Well that's what every sci-fi film does you might say but the greatness in this film is all the characters and the plot holes he uses are mythological and real. That blew me off.Frankly when I first saw it on the theatre with my parents i couldn't understand much. It was only after three times viewing I had begun to love the beauty of every frame in it. Every time one sees he learns a bit more. The cast is perfect. Keano Reeves as Neo, Lawrence Fishburne as Morpheous, and who could forget the macho-looking Carrie Anne Moss as Trinity. i think she has made a mark in her career through this film.

It has characters that I cared about. From Keanu Reeves' excellent portrayal of Neo, the man trying to come to grips with his own identity, to Lawrence Fishburne's mysterious Morpheus, and even the creepy Agents, everyone does a stellar job of making their characters more than just the usual action ""hero that kicks butt"" and ""cannon fodder"" roles. I cared about each and every one of the heroes, and hated the villains with a passion. It has a plot, and it has a meaning...and lo and behold, a plot does help the fight scenes! Just try it, if you haven't seen the movie before. Watch one of the fight scenes. Then watch the whole movie. There's a big difference in the feeling and excitement of the scenes- sure, they're great as standalones, but the whole thing put together is an experience unlike just about everything else that's come to the theaters.

2196,Grumpy_Old_Man,Technically astonishing action? Philosophical text? Conspiracy thriller? Pop culture pastiche? How about all four?,10,14 August 2007,"There is little to be said about The Matrix that hasn't already been said, but I stand it up with Fight Club and Network as one of the most important and rational pieces of cinema to emerge in decades. The many relevant ideas and wisdoms expressed are still resonating throughout society and creating debate. Unlike many modern blockbusters, the effects and battles are astonishing eye candy, but are always backed up by plot or symbolism, image by image. The viewer can spot many references to anime and other media texts, creating both a subconscious landscape for the audience and inviting them to go deeper. The more-than-competent acting (yes, even Keanu), and stylish techno-green production design are just the icing on the cake for this incredible piece of work that demands multiple viewings.A word on the sequels: they cannot compare, but with a little patience and study into philosophy, they at least make for great brain food.",The Matrix

The green code that flashes up just before Trinity attacks the guards is one of the best opening scenes I've ever seen!I heard that Will Smith was considered for the role of Neo, but he would have taken the part to light heartedly and incorporated his own style on Neo (no disrespect to Will, just that Neo is a very serious character with a dark background, no humour about him).There's no point me going on about the story line and discussing the special effects as I'm sure most film lovers have seen this.

2198,calvin-meyer,Better than average action thriller,6,29 March 2012,"The Matrix has excellent special effects, incredible action scenes, mixed acting, an original premise, BUT. . . a somewhat weak story.Fishburne is quite good; and this movie was MADE for Keanu. I found the screenplay threadbare, giving the actors not enough meat to work with. The premise is marginal and a bit watered down to make it as science fiction. The story and direction leave holes big enough to drive trucks through.About half way through the movie disbelief kicked back in and the film seemed merely a platform for special effects. In comparison, Mel Gibson's Payback is a more intriguing and better directed revenge/action flick, and Johnny Nmemonic (also featuring Reeves) has better Cyberspace science fiction.This is a violent film, which I have little problem with in general, but here it's particularly De-humanizing which I *do* object to. Payback is extremely violent and profane, but the violence is focused and meaningful in that it serves to advance the plot and has human consequences. The violence in The Matrix blends a cartoon-like disregard for its consequences with an elitist notion that it's all OK because the human victims have been brainwashed by the bad guys and are essentially pawns in a larger game. Violence should have a moral dimension or at least move the plot if it's to have meaning. If not, it desensitizes viewers to violence which can't be a healthy thing for society.",The Matrix

2200,sho32,The first one is always the best,9,3 June 2004,"The Matrix has intrigued and fascinated me, just as it has with so many millions of other viewers. Besides the obvious aspects of the movie (philosophy, action, and filming style) that people are interested in, I saw that the Wachowski Bros. have paid close attention to detail and mood in this movie. This is the mark of almost every truly great film, of course. The fact that this movie digs deeper than the superficial, entertaining level of most movies says a lot. I find myself absorbed into the world of The Matrix each time I watch it, because of the skillful artwork that the Wachowski Bros. have employed. There is so much symbolism in this movie, I won't even go there. I love how well this movie sets a dark, sci-fi mood. The buildings are shabby and run-down; everything is dark and ominous. I am particularly reminded of the image of Neo waiting under a bridge in the rain and darkness, and of Neo, Trinity, etc. climbing the checkered spiral staircase. The Wachowskis managed to create a movie that caters to the movie going interests of many different viewers, while at the same time retaining the mood and attention to detail of a true work of art. I give this movie a 9/10 only because of the excessive profanity that dumbs it down. Most of the profanity is unnecessary.",The Matrix

2202,viviantaube,"I Have Seen Most of the Ultimate Matrix 10-DVD Set, By Now",2,20 January 2005,"I learned of the ""Ultimate Matrix"" DVD set last year, near Christmas, which was undoubtedly what it was intended to be purchased for. Since I'm in sobriety, as of River Phoenix's autopsy signature date, November 15, 1993, I have taken a keen interest in his, his family's, his friends', and colleagues' histories. He was with Keanu Reeves, as many of you know, in ""My Own Private Idaho,"" in the early 90s, where they did drugs to do the sex scenes, from which River never fully recovered, and this ultimately led to his OD, outside The Viper Room, in LA, on Halloween morning, 1993. I could write on and on about the ""Matrix"" series, which is most likely what Keanu Reeves is now known best for--and before that, it was the ""Bill and Ted"" movies. He and River tried to ""escape"" their teen idol images, by being in Gus Van Sant's horrible movie. I have a limited time, on-screen, at present, as I'm at the library and I need to get to a meeting in Mill Valley, now.To ""cap,"" I find the ""Matrix"" movies to be ""too violent and sexy."" It should be a rating--and then, the movie wouldn't get made that way. I just did a little ""research"" on the Wachowskis, at this humongous and prominent site, where I've been harassed routinely for my November 15th story, and I just found out that Andy Wachowski's wife, Thea Bloom, filed for divorce in late 2002, because he was leaving her for a ""professional dominatrix,"" who had made him his ""slave!"" Keanu Reeves ""owes an apology"" to us, if I may be so bold. I didn't think I'd ""demand"" this, publicly, as I write him, ""clandestinely,"" via Paulie Kosta of Becky, the band they're in together with Rebecca Lord and Rob Mailhouse, but I never hear back directly anyway, so here goes!I could get much more ""deep,"" as I just heard the commentary by Cornel West and Ken Wilbur, with which I did not always agree, since I feel you cannot ""justify"" such violence and graphic sex in movies. Most out of Hollywood are this way for me--and the sex scenes in ""My Own Private Idaho"" led indirectly to River's OD. Is anyone in sobriety as of that, but me? I just think these people were ""lucky"" if they survived the Wachowskis. What is not covered in the very long DVD ""ultimate"" series is the fact that Jennifer Syme, Keanu Reeves' girlfriend, who gave stillbirth to their daughter, Ava Archer, on Christmas Eve, 1999, is not mentioned. After their ""break-up"" over this, shortly thereafter, she died in an apparent DUI, where she was the only one driving, after coming from Marilyn Manson's mansion in LA, where there'd been a party! She'd been with Reeves, apparently, just the day before, having lunch in San Francisco at Crepes on Cole, which I've never heard of, near where the ""burly man"" scene was being shot for ""Matrix Reloaded,"" among others in Alameda County! Manson's obscene music is on the first movie's soundtrack, and a video of it is included in the DVD series, unbelievably! Jennifer's mother, Maria St. John, sued Manson for ""wrongful death,"" about a year later, but he apparently has so much money that I think she ""lost,"" since he denied charges. The ""architect"" scene was filmed at that time, and it was later used in an MTV movie awards ceremony introduction, starring Justin Timberlake, which was ""foul"" about women, in this case Trinity--and ""made fun"" of Gloria Foster's role in the movies, too. Reeves gave his approval to use his image from these scenes, and it was not ""OK"" with me! Gloria Foster died of a sudden heart attack, during shooting, and Aaliyah died in a plane crash, too, that year, as well as the terrorist attacks occurring. A reason I am ""concerned"" about Reeves, in particular, when it comes to the ""Matrix"" series, is because he has been in a number of DUIs, most notably one in the 80s, where he shut his headlights off on his bike in Toganga Canyon, where he apparently ""lost his spleen,"" according to the ""Hardball"" directors' commentary! Hence, my ""demand"" for an apology!One good thing that has come of all my writing is that last fall, Johnny Depp finally gave his controlling share of The Viper Room to Anthony Fox's daughter. Fox ""disappeared mysteriously,"" after suing Depp for money. A judge was trying to shut down the club. I wrote him about my getting into sobriety, as of River's autopsy, ""coincidentally."" I don't think it's a ""coincidence,"" really. If you look at this date in history, it is ""significant,"" and I feel the spirits convened for me.",The Matrix

2204,Pfisiar675,"Matrix, a complex and well developed metaphor",10,14 September 2005,"The Matrix is probably the most important film made in the last 20 years. There are several reasons for this, the biggest of which has nothing to do with metaphysics and ""what is real?""; a question which is quite literally asked throughout most of this film.The Matrix is a story about Neo, a computer hacker living the double life of Mr. Anderson, a person with a ""job at a respectable software company"" and ""helps his landlady take out her garbage"". Yet as No, the protagonist is looking for something just a tad out of reach and in so doing falls into the Alice in Wonderland world of the Matrix.Neo is portrayed as sort of a savior, a single being whose promise is to win a war against a vastly superior force of super-smart and super powerful machines. And on his way to that level, Neo discovers that the world is nothing like he thought.The Matrix is a movie brilliant on many levels, the most base of which is special effects. Some people are willing to dismiss this as nothing more then a good story, a good action film. But hold on now, I say this movie is deep. This movie has a level of subtlety that not many have caught on to.Here's a question worth asking: why is the dream world of the Matrix set in the 20th century? What purpose did the brothers who made this film have in using this time period ad the period represented in the Matrix? In a very conscious effort on the parts of this movie's creators, the Matrix is, in a sense, a dream world which reflects our current world. This then is the metaphor that the brothers have tried to set up.We are living a dream. Every aspect of our lives is designed to pull wool over our eyes. We understand Neo, because Neo's initial plight is relateable. In a way, this time period was chosen because it was the hight of capitalism. In my opinion, the Matrix is a movie which creates a complex metaphor where humans literally become cogs in a great machine. The literalness of being into a battery must be translated into real life. Like those living in the matrix, we in real life, are serving a system which ruthlessly and unapologetically exploits us.Quite literally, the Matrix is the capitalist machine, dehumanizing and exploiting individual humans. That at least is the message I get from the Matrix: a harsh criticism of the capitalist machine that makes up our ""real life""",The Matrix

2206,JudasTheDark,Psudo intellectual dribble...,1,15 December 2004,"I know that this is one of the most popular movies of all time, but that is a flaw in the viewing public. The main reason I dislike this movie so much is because it was a rip off of a much better movie that came out a couple years before it. That being Dark City. Lets review the similarities shall we? First of all our main character wakes up disoriented and not understanding the world around him JM because he lost his memory and Neo because he is taken out of the matrix. We find that both characters have been given a false set of memories by puppeteers (be them aliens or robots) We find that these puppeteers are doing the same thing for all people in an attempt to keep their own race going (matrix as batteries DC cus they need to find the soul) Finally the main character proves to be the savior of the humans by finding they are the only one who can put an end to the false lives that the puppeteers are forcing humans to live. they both do this through the same method. by having a mentor teach them how to use the devices of their captors against them (neo learns how to hack and control the matrix while Murdoc learns how to use the machines of the strangers to alter reality. also we see stylish black leather as the main wardrobe in the matrix. black leather gowns are the main wardrobe for the strangers. moving away from the rip off problem we see that Dark City has a message implying you to ask yourself if your identity is more than just the sum of your memories. the matrix makes people feel smart for understanding the movie, but really offers no deep thought. the feel of Dark City is also better since it has the dark ambiance created by the same director as The Crow. while the matrix has nothing new or special about its ""feel"" just your basic action movie with a plot to try to make the viewer feel smart. Point is: same movie only better (although lacking the eye candy the public adores) is Dark City",The Matrix

Typical Hollywood overblown style, where they think FXs are everything. The Fassbinder movie hardly uses any effects at all, but is ten times as intelligent and a hundred times more enjoyable. Yach! Sorry, brothers Wachowski, have a look at the Fassbinder movie again and learn that less is more. Some people like this kind of action; for me it ruins a movie completely. I was still a kid when I saw that Fassbinder movie, and I would like to see it again; but their are some legal problems about the rights to this movie, and it can't be broadcast at the moment.",The Matrix

Even with everything that's out there today.Obviously, if you hate sci-fi or tech, stay away from this movie. Unless you're a tween, you're not going find much philosophical enlightenment either. Having said that, at the time, it did create a standard for the genre and remains a entertaining movie.As for the story line, in 1999, we hadn't reached the ten-year mark of the popularization of the internet, so the themes certainly struck a chord.

Then , they had to write a script .Pretty useless (XXX , Godfather III and others made lots of money without it) but can help . it was easier :they just need a ""Dictionnary of Philosophy for fools"" . Example:letter D : Descartes imagine that all our lives could be an illusion created by a ""bad genius"" . Good ! letter N : Nietzche : Give up our desire is give up what made us human , etc ...

I felt like Neo, waking up while he was still connected to the System. That's what this movie should be: a wake up call to all of us, to start living, once and for all.We're so trapped in our day-to-day actions and we forget to live for ourselves, we forget to look around, to have feelings, to learn to avoid being trapped in our small bubble, connected to a Reality which is not ours.I watched this movie so many times, without developing an obsession, and every time it's a fresh sip of air, helping me to move on with this life as it is. I'm addicted to it, but in a good way. ""The Matrix"" will help anyone to be more determined, to look for a way out from this System, without disrupting the wires which keeps it connected.In my opinion, is the best movie ever, for so many reasons. If you did not watch this movie, do it. Leave aside the awesome effects, forget about the small errors. Think that YOU can be trapped inside the Matrix and make a choice: the BLUE pill or the RED pill. This will define you: you're either one of us, or one of them. There are no other options.The movie is outstanding: the effects, the characters, the plot, everything is very well made, Andy and Lana Wachowski did a perfect job. Nobody else but Keanu could play Neo's character. The costumes, the make-up, everything was done in the right way.If you did not see the movie, you don't exist.

I still love the line from the Officer in Charge to Agent Smith about jurisdictions.It started out really slow, and sometimes I still get angry at how they made Neo into such a baby back b***h in the beginning. I mean come on - you go all the way out to the ledge just to turn yourself in? I feel that where it really started to get good was the meeting with Morpheous, and I love the blue pill/red pill reference. It is something I use myself to people to this day as to say ""Hey, are you going to keep doing the same thing monotonously, or are you going to take charge and do something daringly different with your life"". So it was very clever! And it was clever for Neo to discover that he was the one - not everything can be handed on a silver spoon (the funny thing I can say is a great allusion with the monk like child to Neo's meeting with the Oracle).At the end of the day - there are a lot of hidden messages and life lessons to be picked up from this movie. I am not sure what the intentions are of the writers of it (are we ever?). However it is a movie that I feel was definitely ahead of its time when it came out and is not a disappointment by any means!

The fact that it is loaded with so many seminal concepts weaved into such an entertaining format makes it that inexplicable phenomenon - you could question the casting then, as the only weakness, but I doubt if even the Wachowski Brothers knew what they will end up making.

One: The concept and script blew my mind. In a good way of course. There are so many dimensions to this concept that you can take, grasp and comprehend in so many levels, metaphorically and literally. On one hand i grasped this concept literally. The dystopian narrative which we all have already seen in movies alike; rise of the machines and war between mankind and human beings. Metaphorically speaking, the concept can be related to the top rich elite who run the world. Us, the ignorant public are just their puppets. Listen and believe all their propaganda because at the end of the day, they hold the power to do so. Media! Two: The cinematography and the groundbreaking photography techniques are just awesome. Not did it only introduce this new technique but draws the audience in and take us for a ride. One of a kind ride!

2217,orangewarm,The Matrix as Cultural study,7,8 May 2006,"There are a number of good reasons why The Matrix could not be a seen as a serious study of modern urban culture. The modern city depicted in the film has two faces: one is that of gleaming office blocks, the other is made up of the ruins of an industrial past. In both cases, the city that is depicted is a vague and generic representation of post-industrial urbanism. The new modern city portrayed is nothing more than a software program which provides an all encompassing hallucination, keeping humanity mentally 'occupied' whilst their bodies are used to power the mechanistic 'real' world. Therefore, The Matrix is not a film about the physical dimension or actuality of a city, nor a film which can tell us anything about the future state of urban society. It is a paranoid dream of destruction which has been seen a thousand times, for example in The Terminator, Total Recall, and Mad Max. However, by choosing to address the modern physical city by casting the city as a program, the film highlights a range of ideas that are useful for talking about the culture of the city. At this moment, communication networks and information exchange are widely considered to be the most important forces shaping our experience of modern urban culture.

I may be on the minority here but hugo weaving did not do a good job in this movie but i think it is mostly the director's fault. 
Also, casting keenu for such a role which deserves a lot of acting capabilities gave the director little to no options but to have a lot of action scenes and diverge away from what is expected.

(This review is only about the original Matrix movie),10,22 May 2018,"The Matrix is one of the best sci-fi movies ever made!I read it used to be one of Tarantino's favourite ones too, but the second and third ones ruined the whole beautiful idea and brought the overall value of the movie pretty low.The story/philosophy is mind-blowing and the directing, special effects and the overall performance absolutely amazing. Thomas Anderson (Keanu Reeves) is an IT specialist in his day-to-day job and a hacker (alias Neo) during the night. He is looking for Morpheous (Lawrence Fishburn) who could give him the answer to the question 'What is the Matrix?' The more relevant questions to ask, though, would be ""How would you know the difference between the dream world and the real world?"" and ""How would you know if what is happening right now is not a virtual reality?""The antagonist, Agent Smith (Hugo Weaving), is one of my favourite characters. Just watch his mouth - the way he speaks, the tone and pitch of his voice, his pronunciation, even the pauses he makes while speaking, have an incredible effect on the viewer. The concept of people being like cancer to this world is absolutely astounding.Carrie Ann Moss was the perfect choice for Trinity because any other blond, big lipped, big brested 'bimbo' would have totally ruined her character.A few more questions pop up in one's mind. ""Haven't we gone too far creating such super intelligent machines?"", ""What if they become so powerfull one day and take control over humanity?""The acting's just amazing, all of them, no exceptions. The 4 leading characters though... (Morphy, Trinity, Neo & Agent Smith) - (yes, to me there are 4 leads) - I love them all. I can't imagine the movie with any other 4 actors but L. Fishbourn, C.A. Moss, Keanu and H. Weaving. They were born to play those roles.Whoever did the casting did a terrific job. Bravo!Brilliant, absolutely brilliant!",The Matrix
2230,uoqytcmbv,The Best Classic Sci-Fi!,7,3 July 2018,"Cannot get enough of this classic. So many themes incorporated to give the story a deeper philosophical meaning, which are not immediately noticed. Definitely one of those movies that really makes you think. Thought-provoking. Great effects. Intense soundtrack. Excellent story.",The Matrix
2231,tiffanyswift-01525,Quite a boring and stupid film,4,21 July 2021,"No solid storyline,no profund world view,just a few people fighting for God knows what, dialogues are weak,cliche, boring,not on point. Characters are aimless and superficial. What a disappointment.",The Matrix
2232,Furcus,"It's fantastic, but you'll feel like a complete moron afterwards.",10,15 February 2006,"Personally, I believe that movies are about bringing dreams alive. Nothing does that better than The Matrix. It'll keep you up at night wondering. That's why they made the Animatrix, they probably got bajillions of e-mails asking, ""What about this, can you give me some information about this?"". Same thing happened with Star Wars, so they put out all those technical books. The Matrix is also great because it took a long time for those guys to come up with and organize. Now most movies are thought up like, ""Oh I wanna do a movie about... Capote! Yeah!"". This was the Wachowski brother's life's work...I think. I mean, that movie was very complicated, and yet flowed very nicely! I can see why a lot of people don't like it, as it's just too weird for them. As for the rest of us, enjoy.",The Matrix
2233,Valravnen,pure awesomeness,10,11 January 2019,"What can be said that hasent been said all ready ?
it rocked my world when it came out. as i did for all i think.

2235,Maro,A really great movie,10,18 May 1999,"The story has a lot of elements taken from other movies. There is a lot taken from Terminator, They Live and Nirvana, but the final result is a really great movie with a non original but still wonderful story. It has been such a pleasure watching this movie that I am planning to go to see it again as soon as possible. I think it's one of the best sci-fi/thriller movie ever made.",The Matrix
2236,Astaroth27,A totally new radical concept and plot: The Matrix,10,8 January 2000,"When you go to the movies, you always come into the darkness of the projection place thinking about you have already seen everything, and well, at least lets give this movie a chance.The Matrix changed everything, there was simply no way you could guess what the movie come up with. I also think that maybe not other movie has generated to much talk and analysis (personal and group) after the lights got back.",The Matrix
2237,Mr.XL,Wow. I just hope they would make a sequel!!!,8,10 July 1999,"What is the Matrix? Well go and see, hear and feel it for your self. Not on a small screen, but on the big screen. It`s not worth to be looking at otherwise.The first thing I said to my self after the movie was: ""Wow. I just hope they would make a sequel"". Why???? Because there is so many unanswered questions.Maybe they just should keep it with one movie? Maybe the meaning with the movie is to keep us wondering? I don`t know... Go and find it out for your self... Good luck!!!",The Matrix
2238,FLuke-2,Something for almost everyone...,10,4 April 1999,"...Everyone but people who don't like to think and don't enjoy stunning visuals and action scenes. The plot could be described as ""the exact opposite of the Lawnmower Man,"" and the feel of the film is strangely similar to the computer game Half-Life.If you're the thinking type, The Matrix will leave you wondering for quite a while. The all-inclusive plot and expert exposition are really the heart of the film. Rarely does one see movies so well-thought-out and believable in general release. Not only does this film take you on a mental trip, it makes you think for yourself. If you're sick of all the condescending and unimaginative SF films of the last few years, this is the cure.If, on the other hand, you like to be blown away by startling shots and powerful fights, The Matrix has you covered. The crew has done a great job of creating an immersive environment that both dazzles and frightens. The painfully tedious world of the Matrix and the post-apocalyptic Real World are both rendered with great detail. The action, which seems to unfortunately get the spotlight in many reviews, is, of course, fantastic. You'll get the feeling that you're watching a video game as the characters duke it out. The crazy moves that ""bend"" the laws of physics will keep your eyes glued to the screen.All in all, this was one of the most believable SF movies I've seen in a long time. When you see all the hard work that went into this movie (as opposed to the half-a$$ed less] ones with which we're inundated), you'll know it was worth the ticket price. Plus it's exciting! If you can't follow it, at least you can just stare and have a good time.",The Matrix
2239,Stick-3,Some of the best special effects to date,10,1 April 1999,"The Matrix is a breakthrough film that surpassed all expectations.  Keanu Reeves finally broke the mold of playing bad roles and delivered an extraordinary performance.  For those of you who like the film ""Blade"", ""The Matrix"" is definitely for you.  The special effects were unbelievably crisp and very realistic.  This film is a benchmark for films to come.  A real keeper.",The Matrix
2240,Maigrey,One of the best movies I've seen,9,10 April 1999,"Though the plot was vaguely reminiscent of other recent sci-fi movies, overall the movie was excellent.  Keanu Reeves delivered a strong performance, and the supporting cast was great as well.  Even if it wasn't for all these things, the movie would be worth seeing just for the special effects alone.  This is a movie you truly need to see on the big screen to appreciate.  And as a bonus, it also has the Star Wars trailer :)  For all these reasons, The Matrix is a movie I strongly recommend.",The Matrix
2241,nathanziarek,...well...,7,10 April 1999,"Immediately upon seeing the first trailer for the movie, I thought that they were showing us all of the cool parts, and that the ""No one can be told what the Matrix is, They must see it for themselves"" line was just another ploy to get you into the theatres.I never would have thought how right I was.While the movie was ambitious, truly, truly ambitious in what it wanted to say, and with what it attempted in scope in action and plot. Ultimately it fell flat. The action scenes were played out (can you say Jackie Chan?), the SFX are tired and old (c'mon now, if GAP is doing something, it is apparently a fad and no good), the plot was tired after Dark City, and the acting was truly terrible. The only one to pull off a decent job was -gasp- Keanu Reeves.And this isn't going to be a popular opinion. I was in the theatre and in the car with my buddies after the movie. The audience ate this movie up...I just can't figure out why...",The Matrix
2242,xadrian,The Superheroes for post 2000.,10,12 April 1999,"With under two months until Star Wars and the unprecedented hype and pageantry of what may be the biggest movie of all time, The Matrix has a big shadow to avoid.Yes, everyone knows the movie has great effects.  A sci-fi movie cannot make it today without them.  What most people may overlook from this movie, amidst the stunning filming and some choice one liners, is that it may be a watermark in Hollywood.  I found the most intriguing aspect of the movie was the story.  It was intricate, thoughtful, and concise.  Some places it was hard to understand what has happening, or more specifically, why it was happening, but don't let it get you down.  It's all explained as you go. This is a movie you HAVE to see at least twice.  It is just so much more enjoyable to soak in the brilliance of a well written script.  It's mystical and technical.  It's retro and futuristic.  It's truly like nothing you've seen before.",The Matrix
2243,Zane-3,Prepare a space in your video library.,9,31 March 1999,"One of the best sci-fi movie since Aliens; yes the one with the S.  My god this movie was incredible.  Let me do you a favor, don't listen to critics whom don't appreciate or understand sci-fi genre.  If you like sci-fi, action, consistency of plot, and movie that has refreshing look and feel-See this movie.",The Matrix
2244,ShowBob,Dangerously close to being the coolest movie I've ever seen.,10,2 April 1999,"I'm not a science fiction fan.  I like Star Wars and all that, but going into ""The Matrix"" I didn't have extremely high expectations.  Coming out of that movie, I felt like I had just seen a movie that will be the standard for sci-fi action for years to come.  I won't go on about the storyline, it's too complex for me to even begin.  But the fun comes in the imagination of the story, and the action scenes (which rival that of John Woo).  If you like action movies, science fiction or just entertaining movies in general, you really need to see ""The Matrix"".  I've never heard an audience clap so loudly before.",The Matrix
2245,ike-6,OhMyGod!!,9,29 March 1999,"As much as i dislike Keanu Reeves' acting ability,...as much as the trailer for this flick told u absolutely nuthin...as much as i had no faith ... i am now a true believer. this movie was fantastic. it had as much action as ""blade,"" but with an incredible sci-fi edge that was deep as well as breathtakingly exciting. the storyline was good and solid and the movie's pace kept me jumping in my seat. what the hell,...i'm going back to see it again!",The Matrix
2246,DMaus,Laurence kicks Keanu's a**... Going to see it again tomorrow.,10,3 April 1999,"I thought that this movie was gonna be cool since it had Laurence Fishbourne in it and you see a scene in the trailer where he kicks Keanu Reeves's a**. BUT... This movie goes way beyond cool with the action, special effects, and plot.I also thought that I'd either give Keanu a chance to perform well as an actor or just ignore his acting, but I didn't have to worry about in this case since he, Laurence, and all the rest worked really well together and pulled off a great performance. I plan on seeing this again very soon (probably tomorrow) and hope to catch the nuances I didn't see before, like the clip from ""The Prisoner"". My only question is not, ""What is The Matrix?"" (for I know the answer) but ""What was the purpose of The Matrix?"" Oh, and as my friend, Zathras would say, ""It IS The One.""",The Matrix
2247,LANMan,Prepare to have your sense of reality destroyed!,10,3 May 1999,This movie makes you question everything that you took for granted.  It's amazing!

2248,yamanish-2,Too much a movie of today.,2,12 June 1999,"It's hard to believe that people say they like this better than Star Wars. The chic, flip cyberpunk postmodernism will wear thin in a year, mark my words. This is not a timeless movie.",The Matrix
2249,rude dog,Best SF movie I've seen in 5 years. Will re-view 3 more times.,10,31 March 1999,"Best SF movie I've seen in 5 years.  I will be watching it at the theatres another 2 or 3 times paying full fare!  It's got the necessary ingredients for an epic sci-fi flick: 1)Great story line: post-doomsday setting with a prophetic messianic premise. 2)Great actors who happened to be in their ""I take my profession very seriously"" mode. 3)Expensive, detailed, and fluid (as opposed to stop-action type) special effects. 4)Expert editing with full consideration for continuity and story.",The Matrix
2250,Movieman-50,Redefining action movies...,10,26 March 1999,"I recently had the chance to see an advance screening of The Matrix at Michigan State.  And OH MY GOD, this movie is going to BLOW YOU AWAY.  A new standard has been set for sci-fi action movies.  Move over John Woo.  Move over Michael Bay.  The Wachowski brothers have redefined what an action movie should be all about.Right from the beginning, this movie is just one HUGE adrenaline rush. And unlike the sorry, pathetic excuses for decent action movies during the summer, The Matrix delivers.  None of that horrendous acting and weak storylines here, The Matrix has been refined down to the smallest details. The action sequences are UNBELIEVEABLE, the choreography is SUPERB, the script is incredible, the special effects are mind-boggling, and the acting is great.  This movie has it ALL.Storywise, like The Usual Suspects, this movie has you guessing and thinking until the end.  What IS The Matrix?  Who IS The One?  The story is incredibly well written and clever, it is definately one of the best sci-fi scripts out there.However, by far the best part of this movie is the action sequences.  The choreographer, Woo-Ping Yuen, known for his work in several Jackie Chan movies, refused to join the crew unless the actors intensively trained in the martial arts everyday for several months.  The work paid off, as you will see right away in the opening scene. I must admire and congratulate the dedication and work put into filming the action scenes by the actors, the end result is truly amazing.  Fight scenes in The Matrix is to car chases in Ronin, they're both in leagues of their own compared to other movies.In closing, I honestly think this movie will give Star Wars a run for its money in overall satisfaction after watching it.  This movie had me thinking for days afterwards, still in awe of it.  It may not be as big or make as much money as Star Wars, but if you're going to see another movie in 1999, let it be The Matrix.",The Matrix
2251,Sandman-33,Butt-Kicking Action Shows Hong Kong Roots,9,30 March 1999,"This movie shows a lot of the benefits of Hollywood power and will surely dazzle the considerable majority of viewers with action scenes unlike any they have seen before.  The deep pockets of Hollywood have slicked-up with post-production CGI and editing pure Hong Kong style martial arts and gun fight sequences heavily influenced by imagery drawn from Japanese anime. The synthesis is quite fresh, but really is an anticipated evolution of East meets West action motifs.  Worldwide audiences should eat it up. Action-director Yuen Wo Ping is a veteran of Hong Kong masterpieces and should get much of the credit for the visual impact of the action.  To experience more of his dynamic work (not to mention the soon to dazzle America charisma and skill of Jet Li) please check out Fist of Legend and the Once Upon a Time in China series from the  martial arts section of your local video store.  You will not be disappointed.  The Matrix receives an eight out of ten.",The Matrix
2252,RyneM,Perfect Visualization of Concept,7,11 April 1999,"The Matrix is stunningly well executed via great direction and flair.  Not a movie of great substance, although it does give you some food for thought when you leave.  Definitely a perfect ten when it comes to the good old Sci-Fi look and feel.  The Matrix (with its visuals and effects) shall do for science fiction movies of the next millennium what Blade Runner and Alien did for Sci-Fi of the '80's and 90's.",The Matrix
2253,rufus-10,This is what Science Fiction is all about...,10,26 March 1999,"Had the opportunity to see the sneak preview of this last night. I was hoping as I walked into the theater that it would be as good as I hoped. I was wrong.  It was even better than I had imagined.  Excellent performances from both Keanu Reeves and Lawrence Fishburne.  The special effects were well thought out and the story line fascinating.  A lot of thought had been put into the plot.  If you love a good Sci-Fi movie like I do, go see 'The Matrix'.",The Matrix
2254,Razer-2,"A tapestry of lucid imagery, shocking twists and just a thread of B movie",9,3 April 1999,"Whoa, it's Keanu Reaves trying to act.  Mind you, I'm not insulting the movie overall by saying that the acting in this film was consistently sub-par.  But I guess that's the good thing about it--consistency.  It was evident early on that the scratchy dialogue was purposely placed there. One could argue that their speech was a result of their society (watch the movie and find out what I mean).  But then one could argue that dolphins taste like chickens.  Worthy Sidenote: Laurence Fishburn tried his best.At any rate, the acting never took away from any of the wickedly ingenious twists (and there were quite a few moments of those) nor did it infringe upon the brilliant fx and cinematography.  What kicked me the most was how the commercials got me to salivate yet still only represented a portion of what was installed for me.  Another reason I believed the ""B movie"" dialogue to be planned was that some of it was actually quite funny and clever. The comic elements would not have been possible had the film taken on the seriousness of Dark City.  Overall, a worthy deal for the price of a ticket.",The Matrix
2255,cZ-2,"Now this is what I call real movie. By the way, what is ""real""?",10,3 July 1999,"The Matrix is a very confusing movie in the very beginning if you don't have any background knowledge. But this is just making the viewer (in this case, me) more and more anxious to find out what this is all about. 'Cause with Lawrence Fishburne doing the character of his life and doing it to its full extent, and Keanu Reeves probably doing his best picture ever, this is a movie full of anxiety and excitement.When you finally figure out what The Matrix really is (and I'm not gonna tell), the movie really blasts off. With the correct use of special effects, great acting, and a breathtaking story, ""The Matrix"" will surely take it's place in peoples' mind as one of the best Sci-Fi-Actions in history.The thing about the story, is that it's so unreal and so Sci-Fi, that the directors can do whatever the want, and it won't seem unnatural, 'cause ""if"" it really was like the movie, stuff like that could be. And we will never really know if the world actually is as described in ""The Matrix"".You didn't see it yet? Well what the heck are you waiting for? (I voted 10 for excellent)",The Matrix
2256,Brad101559,This is a great movie.,9,5 May 1999,This is a great movie. The premise was a bit unbelievable and there were holes in the plot. But the movie was so well done that those lapses were forgivable. The way the movie ended and with its success I'm sure there will be a sequel which I will look forward to seeing.,The Matrix
2257,Leather,Interesting premise and good special effects,7,3 April 1999,"The Matrix is an interesting film that blurs the distinction between reality and the unreal.  Based on the premise that we're all really living in a dreamworld, it asks the question ""What is real?""  The answer seems to be ""Who cares, so long as it seems good to you?""  There's lots of action and good special effects, though not on the spectacular scale of a Star Wars.  Keanu Reeves looks good, and Laurence Fishburne gives a chilling performance.  It's surreal, and if you're looking for logic, go somewhere else.",The Matrix
2258,ywwg,well-done unoriginality,7,13 April 1999,"What do you get when you take the Terminator, Dark City, and Mortal Kombat and throw it all together? The Matrix.  When I first saw the previews, I was sure it was just another effects extravaganza with nothing behind it, but it was actually a great ""popcorn movie""; it was fun to watch.It contains plenty of surrealistic gunfights, kung-fu fights (""you're out of bullets!"" ""so are you!"" ""how convenient! now we must fight!""), and trippy special effects to keep anyone interested, while not taking itself too seriously.  How _any_ film besides Star Wars can talk about an ""oracle,"" and ""the one,"" and ""dessssstiny"" without making an audience crack up is amazing, but this one pulls it off.Oh yeah, and the Episode One trailer is attached to the movie :)Things _not_ to do while watching The Matrix:DO NOT play ""air guitars"" whenever Keanu says something like     ""whoa."" He's really not bad in this one.DO NOT speak for Vader and say ""it is your dessssstiny.""         Fishburne does fine on his own.DO NOT count plot holes.DO NOT complain that movies don't portray computers as they      actually look like in Real Life.DO NOT get tense.

2259,Verigo,"Yes, it IS more than hot special effects!",9,4 April 1999,"Well, that quote in the preview, ""you have to see it for yourself"" worked on me; I went and saw it. But still I went only expecting those great digital effects, and not much in the way of a plot. I even wondered if all that computer generated imagery there for no other reason than to dazzle the eye. Boy, was I ever wrong! This sci-fi thriller had a great storyline, written and directed by two brothers. Think of it having a dark reality like in Blade Runner, yet the action and adventure of Die Hard. Great effects, unique sci-fi quirks, and an AI Agent so rotten you're glad to get to the end of the movie just so you can see him get killed off! Unfortunately, I cannot give away the storyline... you have to see it for yourself!",The Matrix
2260,Austin-16,ok....but nothing special (includes spoilers),5,27 November 1999,"I think sometimes we tend to confuse dark science fiction movies with cyber stuff in them as also being really smart movies. The Matrix, which is really just William Gibson lite, does this unabashedly, it even has some weird pseudo zen-buddhism nonsense to try to overcomplicate ""The Matrix"". Fishburne spends half the movie saying, ""The Matrix"" is this, ""The Matrix"" is that, when he should have just gotten to the point that ""The Matrix"" is virtual reality. I can't stand pretentious science fiction.

Keanu Reeves usually acts and looks the same in all his movies but this time he really fits the character, and even better than he did in ""Johnny Mnemonic"". The visual effects are incredible but in no way done just for the sake of having visual effects, they're all completely justified and the story wouldn't have been the same without them. And the story is probably the only truly original story for a movie I've seen in a long time (just when I thought I couldn't be surprised), it had me in suspense from beginning to end.

I am a big science fiction fan, and I was a little disappointed that the film wasn't more interesting, but I enjoyed it anyway.Keanu Reeves looked good as always, but didn't achieve any kind of epiphany or express much human emotion (also as usual, unfortunately.)

It's too bad it's coming out this time of year, it has all the potential to be a huge summer hit, and it is sad that its accomplishments will probably be dwarfed by Phantom Menace.  This has some of the nicest camera work I've ever seen (some of it similar to Lock, Stock & 2 Smoking Barrels).  This movie also manages to create whole world, in the same way that Dark City did.  All in all, this is probably one of the best sci-fi flicks of the decade, and it is certainly much more innovative in its special effects than Phantom Menace seems to be.PS: don't be scared of the fact that Keanu Reeves is in this, he does a good enough job not to ruin the picture",The Matrix

If you have the slightest inkling to see this film, see it on the big screen, in as large a theater as you can get to. This movie will not be very enjoyable on a television set. The effects are great, and due to the nature of the story, never distract you from the film. Tons of action, but slows down inexplicably in the middle. Keanu doesn't talk much, so Keanu-haters should be able to tolerate him. All in all, a fun time.",The Matrix

The inevitable CGI FX (for what it's worth, better than any seen before) coupled with awful acting on Reeves' part and a plot structure that allows for about an hour and a half of exposition all add up to... one over-hyped blockbuster. And what's that romantic interest all about? Accck! I'm voting 1 on this one out of spite. Please have mercy, Keanu!

2273,Mel-80,A philosophical approach..,9,6 April 1999,"Okay, I just saw this movie and I must admit that it was somewhat confusing at first, but that's because my attention was being focused on the two idiots sitting behind me.  Anyway, if one were to pay attention to this movie (which is what I recommend), one would notice that there was basic philosophy in this movie.  And many people who like philosophy, like me, would absolutely love this movie. However, I did notice the similarity towards the end of the movie with one of Keanu Reeves' earlier movies ""Little Buddha"".  But I won't say what it is because I wouldn't want to spoil the end for you. Anyway, I would recommend it if you are one of the people who likes to come out of the theater with an expression of disbelief...it's worth it.",The Matrix

The kiss scene is the only shadow on an otherwise realistic film.I wasn't a Keanu Reeves fan before watching this movie, and I'm still not, but he pulled off a convincing performance in The Matrix.The special effects are wonderful, and must be seen to be believed.Overall, the premise, plot, and special effects is what made this movie so good.

2276,martensj-2,"Entertaining, but a major premiss is silly",7,3 April 1999,"The movie was entertaining, but the writers' ignorance was glaring.The idea of harvesting heat from people to power machinery is silly since you have to put more energy into a person than you'll ever get out.  And with no sun, there would be little plant life to feed the people.  If all they had to feed people was the remains of the dead, the population would have to be in continuous decline.When Trinity said ""Dodge this,"" she gave the agent much more time to get out of the way than he'd need if he were adept at dodging bullets.",The Matrix
2277,Moppet,"Great Idea, Poor Execution... equals entertaining movie",8,14 April 1999,"I had first seen the previews of The Matrix in the theatres and I have to admit they intrigued me because of the stunning effects.  However I wasn't going to spend ticket money on a film  with Keanu Reeves.  Then some friends of mine who I respect told me that it was actually worth the money and was a really good movie.With this in mind I went to see the movie and immediately noticed the directors and writers (their brothers) were smart to keep Keanu's dialogue to a minimum.  I also was even more stunned by the special effects.  The lighting was very reminiscent of ""The Crow"" (the first) and ""Dark City"", both movies noted for their effects.   Laurence Fishburne gives an excellent performance and the casting was done well.  However, Keanu Reeves as the protagonist actually was a pretty good choice because he plays a very good dark hero.  Though I would have loved to see Brandon Lee play the main part.The Matrix was described to me as reminiscent of Plato's Allegory of the Cave, and if anyone has read this cannon of philosophy it becomes clear that the movie is almost a direct modernization.  However, it seems that the movie could have easily been 20-30 minutes longer.  About half the movie takes place within the Matrix and the other half in the ""real world"". But,the movie fails to add any depth to either of these two worlds.  Some more time spent on analyzing how Keanu Reeve's character interacted within the Matrix would have been very helpful and interesting.  Instead the movie begins with him already ""feeling"" something is wrong with the world around him, but shows not a single reason why this would be true.  I would like to think the writer's did this to minimize Keanu's dialogue and role in the movie.  Added to the thin development was the corny fight scenes.  The actual strikes and blows were very well choreographed but there were some very ridiculous posing which made most of them laughable.  If that was the goal of the fight scenes (which I don't think it was) then I can't understand why they were done that way.  The entire theatre couldn't help but snicker seeing Keanu do Martial Arts pose seemingly for no reason whatsoever.To sum up, I think the movie bought up some very interesting questions about reality and our perception of it.  However the two very interesting worlds that were created were not developed enough to satisfy my interest in either.  I came to the site and was appalled to see it ranked #20 on the top 250 list because of these shortcomings.  I gave it a 6 out of 10 and would recommend it to a friend as an entertaining action flick that would not blow them away.",The Matrix

OK, it's about virtual reality, but what a virtual reality!  The plot is overwhelming, unbelievable and perfectly logical.  A real mind teaser. The special effects were simply fantastic. In my opinion, it's one of the best movies of the year.  You will leave there stunned, overwhelmed and begging for more. If you haven't seen it, go and do so!!! Deserves at least 10/10.",The Matrix

The Matrix is the only movie I can honestly say is worth paying seven and a half bucks for. It went beyond my expectations and not only did the special effects blow me away (understatement), the whole premise was amazing, clever, and believable. Every character played their role with perfection and didn't allow the movie to be just visually satisfying. I'd admire these actors a great deal for dedicating many months to learning martial arts. What must have been a very long and difficult experience paid off extremely well, and each actor should be proud. Overall, I walked out of the theater like I had just walked off of a rollercoaster; shaken and flabbergasted.

I thought I had seen this movie before when it was called Johnny Mneumonic or was it Spaceballs.  This was a typical movie with characters and plot straight out of Mission Impossible.  Sure the stunts and effects were cool, but Keanu Reeves's acting overshadowed it.  It was if Ted Logan (from Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure) was the main character.

In actuality this movie's philosophical aspects were rooted in the skeptical ideas created by John Locke and Rene Descartes 300 years ago. The questions of reality and what is true have been around hundreds of years due to these intelligent minds.

2292,ChandlerHeel,"#31 all time, yeah right",7,24 June 2000,"Alright, I possibly have more to say about this movie than about any other I've commented on here at IMDB.  Well, I finally saw the Matrix.  The way to describe it was that I expected to love it and give it a 10, but I only give it a 7.First, some of the good things.  The action and much of the special effects really are great.  The sequences at the end are incredible.  Laurence Fishburne and Carrie Anne Moss looked really cool in their outfits.Now, some of the bad things.  I don't remember thinking that Keanu Reeves was so bad in say, Speed.  But here, he's just not very good.  He sure looks cool in the black attire and in the action sequences and all, but in the scenes where he has much dialogue, he's just not very good.  Actually, my biggest complaint is something that judging from other people's comments, I am in the minority on.  I'm talking about the villains.  Were they meant to be seen as sinister or funny?  I found them to be neither.  I found Agent Smith to be highly annoying.  The way he talked just grated on me.  And, I swear, I fully expected the MIB team of Will Smith and Tommy Lee Jones to come out and tell someone to look at their little light.  The other two agents were even worse.  The part where all the bullets stop before hitting Neo at the end and the three agents simultaneously lower the guns was so ridiculous.  The lowering of the guns made it look like a farce of a movie. Was it mean to be seen like that?  One other little complaint and I have to apologize for this one.  During the interrogation scene when they put the bug or whatever in Neo, they call him a ""program writer"".  Please.  If they are going to portray someone in the software engineering profession, they should have asked someone who knows about it.  It looks like they should have asked one of those many computer people who worked on the movie to look over the script.  I know it is a tiny complaint, but when you have been doing that kind of work for several years like I have, calling it ""program writer"" sounds highly, highly hokey.But, overall, the movie is pretty cool.  The action to a great extent make up for the bad things.  I rented Blade Runner also this weekend, and I'm hoping it'll be better than the Matrix.",The Matrix

The camera angles really work for the action sequences and the choreographed fight scenes made me yearn for more.  Say what you want about Keanu Reeves' acting.  He may not deliver the best dialogue, but his look can carry a film.  He was a great choice for the role of Neo.  Carrie Anne Moss was great as was the underrated Laurence Fishburne.

Good thing I stayed. It just got better and better.  Yes, it had good effects (with one notable exception) and great action sequences, but the winner was its exciting story. I don't really know what else to say, because I want everybody else to be as surprised as I was at all of the enticing aspects of the plot.

2296,BigSexxE,The Best Movie of 1999!,10,5 April 1999,"The Matrix explodes onto the screens in a way that is truly great.  The movie takes ideas from The Terminator, Alice In Wonderland, Men In Black, Kung Fu, Star Wars, Aliens, and Blade Runner.  The directors have taken the key ideas from these movies, and have told a tale that has you second guessing your own mortality and sense of reality.  Are we all just slaves of a higher functioning system on this planet?  Will we (man) ultimately create something that will ultimately destroy us?  If so, how can we combat a foe we don't know exists? While the end of this film undoubtedly sets up movies for the rest of the series. The one thing that would do this new, and wonderful film franchise justice is to take a page from George Lucas's book.  Do a couple sequels that tell of the downfall of this heinous enemy.  Then, after that is complete follow-up with a prequel that tells the audience how man got to be in this situation. The movie is a ride from start to finish.  While most people will go to see The Matrix for its action.  The best part of the whole movie comes about when Agent Smith is holding Morpheus (Laurence Fishburne) captive in a skyscraper.  Agent Smith talks about the way things are in the eyes of the computer.  How we humans are just like viruses that go from area to area infecting all that we touch. The Matrix has a powerful message and is definitely the only movie worth seeing this year.  While it will not make ""Star Wars-Episode 1"" money. The story is truly magnificant and probably the only movie people will remember from this year, save one, Star Wars.",The Matrix

I had seen glimpses of the movie's special effects and knew that Yuen Wo Ping had choreographed all of the action, and so I thought to myself that this wouldn't be too bad of an idea.  Well, I found that that was an understatement.  This movie amazed me. In ""The Matrix,"" Keanu Reeves plays a hacker named Neo. There is a remarkable action sequence that opens the film, one which may be slightly confusing, but stick with it the movie explains everything.  I don't want to spoil the film and as Morpheus says, ""Unfortunately you can not be told what the matrix is, you must see it for yourself.""  I will say this though, combine Phillip Jose Farmer's ""To Your Scattered Bodies Go"" with William Gibson's ""Neuromancer"" and throw in Hong Kong style, action, and choreography and what you end up with is ""The Matrix.""

In all honesty, I hated every single frickin' minute of this flick. It was boring, unimaginative, and really quite contrite. The scripting was terrible, the acting horrible, and for Gods sake, the movie wasn't even a movie, it was a playhouse for new visual effect techniques. Show me one part of this movie that you feel is good, and I'll show you a person who's afraid to make up their own mind on anything good in movies.While The Matrix was busy making millions of dollars, people skipped out of movies with a SCRIPT and ACTORS such as 'Waking Ned Devine,' an incredibly character driven movie, with real actors, not Bill and Ted rejects. (Don't get me wrong, Laurence Fishburn wasn't in Bill and Ted, and I did like the B&T movies, I just didn't like TED!) This movie was full of eye candy...it's a disappointment that movie goers now a days will shell out $7.50 for a movie full of things you can see on a Playstation...but you don't catch people sitting around the house and paying money to watch some guy play Final Fantasy.Now go watch a real movie, like 'Brazil.'",The Matrix

Most of them are just a cluster of special effects with a poor script. Their directors intend to entertain us with computer animations and amazing scenarios, forgetting that a good idea is much more attractive. One could number the best science fiction films ever done without having to use more than its fingers. 2001, Blade Runner, A clockwork orange and Alien would be in the list. And now, so would Matrix. It's frightening the idea of a world not in a world against machines, like in Terminator, but in a world where machines have already won the battle, and human beings are trapped in a jail for their minds, living in a computer-designed program, incapable of realising the truth. Not only the main idea is fascinating, but the film refers to many different stories, like Alice in Wonderland, The Sleeping Beauty, and the very Holy Bible, where Neo, the main character, would be The Messiah. More, it mixes elements from western, action, love and dramatic movies. Of course, it's not perfect. As Warchowsky Brothers are novices in the direction business, the actors were poorly directed. But, in spite of this, they made a very good job.",The Matrix

Even the soundtrack is the best I've ever owned.  As of now it's my all time favorite (the movie and the CD).  It'll take A LOT to move this movie out of the #1 spot in my top 10 list!,The Matrix
2313,Mooooo,Kick-a**!,8,5 April 1999,"The Matrix kicked much a**.  This movie kicked so much a** that even Keanu Reeves looked good.  Laurence Fishburne was, in his usual under-stated way, cool, and yet, effective.  Carrie-Ann Moss (Trinity) gave the movie a reason to watch, besides all the a**-kicking, of which she had no small part.The highlight of the movie was when Neo wakes up from his combat training session and blurts out, ""I know kung fu.""Does anyone know what brand/where to find the sunglasses that Morpheus was wearing?",The Matrix
2314,gerald-19,An unbelievably breath-stopping and adrenaline-pumping and mind expanding experience!,10,3 April 1999,"The Matrix left me speechless after seeing it.  It is truly movie-making at it's finest.  The action sequences, the flow of the story, the images - they are extremely well done. If you are a kid, you'll remember the fight sequences for a long time.  If you are an adult, you will remember ""the matrix"".  You will ponder the issues brought up for awhile.  The kid in you will go crazy. It's just cool.  If you ever wondered what the limits of technology are right now, well, just see this movie and you'll see many boundaries being pushed.  It's just amazing. I have never wanted to go out and buy a video, because I'm a stingy man. Trust me, as soon as this comes out, I'm going to buy my first ever video. It's worth watching over and over again.  It's like no experience I've ever had.",The Matrix

Movies like this generally don't get the Oscar and that's a shame.  I haven't been this so completely entertained, non-stop, I mean it doesn't let up for a second, in years. After it was over I wanted to beg them to just run it again.  Who are the Wachowski brothers?  Where did they come from?  I have to rent ""Bound"" now. They are amazing.  Come to think of it, everyone who had anything to do with this has to be amazing, or this was their moment of amazing, or just the beginning of their amazing filmmaking lives.  Thank you all of you.",The Matrix

Excellent story mixed with awesome special effects mixed with sometimes decent (Reeves), sometimes pretty good (Pantoliano), and sometimes awesome (Fishburne, Moss, and Weaving) acting. Also the oracle was totally unexpected. Good flick.",The Matrix
2317,Puff Master,"""Whoa""",10,1 April 1999,"Now this is a movie worth seeing.  The Matrix has got to be the best sci-fi movie since Terminator 2, and that has been awhile.  The Matrix has everything.  Its got a wonderfully imaginative plot, gorgeous visual effects, great acting, and the whole atmosphere gives it a mysterious and apocalyptic feel.  The fighting scenes were great!  Very much like anime cartoons.  Kudos for The Matrix!  It is definitely a MUST SEE movie.",The Matrix
2318,rlmccoy,Cool!,9,3 April 1999,"Wow, what an excellent movie! The acting, the fight choreography, and the special effects are aweswome. This is by far Keanu Reeves best movie yet. I never though I would find him believable as a tough guy, but he is. Laurence Fishburne plays the leader well with his seriousness balanced by his drive. Carrie-Anne Moss was amazing, and Hugo Weaving was just evil. I was equally impressed with all the actors/actresses dedication for doing all the combat and stunts. This movie is like a live-action anime, has a great story and terrific special effect. I would advise anyone who enjoys sci-fi movie to go see this.",The Matrix
2319,xcalibur-2,Science Fiction,8,2 April 1999,"It seems to be as difficult for Hollywood to put together a good science fiction movie as it is for a Catholic to take the pill. That is what makes The Matrix such a pleasant surprise. The opening scene (which is most of the trailers) is engaging, very well-shot. Keanu Reeves (who's Johnny Memnonic almost made me swear off Sci-fi)is, believe it or not, very good in this part. Even more unbelievably, he performs the high-impact martial arts scenes flawlessly. And when I say high-impact, that's just the tip of the iceberg. Very well-choreographed, and paced. All the actors do their own fighting in this one, and all do a good job. The plot is disturbing, and took a lot of balls to spend this much money on. The directors only occasionally dip into the realm of cheesiness that haunted Bound, and the rest of the movie more than compensate. I gave it and 8, which is for me very good. I think this is probably the best sci-fi movie released in the last five years. Very well-done.",The Matrix
2320,vulgrin,The culmination of decades of science-fiction,10,3 April 1999,"What struck me the most about the Matrix is that there were really no themes new to the science-fiction realm, but a wonderful culmination of many different plots from decades of great authors.  This is not to say it had no original ideas, but I think it shows that the old tales CAN be retold and combined to make a new story.",The Matrix
2321,Ollie-21,Let Down,6,3 April 1999,"Maybe I'm missing something.  I thought that this movie was visually incredible, but the story REALLY let me down.  I think that it is a pity that such a great set-up leads to a blow-em-up finish.  It would have been nice if this film's story-line would have captured my interest as much as the effects.  All in all, worth seeing, but if you are the type that likes a thick plot that comes together at the end, prepare for disappointment.",The Matrix
2322,MDW-4,Great special effects,6,16 April 1999,"It took the first one-third of this movie for me to understand the premise. During this time, I thought the movie moved a bit slow and I even considered leaving the theater. However, once I understood the plot, the movie was very enjoyable and was I glad that I stayed for the conclusion.",The Matrix
2323,Colossus-5,"Excellent FX, but acting leaves something to be desired",7,4 April 1999,"I thought the movie to be very entertaining, but see it for what it is. You aren't going to be emotionally moved by it. It's rather a gun-toting special effects monster. Keanu Reeves was a bit of a disappointment.  The plot was familiar, the evil artificial intelligence vs. the humans, but original in its own way. Up until the final bit of cheesiness at the end, I enjoyed it the whole way through.",The Matrix
2324,Shorokin-2,Video Game It's Not,10,22 May 1999,"This is what sci-fi movies of the future should be like. Lots of eye-candy, style and deep thinking. It appeals across many levels of movie goers. All of the acting was great, especially the four main characters. Yes, even Keanu. I have never seen anyone do an impersonation of Bruce Lee so well, even down to the tiny mannerisms. Laurence Fishburne and Carrie-Anne Moss were brilliant and oh so stylish. Big kudos to the costume designers. The Matrix is well-thought out, perfectly executed and intricately detailed. See it more than once to get the full effect. It's my current best movie ever and I hope it wins an award for special effects, or even just coolness :)",The Matrix
2325,punkrock,#1 SCI-FI Movie of All Time,10,17 April 1999,"The ""Matrix"" really gets your mind working. The special effects are great but I don't think that that is what makes it a good Movie. The ""Matrix"" has a great plot and it's original. The characters were portrayed very well, especially Laurance Fishburne as ""Morpheus"" and Keanu Reeves is the perfect match for Neo, I had my Doubts about him but after I saw it I Thought he was great.If you think it's a bad movie you better see it again because obviously you didn't understand itThe first time you see this Movie Many ideas will pop into your head about what's going on, the dialogue was planned out very well and it's hard to tell what the plot is at first. you really don't know what's happening until ""Neo"" meets up with ""Morpheus"" and he shows him what the ""Matrix"" is.I rated This Movie a 10 Because I love the plot and dialogue. and the special effects help too. Basically it's an all-around good Movie.",The Matrix
2326,Niccy,One of the best Science Fiction Movies ever,10,4 April 1999,"I take that back.  This very well might be one of the best movies ever...period. I had seen a program about it on HBO, and I KNEW that I had to see this movie.  I thought that even if the story sucked, I'd pay eight bucks to see the special effects.  Well, those effects were well worth my money.  And as an added bonus, the plot kicked butt.  I've seen it before in other mediums, but never before was it this intense and clear and focused. Another bonus was the actors.  I cannot express my feelings about how fine of a job those people did.  They trained hard and it shows.  It takes real dedication to do what they did.  And beyond the kung fu, the actors can ACT. I was nearly in tears for some parts. This movie does what it is supposed to do.  It entertains, it makes the viewer feel and care for the people on screen, and it kicks the viewer in the butt many, many times. This may sound really stupid, but there are some movies that make me feel ""enlightened"", and The Matrix is one of them.  By far this movie is at the top for 1)Sci-Fi 2)Action 3)Drama 4)intense involved plot 5)visual effects. I can't remember another movie with such an involved plot that pulled it off well.  This movie has everything.  Kung Fu (with some of the coolest shots I've ever seen), Stunning Visual Effects, Beautiful Acting, Big Guns, Big Emotions, A Deep, Profound Meaning (listen to the dialogue...it all rings true), Red, Sticky Goo (okay, I admit, I'm weird), Wonderful Sets, Great Costume (can I thank the costumer for this?), Big Stunts (many done by the actors themselves), A Kick Butt Soundtrack (which I'm listening to right now), Keanu Reeves in All Black Clothes, Toting Big Guns, Carrie-Anne Moss in All Black, Toting Big Guns (This is important!  She's a warrior and a woman and balances the two with ease!  There needs to be more of this type of character in film!), Laurence Fishburne in One of His Finest Words (when I was talking about acting before, Mr. Fishburne is just plain awesome). 
Give a big hand to the Wachowski Brothers.  They rock in a hardcore way.In short, I loved this film.  I plan to see it again.  I feel sorry for those people who aren't going to see this film.  It's one of those films that captivate you and forces you think about it weeks after you left the theater. Go see it.  You'll be pleased.  I was!",The Matrix
2327,Stealth-11,Outstanding,10,4 April 1999,"One of the best movies in years.  Unfortunately it has been slighted by people with a bias against action/sci-fi movies, as well as against Keanu Reeves.  However, do not let that talk dissuade you from experiencing this movie.  A great and thought-provoking story, combined with outstanding visual effects, make this one of the most unique and masterful movies released in recent years.",The Matrix
2328,Mecohano,"Exciting, entertaining, and even occasionally deep...",9,5 April 1999,"I must admit that I was a bit dubious about this one, since there have been so many horrendous computer/AI films in the past, but I was actually quite pleasantly surprised.  The Matrix is a truly entertaining film, with nice attention paid to internal plot consistency, as well as an impressive selection of special effects.  Fans of anime-style action scenes should definitely tune in for this one, it's right up your alley.On a semi-related note, I'm reminded of the series of computer-scare movies that started decades ago when the technology was still in its infancy. Suddenly it seemed Hollywood couldn't get enough of the ""do we really know what we're getting into?"" theme.  Every once in a while, there's a new scare, as we make more and more progress in computer-related fields.  Now we have the Internet, Web, and continuing attempts at Artificial Intelligence stirring up those fun anxieties all over again.  Seems to be a topic that just keeps coming back.  But then, they say there are only 5-10 storylines anyway, and everything out there is just a rehashing of various combinations...Despite the fact that this storyline is similar, as most are, to many that have come before it, the premise is still a well-structured and intriguing one.  Nicely conceived and executed, I must say.  The Matrix may not be high drama or Best-Picture material, but it's still fun, exciting, and even (gasp!) thought-provoking.  Enjoy it for what it is, you won't be disappointed...",The Matrix
2329,Road-Dawg,A excellent movie,10,6 April 1999,"This is the movie that the CGI wizards have been promising.  An outstanding story welded together with amazing special effects.  A combination of many types of filmworks, including martial arts films, John Woo-Style gunplay, and dizzying science-fiction, this film is the first great movie I have seen this year.  Unlike the horrible ""Godzilla"" or ""Wing Commander"", this movie uses its special effects to enhance, not replace, its story. The W2 brothers have done it again, easily topping their lurid, but enticing previous film, ""Bound"".  Check out this one for sure!",The Matrix
2330,verbal-32,Certainly the best action film I've seen...one of the best period.,9,6 April 1999,"Every movie I see I give a rating somewhere between 1 and 10.  To give some perspective, I gave Braveheart a 10, as well as the Star Wars Trilogy as a whole.  I've given tens to a very small amount of movies, and they've all been what I consider extremely good films with almost no flaws.  The Matrix was amazing, it had me riveted throughout.  Definitely the best action film in history, and without a doubt one of my all-time favorites.",The Matrix
2331,makin-2,"Action was so well maintained, it tired you out!",10,7 April 1999,"The timing of this movie, the flow of the action, was so well done that we found ourselves tired after watching, realising that we had been subconciously tensing and reacting to what was going on on the screen. This is when you know they have done it right!",The Matrix
2332,Movie Man85,AMAZING FILM!,10,7 April 1999,"The Matrix is the first great movie of 1999.  The special f/x were top-notch, and the well-thought plot always kept me on the edge of my seat. Keanu Reeves was the definition of cool as Neo, and the soundtrack was great.  I advise everyone to run out and see this movie.  It is destined to become the best sci-fi film of the year (besides Star Wars: Episode 1, of course).  GREAT MOVIE!",The Matrix
2333,SYC78,wow - and I wish there were some elegant way of saying that!,10,9 April 1999,"What can I say? It was GREAT. I absolutely loved it. And make no mistakes, I'm not much of a Keanu Reeves fan. This is how the story goes - nothing is what it seems. It sounded all so complicated at first. I'm used to sci-fi and I love twists but this was totally different. The most amazing part of it all is that the movie was actually easy to understand and clear in meaning. And the special effects.... well, I can't TELL you about it but you'll see. It's awesome! As I said before, I wish there were some elegant and sophisticated way of saying 'wow'. I'll be using them all now.Oh, and the fact that it was filmed in my town didn't hurt either. 'Hey, isn't that where Jenny's dad works?' and 'look, it's Martin place' and 'hey, that's Centre Point' and 'I swear that guy looks like my chemistry teacher from year 11!!!!' and so on.I have only one thing to say - GO AND SEE IT!

It will quickly become a classic!",The Matrix
2335,jefferv,"Get over yourselves, THIS MOVIE IS ONLY SLIGHTLY ABOVE AVERAGE!",6,10 April 1999,"Let me start off by saying that I was intrigued by the premise of this movie.  However I believe the Hollywoodization of the plot turned what could have been excellent into boring rehashed crap.  Keanu Reeves is about as good an actor as Nick Cage!!Lawrence Fishburn is good if not somewhat understated.  The overall look of the movie was excellent.  The special effects were way above par. The main area that this film falters is the fact that somehow this way out futuristic storyline suddenly reverts to a love story about kung-fu!  I don't understand why the film couldn't have been just as interesting without the abrupt change in the story.  It just seemed silly and geared toward garnering the all important teen movie crowd.  I recommend seeing this film, especially in a theater, how ever I was extremely disappointed that the writers, who also happen to be the directors, chose the course that they did.  This is in no way the classic sci-fi/action movie that so many seem to think.  AVERAGE AND TYPICAL!!",The Matrix
2336,jefferv,This movie is average at best!,6,11 April 1999,"This movie starts with an intriguing story.  Albeit, not really anything new, I had high hopes for this film to rank highly in my personal movie favorites list.  The style of the movie is really the best feature, something one could expect to be repeated in the coming millenium. Lawrence Fishburn's portrayal is well done and somewhat understated.  In fact, all the roles are understated.  I believe this was purposeful because the Producer was hoping to acheive big box office totals based on the special effects and look of the movie.  In other words, they didn't want to detract from the main selling points by bothering with a coherent storyline or anyone actually acting in this movie.  I thought it was somewhat bland because of this.  Keannu Reeves is just not a very good actor. The plot degenerates suddenly into a love story to save the day. This plot twist actually made me laugh out loud!  It just seemed out of place, with no reason to occur.  The kung fu aspect of the storyline was also laughable. If he is the one, I don't want to be on the team. In fact I stopped rooting for the ""heroes"" about half way through the movie. Many areas of this film will be copied for years to come, because there were excellent aspects to the style, however so many things were done wrong that it will ""rank"" as only average overall in book!  See it, but it is no masterpiece!",The Matrix
2337,azeem-3,Definitely a must-see for sci-fi fans,10,9 April 1999,"The movie is dark. Literally and figuratively. The acting is ok considering that there's a lot of relatively unknown talent. The action scenes are superb and the recent trend of getting Hong Kong based people to do slow motion action (remember Face/Off)  is exploited to the hilt. Some of the concepts are original although the dismal attitude towards the future is something that is being repeated everywhere. Some of the the ideas will probably be true in the next few years, however their impact may be different. I saw Laurence Fishburne after a long time and he gives by far the best performance. Keanu Reeves looks more convincing than he was in Johnny Mnemonic. The others are tolerable because the special effects take over the rest of the movie.

More than that, though, it asks ""Would you rather live in a comfortable lie or a harsh truth?"". This is a great movie with an intriguing plot. The special effects combined with the characters/cast provide an action-packed movie that has something for everyone. However, some characters are introduced as important, but are not fully developed by the end of the movie, leaving you saying ""What about...?"". For example, the character Switch a very intriguing character for what we saw of her, but her character was not fully explored. Also, the ending would have been better if it had gone a little bit further into the story than it did. It almost ends too soon, without fully satisfying the audiences expectations. All in all it was an excellent movie. I recommend it to anyone who's stomach can handle the gory scenes.",The Matrix
2341,G.G.,Wonderful Film-making!,10,25 April 1999,"Of course the special effects in this movie are breathtaking, but there's much more to The Matrix.  Carrie-Anne Moss (there's always so much going on behind her eyes), Hugo Weaving (what fun he must have had with this!) and Gloria Foster were fantastic in their roles.  The choreography and cinematography both exceed all expectations in their attempt to style The Matrix like a live-action anime'.The dialogue, with a few notable exceptions, is excellent, and the story line does a great job of being as complex as it can be without losing the audience (well, some folks can always get lost). Marcus Chong gets stuck with a few lines that are less than choice, and how they are received depends on how jaded the particular audience is.  The romance is also a sticking point for those who gave up fairy tales for Goodfellas at the age of six, which seems like a lot of us these days.  I'm baffled by how Lucas can feed us the corny mystical stuff and we love it, but no one else can completely get away with it.  But I digress.As hard as it is to imagine a Keanu Reeves movie inspiring discussions regarding the nature of reality, that is what has happened.  An added bonus is that the Matrix has fun, tipping its hat to other films and not taking itself too seriously at times.  This is a movie that you can probably go see five or six times and notice and appreciate something new every time. Enjoy!Go Wachowski brothers!   Go Manex Visual Effects!   Go Carrie-Anne!

2342,Mythic_Male,Pushing the visual and FX envelope!,10,20 April 1999,"I would LOVE to address some of the negative critiques, but I think some people look too hard for faults. This movie not only met, but exceeded my expectations for many reasons too numerous to list here.  The visuals were stunning and the FX cutting edge. After seeing the Wachowski brother's ""Bound"" (another visually beautiful film), I see why they used the same cinematographer to lens this movie. Their use of ""bullet-time"" photography and virtual camera panning (freeze framing mixed with live action) was done superbly.  Yes, I know we've seen this done recently for for numerous television commercials (e.g., the Gap commercial mentioned by another reviewer here also), but never with such technical precision and poetic imagery.  ""Poetic"" you say?  Just as Sam Peckinpah was the first to show us artistic violence with his slo-mo scenes in ""The Wild Bunch"", Larry and Andy Wachowski have utilized new technology to go the next step (the helicopter-machine-gun-rain-of-bullets scene was dazzling!). The opening sequence with Trinity running from the Agents, leaping from the rooftop, then diving through a window in the adjoining building, tumbling down the stairs and landing face up, guns drawn, made my jaw drop.  And to top it off, she picked the smallest window! I didn't find the story line overly complex or convoluted, as I've read so many have.  I mean, how do you present the concepts of virtual vs. real, dream vs. waking, or parallel universes in an easily explained manner. Did everyone totally understand the parallel time lines and co-existence of past, present and future from the ""Back to the Future"" trilogy.  I don't think so! The Matrix had story line flaws, yes.  For instance, why didn't Morpheus get hit by a stray bullet as Neo was spraying a deluge of machine gun fire in the Agents office?  Why wasn't Neo running away from the agents in super-fast motion instead of normal speed?  Hey, maybe he was tired!  He did take quite a beating. The movie left me satiated but longing for more.  I was a little disappointed that we didn't get to see a little more of Neo utilizing his ""oneness"" power once he realized it.  Think of the possibilities!I LOVED this movie and, no matter what anyone says, Trinity's ""dodge this' line cracked me up!",The Matrix

Keanu is at his best since Speed, supported ably by noteworthy performances from Fishburne, Moss and Hugo Weaving as Reeves' enigmatic nemesis.

I thought the various chase scenes and showdowns were well integrated with the plot, and flowed seamlessly, with nothing I noticed in the way of obvious plot-continuity errors.However, for anyone out there thinking this movie is really DEEP, philosophically speaking, and ORIGINAL, in terms of plot scenario, must not have progressed passed the ""midnight bong sessions"" stage of their education.  Come on people, characters asking ""have you ever felt like you don't know the difference between what is real and what is a dream?""  is very run-of-the-mill in the sci-fantasy genre, as is much of the rest of the movie.Also, as for cinematic originality, this stuff has nothing on, say, Terry Gilliam, Ridley Scott, or any of a number of other people.  They seem to have borrowed and innovated all over the place, in terms of visuals, plot devices, action sequences, and special effects.BUT HEY, they did a DAMN GOOD JOB OF THAT, so I say, why not?

The overall plotline seems to be a take on Campbell's classic ""hero's journey""... but the film certainly doesn't suffer from being derivative of it.But the story isn't the only winning point of the film.  Gripping combat scenes, magnificently performed wire-work and stunts, some of the finest and most seamless special effects I've seen in ages....  All of these combine with first-rate acting and a melange of contemporary music and instrumental scoring, to produce an epic, outstanding whole that will be remembered for decades.  Personally, I'm avidly awaiting a sequel, if, as is rumored, the Wachowski brothers plan this to be the first film in a trilogy.",The Matrix
2352,Butcher,"Triumphant combination of brains, action, and F/X",10,5 May 1999,"The Matrix was one of the best movies I've seen in a long time, and I see a lot of movies.  It was a thinking man's action movie.  The combination of brains (plotlines, dialogue, etc.) and action (Hong Kong style sequences with intense camera work) mesh seductively to enthrall the viewer into the world of the Matrix.  The special effects were phenomenal, making this movie a must see for just about anybody.  The critics like to give Keanu Reeves a hard time, but this was HIS role, fit to a tee.  As the movie ended, I found I wanted more.  Neo (Keanu's character) best summed up my reaction: ""Whoa!""",The Matrix
2353,morpheus-108,Excellent. Biblical symbolism is just the beginning,10,10 May 1999,"Forget the Biblical connotations.  Forget the fact that this is by far Keanu Reeves' best movie.  Laurence Fishburne, Carrie- Anne Moss, and Hugo Weaving make this movie the best I have ever seen.  The fighting sequences, excellent sci-fi plot, and spectacular special effects make this a must see. The movie inspired me and also showed me in a ""Neo""-Christian way, a small idea of what life on Earth may actually be.  It is actually easier to understand the Christian philosophy after seeing this movie, though it will likely upset the hardcore Christian, who will witness mere mortals wield power like that of God(s).",The Matrix
2354,Yanikk,It makes you think......,10,29 June 1999,"I am totally biased towards this movie because it makes you think about if what we believe is true or not. I enjoy movies that tease the brain, and not the flesh. The Matrix is definitely that. You have to look at the movie from a technological view in order to enjoy it. The special effects were awesome, and I appreciated the fact that the language was not that bad. No, the plot was not one that I expected, but the action made up for that. I do not recommend this movie for children under 18 - their minds probably won't grasp it - but I do recommend it to adults who like to see movies that are out of the ordinary. I am waiting for it to come out on videotape/DVD so I can hear it through my surround sound system. I enjoyed this movie.",The Matrix

I loved this because there was the suspense and excitement that you would expect in this type of movie. Just imagine if this was a true, and not a movie. This would be a horrible  but the movie does tend to make you think. This movie comes highly recommended to all my friend and anybody who is thinking of seeing this for the first time.",The Matrix
2356,NEO1,Breathtaking,10,19 May 1999,From start to finish this film has you firmly lodged into your seat.  the SFX are out of this world and the slow motions will have you gasping and crying out for more.  When this film finnishes you will watch it all over again,The Matrix
2357,Overdriv,"Stylish, well done, intellectual, post-modern - even Keanu can't sink this one!",10,21 May 1999,"This movie takes the ""intelligent action-thriller"" genre started by _Face Off_ to a new level...  For people who enjoy philosophical speculation and exploration of deep concepts, this movie is sure to satisfy.  Although some complain that there are many derivative ideas in the film, you have to remember that ""Mediocre artists borrow.  Great artists steal.""  In stealing some of the best ideas in philosophy and filmmaking from the past 20+ years (the visual references are Simpsons-esque in their ubiquity ;-) , the Wachowski brothers have given concepts that are usually relegated to incomprehensible ""art films"" mainstream appeal, and they do it with a great sense of style.  Kudos.If you enjoy Sci-Fi or Action movies, _The Matrix_ will not disappoint; similarly, if you enjoy metaphysical mental explorations (and are quick enough to appreciate them in a movie context), _The Matrix_ will also push your buttons.  Basically, anyone with a slow mental clock speed need not apply - brainiac adrenalin-junkies, this one's for you!Although this movie *has* taken my #1 spot for best movie of all time (from _Apocalypse Now_), there are a few downsides:Keanu (or as my Brit friend pronounces it, Canoe - as in a hollowed-out chunk of wood) utilizes his natural ability to look clueless perfectly through most of the movie, then doesn't blow it when he has to seem like he knows what he's doing.  He's OK, but his romantic chemistry in the film leaves much to be desired.There are also several supporting characters who are not really given a chance to develop quite thoroughly, although I think the film strikes a good balance due to the limitations of the cinema format (can't be too long - try seeing _Dances With Wolves_ more than once!).  In addition, I believe _The Matrix_ was supposed to be the center part of a trilogy, so perhaps more exposition will be forthcoming.Lastly, those of us who have thought about some of the ideas explored in _The Matrix_ may find that the movie doesn't go *far enough* - there are so many more great questions that could have been posed, but again, you can't try and overload a movie, so by and large, all complaints I could have with the movie are minor.Bottom line:  WHOA!  Go see it!",The Matrix

2363,SLIF2000,hi,10,21 February 2000,"The Matrix is the best movie ever made.  This movie is so perfect in every way, the story is original and clever, the action, stunts and effects are the best you'll ever see.  The movie starts off with Carrie Ann Moss in this room surrounded by police and then in 10 seconds all the police are dead and she's not even harmed, and all the audience are thinking wow!.  After that the film starts explaining what happens for about an hour which it does need because there is a lot to explain, but there are good action scenes in the middle like a training kung fu fight between Keanu Reeves and Laurence Fishbourne.  The last half hour of the movie is my favourite part of any movie ever the action does not stop the whole way through, it starts off with Laurence Fishbourne being captured by Hugo Weaving the main bady agent who are trying to kill the goodies (Reeves, Fishbourne, Moss etc), Reeves and Moss try to rescue Fishbourne from these nearly invincible agents. If you haven't seen this film you are really missing out on something, just make sure you concentrate or you will get confused.  My rating is 10 out of 10.",The Matrix
2364,omega-22,The most impressive vision of 1999,10,13 June 1999,Th Matrix was without a doubt the most well written science fiction film in the past 5 years or so. I was blown away by how they created such a hard to believe world but yet managed to make you believe it. The whole theme of the film (at least this is what I think) was a reflection of our own lives and how we live in a world that's made up of so many distractions we never really realize whats going on around us. So many people shut their eyes to many events that happen in the real world and get lost in their own private worlds. Well to describe the theme this movie tries to pass on to the viewers. I can do this in three words. FREE YOUR MIND. Like I said thats just what I think. Maybe you do too.,The Matrix
2365,Matrix-34,Awesome!,10,26 June 1999,"The Matrix is probably the most visually stunning film I have ever seen. The fight scenes simply take your breath away, and leave you in a state of wonder.  The slow-motion filming of the gun battle scenes is of first class proportion.  As stunning as this film is visually, the story is of the highest class, spun out over two and a half hours or so, blending in perfectly within the films context, that being action/sci-fi.  Despite the complexity of the film, it was surprisingly easy to follow, the reason for that fact lies in the majestic storytelling that is conjured within The Matrix.  One word to describe this film would have to be awesome.  Don't even think, just go see, and be amazed.  I promise you will not regret it. The Matrix is an experience of film-making all of it's own, simply of a different class.",The Matrix
2366,Dan-308,Very slick and smooth!,10,22 June 1999,"The Matrix is one of (if not the most) coolest film ever made!It has revived Keanu Reeves' career entirely and is a must see for everyone. The only problem I can see for this film is that when it comes out on video it may lose its effect unless everyone has 16"" T.V's with digital surround sound! The FX were immense. It has definitely broken into my number 5 films ever!",The Matrix
2367,Mad-Scientist,wow,9,18 June 1999,"I went to see this movie twice, and maybe I'll go another time. It's a totally cool idea of this world being a fake, virtual world that is fed into the minds of us, humans, to let us think everything is OK, which is not the case. We've let things get out of control when we invented AI and now ""the robots"" use our bodies for their energy supply. Neo (Keanu Reeves) is pulled out of The Matrix to the real world (or what's left of it) to save mankind. I especially totally liked the 'agents'. The way they behave, act, move, speak is so very credible, machine-like. They look like men in black but they're cooler in some sort of way. They never react wildly, but speak distinctly. Bad guys of this millennium if you're askin' me! The fighting scenes are also very mind-blowing. The slowmotion/fast blurry effects are like you're watching them in trance (definitely go see this movie in a big-screen cinema!!!). The bullet dodging and flying around is very believable. also check out the soundtrack! it really rocks!!!",The Matrix

2369,Lilia36,It's an excellent movie--GO SEE IT!!!,10,22 June 1999,"It is the best movie I've ever seen!  The effects are astounding, the actors' martial arts techniques are perfection, and the plot well thought out.  Personally, I was very much inspired by this movie.  It shows a world where there are no limits and anything is possible. The role of Neo was perfect for Keanu Reeves because he, like Neo, has that mysterious aura.  It worked out very well for the movie.  Carrie Anne Ross was empowering in her role as Trinity.  I loved her quiet authority. I particularly liked how there were various philosophies combined to send an inspirational message.  Actually there were many messages the movie sent across.  Question ""reality"", ""What is real?"",  letting go of doubt and fear and freeing your mind, etc.  I liked when Morpheus said, ""...There's something wrong with the world.  You don't know what it is, but it's there, like a splinter, driving you mad.""  The movie brings up a lot of questions about reality. Please, if you haven't seen it yet, GO SEE IT!!!

I thought The Matrix was phenomenal and well worth the time I spent watching it.With stunning visual effects and a well-integrated plot, The Matrix is by far the best movie of 1999.  I believe the character Neo was well suited for Keanu Reeves' acting style who did a wonderful job.  Moss, Fishburne, and Pantoliano were excellent in their portrayals of their characters.  After seeing the movie, I saw reality in a different way.  It was empowering for me.  I can only say that about a handful of movies.For anyone who hasn't seen The Matrix, this is one you won't be disappointed with.  It's well worth the time.",The Matrix

2372,Jobje,Fantastic movie!,9,29 June 1999,"I saw this movie twice, and probably am going to see it once again. This is a superb film which combines action with science fiction and adds some philosophical questions too. I read some comments which say that the story is crap, but that isn't the point. The point is that it makes you think! The Matrix is just a story of an interpretation of reality and we all do that once in a while. We all sometimes question what is real and what is not. The Matrix is an enormously rich movie, that's why you should see it more than once.The first time you can sit back and just enjoy what you are seeing, and you will see much. During the first part of the movie not just Neo is introduced into 'another' world, but we as viewers are too. And it just takes you away. Only super objective people can say that they are not 'sucked' into the movie. You won't be bored, I can guarantee you. The visual aspects are astonishing, the action scenes are perfect and don't forget the soundtrack! First of all it's a super action movie.The second time, when you know what is going to happen, you can think about what you see. The story has pretension, it's about rethinking all that is familiar. Is the world what it seems to be? The symbolism within the movie is also overwhelming: it's Plato's cave mixed with the story of Jesus Christ. Sometimes you will see flaws in the storyline (especially in the end, when I started thinking we were in an adaptation of Snowwhite), but that doesn't matter, because after the movie has ended, it's just fun thinking (and talking) further about it. Imagine the moral implications of it all: especially the Cypher-character is interesting. What would we do in his situation? In general: Who is good and who is bad in the movie? Is that distinction possible?I can really recommend this movie to all moviegoers, I'd rate it 9 out of 10. (By the way: Laurence Fishburne is magnificent)",The Matrix
2373,Gumby-17,Whatever happened to enjoying the movie?,10,4 July 1999,"I've been sitting here, reading these comments for a while now (being a staunch fan of The Matrix, i'm a bit biased, but still...) The first thing that comes to mind is the overwhelmingly large number of negative comments, ranging from ""Holes in the plot"" to ""I hate Keanu Reeves"" to ""One big Nokia Advertisement"" to ""Engineered to appeal to youth, no real content""... I have only one thing to say to these sad, pedantic people: ""Why don't you just sit back and enjoy the movie?"" Sure, the plot has a few holes... but there's a plot, and it is original, and it holds together much better than many others (Lost in Space or Armageddon, anyone?) Who cares if it was engineered (if it was)? Whatever caused it to be created has nothing to do with the result... I mean... Who failed to grin at Neo's trenchcoat-opening scene before the big lobby shoot-up? Who didn't thrill with anticipation and grin with glee as Neo swooped down behind that HUGE chaingun to deliver some major Agent Ass-whipping? Who wasn't impressed at the amazing fight scenes? (""Camp?"" what planet are you on?)The bottom line is, The Matrix was an entirely original, well presented, sci-fi action thriller that everyone should see. Roll on the sequel, Wachowski brothers...",The Matrix
2374,Gnizhak,Like my thoughts exactly..,7,10 July 1999,"From the minute the movie started, I saw that there was good planning behind the movie.The Movie really had a plot. Not a very complex one, except for some people. But it made you think, what if that was real, and all else not. We just have to find an awakened person.The Camera angles were excellent. They almost always found the optimal effect or angle to speed up the feeling in the scene. Halfway of the film, it looked like it was lost, but later on it was rolling again and the show was really enjoyable. New and amazing. Only one major ""annoying"" cliché in the film though.. And a few smaller ones. Not gonna spoil someone's movie telling about them. :)Go and see it.. It made me doubt, that should I see Star Wars: E1 after this experience.",The Matrix

2376,joerum,"Beyond the flash, not too much substance",6,20 April 2000,"The Matrix is the typical hyperactive action movie that once you look past its flash there is not too much substance.  With a really good movie of this type, the questions will not arise until after you've been on the rollercoaster ride.  However, the Matrix doesn't live up to that standard, which is why it deserves only a 6.Some questions I had while watching the Matrix: 1.  Why do the machines need humans as a source of energy?  Fossil, nuclear, thermal even cows, wouldn't be better source? 2.  If the entire Matrix is computer generated by the machines, why do they run around shooting bullets instead of just bending the situation to their needs? 3.  How are the ""warriors"" fueling/repairing their ship? 4.  What sort of power has made Neo the One?  God? The Force?Overall, the typical one man fight against ""them"" and all the evil ""they"" personify yet in no way exploring what the alternative is once everyone is freed from their pod.  I would guess The One enslaves them all and has them erect a temple to his glory.  I'd rather stay in my pod.",The Matrix

Nothing bad for Wachowski brothers, which, in an universe of movie business where we are used to watch to action movies without any story, their job is unbelievably extraordinary. It really takes your breath away. You feel as if you were under effect of some kind of drug! Those fights are the best ones I've ever seen in my whole life, and I don't even like fights at all (until now), just because the truth is that those fights look like ""ballet""... Like said Keanu Reeves (probably the only guy crazy enough to understand what was that movie all about without watching it): ""it's all about love, evolution, faith, questions, authority, systems, order""...

2384,Rey-5,Okay but HIGHLY overrated...,5,13 August 2001,"The Matrix was great.  Well, that's what I thought when I first saw it. But after that, it was kind of dull. Plus, everyone goes on and on about it: the great fighting scenes, the awesome special effects, the ""original"" and ""deep"" idea of reality not being reality. It wasn't really that great. First, it was NOT as unique as everybody says. The idea of this not being reality has been approached in several other movies and shows, including ""eXistenZ"" (a great movie),  an episode of ""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" (and a few other Trek episodes), and even ""Red Dwarf"" (a British sci-fi comedy show). I'm sure it's been used in countless other things before as well. The fight scenes and special effects weren't as good as they could have been, either. Wow, they can fight in slow motion. They can do whatever their minds can consider, right, especially Neo? Why not just think the enemy dead? Why dodge bullets when you could make them cease to exist? Oh, right, because the people watching this movie for the ""deep"" plot line really just want some plot with the fighting and effects. Also, one thing that really annoyed me (SPOILER ALERT) was the Sleeping Beauty ending. Trinity didn't exactly have a main part until the end, where she suddenly kisses Neo and he's no longer dead. It was far too romantic-gushy-fairy-tale to be in an action/sci-fi movie. The movie was not worth the reviews and popularity it received.

But in this case the plot extends beyond the bounds, creativity and originality like anything before it. The movie keeps the viewer guessing between what is reality and what is unreal throughout the entire movie, which makes it a rather stimulating watch for those viewers who don't mind a somewhat complex storyline. The movie though will suit the action fanatic with an abundance of fight seens, including a memorable one between Laurence Fishburne and one of the bad guys. Once you take away the action and stimulating storyline there is a rather original and unique science fiction tone around the movie that will please any sci-fi fan.

I put aside such questions as ""Why does Hollywood see Keanu as a cyberpunk? How came everyone is making making a big deal about these fx which you can see in shampoo commercials?"" I can honestly say I gave it every chance. The fact that the creators were trying to create fully developed worldview was admirable, and the movies surprises hadn't yet been revealed.So as the movie rolled, and I got too see one of the worst, most painful movies I have ever seen, I could honestly say it wasn't me. I enjoy scifi and Hong Kong films, enjoy Philip K. Dick, so I was basically the ideal audience for this film.The plot was so full of loopholes, maintaining suspension of disbelief was impossible. Except for one or two supporting cast members, the acting was lifeless, and the action was unsupported by any motivation. The antagonists were far more sympathetic than the protagonists, whose cold-blooded killing sprees did nothing to endear them to me. Finally the washed out lighting and coloring took away a lot of depth from the images.. when someone seems to leap from building to building, if the buildings look collapsed together, it's not that impressive.
And the fighting.. when you watch Jet Li or Jackie Chan fight, even when they are obviously assisted by wires, you feel an exhilaration at what they are physically capable of doing. The fights flow, and the character is maintained through out. In The Matirx, there is no real joy or sense of exertion. People punch each other, pull some interesting feats, but without any sense of risk or accomplishment.What people saw in this waste of film, time and money, I do not know. But I include it with the American remake of Godzilla as one of the worst movies I have ever seen. If you want Phillip K. Dick reality warping, see Blade Runner. If you want good cyberpunk anime, see Akira or Ghost in The Shell, or for martial arts, a good Bruce Lee or Hong Kong flick.But don't waste your time on this.",The Matrix

We have no idea whether the world we are now living is true or just a dream. Real or not real? What a deep question from the movie.Those gun fighting scenes are excellent. Although they really let me think of John Woo's films but they are still very cool.Anyway, don't miss this film. And if you like Matrix, please also try Dark City. It is also a very interesting cult movie.",The Matrix
2392,Sampson-7,Matrix=Brilliance,10,22 May 2000,"A Philosopher who once thought that we were all just blobs being controlled by someone or something else concluded that we really existed based upon the saying, ""I think, therefore I am."" Without trying to give away too much of the plot of this fascinating philosophical script, The Matrix interprets life, and the world of Thomas A. Anderson (Neo) not too differently. Combined with great fight scenes and special effects, the Matrix will stretch your imagination and set the table for the sequel (coming in 2001). Even if you don't like sci-fi, see The Matrix for its philosophy; It all begins when Mr. Anderson (Keanu Reeves) is asked by Morpheus (Lawrence Fishburne) which pill he would like to take? One reveals the truth, the other and he can return to his bed and continue to live his life. This was first proposed to us by Plato, with the analogy of the cave. If you like action, if you like effects, if you like sci-fi, or if you like philosophy, see the Matrix.",The Matrix

It's got action and sci-fi and heaps of special effects, and Keanu Reeves is as usual wonderful to watch. You better hurry!",The Matrix
2394,sdc_1,This One Will Last,10,21 November 1999,"""Forget about the screenplay, it's all about the effects"", they said.When I went to see the film at an exclusive midnight premiere I didn't know anything about the film. 144 minutes later I decided to never go to an exclusive midnight premiere again. The punishment was the knowledge that I would not be able to see the film again until its official screening one full week later. Somehow I survived.The story is mind-blowing and discusses a lot of essential questions about reality, everyday life, who each one of us is and who decided it that way.The protagonist, Thomas Andersen, not really satisfied with his existence as an average employee, finally gets the contact he had always been seeking. A group of ,matrix-resistant' individuals share their knowledge about the ,matrix' with him and furthermore tell him that he was chosen to put an end to that fake reality.The exposition of the story and the characters is great. The film starts within the very first second but still leaves the viewer unsure about what ,really' is going on. Is Thomas A. Anderson only dreaming? Or is he really ,Neo'? Is ,Neo' more than just a night-life name? Is ,Neo' Thomas A. Andersons true identity? The way the story unfolds is thrilling and the turning points come with good timing. One of two weak points in the story comes when the writers-directors must get Neo to confront his antagonist. Trinity at that point has to play the poor part of bringing on the delay. The way we got to know her throughout the film makes it anything but convincing that she would start long talks at that rather delicate moment.Whoever wants to criticize Keanu Reeves for his acting probably has a problem with actors that don't show that they are acting while they are acting. He's not in flirtation with the audience or the critics while he's performing. He's too busy doing a great and extremely convincing job. I have never been a fan or something so please consider me as neutral. Lawrence Fishburne is the most charismatic Morpheus I could ever imagine, and the rest of the cast is the perfect choice also. Carrie-Anne Moss handles the extremes between the cool ,matrix-trinity' and the sensitive ,reality-trinity' impressively well. Stock music rarely works in movies but when Rage Against The Machine hit it after Neo flies away in the end, something just works.I don't see ,The Matrix' as bringing on  easy answers. Every answer is followed by a question, and ,the one' in the end only becomes ,the one' because he chose himself to become ,the one'. Nothing more, nothing less. While the matrix is all clean and colorful, reality is dirty and cold. The parts of the dialogue who deal with essential questions (like ""what is the matrix"") are brilliantly written and convincing -apart from that other weak point that irritates me, concerning the machines and how they got the power. I suggest you go and check that for yourself ...It's surprising to see deep-thought-subjects being discussed in a ,mainstream' Hollywood movie -especially at that length. Since the Wachowski Brothers had troubles to get the project financed, it might not be that ,mainstream' anyway. In fact, at least the outlook of the film is ,avant-garde'. Ground-breaking camera-technology and breathtaking choreography of the fighting scenes team up with innovative direction. Neo's ,wake-up' scene in the incubator, the showdown or ,the white room' won't be forgotten so fast.Since the first human being was walking on the planet, there have been speculations about what is real, if or how that might be proven, and what kind of consequences that might have. Therefore not too many themes could be more classical than the one of ,The Matrix'. But it's not only classical, to some it might be scary: it invites us to see parallels in our world, igniting questions about who -based on what kind of legitimacy- makes all the rules and how much power each of us has in that game.The choice of the theme and the way the theme is presented is what truly makes this film the first film of the next millennium. It already has entered movie history.",The Matrix

Some say that Keanu Reeves is somewhat wooden in The Matrix, but I can't think of anyone who could play the role better.  It has a great plot that keeps you ensnared until the end, when you're begging for it to keep going.  You leave wishing it were real. The effects were, in a word, perfect.  I have to say that there are only one or two flaws in the entire movie, and I'm not telling what they are, because I wish I didn't know them.  But then, you have to see it as many times as I have to notice.  If you haven't seen this movie, rent it.  I promise it will blow you away.

Like most folks, The Matrix's visuals blew me away. YOU MUST SEE THIS FILM ON THE BIG SCREEN. But what was even more impressive was the super-tight story, effective use of mythology, empathetic main character, compelling obstacle character and horrific antagonist. Before I saw this film I thought THE ROCK with Nick Cage and Sean Connery was the best action film with real substance behind it.  The Matrix definitely deserves a top spot on the Top 250 list. See this film! I don't know anyone who hasn't been impressed with it. If these brothers can keep writing like this they are destined for long-term film maker fame.  If you end up liking this film, see BOUND, also by the brothers Wachowski, with Gina Gershon and Jennifer Tilly.",The Matrix

Although the movie is pretty long, about 2hrs and 15mins, it's well worth it.  The special effects is top notch and the plot makes one think and can mess with your head if you let it. Carrie-Anne Moss is awesome as the tough and sexy Trinity who always seems to be wearing tight leather outfits, which is fine by me.  Her opening scene in the movie is definitely an attention getter.  Laurence Fishbourne also does an awesome job as the ever wise morpheus. I enjoyed every scene with him in it.  The kung fu action is smooth, especially when it's blended with cool aerial stuff and special effects.  All in All, definitely a must see movie.",The Matrix

For example, one of these films is ""The Wizard of Oz"".  The Matrix is an influential film, mixing fun with a serious plot, which has underlying implications in modern life.  I refer of course to the under-hand and, in some places blatant, disregard for human life for the benefit of those in power.The point is, I believe in the Matrix as a true representation of our oppressed modern society.",The Matrix

I just blown away by his everything. he was the one of the best villains that I've ever seen on screen in recent movie history.(alongside ""Hannibal Lector"") some people hate Keanu's wooden acting, It was.. yes..but I doubt any other actor could achieve that role so naturally like him.In spite of some bad reviews, it's obvious that this movie ""the one"" which open the new sci-fi film world.",The Matrix

There are certain movies you go to to see action, some drama, some horror, but this one was a special effects one for me.  The first half-hour of the movie filled me to the brim with all the S/FX I needed.Surprisingly, when the plot is exposed, the movie becomes more than just a sci-fi flick with plenty of black leather.

I was taken completely by surprise.Yes, there were lot's of special effects.  Yes, there was the set of actors there with name recognition.  But, to my surprise was a solid plot, and credible, solid acting to make it believable and interesting.Keanu Reeves stars as Neo, a computer programmer who is also a hacker finds that his life is not what it appears when a team of people, led by Morpheus(played by Laurence Fishburne) rescue him from Pseudo-Reality.The combination of a well written action adventure, with stellar special effects, great direction and cinematography and a cast that makes it believable and real makes this film the best action science-fiction movie since Blade Runner.",The Matrix
2413,pmayer1,A good action movie,5,13 December 1999,"I thought that The Matrix was one of the better action movies I have ever seen.  However, the depth that so many other people see, I do not.  It seems like the directors read some philosophy of knowledge, found enough of an idea to make a movie, and then quit.  The philosophy of this movie misses the entrie point of epistemology, which doesn't ask if we are in the true reality, but more what is reality, how do we interact with it, and how do we have knowledge of it. As far as acting, Fishburne was good, as was Weaving, but it seemed that Reeves and Moss were there so they could be seen in tight leather. The special effects are very well done, and I loved the training sessions. The directors do a good job of building the action and the suspence. Overall a good action movie, but little more.",The Matrix
2414,mambubukid,The benchmark for all sci-fi films to come,10,19 September 2000,"The story of a reluctant Christ-like protagonist set against a baroque, MTV backdrop, The Matrix is the definitive hybrid of technical wizardry and contextual excellence that should be the benchmark for all sci-fi films to come.Hollywood has had some problems combining form and matter in the sci-fi genre.  There have been a lot of visually stunning works but nobody cared about the hero. (Or nobody simply cared about anything.)  There a few, though, which aroused interest and intellect but nobody 'ooh'-ed or 'aah'-ed at the special effects.  With The Matrix, both elements are perfectly en sync.  Not only did we want to cheer on the heroes to victory, we wanted them to bludgeon the opposition.  Not only did we sit in awe as Neo evaded those bullets in limbo-rock fashion, we salivated.But what makes The Matrix several cuts above the rest of the films in its genre is that there are simply no loopholes.  The script, written by the Wachowski brothers is intelligent but carefully not geeky.  The kung-fu sequences were deftly shot -- something even Bruce Lee would've been proud of.  The photography was breathtaking.  (I bet if you had to cut every frame on the reel and had it developed and printed, every single frame would stand on its own.)  And the acting?  Maybe not the best Keanu Reeves but name me an actor who has box-office appeal but could portray the uneasy and vulnerable protagonist, Neo, to a T the way Reeves did.  But, come to think of it, if you pit any actor beside Laurence Fishburne, you're bound to confuse that actor for bad acting.  As Morpheus, Mr. Fishburne is simply wicked!  Shades of his mentor-role in Higher Learning, nobody exudes that aura of quiet intensity than Mr. Fishburne.  His character, battle-scarred but always composed Morpheus, is given an extra dose of mortality (He loves Neo to a fault.) only Mr. Fishburne can flesh out.People will say what they want to say about how good The Matrix is but the bottomline is this: finally there's a philosophical film that has cut through this generation.  My generation. The Wachowski brothers probably scribbled a little P.S. note when they finished the script saying: THINK FOR A MOMENT ABOUT YOUR EXISTENCE.  What is the Matrix, you ask?  Something that's closer to reality than you think.Either that or it's my personal choice for best film of all-time.",The Matrix

I was surprised to hear that a lot of people were bad mouthing the story line, but I then found out that they didn't get the movie. When I explained the events to some of my friends they changed their opinion and started liking the movie. The movie also had some of the best dialogue. It was all very crisp and sharp which helps to make the movie more engaging. And I liked all of the actors in the film. Especially Laurence Fishburne, he was magnificant as Morpheus.

2421,olegperov,Cult movie? Not really.,4,24 February 2000,"After watching a movie which some call ""The best sci-fi film of the Millennium"" I had this serious and uncontrollable urge to go in depth and examine it to the last piece. You can ask me ""Why can't you just seat back and receive pleasure?"" I can. But not when it comes to movie which is called cult.The special effects were good. But the only reason they were made is to create a show. Check out the eXistenZ - I don't think there were any computer animated effects at all, but you get a full feeling of another reality.What's really bad is a plot of the film. This is supposed to be a movie were the Good Guys are fighting the Bad Matrix. But what Matrix is bad is questionable. It takes away people's freedom to control their lives but allows them to live in a bright sunny world, when the real world is dark ruins, ugly closing and food that looks and tastes like plastic. Some people could say that the Matrix is doing a good deed.Not to mention that using a people's bodies as a batteries is not very effective, you have to feed them and that's a real waste of energy.Absolutely unnecessary thing in this film is a Kung Fu. If you can bend spoons and duck bullets with the power of your mind, you don't need any martial arts. It was made only to put some action into film.And the worst thing is a prophecy about the ""Chosen-One"". Neo was the ""Chosen-One"" all the time and it doesn't matter if Trinity would fall in love with him or not. He had his abilities, he trained them and it's logically to assume that he would get them. But no! He fully gets them only when Trinity says she loves him. Yes, it was in Oracles prophecy, but don't You think that the things You can do are not depend from what other people think about You? This is really falls apart, and this is a major moment in movie.To avoid any farther damaging of a Matrix fan's feelings, I must say that this movie is not all that bad. It's a good show and you can really enjoy it, but please, don't call it ""The best sci-fi film of the Millennium""! Go see Alien instead.

Except that it's incredibly refreshing to see an intelligent action movie. It's a real rarity in a society where action movies have been getting dumber and dumber. I think this film pretty much sounded the death-knell for the standard brainless Schwarzenegger/Van Damme genre (notice how relatively unsuccessful such movies have been since ""The Matrix"" was released). Perhaps ""Total Recall"" would have been as good as ""The Matrix"" if the original lead, Matthew Broderick, had starred instead of Arnie. Whatever.

The switch between Green and Blue layers to make it easy on the viewers to tell the difference between fiction and reality are a nice touch. The combined slow-mo and highspeed frame scenes are a pleasure for the eye.

While certainly not a Christian movie, it has many Christian parallels.The whole concept of ""The Matrix"" applies aptly to our time. Our ""matrix"" is created by the major news media, Hollywood, the government, etc. They all tell us what to believe and they all lie to us with relative impunity. Only a few of us know the truth.I eagerly await the sequels and highly recommend this fast-moving movie to all.",The Matrix
2433,hearm,How action should be done,9,23 July 2000,"When I first read my norwegian newspaper about the popular movie about ""the reality that's pulled over our eyes"" i've got interested, also because i'm interested in the paranormal and of course computers.I went to the theater, sat down and the movie started. After about 30 minutes I realised; this wasn't just an ordinary action movie, it was much, much more.I've got this ""Deja Vu"" when i watched that movie. The thought of me thinking exactly the same as the writers of the movie did.The action scenes,the fighting scenes,the breathtaking effects,the taglines, everything about this movie was extremly well made.But, on the technical side, I just hate one mistake that was shoot in the film. Tha's the scene when Neo and Mr Smith is fighting in the subway rails, when Neo jumps from the rails, and up to the higher floor level.It was easy to see the cables he hangs/and holds himself from.But that the only thing that I dislike with this movie. And I have no doubt when I say, this is the best movie i've ever seen.And therefor I bought the DVD version,the VHS version and a VideoCD version, just to have it in a long time.Brilliant!",The Matrix
2434,[cCM],It was a big shiny action movie.,8,5 August 2000,"I saw this in theaters when it came out, and it was what I expected: a movie with lots of special effects-enhanced gunplay and exploding things. A lot of people have dismissed it as not being sufficiently serious sci fi, or lacking character development. I'm suprised anyone expected either. If you haven't seen the movie, prepare for nonstop eye candy, stylish violence, and a fair amount of humor. Whether or not that's enough is personal preference. Personally, I was entertained enough to have watched it a few times since.",The Matrix
2435,khavanon,"The best Science-Fiction film of 1999, ""The Matrix"" is certainly a whole leap above ""The Phantom Menace.""",9,25 September 2000,"Of all the blockbuster movies that were shown last year (1999), I would rate this second only to Fight Club in overall appeal. Even as ""The Phantom Menace"" entered into the summer, ""The Matrix"" was definitely the premier Science-Fiction of the year, making up where ""The Phantom Menace"" failed so miserably. (Anyone that up-plays ""The Phantom Menace"" over this movie is jealous because everyone ragged on their ""precious, infallible Star Wars"" and placed this one far ahead of it, which is rightfully so. Don't get me wrong, I love Star Wars, but this movie is definitely better than Episode One).There were at times some cheesy moments, most notably the romantic moment between Neo (Keanu Reeves) and Trinity (Carrie-Anne Moss). Neo wasn't as strong as one would hope our hero to be, but it can be understood that he is taking his situation in all at once, converted from just a simple programmer/skilled hacker in the process of reorientating his entire knowledge of things. To understand the movie of course, one would have follow the advice of Morpheus (Lawrence Fishburne), ""Unfortunately, nobody can be told what the Matrix is. You have to see it for yourself.""The effects were excellent as well as the action sequences, not to mention the plot concept had been very intriguing, original no less. It is certainly worth seeing for anyone who wants to think about new concepts afterward. Anyone who thinks this was a terrible movie DOES NOT appreciate Science-Fiction, and probably believes classic literature is the only kind of literature. Let them watch ""Citizen Kane"" if they like and leave these movies alone.",The Matrix

Also with all the hidden things in the movie, all the connotations to other things, and all the biblical similarities it is a movie that one can watch over and over again and even study.

2445,GPL,"Uncanny, and perhaps unintended, Christian allegory",10,3 December 2000,"One of the best films of the decade and perhaps the finest sci-fi of all time finds these merits--not from its excellent visual and special effects--but from its philosophical underpinnings.The power of The Matrix comes from its (unintended?) inspiration from the Christ story of bondage and blindness to the illusionary natural world of pleasures for a season vs. the truth of eternal life through the sacrificial blood of the Lamb of God, Christ the Messiah.  There are so many comparisons between the Christian world-view as portrayed in Scripture and The Matrix---be it the natural/supernatural and Matrix/non-Matrix experiences or Christ as Redeemer and Neo as Savior---that is is impossible to belief that were it not for the Christ-story, The Matrix (the movie) would have ever existed.That is not a criticism.  Just a testament that the greatest stories find their sources in a reality higher than our own and a select few have opened their minds enough to tap into this truth.",The Matrix

2447,dzieve1,Classic misdirection into reality,10,13 November 2011,"""Matrix"" is all shiny, trendy, slow bullet sci-fi. Even has the obligatory helicopter destruct scene. What's not to like? Must be why it is in the ""top 250"" and why everyone loves it. Not really. NO, this movie is a camouflaged parody of the modern sci-fi blockbuster. Everything it has to tease and attract the Uberjaded movie addict does not work in the end. That is the not so hidden message of the film. The W brothers started out with a faux-secret agenda and stuck with it for the first movie. Their agenda is so simple, it needs no explanation, no complicated deconstruction, no long winding road of thought. Yes the MATRIX is not the real world. But the world of Zion, the world of the Nebuchadnezzer, is not the REAL world either. It is just a vehicle the W brothers gave you to hold onto. The mind wants to hold on. Look beyond Zion, beyond the Matrix, beyond Neo. Why does Neo wake up so many times in this movie? Because he is methodically learning that each world he encounters is a dream. They are all Maya. When Neo believes he can alter reality in any way desired with his mind alone that is also a trick. Remember, this is the clueless and dazed Keanu Reeves acting. It is not his mind he is using, but rather his faith. Doesn't have to be faith in Jesus or God or Trinity per se, just faith in himSELF as the ultimate reality. IF most people believed they had this power, our society would dissolve and become reformatted into a friendlier and freer place. It's movies like the Matrix that actually foment such freedom. This movie has a message which has nothing in common with ""Inception"" or any of the copycat escapist drivel that it has spawned. It is one of the best movies ever made and reminds me of ""Cast Away"" and ""Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind"", all of them a celebration of the power of the Self.As for the W brothers, it is hard to blame them for straying away in the sequels, it is just human nature to want MORE. That's why the sequels, which should not have been made, are well recognized as big box office rip offs.",The Matrix

It has some of the most awesome actions scenes ever, pure originality, strong ideas and plot lines, a great cast, deep hidden meaning and it makes the viewers think about whats going on. Bullet time was truly excellent, the revelations of Neo's true power was compelling and to finalise, it rules! The film of the 90's by a country mile. Have to fill out ten lines. Okay, the soundtrack was also awesome. Check out track 12 on the album (Du Hast - Rammstein). One of the greatest tunes ever. The lobby scene was spectacular, and there is also a lot of hidden meaning within the film. Neo is an anagram of one, Morpheus was a Greek god of discovery (I think), Trinity is a blatant reference to the holy trinity, the ship Nebuchchadnezza is a Biblical reference to King Nebuch Chadnezza, the other crew members - Mouse, Psyther, Switch, Apoc all reference computers in some way, and the pilots and children of Zion - Tank, Dozer both refer to mechanics in some way. It's awesome. P.S can people stop bad mouthing the sequels? They were great films. People just think they were bad because they compare them with this and that makes them look bad. This film cast a huge shadow which was almost unbeatable, but accept that they were still pretty damn good.",The Matrix
2460,fender1514,"Not only the bible, but also Plato",10,14 November 2002,"I've read many of the comments regarding the parallels between the Matrix and the Bible.  I didn't see them before that but thanks for pointing them out.  The Matrix also had a strong parallel with the writings of Plato. Plato basically believed in two worlds.  The world that you could see with your senses (filled with problems, change, and imperfection) and the world that you could ""see"" with logic.  According to Plato, the logical world was the ""real"" world and the world of senses was created by a divine being(similar to the matrix being created by the machines).  Plato's allegory of the cave is a story to describe how this situation could happen. Basically, he tells of people who have been captured and chained to a wall in a cave.  Your head is held in place so you may only look forward at another wall.  Above your head (and out of your vision) are many objects that are part of the real world.  However all that you can see are the shadows of these objects cast upon the wall of the cave.  Everyone learns these shadows and makes names for them.  Their entire lives are based on shadows.  Upon being released from the cave the people are obviously in shock (like when Neo was released from the Matrix).  I could get into it more but I think you can probably see the parallel here.  Anybody who wants to more about it can study Plato a little as these are some of his major contributions to natural philosophy.",The Matrix

Every now an then a film will come along that pushes imagination and technology to a new level. The Matix being one of those films. With its (at the time) cutting edge use of still photography techniques to the sophisticated CG it is a unique piece of art that touched many old, tried and true story lines, yet combined them with current ideas and fantasy.
For those who feel that this film was lacking in originality I have this to say. Art is never original, it is an imitation, improvisation and adaptation of many influences, ideas and concepts put together to create something new.

Keaunu Reaves as Neo,Laurence Fishburne as Morpheus and Hugo Weaving as agent Smith were all ten out of ten because of their costumes they wore,their amazing fight scenes(especially at the end between Neo and Agent Smith),and of course the way they all acted.What ever you say about The Matrix you must say that if its either the best film you've seen or at least one of the best films you've seen.",The Matrix

I wanted to elaborate on that, but I mean, isn't that special? It takes me back to the Universal horror days.
Now that we know them as the the Wachowski Sisters it's as clear as day how their trans experience informed every aspect of this story. You can read this film a 100 ways I think but if you don't rewatch it soon with this in mind you are truly missing out.
I highly recommend readers watch the Matrix animes created for the film. I'm not gonna Google it right now, but I saw them years ago and they were fantastic.

Obviously, the movie is not perfectly realistic. There are logistical problems with how the Matrix would work, the whole concept of Zion is ill-concieved, but I think what the Wachowski brothers were essentially trying to do is transfer a comic book to the screen. If you look at the book on the making of the Matrix, or of some of the storyboards shown on the DVD, you'll understand what I mean. Not to mention the planned anime prequels.Morpheus is a 2-dimensional wisened mentor of a super-hero, nothing more, nothing less, and Fishburne plays him excellently. Neo was supposed to just be confused a lot, which Keanu can do pretty well. Joe Pantoliano was great as Cypher, and Hugo Weaving was excellent as usual as Agent Smith. All relatively simple, yet well-written and well-played characters.
Carrie-Ann Moss is a pretty bad actress, and she looks like a cadaver. That's really the only flaw in the movie.The brothers Wachowski very successfully articulate their comic book vision on-screen, and it is a visually stunning film with great effects and well thought out action scenes. The opening of the hotel lobby scene is one of the coolest things I've ever seen.Stop criticizing this movie and take it for what it is, a slightly more serious, less mindless, action-packed sci-fi movie. It's already being imitated throughout Hollywood, but once that clears up in a few years, people will see how original this is.If Star Wars deserves its spot on the Top 250, then the Matrix definitely does.",The Matrix

2502,MattStolz,The Allegory of The Matrix: A Metaphysical and Theological Odyssey,10,11 January 2007,"On March 31, 1999, The Matrix, undoubtedly one of the greatest films ever produced, was released into thousands of theaters worldwide. Directed by the Wachowski brothers, The Matrix tells the story of a confused, questioning, Thomas Anderson, a computer programmer by day and a notorious hacker by nightalias: Neowho is searching for an answer to a question that eludes him: what is the Matrix? He is visited by a man named Morpheus who tells him that he can answer the question which Neo so desperately seeks the answer to; that he can show Neo the truthhe can show Neo ""just how deep the rabbit hole goes""if he wishes it, and so he does. Neo learns from Morpheus that he has been living in a completely fabricated reality known as the Matrix; a computer generated dream world created by an advanced artificial cybernetic intelligence systemthat now rules Earthfor the sole purpose of keeping humans blissfully content as they are unknowingly grown in endless fields and then harvested for the energy that their bodies emitas they are transformed into batteries for the machines. Morpheus frees Neo from the oppressive shackles of this ""reality"" and Neo finds himself catapulted to the vanguard in a war between the pitiful remnants of mankind and the awesome machines that now rule the world. The Matrix manages to combine a stunning array of ingeniously filmed visual effects and intense stylized action with a plethora of philosophical and theological allusions and symbolismsomething precious few other action films ever manage to achieveand it is this featthe melding of thought-provoking intellectual concepts with the usual commonplace high-paced actionthat makes The Matrix such a unique and truly exceptional movie.The Matrix continually ponders philosophical questions sporadically throughout its entirety. Chief among these are questions concerning the nature of reality, truth, existence, and destiny. The Matrix is, in fact, a modern day retelling of Plato's Allegory of the Cave. Neo, being the prisoner who is freed from his bondage and dragged into the world of light, who, when confronted with the painful, naked truth, finds himself unable to comprehend and accept it at first, until, as his mind and eyes adjust, the truth comes into focus and he is able to see and grasp reality for what it truly isno longer tricked by the ghostly apparitions of his old existence; of what he once believed to be real and true.Besides inundating its viewers with a deluge of philosophical themes, The Matrix also presents a veritable feast of theological and mythical allusions and symbolism. Many of its locales, characters, and objects, are based, either explicitly, off such topics, or, if not quite as evidently, still cleverly alluded to, and clearly discernible. Zion, mankind's last city, the Oracle, a guide who assists Neo in his questmost assuredly based off of the legendary Oracle of Delphi that assisted Socrates along his paththe Nebuchadnezzar, Morpheus's ship, and Morpheus himself are some of the more readily apparent references to historical, mythical, or theological objects.However, The Matrix also plays host to a variety of more subtle, yet nonetheless important, thought-provoking, and intriguing references. Many aspects of the plot, themes, and characters presented within the movie directly correspond and run parallel to many of Christianity's themes, biblical stories and characters. Although the story of The Matrix is most closely aligned with ancient Greek and Christian themes and stories, that is not to say that its exploration rests solely within said respective domains.; for The Matrix also delves into many other realms besides those of Christianity and philosophyHinduism and Buddhism being just some of them. The many allusions, symbols, and philosophical aspects of The Matrix are what makes it truly one of the best movies ever made; it is these aspects that propel it from simply a great action flick to preeminence.",The Matrix

Apparently, The matrix managed to do exactly what I didn't expect: it left me empty, but not because of the fact that I've got overwhelmed with emotions and got stunned with the story, unfortunately it's just because of the fact that ""The Matrix"" turned out to be unfathomably dull.It's actually astonishing how such a big amount of money and talent can be wasted on something like that.

Saying that humanity is a computer generated life style. What kind of an idea is that??? It kind of ruins the way that you look at life!!!!!!!!! The soundtrack sucks and so does the cheap special effects!!!! This movie is almost as bad as The Godfather. The thing these 2 movies have in common is that they both suck and are over rated beyond belief. WHAT IS SO GREAT ABOUT THIS MOVIE!!!!!!!!!!!!!! My answer is nothing.

Recently, I watched it again, and realized just how disappointing this movie is.The idea is a winner, I'll grant that, and yes, it is beautiful, everything looks good. The special effects are to die for, and the action sequences towards the end rank among the best I've ever seen. But that must've been all people remember about this movie, because the rest is truly horrible: corniness to the max.Not only are the lines continually terrible, the script writers seem to be trying to be so mysterious and philosophical that some of the things (especially Morpheus) people say come out sounding like they're a complete space case. They simply dont make sense.The acting is truly dull. Absolutely lifeless, except for a reasonably impressive performance by Hugo Weaving, which doesn't save the rest of the cast from looking completely pathetic.Perhaps I am being too harsh, because this movie is worth watching if you're prepared to sit through the cringe-worthy script at the beginning to see the end.

At that point, this becomes a 'bad science' movie that p***ed me off several times for such things as - Reading the matrix off of a computer screen, - Harvesting 'bio energy' off of humans, - Having to create an illusion for humans to live rather than just making them brain dead. Good science and good SF can work together just fine, or at least make it jive with reality! Despite the science, this really is not a bad SF movie, exploring the concept of if 'reality' matters versus the experience, the mental duel with the machine has shades of the of 'if you believe wholly in something, it must be real; if it's not real, you must not believe wholly in it'.Being rated as top ten in the SF category (4th today) is way too high. In the fullness of time, this *might* be considered in the top 25 of the century, but right now it's over rated, probably by those who have not seen enough truly great SF.

The special effects and the action were excellent - ground-breaking in ways.However, it's not as if this was a novel plot, or if the acting were that good, or indeed as if the plot was without holes. Indeed, the entire reason for the matrix indicated that the AIs were in ignorance of the laws of thermodynamics.Not only that, but the bizarre rules (can only leave the matrix via a _simulated_ (remember that) phone line) were far too obviously set up to add drama, rather than as a logical outcome of the rules of the system.Compare this movie with, say, ""The Fellowship of the Ring"", where the world and what happens within it are clearly the results of the rules _behind_ the world, and the flaws of ""The Matrix"" become clear, almost overwhelming.In summary, excellent fluff - but like candy-floss, no lasting value or impact.",The Matrix

The entire concept can be quite mind boggling for a first time viewer but once you watch it, you will want to watch it again.It also helps if you have a basic understanding of Computer science and Artificial Intelligence as the entire movie revolves around these two themes. Without giving anything away, if you have not seen this movie then stop whatever you are doing and go and watch it.",The Matrix

In fact I had to look today on IMDB to see who exactly was involved in both movies, only to find out that virtually nobody had anything to do with both. I could not believe that not only had I not realized this before, but that I hadn't even heard anything about how similar the two are. These two movies are more similar in presentation, artistic imagination and cinematography than Pi and Requiem For a Dream! I'm not saying, necessarily, that it detracts from the incredible effort and excellence apparent in The Matrix, or that the two are all that comparable, but when I see someone performing hyper-realistic martial arts with an unbelievable machine gun and a black trenchcoat jumping through the air flippping and killing 100 people a minute to techno music I feel like I'm experiencing deja-vu! Like I said I'm not knocking The Matrix, I just had to put this info out there!!!!",The Matrix

Even better than Terminator, just because in the later, there is still hope of not allow the destruction to come. While in the former, the damage is done. Moreover, there lots of philosophy references during the movie, what make it more interesting and enjoyable. There are entire websites dedicated to explain those references. Besides that, the movie has set up new parameters for action and sci-fi movies, which has found no surpass until now. I always wander: when a movie will make me feel that way again, after seeing it? Defnetely a milestone for action and sci-fi. MUST SEE!",The Matrix

You get ""The Matrix""I hate this movie...and you wanna know why?  Because it serves no purpose. It's ""Dude, Where's my Car"" on steroids...louder, flashier, but not a bit more interesting.  The whole thing is based on special effects.  It's a film by two directors that think half of the cameras running at 300 fps is art...or something.Hugo Weaving has the only good performance in this movie as Agent Smith. Carrie Anne Moss is bland as can be.  Do I even have to comment on Keanu Reeves....dude...woah...nuff said.This is the perfect example of Joel Silver run amuck.  Just because you have money to produce movies, doesn't mean you should produce bad movies....sounds pretty obvious to me.  I'm just so thankful when I see someone like Steven Spielberg putting out a movie like Minority Report...a movie (actually...a director and crew) that knows how to USE special effects to drive a story.  Not just shoot the hell out of a government building...hmmmm...not such a great scene to slip in there now, huh?So, to everyone involved in The Matrix...give up your black leather, gun toting, world-is-an-illusion, horrible filmmaking and go put your money to good use...like film school.",The Matrix

Today while watching a portion of the old PBS series Cosmos by Carl Sagan, I thought they had used Hugo Weaving's voice to narrate but it was indeed Carl Sagan with his rounding of sounds, pausing and emphasizing, and pursed lips that was speaking. Does anyone know if this is where Hugo Weaving drew inspiration for his manner of speech in The Matrix series? As for the series itself, movie #1 is by far the most exciting, after which the Wachowski Bros writing devolves into a mismash of junk. The last two movies have their moments but some scenes are painful to watch, I.E. the rave and those awful loves scenes with Neo and Trinity.",The Matrix

I'm dead sure they didn't understand the story behind the world & the principles of the Matrix. Go see this movie 5 times more, then watch the Animatrix & read the books, maybe you need a manual to make it to your minds who knows....I agree that a quite similar idea was used in Alex Proyas' Dark City. But what if I tell you both Dark City, & this so called Star Trek Episode is a complete copy of another concept?Go see for yourself. Google these keywords down :""ALLEGORY OF THE CAVE by Plato""""Thinking so ruthless for the ones who create or derive ideas & improve them to a point where they can shape it into a movie, & not showing any respect for creative minds"".... it's a very easy thing to do. If I start to think so blame oriented, then I come to a conclusion which is ""from this time ,no one should make a movie. No horror movies! No vampires, no werewolves, no creatures. No thrillers with killers. Why? because these were all used 200 centuries ago in books & literature. Oh all movies are copycats right!?!?

The film is well cast and boasts several excellent performances (Joe Pantoliano and Hugo Weaving namely) as well as some mediocre ones.  I could say that Keanu Reeves was not the best choice for Neo, but he fits well enough.  A cardboard cut-out of an actor for a cardboard cut-out of a character.

Within Ghost in the Shell, there is slow-motion-action ""bullettime"", and the concept of computer intelligence, with the overarching question ""who am I, why am I here, what do I do."" But anyway, the Matrix did bring the slow-motion action and many new special effects types to the silver screen. Keanu Reeves also has a pretty good cast part in the movie, as long as he is cast well, he performs his parts excellently. The soundtrack is also a pretty good fit to the content of the film.

""being the one is like being in love, you know it with every fiber in your being."" she also tells him that he will have a choice- to save his own life, or to save Morphius's life. Now you would think that if he knew he was the one, then he would save himself for the greater good... but it is when he realizes that he is the one, that he decides to save Morphius when he comes to that decision. ""there is a difference between knowing the path, and walking the path."" the oracle told Neo that ""one of them was going to die."" but he changed fate, he took it in his own hands to save them both because he knew he was the one and that he could do it.

(that is untill The Matrix Reloaded and Revolutions come out)  Great to watch over and over again because you realize countless religious, philosophical, and real world allegories.  I'm not exactly sure why some people don't like this movie, but the best I can work out is that they don't understand it.  They just don't ""get"" it.  There are sooo many people who automatically don't like a story because it doesn't spell it out for them right away.  You might actually have to think to fully grasp the whole of this movie.  This is hard for some people to do, for whatever reason.  Maybe they just weren't expecting this from a action movie.I've seen many people reference to Christien connections to The Matrix. True, true.  (names of characters, story of jesus) And all of this was put in there on purpose.  This was the brothers' fist big project so they put a lot of time into fitting all of these underlying messages in.  What many people do not know, however, is that it is actually ment to be more budhist than christian.  But, since the religions have similar storylines and the majority of people that this movie reaches are Christian, people tend to notic just the christian allegories.  I haven't even mentioned the philosophical end.  If  you are interested, try looking into Descartes and Kant.  If you are really interested, you can try some greek mythology, because that is deffinetly going to show up in the next parts of the trilogy.",The Matrix

2554,allah_is_mighty,I hate this film,2,5 September 2009,"With its trite Kafka-wannabe subtext and pretensions to profundity, this badly acted (Reeves is like a lump of wood, with a permanently perplexed look on his dumb face), poorly scripted, mess of a movie had me yawning and, at times, bristling with irritation. The stupid, faux philosophy about different realities was clearly ripped from a film called Dark City, which was far more chilling and unhinged, and managed to steer clear of the juvenile philosophical clap-trap that infected The Matrix (even the title is lame).Its only saving grace was some innovatory and influential action sequences and a good Don Davis score.But the action eventually seemed to contrive to divert the viewer from the paucity of original ideas exhibited, and culminated in a ridiculous, Dodge City-style shoot 'em up that had me laughing out loud. Then Neo turns into Superman: yep,s-o-o-o original. Then there's the bit where Neo is resurrected by the kiss by Trinity. It's ET and Snow White and every other now-predictable cliché in the cannon of story telling. To top that Fishburne's character whispers in hushed awe: ""He's The One"". I would have laughed if it wasn't so pathetic.In another comment someone described this and the sci-fi benchmark for all others to follow. Excuse me?! Show some me actual science in this muddled subterranean labyrinth, then I might reconsider. I won't even comment on the ensuing two movies,with the preposterous Christ fixation that dominated the third. Horrible, style-over-content rubbish.",The Matrix

This is the type of movie that i only intend to watch 10 minutes of and end up watching the entire movie and all special bonus features. At the end of the movie i actually gave it a standing ovation. the matrix is bye far the best Keanu Reeves movie bye far as his martial arts skills kept me at the edge of my seat throughout the whole movie. the directing is done in a very good way really putting good emphasis on some of its fight scenes e.g slow motion kicks and dodging bullets. like they say on the trailer the matrix cannot be explained you have to see it for yourself.,The Matrix

Reeves is really the one.....kudos NEO, so as agent smith and morpheus.

The Matrix chronicles the rise of Thomas Anderson, played with good skill by Keanu Reeves and his journey to becoming The One, sole saviour for the human Resistance in their fight against the machines. Hugo Weaving is magnificent as the villainous Agent Smith, with Carrie Ann Moss and Lawrence Fishburne providing charisma as the no-nonsense Trinty and the mysterious Morpheus.Why do I like this movie? Well the action scenes are well played out with some of the best choreographed fight sequences i've ever seen.

With no prior knowledge of the plot, I was a bit lost in the middle, and when I finally took the red pill about 15 minutes after Neo did, it was 'Whoa!' Great sci-fi concept, good casting, acting, effects, action, filming and use of music. Not a lot wrong with this film.The Matrix was the first DVD I bought, before I had a domestic DVD player.

The acting in this movie is great as it really suits the feel of the movie.Some may accuse Keanu Reeves of being a wooden actor, but they are wrong because the way he acted in this film made it even better, and he played the role as it should have been done.Laurence(SP)Fishbourne does well too, showing prowess as the leader and Neo's sort-of mentor.Carrie-Anne Moss is the best as Trinity.Finally a female heroine who's effective, cool, and deadly without coming over all Xena-ish or worse, Charlie's Angels like.Hugo-Weaving is just right for the bad guy, and he's so evil you start to like him.The Special effects are like millions  noticed in 1999-amazing.Today, they are still not outclassed simply because in the film it's not horribly overused-it's in a big mixture of all the successful ingredients.To sum it up, The Matrix is a one-of-a kind film which many have since tried to copy, but never get as good.

And the special effects are absolutely amazing (even if similar ones have been used in other movies as a result- and not explained as well).But the movie has plot as well. It has characters that I cared about. From Keanu Reeves' excellent portrayal of Neo, the man trying to come to grips with his own identity, to Lawrence Fishburne's mysterious Morpheus, and even the creepy Agents, everyone does a stellar job of making their characters more than just the usual action ""hero that kicks butt"" and ""cannon fodder"" roles. I cared about each and every one of the heroes, and hated the villains with a passion. It has a plot, and it has a meaning...and lo and behold, a plot does help the fight scenes! Just try it, if you haven't seen the movie before. Watch one of the fight scenes. Then watch the whole movie. There's a big difference in the feeling and excitement of the scenes- sure, they're great as standalones, but the whole thing put together is an experience unlike just about everything else that's come to the theaters. Think about it next time you're watching one of the more brainless action flicks...think how much better it COULD be.All I can say is WATCH THIS MOVIE.

2582,mnavarre,The Matrix and Plato,9,24 February 2015,"There are a lot of symbols throughout many different aspects of the film that embody and support similarities to Plato's Allegory of the Cave. Going back to the movie's scene of the red pill vs. the blue pill, Neo enters a room where he meets Morpheus for the first time; the symbols to be noted here are the rain and the thunderstorm happening just outside. Rain symbolizes Thomas Anderson's moment of rebirth, taking place upon his decision to leave the confines of the matrix; furthering this interpretation, Neo is Latin for ""new,"" and becomes his name once amongst the rebels in the real world. The chaos of the thunderstorm during Neo's first encounter with Morpheus is a symbol of Neo's mind disrupting or even starting to neglect the perfection and illusion that is the matrix. In both cases of these particular symbols, the rain and the storm, they are the only sounds in the scene, providing the background nuance to the dialogue exchanged between Morpheus and Neo. We know that Neo, all though hesitant for a brief instant, takes the red pill from Morpheus's outstretched hand. The red color of the pill that offered Neo the freedom from the mental prison of the matrix, can be seen to symbolize the brutality of how challenging the truth is going to be, but also how intriguing and alluring it is at the same time. Blue is a soothing color, symbolizing the comforting feelings and blissful ignorance of staying in the matrix. The simplicity of how the scene is physical organized, the visual presentation of the room's dilapidated condition, and especially the cinematography, help set the uninterrupted, to-the-point atmosphere the scene requires. There are two chairs, equally the same and facing each other at a reasonable, but intimate distance; besides the chairs and small end table, the room doesn't really have any other furniture, and rightfully so. In a modestly simple atmosphere created in his mind, Neo is presented with the biggest decision of his life. In addressing the cinematography used, there were many up close shots of Neo and Morpheus, which is an emphasis on the importance of Morpheus's proposition and ultimately, Neo's decision.A well thought-out storyline, executed impeccably through the series of three films, the creators of The Matrix trilogy successfully captivated the essence and ideas of great philosophical minds from ancient Greece, along with making it applicable to a realistic possibility of a future (or even a view of the present, if you dare to go that deep). Much like 1984 and Brave New World, the movie The Matrix presents the audience with a future interpretation of the world, which is comprised of an oppressed state of mankind dominated by and built upon various technological advancements and systems, leaving only a small minority of rebels. Although we are not paranoid big brother hears and sees everything we do, we are not soma medicated caste workers, and we are not living in some digital world only through our mind's projection of ourselves, how our culture immerses technology into everyday being and the degree to how infatuated we are with the media is a testament to the caves our culture is prisoner of. Expert media and societal analyzer, Neil Postman would possibly argue the current media as being our society's mental prison; ""we are amusing ourselves to death,"" a well-known quote from Postman, it is a reflection towards his strong view on the detrimental nature of the media to the American culture and society, both as a whole and on an individual level. As mankind continues on its race towards new developments and technological advancements, we must be cautious and aware of the answer to the question of what kind of society we want to live in. Caves are difficult to recognize, and often it takes an outsider's help to realize that you're even imprisoned, but when you do recognize a cave, then you can see a way out. It's never an easy exit into the light and open space of the outside world, however once acclimated to the changes, you can begin to achieve a state of higher knowledge. Because Neo took the red pill, he accepted the challenges to come facing the truth and as a result, he gained a greater satisfaction in knowing the real, and created a fate for himself in the real world as being ""the one,"" the rebels' savior. In more ways than one, this cinematic gem reflects and represents through countless symbols and world of the matrix itself, a strong relation to the great philosophical works of Plato, particularly his story The Allegory of the Cave.Check out My Blog: http://mknavarre.blogspot.com/",The Matrix
2583,saadsheikh,Simply marvelous and superb,10,18 December 2003,"One of the best movies EVER! Truly an ingenious idea! I have seen many movies, but to me this will always remain the best of 'em all. It is a pity not everyone is able to grasp the idea and message behind.",The Matrix
2584,CHall2K3,Everything rolled into one.,10,31 December 2003,"Once in a while, a film rolls into theatre with everything you (might) want. Style, Story, Special Effects, Sincerity, and moments you'll always remember. Obviously, The Matrix to most (including me), is one such film.Now let's forget about the flops that were Reloaded and Revolutions. It was about 5 years since the first release.To myself, The Matrix was a movie that added new things which I wanted to see in a movie. Quite impressive for two brothers who were virtually unknown at that time.Usually, any movie may contain one or two good things. The Matrix contained everything. Groundbreaking CGI and special effects basically brought its style into the new movie standards. The story and meanings have been parodied, read, and even used as course material.The Matrix is one movie in which people can watch again and again, and this is something I still watch today.Hopefully, 10 years down the road, someone will remake Reloaded and Revolutions to the standard that The Matrix set for its time. Until then, there is no Reloaded or Revolutions (in my mind).",The Matrix
2585,onurbug,Best movie ever,10,21 December 2003,"This is by far the best movie I have ever seen. Or should I say that I have seen 11 times (no kidding). It has everything: computers, hacking, amazing martial arts, superb visual effects. Above all there is philosophy, a new reality. The mixture is perfect. There is nothing left to say but ""follow the white rabbit"". Superb job Wachowski's",The Matrix
2586,audiophile,Pretentious and overblown,3,26 December 2003,"The Matrix is the first installment of a ""trilogy"" of sci-fi movies. In fact, it's not really a trilogy, in an organic sense, it's just a movie and its sequels.Anyway, ""The Matrix"" is a film with good premises, but bad developments. Although most of the ideas of the film were taken from sci-fi writers of the 60's and philosophers of the past (the idea that we exist as a thought, or a dream, goes back to Plato at least), the script did a good job in putting these ideas together in a modern plot (at least as for year 2000). The oniric influence of recent sci-fi comic books on the film is visible throughout and is what makes the visual appeal of the film.Unfortunately, what could have been a really good movie has been turned by the W. brothers into an average action flick targetted at 15 year-old boys, among which must belong the guys who wrote this flick is the ""best movie"" they've seen. There is almost no acting, and the heros wearing sunglasses all the time is a good way to avoid any sort of emotion to show on their faces. This total absence of emotion is one of the reasons why nobody gives a f..k whether or not everyone dies in the sequels.The W. brothers have a strong tendency to show off : heroes wearing sunglasses and Armani black leather coats designed for yuppies, trendy night-club population, ""bullet time"" special FX, (ugly) kung fu video game action, heavy metal and techno music during the whole film, etc. All this is supposed to make the film look ""kewwwwl"". In opposition to the heros, the agent Smith wears a dark working suit : he is not cool (although he also wears sunglasses, but that's because he is a spy agent).But what really turns me off is the pretense of the religioso-philosophico-technobabble which hardly hides the vacuity of the characters and the serious weaknesses of the script. There are so many other films which say much more with less, that this film looks highly overblown in comparison.I'm not even trying to elaborate on the sequels, which, instead of correcting these problems, show them in their full splendor.In a word, this flick is highly overrated. But hey, who cares ? The ""trilogy"" has ripped off enough spectators to make the Warner happy.",The Matrix
2587,jro0,mindless,1,6 March 2004,"The Matrix is a horribly formulaic stew of standard pulp items (conspiracy theories, bands of gallant rebels, babes in tight black leather) with a light dusting of philosophical/religious concepts to make it all seem like serious, meaningful stuff.  It is almost unnecessary to point out that none of the philosophical concepts plays any real role in the plot, which is basically just a sequence of action scenes enhanced by computer graphics. Its fans may talk about savior figures, but this is salvation lite, by means of gunfights and kung fu.  A better bet is Scary Movie: you'll see the same action and maybe even have a chuckle or two, which is more than can be said for The Matrix.",The Matrix

When The Matrix was released, it was such a landmark in the world of sci-fi, with it's imaginative, creative, original and clever storyline, everything about it is just unbelievably fantastic. The action scenes and special effects still hold up just beautifully and will blow you away. The Matrix is one of those films that had to be seen at the cinema. I would love to watch this again on the big screen. Once you watch The Matrix you will never ever forget it for a long time, as it just keeps playing on your mind. The storyline is amazing and will blow your mind. The entire film is oozing with style and atmosphere from start to finish and all the characters who will take you on that journey you just don't want to end. The film sends out a very good and philosophical message. Yes. This film has it all. The Matrix is a true genre classic by the Wachowski's.",The Matrix
2593,luvshak406,Kicks A$$,8,24 March 2004,I thought that this movie was one of the best. This movie had great effects even when it was made in 1999. I don't think that the computer effects were that good but I still think that it kicks ass. I really liked this movie and so did other people. I liked it better because there was more of Neo with the gunshots. The thing that they didn't show in this movie was Zin.  They talked alot about it but they never showed anything of the city. I think that the people who wrote The Matrix should make like a special edition of this movie. Maybe not about the city with the characters of the movie but Morfeus could tell Neo about the history of Zion and show that the city is being destroyed just like in the Matrix Revolutions. But that's just my idea.,The Matrix
2594,lori-kim,A true pioneer for the genre,10,4 April 2012,"Matrix is considered a sci-fi classic for good reason. The action scenes are simply outstanding. The last 20 minutes feature some of the most thrilling action sequences ever put on film.Also, the whole concept of the Matrix is fascinating. The trailer teases audiences with the question ""What is the matrix? There's no way to describe it. You have to see it for yourself."" Well, when you see the movie and find out what The Matrix really is, you're not disappointed.If there is a weak spot in the movie it's in the middle when they get caught up in the whole ""Chosen One"" storyline. This is too good a movie to rely on such a stupid plot device. The whole sequence of events surrounding this plot line reminded me of a really bad Japanese animated movie I once saw where one of the characters kept saying ""I don't understand! I thought I was the chosen one!"" (or something like that). Why can't they just say, ""he's got great potential"" and leave it at that.",The Matrix
2595,Donjon_the_2nd,"A movie made by nerds, made for nerds",7,25 April 2004,"If you are some small programmer working for some big company, doing all day the same stupid work you might fall for the idea that your life is not as boring and senseless as it seems (and maybe actually is), but that you are in fact the god and creator of this world. The normal reaction should be: Turn that computer off, take a vacation, maybe seek professional help. You can also make a movie...Matrix is not boring, it`s tense and it has stunning visuals. But like a good video clip does not make the music worth listening to, a whole bunch of special effects do not make a great movie.After watching the Matrix I recognized that:1. I don't get why super-robots, who overwhelmed the whole human kind, are not able to build some nuclear power plants, despite the fact that they really needn't care about radioactive pollution. Instead they get their energy from humans, and if you take a look at their body ""farms""  you must agree that it looks like they are putting a lot more energy into it than they get out of it... A good movie (even if it's science fiction) should provide some ground level logic in its story.2. I did not care about the characters. They die? Hmmm, okay. Trinity loves Neo? Uh, why is that? Did I miss something? A good movie makes me feel for the characters and understand their reactions. In this point Matrix is a total failure. Ever watched Brazil? You maybe should if you'd like to see a good ""big brother"" picture.3. This pseudo religious bla bla. Realize that there is no spoon? I realized that there is something else missing somewhere in the story writers head. Well, wouldn't be so bad, if there weren't point 1 and 2.4. This background theme of being something better than the others. Uh, am I really just some role playing games liking informatics student? Or am I the master of the universe? Look in the mirror, decide for yourself...does not look like Keanu Reeves? What a surprise.Watch this movie, it won't bore you. But if you think your going to see a REALLY good movie, or even a masterpiece, keep away from it. You will be quite disappointed afterwards.Ah, and if you like MTV...this is the best movie ever made. ;)

2596,deadpriest-1,Read It.,10,20 July 2004,"Called by many 'one of the greatest films ever made'. Do you want to hear why? The Matrix is a mix of many genres, (It will appeal to almost all audiences) including elements such as stylish Kung-fu fight sequences, wire effects, very good CG effects, etc. But, behind the slow-motion/camera techniques, suspense, and cool music, there is one of the most interesting tales ever told. The plot is thick, and very long after you watch the film, you are still thinking about the ingeniously made and well-told story. The Visuals of the movie, the camera angles, the color, all of it permanently effects your mind. believe me, once you see this movie, you'll want to watch again and again, I have never tired of watching this movie, and I doubt that anyone who sees this movie will ever forget it. And I end this with a great quote from the film, ""Unfortunately, no one can be told what The Matrix is, you have to see it for your self.""",The Matrix
2597,deadpriest-1,One of my favorites! (SPOILERS),10,6 August 2004,"'The Matrix' may have one of the most interesting plot ideas ever, the idea that the world might not be real. I watch this movie over and over again, and each time I see it I'm reminded that the movie contains no part that is not boring; what's even better is that the movie also has no scene, no sentence, not anything that isn't a necessary or important part of the story, there aren't even any fight scenes/action sequences that don't make sense. And the story, though improbable, makes sense; the writers actually found a sensible way for people to defy gravity, move extremely fast, learn martial arts in a matter of hours, and move in and out of two different worlds.

2599,pratiksharma996,Great at its style...,10,5 December 2016,An eye opener by all means. it guides all the conspiracy theories and spiritual knowledge in to a single film. every dialogue every scene has its own mythology. A film which will guide the pop culture for years. there are scene which have redefined the genre on its own. theories which can create genres on its own. Keanu Reeves as Neo is at his best and will be remembered for generation for portrayal of Neo. for Neo will be known for generations as the one of the greatest protagonist ever filmed. other characters played by Hugo Weaving as agent smith has nailed it and will be remembered as best antagonist for Neo. supporting characters like Morpheus played by Lauren Fishburn who has played a character similar to Yoda but with a different aim. As a whole this is best film sci-fi can give and will go down as one of greatest in genre. the director duo Andy and Lana Wachowski were at there best when this happened.,The Matrix
2600,tammyismuycool,Best Action Movie,10,6 July 2004,"This movie gets everything right. In short, it is an action movie with a brilliant story. There is a valid excuse for supernatural action sequences, which allows the viewer to immerse themselves in the incredible effects without a sense that the characters are doing the impossible.The acting was believable. Even Keanu turned in a great performance.The storyline is philosophically sophisticated. Scary how something so far-fetched is made eerily possible. The innovative effects make the movie move quickly, leaving you breathless. Little time is wasted in the storytelling. Everything is dense. I can think of no movie to compare it to--The Matrix outperforms any action movie I have seen.",The Matrix

Maybe it's not my kind of movie, but I still don't understand why it's rating is 8.7 . I liked the actors, they were fine, but I still don;t really like the plot. For a 16 year old it's really confusing and frustrating, maybe 5 years later I'll find it interesting, but for now, I really don't recommend it. I actually asked my friends, and they think the same. For a 1999 movie, the effects are pretty good and realistic, I was impressed. One thing I'd like to discover is the name, why ""Matrix"" and not something else, what does it mean. Probably that's the only thing that got me interested.",The Matrix
2602,vrcaudill2016,The Matrix,6,1 October 2012,"The Matrix is humans against the machines. The machines have almost ruined the entire human race, and a group of people must come together against all odds to battle the malicious machines to save what is left of the year 2199. This movie is not just packed with action, but allusions and symbolism as well. In the Matrix, there are various allusions to the classic story, Alice in Wonderland. In one pivotal scene, Neo is told to follow the ""white rabbit."" He has to make the choice to either follow a girl with a white rabbit tattoo and or to stay at home, just as Alice had to make the choice to follow the rabbit. The white rabbit symbolizes Neo's curiosity to learn more about what is the Matrix. Another allusion is when Neo is forced to make the decision to either go home, or take a red pill to ""find out just how deep the rabbit hole goes."" The red pill symbolizes the journey Neo will take to find out the truth about the Matrix, just as Alice had to make the decision to go on her journey. These references to Alice and Wonderland allow the audience to realize that Neo is embarking on a journey to a different ""world."" The writers and directors of the film, Larry and Andy Wachowski, create symbolism in the manner in which they name locations and characters in the film. In classic mythology, Morpheus is the god of dreams. He is named this because he is a leader of a ""sleepy"" society. In the year 2199 the only place human race still thrives is in the city of Zion. This city is never seen. But by not showing it, one could say that it represents Heaven. It is the only place where people can live safely. This city is called Zion because in the Old Testament, Zion is the heavenly city for people to live in safely. The religious themes continue throughout the film with the character Trinity. Trinity represents the number three, which relates to the ""father,"" ""son,"" and the ""holy spirit."" The Wachowski brothers are able to illustrate the differences between the virtual reality of 1999 and the present 2199 very well. When in 1999, the workers are portrayed as ""drones,"" or people who act like robots/machines. They are blissfully unaware that their version of reality is not real and their minds are being used to power machines. It is always sunny, which represents that the virtual reality of the Matrix is far better than the present. When Neo is shown what 2199 actually looks like, he is stunned. There is no sun, only darkness. Morpheus' group must live in the dark underground tunnels referred to as sewers, while Neo learns his true potential. The darkness represents that the future is bleak and that humans have the potential to ruin their own planet. The contrast between the two time periods represents the fight between good and evil. All action films are in constant motion. Because the Matrix is an action movie, this means it was in constant motion. The Matrix is definitely action-packed; too action- packed in my opinion, being filled with battle scenes that set up good versus evil. Because the battles take place in virtual computer software, everyone has higher capabilities for fighting, running, etc. The battles seem to be the same ones over and over again, until the very end of the movie. I began to form the attitude that this film lacks creativity when it comes to the fight scenes. The special effects are very advanced in this film for being released in the nineties. The characters have the ability to scale walls and do advanced karate and Kung-Fu. The ability to switch from 1999, to a computer program, to 2199 is very impressive. Having grown up in the technological age of our society, I have learned from personal experiences that technology rules our lives. From making tea on the stove in the morning, to checking email throughout the day on both phones and computers, to using a kindle to read in the evening, one is always using technology. In the film The Matrix, an underlying message can be taken to not rely on technology, because it can be the downfall of civilization. But has society reached a point in which life cannot be sustained without technology? Before watching this film, I had previous knowledge that one can be oppressed in society. Examples of this can be seen in dictatorships worldwide. However, this film has taught me that society controls the way one feels, dresses, works, etc. To be different is to be great. Being outspoken will change the world for the better. Neo learned to be different and overcame the challenges to defeat his enemies in the end.",The Matrix

It also leaves it open for Reloaded an Revolutions very well. It is also great because the only reason it is R rated is because of the action (guns, fighting). There's no drugs, sex, and not very many curse words, which means that if you don't mind shooting, it's a great movie for you. It is one of those movies that you just want to watch over and over again. I watched it twice in one night because it was so exciting. Over all I have seen it 4 times, and since I rarely ever do that to any movie, you know that it has to be a good one.

2606,elimoon_mike,Jaw-dropping and 100% Spectacular!,10,24 October 2004,"I love this film!i love the way that Andy and Larry put their visions into making this film, which to me is similar to an animé. The SFX was REVOLUTIONARY!! it used a technique called the ""BULLET-TIME"" which gives us a whole new way of looking at space and depth and time, this summed up the late 90's, the same way slow motion summed up the late 60's. Asides the visual effects, the soundtrack and sound effects was well done.Using music from popular heavy metal bands really is perfect for the genre of the film and the use of Juno Reactor's electronica and techno music gives a strong relation with the plot. Sound effects was done well as well. By just seeing the Nebuchadnezzar, we immediately know what sounds it makes- the electric like, rough pulses of sound s it makes. Over all, 10/10!!!",The Matrix
2607,rtfakadiga,Sight and Sound,9,1 April 2005,"The Matrix is a movie. It moves and it is moving. Indeed it is a movie of the highest order. The Matrix combines the elements of movie making in a way that is both thoughtful and thought provoking. The movie displays, on the part of its writers and director an acute understanding of story, background, lighting, and especially the role and impact of music in the film. The combination of action and music in this movie is so precise and complimentary at times it is exhilarating. The scene where Trinity meets Neo in the club is as close to a perfect marriage of sight and sound as I have ever experienced while conscious. ""Morpheus is fighting Neo"", the scene where Laurence Fishburne invites Neo to show what kung-fu he has learned is scored immaculately. And the ""lady in the red dress"" sequence is only beautiful in its execution of sound and action. On the whole, the movie is a wonder to behold. Special effects are just that, and once the separation of what is called reality and what exists as the matrix is established, the viewer is rewarded with passage from one to the other and perceptions of layers of each that reveal the brilliance of the film makers. This is not only a movie worth watching, it is one you can not afford to miss. Even if you missed it in theaters, I can heartily recommend it on VHS or DVD with one major condition; if you want to enjoy The Matrix, watch it in stereo or surround. Whatever you like about this film will only be improved by a quality reproduction of the audio content. The sequels, while being good movies themselves were not given the same attention and fail to keep the intensity of the first soundtrack, but Reloaded has twice as much attitude and visuals that defy comparison. This series will stand as some of the best film making of all time.",The Matrix

You pee in the matrix but where does that pee go in real life as they only connect the brain while they put you in the matrix. These put The Matrix as a 5/10 star review from me. Another thing I do not understand is how people don't get the movie! The movie is very very easy to understand.

2609,Scoopey,Sci-Fi cinematic history in the making.,9,18 February 2005,"If a movie's success was judged by the amount of times it is imitated then the Matrix must be one of the greatest modern cinematic pieces. Never has a film set new bench marks in this type of genre since Disney's Tron in the late 70's. However I do believe that this original masterpiece by the Wachowski brothers has created a two tier audience, those that love it and those that loathe it! I'm glad I'm part of the former group and have to say The Matrix is one my most heavily worn DVD's in my collection. The origirnality of the special effects really sell this film well, in fact the self same effects have been parodied a heck of a lot since from Shrek to Team America which further reinforces it's impact in cinematic history. The cast is a good choice even if many have little regard for Keanu Reeve's acting ability it works well here and I could not imagine anyone else better suited for the role of Morpheus than Lawrence Fishbourne. Equally interesting is the way Hugo Weaving plays the sinister Mr Smith. To look at the actual script you would not regard the part as malevolent but Mr Weaving turns it into the guy you really love to hate! This has similar shades to Ricardo Montalban's Khan in Star Trek 2 where some of the line looks mundane of even laughable but are made into something completely unexpected by the actor portraying the character. And finally The Matrix has one of the few scenes in a movie that I'd place in the top ten movie scenes of all time. This was when Neo recovers after being ""killed"" and realises he is 'the one'.Final word - If you never seen the film then at least go out and rent it to decide if you love or loathe it. If you find you like it you will probably be wondering why it has taken up until now to see it!",The Matrix
2610,ComeAsYouAre91,Why Hate It???,8,21 December 2004,"When The Matrix came out I was only twelve years old. Like many, I was utterly shocked by how well the Wachowski brothers had made the movie. From the editing to the music to the costumes this movie is just great the whole time. Sure, Neo doesn't have the world's best actor playing him but he still gets the point across. Also, I loved the philosophical view of the movie: ""The One"", ""Trinity"", and ""Zion"" make it easy to see the intended message. Again, like many I was disappointed slightly by the subsequent Matrix movies but that does not take away any of the power that The Matrix has to offer. I give it eight stars only because I will never give a ten (no movie is perfect, some people should learn this) and not a nine because some of the acting is, well, blah. I love all three Matrix movies, but there is no doubt that this one is the best.",The Matrix

There some very talented actors in this film and they all play their roles very well. Not all of it is complicated though, don't want to pull the film down because it is a very good film and the director has a brilliant mind. Think you have to be someone with a very intelligent brain to figure out which is the real world and which one isn't. Overall this is a very good film, I have only marked it down because I have never really understood the film.",The Matrix

The storyline seems to get in the way of the action at first, but if you take the time to watch this 3 or 4 times, the storyline ADDS a lot to the film and shows you that the awesome gun-flashing scenes had a reason to them.Agent Smith was cool, the kung-fu action scenes were cool, the guns were cool, and the special effects were great. I don't want to disappoint anybody by giving them high expectations before they saw the movie, but this is a great movie. How can you resist the idea of being able to download ANYTHING you want to learn in an instant? 10 years of kung-fu experience downloaded into your brain in 7 seconds!

2614,ratanr,Awesome,9,5 August 2014,"But what makes The Matrix several cuts above the rest of the films in its genre is that there are simply no loopholes. The script, written by the Wachowski brothers is intelligent but carefully not geeky. The kung-fu sequences were deftly shot -- something even Bruce Lee would've been proud of. The photography was breathtaking. (I bet if you had to cut every frame on the reel and had it developed and printed, every single frame would stand on its own.) And the acting? Maybe not the best Keanu Reeves but name me an actor who has box-office appeal but could portray the uneasy and vulnerable protagonist, Neo, to a T the way Reeves did. But, come to think of it, if you pit any actor beside Laurence Fishburne, you're bound to confuse that actor for bad acting. As Morpheus, Mr. Fishburne is simply wicked! Shades of his mentor-role in Higher Learning, nobody exudes that aura of quiet intensity than Mr. Fishburne. His character, battle-scarred but always composed Morpheus, is given an extra dose of mortality (He loves Neo to a fault.) only Mr. Fishburne can flesh out.",The Matrix

One has to get their mind ready to think in order to fully understand this film. The main actors were stellar and all other characters played their part quite well. The follow ups were both watered down version of this first masterpiece and The Matrix will certainly take viewers out of reality into the world of The Matrix. The use of CG in this movie masterpiece was nothing short of outstanding. This maybe why several movies have spawned from this great film.

2616,thedawg180,this film will amaze you!!,10,18 February 2005,"this is one of the best science fiction films I have seen by far and is just a classic in my own mind! the story is set in the way future and how civilization is overrunning by machines and that humanity are slaves to these artificial beings so only one man is destined to free humanity which is ""the one"" and thats how this man named Morpheus finds this computer hacker and free's him from slavery and trains him to unlock his abilities inside the matrix so he can take on the agent programs that threaten the system and humanity inside it.the film has spectacular visual effects which put other teams to shame at the time and still do to this day and what really gotten me is to how destructive the sets really were like in the last few scenes where neo and trinity walk inside the military complex and literally tear the place to shreds just blasting away but the scene that i find classic was when neo was in the helicopter and hovered right next to the room where Morpheus was held captive in and just unloaded everything the Gatling gun had at the agents inside it was just phenomenal to the greatness the film offered! the film was just incredible and is definitely recommended to anyone who loves sci fi and hasn's yet seen the film!",The Matrix
2617,sungoh78,Could it be...? Can it be...? So are we living in reality or what?,10,13 January 2014,"If you like action films, then this movie is a must-watch. It revolutionized arguably the entire sci-fi action-movie industry in the neo-20th century when it was first released (pun intended - of course). Anyhow, I did not come on here to just marvel at the screenplays of the movie. In fact, I came on here to marvel about the philosopher or the philosophy that the Wachowski brothers have studied, written, and directed. The idea of simulacrum as proposed by the post-modernist French philosopher Jean Baudrillard is that everything in this world has now lost originality because there have been too many replicas that have replaced the original that there now exists no original in any way or form. I mean how would any and all of us feel when we are faced with the lite-threatening questions of: who am I? What makes me who I am? Did I choose to become who I am or did I simply choose to mask myself with the personas that I have seen and studied on TVs, Movies, magazines, etc.? How do I then choose to become who I am? Can I truly call myself an original form or am I just a replica of other notable personas that I have chosen to adopt throughout my life time? (Does Neo choose to live in the blissful ignorance of illusion or the sometimes painful truth of reality)(noted by Wikipedia.com by searching ""Neo blue and red pill"")?Anyhow, mix that formula with the exponential growth of technology and machines, Wachowski directors have successfully drowned any and all existence of mankind in the form of machine-controlled (plugged-in) ""batteries"". Of course, this is where the existence of Zion, ship Nebuchadnezzar, Morpheus, and Neo kick in to free what is left of civilization from the machine's oppression... and ""Action!""Anyhow, what I've written is only a glimpse of what the directors have studied and tried to portray on the screens. Nevertheless, it is a masterpiece that has forever revolutionized the ways in which action movies are filmed now. Mad kudos to the brothers for such a fantastic film and thank you.",The Matrix
2618,mgardubas,Both sophisticated and entraining,9,20 January 2015,"What do i need to say about a classic such as the Matrix? It is not just another action flick to be forgotten as time passes. It's philosophical basis, the incredible plot and the bullet-time sequences can please any viewer. Keanu Reeves fits perfectly in the role of Neo while Carrie Ann-Moss, Robert Fishburne and forever evil Hugo Weaving do an excellent job too. The idea of the fake world is just ingenious and is well translated into the film by the green code effect.I should also recommend the awesome anime Ghost In The Shell,that greatly affected the tone of the Matrix .It's a great film, just watch it and you will understand how many cyberpunk and not only movies you may like were so greatly affected by it. a guaranteed masterpiece.",The Matrix

The camera angles really work for the action sequences and the choreographed fight scenes made me yearn for more. Say what you want about Keanu Reeves' acting. He may not deliver the best dialogue, but his look can carry a film. He was a great choice for the role of Neo. Carrie Anne Moss was great as was the underrated Laurence Fishburne.

Matrix will always be inside your mind..",10,24 April 2015,"This time I have to write something because I've watched this movie for 11th times and it never bored me. I wonder why is that? Because Neo was so cool or Wachowskis are so genius or.. maybe deepdown inside I'm so eager to take the red pill? Whatever my reason is, this is still (after 16 years) the best movie I've ever watch. The philosophy behind this movie is never gets old because in some points, it's like a religion, blind faith & spritually enlighting.. Kinda 21st century Moses story.. A bible that re-written in modern & sophisticated words.Keanu Reeves is absolutely best fit for Neo role, despite of he is not the first actor chosen to play Neo, Keanu is The One! Laurence Fishburne played very well as Morpheus, Neo's mentor. He look so tough & convincing and off course so freakin wise, almost as wise as the oracle. Carrie-Anne Moss match properly as Neo's girlfriend.. well.. I think more of partner though. She's not just a sexy girl decorating a hovercraft full of man, but as a crew, she is as tough as other. Hugo Weaving is a badass agent Smith that if he is a human, maybe he will become a saint.. LMAO!For the special effect, even though it's old enough (16 years old tech), still looks excellent. Similar to my favorite serial, Star Trek The Next Generation. Tech is old, but the storyline & idea behind that visual effect is more important & so sharp that cut through the eyes straight to the brain. Aweeesomeee!!!",The Matrix

I wish I was the matrix because it is really awesome and it would be so fun. I always wanted to be in the matrix movie because I love action movies and adventure movie especially when it comes up horror movie. The part of the movie that I like was when matrix was fighting clones and he was only one and the enemy were more and matrix got them all like that.

The acting is second and third rate. The plot is an annoyance usually ignored. The dialogue is cliché, weak, and for the most part, useless. However, the action replacing the plot is some of the best to hit the screen. The Matrix delivers visually impressive and intense action sequences. Costumes, bullets, and incredibly well choreographed fight scenes create some of the most memorable moments in cinema. Very entertaining, with little sophistication, The Matrix becomes pretentious at times. Despite all of The Matrix's flaws, I still say it is a must watch.

It is the story of an unlikely friendship that forms when an outcast alien meets a sassy little girl on a mission to find her mom. I think the story is well thought out and there are many hidden life ""gems"" noted within. The theme of judging others sticks out as well as themes of ""being yourself"" and learning from your mistakes. It is a little predictable but I think all adults feel that way about children's movies. The acting was good and surprisingly Rihanna did very good (I had my doubts about that). The kids loved it and laughed a lot. They also enjoyed the music a lot and that is really what it is all about. I would recommend it for families.",The Matrix

This universe explores a different reality and the Matrix. Many people find this film to be well shot,action packed,and very excellent. I found this to be all of those things. Most of the film sequences such as the sequence when Neo fought the Agent in the station,were well choreographed and looked beautiful. Definitely buy this on Blu-ray BTW! There were only a few mistakes and things that I didn't like in this film but that was it. The first mistake I saw was when Neo was shooting the turret on the helicopter and the bald dude(forgot what his name was) was held hostage by the agents and he just starts shooting at them chaotically and none of them hit the guy held hostage.The next problem was this:the action is at the beginning and the end,that's it.'This made the film a little on the dry side at times. Yes you have the scene when they are in the walls and the swat team starts firing at them but it wasn't like a real action packed fighting scene that really got my attention. That was the only bad part. But the action at the beginning and end of the movie was awesome.So in the end this is probably one of the greatest movies and action movies of all time. I really like this film. I would recommend this movie to people who are willing to watch a good action movie but without action left & right. Someone who can watch a movie without action being handed to them every five seconds can watch this because although there is a brief action sequence at the beginning,it gets really wild at the end so you have to sit a little tight before you see Neo kick some ass. If you can do that however go watch transformers 2 or a much better film than transformers, Kill Bill Volume 1. Yep I lowercase transformers on purpose cuz well,I hope you know why.",The Matrix

This film is heavy on special effects and brooding paranoia, light on plot, dialogue, character, and even coherence. THE MATRIX challenges what's real and what's part of an elaborate, fake cyber-reality, so it can be confusing for both the audience and the characters in the movie. But it's certainly an ideal pick for the kind of teen who wishes that video games could come to life. Though it's rated R for violence (some pretty gross, including an icky bug that enters the hero's body through his belly button) and language, most teens 14 and up who are begging to see it should be able to handle it without a problem.

So sad that the Wachowski brothers didn't even come up with the script. Sophia Stewart came up with this script and she is noted as being The Mother of The Matrix! Wachowskis used her work without her knowledge and for that we all suffered! They suck!I don't appreciate the fact that they stole such uncanny ideas and used them for their financial gain.The Wachowskis' were originally comic book writers searching for a story in which they could adapt into a comic. Sophia submitted to them her entire work (early 80s) not knowing that they would actually attempt to shop it and steal it for themselves. Sophia Stewart attended USC Film School and wrote the script itself back in the early 80s and copyrighted it in the latter part of 1984. Her epic work was called The Third Eye. After the FBIs study of her claims of copyright infringement and theft. They also found out that from her epic The Third Eye, also came the story of THE TERMINATOR!

I loved this movie for its amazing script, meaningful dialoges. Each sentence or scene has some meaning to it and its rare thing to happen in a movie. For example Neo visits Oracle for the first time, where he encounters a little boy staring at the spoon. The boy teaches Neo an ultimate lesson, there is no spoon. In another scene when Neo and Trinity breaks heavily armed building to rescue Morpheus. After shooting everyone down at lobby, they enter the lift, plant the explosive and drops lift down, there Neo says those words, there is no spoon. Just fantastic!!

2680,jiggys-49002,Reality is Not Real,10,3 January 2019,"This is a movie yes, but in reality it is a lesson from someone whom I've yet to determine, that reality is not real.
Lesson #1 After this movie magically appeared, everyone in the whole world now knows for sure that you cannot trust what you perceive as reality. Maybe there is really no such thing as the whole world either. Right?Lesson #2 We now understand that sentient beings of greater knowledge and power have created our intelligent consciousness and the external world observed by our senses. Otherwise we would not have thoughts of existence or any thoughts at all since we would not exist.
We now also understand that higher level sentient being are probably exploiting us in ways we do not understand, just as we exploit animals and plants which are at lower levels then ourselves.I suggest you get busy figuring it all out.
Clear your mind of preconceptions about the nature of truth and the nature of the universe and admit you do not know. Look for and pay attention to divine messages from sentient beings at higher levels of understanding. Observe and learn. Trust only truths you have discovered yourself. Ponder difficult questions. You will be rewarded. Good luck Dude.",The Matrix

When the matrix was released I would have gladly rated it a 9, when it was released it was way ahead of it's time with stunning cgi effects and sound effects, if I was rating this movie honestly I would say it deserves a 7.0 , it is still an entertaining film , I dont find myself looking away from the film too often to loose track of what's going on , I understand the story and I do like it unlike many of the other reviewers who rated it honestly a 1 star, I like many others simply believe this movie had it's time in the spotlight and deserves to have a special place in our hearts for nostalgia but I believe there are many other movies far better than this ranked lower than the matrix that are better in every way by a big margin. I dont believe it deserves a spot in the top 100 simply for how good it used to be.",The Matrix

But i will try.First time i watched Matrix its was in 2000, ( i was 12 years old) and took me for the inovative action, i loved it!. In 2003 a lit bit older i rewatched as a study in a philosophy class. And that i just remarckble. After that day it opened my mind to many aspects in films and moviemaking. First for the movies itself ( the oracle and its messages, the pils, the Matrix itself and its meaning). And of course, .this broadened my vision of film interpretation, not just in the Matrix itself, but ignited my perception as whole and after that i become a lover of the seventh art,
In short, I liked Matrix Iwhen I was 12 years old, and I loved it when I was older and could really understand it (or thought I did). The perfect mix of sci-fi, philosophy, action, a perfect mix of cult and mainstream movie, a real masterpiece.For all the meaning that this movie has in my life i would say that its ( of course in my opinion) the best movie the human kind did.",The Matrix
2684,1manbandmedia,An Original Story,9,7 June 2019,A mind bending sci-fi that inspired a generation to dwell further into what is or isn't real. Keanu Reeves gives a performance of a lifetime in his breakout role as Neo. Our hero is given a chance to know the truth or to remain ignorant to what is happening in the real world. This is a great message for anyone that feels like they don't know enough about the world and have a drive to want to understand more.,The Matrix

After repeated viewing (I'm heavily into eye candy) I have become more and more impressed with the acting (and voice) of Laurence Fishburn. There are several places that the combination of LF's voice, acting and the camera work just stop me cold.  Those are the parts I will remember long after I have moved on to the next/future favorite movie.I have a copy of the wide screen collectors version with shorts at the end explaining how some of the effects were achieved.

Who would have thought that a Keaun Reeves movie could be this good.  It just goes to show you that the script and the directing were right on the money.  I loved the kinetic feel of the action sequences and the story was a new fresh take on how we as a society are to blame for everything that happens in our lives.  We are responsible for our own lives.Run, run as fast as you can to this film.  You will not be let down.",The Matrix
2691,u32,A great Techno Movie,9,14 April 1999,"The first thing I want to say is : I think this movie shouldn't be even compared or quoted as ""good enough until Star Wars releases in May "" because it shouldn't. This movie is able to stand on its own as a ""techno science fiction "". Star Wars in general is a entity of its own and anything to be compared against it would be unfair.This movie has a great script , great characters , one of the best jaw dropping effects I have seen. Keanu Reeves played a much better role then in Johnny ""Moronic"" but then again the movie was bad in the first place. Laurence Fishburne had a outstanding role ,and he  shines in this movie (let alone his sunglasses). But my only problem is with Carrie-Anne Moss's role as Trinity. Her character was the best out of the group in the beginning of the film , but after she became Reeves side kick her role diminish over the course of the movie. This movie begs for a sequel and really it has to : because I want to know what ""Zion "" looks like.If you love this movie after one showing see it again, and I just hope it will look great on DVD.",The Matrix
2692,Rand-7,"""Whoa..""",10,3 April 1999,"To quote Keanu Reeves would be an understatement when talking about this film. Even if the acting and storyline suffered severe ""Holywood-ness"" (which they didn't--well maybe a little) the special fx alone is worth seeing. A lot of work has been put into this film to make it one of the best, most inspiring sci-fi films of this decade. The actors had to go through 4-6 months of martial arts training to do these scenes WITHOUT stuntmen, which makes it so much more real and heart pounding (like Jackie Chan action films). There are fx in Matrix that have never been done before, or at least extensively used throughout the film. Such as, what the Wachowski brothers call ""bullet-time photography"", which provides dynamic camera movement around slow-motion events that approaches 12,000 frames per second, thus the super smooth slow-motion scenes seen occasionally in the film. This is also one of the first films I've seen that effectively recreates the ""Anime"" action feel. This is how John Gaeta, of Manex, describes it: ""The Wachowskis are from the comic-book culture, and are therefore familiar with the Japanese animation style called anime, which we re-created with live actors for this movie. Anime takes advantage of 'the physics of decimation'  it breaks down action into its components and allows those elements to be meticulously controlled to build the most dramatic effect from dynamic movement."" But if you're not a fanatic of incredible sfx and action sequences, you'll still be pulled into the plot like the Matrix pulls in its visitors. Don't cheat yourself from the most incredible cinematic experience of your life. Go see this film!",The Matrix

It had a solid story, which is rare in most contemporary Sci-Fi, tons of eye-candy, and exhilarating action sequences. There are holes in the story, and I think the directors could have stretched our imagination a little further. But any holes that you can find in the plot are easily made up for by the films style and and over-all feel.",The Matrix

This also contains one of the best gunfight sequences I've seen not to mention skillful use of slow motion and lighting.  The plot is well thought out and the acting is satisfactory.  Keanu Reeves plays his role well and is well supported by Laurence Fishburne.  If you ever wondered about why the world is the way it is, this will blow you away!",The Matrix
2695,missborg,Excellent scifi/cyberpunk genre film.,10,5 April 1999,This was the most satisfying action/scifi movie I have seen in quite some time.

I have been waiting so long for their next movie ""The Matrix""  and boy did it deliver...I knew if I only seen one movie this year it had to be ""The Matrix""  I'm a fan of Star Wars and everything, but man the Matrix is just so awesome!I've seen it three times now, It has such a great story line, that even if this movie wasn't jam packed with amazing action scenes (which it is) :) , the story itself is enough to support the movie..All the characters played their roles great, I know alot of people don't like Keanu's acting but he did a great job in this movie, as well as Fishburne, Joe Pantoliano, Carrie Anne Moss was great as well, very tough. Hugo Weaving was also great as Agent Smith....I'm not a huge Sci Fi fan, but this is probably one of the best movies I've seen in a long long time..Do yourself a favor and see this bad boy on the big screen, you'll be sorry if you miss this one.",The Matrix
2697,Mahoot,Avoid at all cost.,1,28 May 1999,"This movie is the biggest piece of crap I've seen in years.  It is horrible on all levels; plot and dialog mainly.

2701,Eric-25,"A perfect action movie, with philosophical implication and great special effects.",10,6 April 1999,"The Matrix is not only the best action movie I've ever seen, it has substantial philosophical implications that will keep you thinking after you leave the movie.  It has amazing special effects, some humorous lines and moments, great fight scenes and a great sci-fi story.I admit, I saw this movie the Thursday it came out because I'd heard about and seen some of the amazing special effects.  I'd told my girlfriend about it and she came with me.  As much as I expect it to be the quintessential guy movie, she enjoyed the movie tremendously and the plot and acting turned out to be a lot better than what I'd expected.The movie made me think so much, I went home and opened my Philosophy textbook 'Reason and Responsibility' and willingly read about human knowledge, it's grounds and limits, the mind-body problems, the implications of AI and it's effects on our life.I liked the movie so much, that my cousin and I saw it the very next day. My cousin liked it so much that he also returned to see it two days in a row.  The movie is a lot different the second time around and I found it even more enjoyable than the first time.  Everything the oracle says makes a lot more sense, you can appreciate the special effects without being too involved with what is coming up.  The beginning makes a lot more sense and you notice new things, such as Neo's book, containing a chapter titled ""On Nihilism"".  While I saw a review for the movie that called it overly philosophical, I would call it a thinking man's action movie.I recommend this movie be seen by anyone who even remotely likes sci-fi or action and/or great special effects, and that if you liked it the first time, see it again in a movie theater.  It's worth it for the special effects and the different perspective on the story.",The Matrix
2702,Roger-19,Great effects + no story = Boring!,1,18 April 1999,"This movie had great effects and camera angles.  Definitely not a movie for anyone who suffers from nightmares!Extremely thin and disjointed plot for a sci-fi flick.  It reminded me of late '60s and early '70s ""stream of consciousness"" movies.  It probably would help to be stoned on something before entering the theater.All this combined made for a way too long and way too boring evening out. But it will do fine for the ""what you see is what you get"" crowd.  Leave your I.Q. at home.",The Matrix
2703,Whizcomp,Stunning...Visually and Mentally,10,1 April 1999,"This movie is simply stunning.  The visual effects are some of the best I've ever seen, if not THE Best.  The movie is gripping.  The action never lets up.  You are pulled in from the very beginning and are left begging for more at the end.  The story itself and the questions it raises are incredible. They remind me a lot of a book called ""The Mind's I"" by Douglass Hofstadter and Daniel Dennett.  The main question is could this really be happening? How can you even pretend to know what someone else experiences if you are not really them?  If you are interested by the questions of AI, separating mind and body, reality, and being other objects, I would seriously suggest you read ""The Mind's I.""  Most of it is very interesting and raises questions about the reality of the world we live in.",The Matrix
2704,Barron-2,An exciting sign of what young filmmakers will be able to achieve with CGI special effects.,10,1 April 1999,"I enjoyed ""The Matrix"" because the tremendous special effects fit into the story well and served to enhance the film, not define it.  Too often I find CGI distracting, but in a movie that writhes with as much as intensity as this one- it simply brought me to edge of my seat. I give total credit to the young brothers that created this film for imagining the story, and having the wisdom to know that story is, and always should be the most important thing. Towards the end of the film, I wasn't waiting to see bigger guns or cooler kicks, I wanted to know how the story was going to turn out.",The Matrix
2705,Martz,The most stylish movie ever made,9,21 May 1999,"I was about 12 the last time I left a theatre and wanted to go back in and watch the same movie again, right then and there...until The Matrix. Non-stop plot progression (character introductions last about 5 seconds) coupled with some of the best fight sequences I've come across and almost seamless special effects combine to make this an intense, thought-provoking movie. Morpheus' ""born into bondage"" monologue strikes disturbing bells even without the matrix. Creditable performances from all the main characters, an internally consistent plot and, unusually, science that didn't make me want to throw up in disgust made my suspension of disbelief not just willing but unnoticeable. Sets, costumes, lighting, cinematography (I loved the ""freeze the frame yet rotate the camera around the main subject"" technique and thought it could have been used once or twice more); everything hangs together beautifully to create an often dark and oppressive atmosphere which perfectly complements the story.",The Matrix
2706,xcarrier,Special effects are the only reason to see this film,5,16 April 1999,Dark City and The Truman Show were films that caused me to rethink my view of the world.  The Matrix attempted to copy the themes expressed in these films with little success.  It relied on energy and special effects to deliver its message.

2708,eddie-140,Boring......,4,26 June 1999,"OK, I'm probably one of the very few people that found this film incredibly boring, tedious and predictable.It felt like I was watching Men In Black V. Terminator 2.  I kept expecting Tommy Lee Jones or Will Smith to turn up any minute.  The concept of bad(?) guys wearing dark suits and sunglasses and trying to hide the truth from us mortals has been done before in MIB.  The concept of computers taking over the world in the future and one person being the saviour was done before in Terminator 2.It was predictable that Mr Keanu Reeves was the chosen one, yet he would not realise this fate until there had to be a near death scene where the audience were all to believe he was dead, until he realised he was him - the chosen one.  There was lots of mush in there about if you know then it will happen, oh please fetch me the sick bucket.The special effects are OK, not much to shout home about, and definitely did not add anything to the film.",The Matrix

This movie isn't just another 'what-is-the-earth-like-100-years-from-no'-type of film.

This film has in something for fan of either genre.The overall movie was great in my opinion, only problem I had with the plot was Neo (Reeves) having to get a kiss from Trinity (Moss) to revive him after he is shot to death by Agent Jones (Taylor).(Don't take my word for it.... go and see it for yourself once or twice)",The Matrix
2712,Aeried,Great effects vs. great plot holes,7,5 April 1999,"Don't get me wrong. This is a great guy flick and I like guy films as much as the next guy. The Wachowski Brothers do a remarkable job combining sfx with kung-fu and 8mms. The premise even creeped me out (and that's good!). My main problem was these glaring plot holes. In order to turn this film into a Blade Runner type classic sci-fi film, the filmmakers would have had to not give in to the Hollywood mentality that movies must end on a hopeful note, heroes must win, etc.The movie's ending left a very bad taste in my mouth (kind of like battery acid). Too bad because I liked all the sfx and fights. Cool stuff. My ending is not the kind of ending to pull in audiences, but it certainly would have been more honest. If the producers had been honest with us and themselves, I would probably given the film another point or two.",The Matrix
2713,Mike D.,"good, better, best",10,6 April 1999,That's the way this movie went.  It started off slowly and confusing. But the pace was gradually picked up and the last hour was total action and explosions.  I went to this movie for the fight scenes and actually came away seeing a movie with a great sci-fi plot and some of the best action sequences ever.  9.5 out of 10!,The Matrix
2714,Kamikazi,"""Mind-Blowing""",9,1 April 1999,"After Keanu's last romp as a Cyberpunk in Johnny What's-His-Name who would have thought he'd ever be able to redeem himself in that type of role again? Well, the Wachowski brothers obviously did. Granted, the term ""Cyberpunk"" has a tendency to turn people off since it's been dragged through the mud thanks to the internet but what the Wachowski brothers have done is put a slightly different spin on the genre.  Though many of the plot devices used in The Matrix are easily referenced from other movies, they are presented in a slightly different fashion that breathes new life into them.The special effects are used effectively and don't overpower the viewer. The sound effects, on the other hand, are loud - almost too loud.  The sound effects were a bit overdone in my opinion.  Sound should be used to accentuate the visuals, not drown it out.  In several instances the sound got a bit too chaotic and made it hard to concentrate on the film.The action scenes are some of the most inspired martial arts this side of Hong Kong cinema.  The use of wires and a majority of the slow-motion shots were done exceptionally well.  Because the Wachowski brothers are notorious for extreme closeups, some of the action scenes aren't always framed properly and the amazing choreography doesn't give the audience the full impact (sorry for the pun).  The director of photography, for some odd reason, had scenes with people dressed in black fighting in extremely dark interior spaces which, oddly enough, makes it difficult to see what was going on.But these are only minor gripes for a movie that stands as 1999's first Sci-Fi/Action hit for the year.**** out of *****",The Matrix
2715,Blorp,3 things that lacked,10,28 June 1999,"First of all, i want to say that this movie is one of the best movie's ever made in almost every aspect. but instead of describing how great it is. i want to point 3 thing that lacked in this movie. 1. the audience was never told why neo started wondering about the matrix and why did he want to find the answer to the question: what is the matrix? what made him find out about the existence of the matrix? 2. i wish that the character of trinity had more aspects then just the romantical aspect in this movie. i wish that her character was more developed. 3. i wish that the audience would know more about the oracle character. again, i wish that this character was more developed.other than those 3, i think this movie is (almost) perfect.",The Matrix
2716,Kelly-20,DON'T READ ANY SPOILERS!,10,5 April 1999,"This movie just rocks! It just passed The Fifth Element as my favorite sci-fi flick of all time. If you haven't read anything about the plot, please don't! It was so cool to figure out the plot with the protagonist, Neo. I was truly awestruck. This movie has martial arts, gunfights, philosophy, humor, a little bit of romance, a whole lot of heroism, and an enemy that everyone living on this planet can justifiably hate without remorse. If you don't like ickiness, the worst part (I think) is right after Neo demands a phone call while being interrogated; so close your eyes for a few minutes. Blech. Anyway, do go and see this movie, but remember, it's just a movie. Movie producers are not the philosopher-kings of this world. You may be highly disturbed if you don't remember this after watching.",The Matrix

Not totally realistic, but close enough to be lots of fun to think about and make it a great story.  Incredible action sequences.  I'd say it's pretty much the best movie ever, especially if you like Sci-Fi and Action.",The Matrix
2718,Odin-2,See it Now!,9,24 March 1999,"This movie had everything.  Great special effects, a strong story, and even Keanu Reeves put in a good performance.

Its one of those movies where the heroes are Gods, but in this one there's actually a reason why.The storyline I won't tell you.  All I'll say is that if it's based on a book, I'm going to go read it.  What a plot!",The Matrix

Absent - acting, plot,script.",5,13 June 1999,"In a parallel universe William Gibson knocked this story out in a morning, read it back and consigned it to oblivion. In the alternate reality that is late nineties cinema the story has resurfaced and stretched to over two hours.

This movie is like anime come to life.Yes, the Wachowski bros. toss in bits of every myth and fantasy they could find, yes, they lift bits from dozens of other movies -- from Alien to Star Wars to Face/Off -- but they make it all work. Even better, they draw the best performance from Keanu Reeves since Speed.As sheer movie spectacle goes, it's brilliant.",The Matrix

2724,hyper-bu,It's like watching a Hong Kong action film that has only Hollywood actors.,5,2 April 1999,"If it wasn't for the special effects, I would have left the theater in the middle of the film. I mean, this is one of those films whose dialogue is so lame, you just want to tell the actors to stop talking and start fighting. I thought Hugo Weaving was going to be good, until I got sick of the way he was talking. The Wachowski brothers should have made him into a silent character, one who does everything but talk. The special effects were spectacular, but I have to say the action scenes, especially when the actors were shooting at each other, were really unnecessary. When Keanu Reeves was firing his weapons, he was always in slow-motion. It's like watching a Hong Kong action film that has only Hollywood actors. This film should only be watched by people who are EXTREMELY fond of special effects.",The Matrix

You really need to follow the film closely..Don't get up out of your sit for popcorn..You just might miss some of these Special Effects that are incredibly believable. A well thought out film both special effects and dialogue. Keanu Reeves and Laurence Fishburne both deliver great performances along with Carrie-Anne. Be careful, it could get you thinking about were and what we live in know.. Is it Real or Is it False..Our surroundings.. Find out what the word ""Matrix"" means to their world.

Is this world just a false reality?? Or are we just mindless drones looking for a way out that does not exsist. This movie starts out with a mind blowing scene with Trinity, who then goes on to demonstrate her ability to jump higher, run faster and escape from anything out there. If I go on then there will be no purpose for you to see the movie. Once again this movie was the best I've seen this year, the f/x only made the plot more belivable.",The Matrix

Dark City, Blade Runner and any John Woo film in one!",9,1 April 1999,"I saw the trailer for this film on my computer about a month ago and was waiting with baited breath to see it! Well I was not disappointed. It was excellent. Really good special effects, gun fights, bleak-futuristic cyber-punk film-noir stylee. YES! The Kung-fu scenes were very well choreographed, and the actors themselves performed the fighting, very fast, very exiting. Even Keanu Reeves managed to do well in his role as ""Neo"" the Hacker, turned Leather-clad, sub-machine gun wielding fighting machine. The coolest film I've seen since 12 Monkeys SEE IT NOW, Miss it at your peril!",The Matrix

It has the music (LOUD!), it has the actors (COOL!), it has the effects (UNBELIEVABLE!) but most of all it has that wonderful ""None Of This Is True"" angle.If you've ever found yourself at the end of a good party talking to someone and discussing the possibility that the world is designed just to fool you and none if this is really happening, you will know what I mean. It usually leads to the question: ""If the world is created specially for ME, will YOU disappear once you walk out of site?""A friend and I where already p****d that they stole ""our"" idea to make ""The Truman Show"" but now The Wachowski Brothers gave us the change to watch our paranoia in a +2 hour during rollercoaster ride and I was blown away!

Also has the eerieness of Se7en and Dark City.Even with Keanu's background of poor acting in poor scripts, he makes a nice comeback with this movie.  Laurence Fishburne (aka Cowboy Curtis) is also great.  Plus, lets not forget that Trinity (Carrie-anne Moss)!Any one that doesn't think this movie is great, tell me what is?  It has action (setting a new standard in visual effects), a great story (any comic book fan will love), a sappy love angle (probably the only poor part of the movie) and great suspense.The only ones I can see not liking this film are people that don't have the intelligence to follow the story.  Some women that are Action film haters may not like it either, although when I saw it on opening night, 75% of the audience were women, and they all loved it.",The Matrix
2731,Hag,Give this movie a try.,8,1 April 1999,"I saw 'The Matrix' and have to admit. I Loved It. The first few minutes will blow you away. The stop animation fights got you tense and then kicked some. But unfortunately, after the first few minutes, it gets dry for awhile. There are exciting bits here and there during that dry time, but really it's a first five minute/last 30 minute movie. Everything in the middle was just to get you to the last scene(s). But those last scenes didn't disappoint me at all.I really think this is a movie I'm going to go back and see in a week or so, to get it burned into my head a little better. One of the good things about this movie is, it can make fun of itself. Through the whole thing, It would take itself seriously, then suddenly, something was ridiculous, and that really broke the tension. The audience laughed during the funny scenes, and actually clapped after some of the fight scenes and moves that the actors did.The fight sequences were so creative, and original. The special effects were amazing. Just so fun to watch. So surreal. Almost convincing, but that's not really necessary for this kind of movie, because the special effects are there to make things surreal. One thing can be said though, the ending is predictable.  Through the whole movie, you are trying to figure it out.  They tell you about it, but never tell you everything. That makes it really interesting.  All in all, if you are a Steven Seagal fan, see it. If you are a sci fi fan, see it. If you are a Keanu Reeves fan, see it. And if you like girls(and guys) in black leather, see it. So go out and pay a couple of bucks for The Matrix, if nothing else, you can make fun of it afterwards by saying ""what is the matrix?"" and doing some stop animation/slow motion fighting with your friend, as my friends did.  But I definitely recommend this movie.",The Matrix

Both movies frame the 1990's perfectly and both deal with a possible future for man if he doesn't, in a sense, wake up from the machine oriented reality he has fashioned for himself. Do you see how wild The Matrix is? It has got me babbling on about reality and machines!! Cool, man!!",The Matrix

If you haven't already seen this film then you don't know what you're missing. A film which sets new standards in the action genre which many films will have to comply with (which can only be a good thing). This film has everything and is for everyone.  I have seen this twice, and it's just as good the second time. I bet George never saw this phantom menace coming!",The Matrix
2734,tyler-20,The special effects don't carry this DOG...,1,2 May 1999,"This was one of the worst movies I've ever seen. > Overall, the movie is a grotesque union of bad science fiction and bad philosophy.  The writers decided to trot out that old ""what if a mad scientist had your brain in a jar..."" nonsense except this time it's a mad computer program and it's your whole body instead of just your brain.  The director's view of Man's nature is one of a cross between a virus infecting the face of the Earth and a battery.The special effects are well done, but aren't good enough to carry the rest of the film.My recommendation is ""Don't waste your money"", I'm sure sorry I wasted mine.",The Matrix
2735,Nati_A,"When so many films that try to capitalize on the virtual world fall flat, the Matrix exceeds expectations! The Matrix was a refreshingly good sci-fi film with excellent visual effects and great casting.",10,10 May 1999,"I'll admit... I'm not a big Keanu Reeves fan, so I kept my expectations a bit lower than usual when I went to see this movie. I was definitely surprised! I think this was his best performance ever. Neo is a likable character thrust into a world that he was neither aware of nor oriented to, and then expected to save. There is an innocence about the character that is touching when he discovers the Matrix and learns how to interact within it. As the movie progresses, you really hope that he is the One.The rest of the cast was wonderful as well. I'm usually critical of the strong female image many movies try to project. But this movie surprised me there as well. Trinity, played by Carrie-Anne Moss, is also an interesting and compelling character. She initially appears to be Neo's watcher/bodyguard, but somewhere the relationship becomes more personal... and even more interesting.The visual effects were the best part of the film. That's mostly because I can often clearly see the computer enhancements and can point them out. These visual effects flowed smoothly and were not obvious. It really was fantastic.Lastly, I've got to say I loved the Oracle. She was great.",The Matrix
2736,OOO7,Extremely satisfying viewing experience.,9,31 March 1999,"This film fairly exceeded my expectations.  Right off the top of my head I cannot think of a single thing that I disliked about it (as I sit here listening to the soundtrack).  I can't claim that this is a ""good"" or ""great"" movie, or give it a fair, unbiased rating.  What I do say is that I'm extremely glad that I spent the 120 plus minutes sitting in the dark, and becoming totally absorbed into another reality.  Movies to me are a total form of escapism, a glimps into impossible dreams, and in that aspect ""The Matrix"" more than accomplished its purpose.",The Matrix

In fact, I am planning on seeing it again.  Excellent cast.  All I can say is, it really makes you think.

It's been what seems like forever since a mainstream production has been so artistic and yet so able to capture everything that makes a good movie interesting. All the action, drama, and especially the visual effects are astounding. The only drawback is the fact that Keanu Reeves plays the character of Neo which is the film's focus.  If Keanu knew how to act instead of just playing himself as every role he's ever done then this film would be ever better, which is hard to imagine.  Another wonderful feature of this movie is that it has a full and interesting plot.  Unlike most films of the recent past, the storyline not only builds through out the movie but it also comes to a very well done conclusion.  The Matrix is definitely an instant classic in the sci-fi genre.  See this film...then see it again...and again...and again...",The Matrix

It was a fun flick with impressive special effects that didn't seem entirely tacked on.But the more I thought about it, the more I felt cheated and manipulated. The plot was fairly decent... for the first half of the film.  Then it pulls out and lets the special effects take over.  I know the purpose of film is to manipulate emotions, but being stroked into thinking a movie is great because it looked pretty is just insulting.I recommend seeing it at least once, especially on a big screen, but not because it's the great sci-fi film everyone's touting it to be--because it's a good two hours of mindless entertainment with some decent loud music and entrancing special effects.",The Matrix

It's about technology and where technology could take us, about the progress with the virtual reality. And that's why this movie is so good, for the plot itself and the visual effects.

If you liked all or any of these movies I highly recommend The Matrix.Keanu Reeves gives one of his best performances along with a great cast. This was not a ""Supporting"" cast in my opinion as they each brought something of their own into the vision of this movie.Among them, Belinda Mcclory whom I believe was a wonderful addition to the cast.  She brought a bit of attitude and beauty to the screen.  Plus, she made herself stand-out in one seen while everyone was wearing black, she wore white.

The trailers do it little justice.  The action sequences: hand to hand, gun fights, and others are amazing.  The plot makes an X-File conspiracy look tame.  This movie took me to the edge of special effects and action without sacrificing a great science fiction story line.  Anyone with the capacity for understanding its plot would enjoy this movie.  Aside some action scenes that may be scary and harsh, (no nudity, little profanity [gave a finger],deaths) I would recommend this movie to any age group with ANY kind of taste.  This movie rocks!The best way I can describe this movie is a better written, if possible, Dark City with an even more mind boggling plot and better special effects along with the added bonus of great action sequences.  Whooh, say that three times fast.  Back to my original comment, MATRIX is a great movie I would see more than once and can't wait to purchase.",The Matrix

They want you to walk out of the theater with the Oliver Stone type feeling of ""It's a conspiracy, man!"" but it doesn't exactly work. The makers of the movie could have taken an example from Men in Black, in which the concept of the movie explained some weird stuff that is in our world so that it would make sense, but The Matrix just introduces even weirder new stuff.",The Matrix

That and Keanu Reeves seriously needs to spend more time with his band. Don't get me wrong, the kung fu sequences were spectacular, and the special effects were, to this day, untouched.

I was amazed that the plot was of the same quality. What amazed me even more was that Keanu Reeves did not stink! Granted, he played a part that called for the dopey look at times, so he wasn't completely out of his element. Still, he pulled everything off well.I know Star Wars is going to be the sci-fi movie of the year, and will probably trounce this movie in almost every measurable category, but even so, the bar has been raised for the action/sci-fi genre.",The Matrix

The Matrix is a high tech, gritty sci-fi thrill-ride of what could be reality. Great fight scenes, incredible special FX (look for the awesome ""bullet dodging scene""), great performances from Reeves, Fishburne and Moss and what has to be the greatest Hong Kong cinema-inspired shootout EVER make The Matrix one of my all-time favorite films. However, there are some faults, such as the flimsy plot (the background story is excellent, and the following CGI vision, is well, scary, however), just average script, ""tacked on"" romance, Weaving's ""not too bad""-bad guy, and the tackiness of Sydney's skyline (a city with more skyscrapers would've been awesome, but too dangerous for the shot). But these faults are minor, and don't detract too much from the film that is THE MATRIX. Watch it. NOW.",The Matrix

Irregardless of the fact that it draws many elements from other stories of the genre, this movie kicks a$$. No matter what, see this movie at least once. Depending on your point of view, the only problem is with the ending - there was no real resolution of the main plotline. This is bad if this is a single movie, but if there's one thing about the genre, it's sequels. This open ending allows for another movie - which would definitely be a good thing.",The Matrix

I had some doubt about this movie and was originally expecting this flick to have glorified special effects and absolutely no story whatsoever.  However, I was totally wrong.  The story was beautiful and well-made!  The effects were not over-played, and were added to only accentuate the mind-blowing narrative.  The action was stupendous with its attempt at making realistic anime-style fighting sequences.  The characters were also memorable and fun.

2761,l0cutus,Matrix is the best Sci-Fi movie to date.,10,2 April 1999,"Here are a few thoughts on why this movie is so great:The kung-fu is spectacular for a movie not out of Hong Kong.   They even did the nice touch of having Keanu learn some of Bruce Lee's little moves from movies like ""Enter the Dragon"".  But the camera tricks, slow-motion, and actors did a wonderful job!  Wow...  It isn't better than the final fight in Jackie Chan's ""Drunken Master II"" -- the best fight in all of Martial Arts movie history -- but it is great!The special effects are spectacular.  The first fight scene between Trinity and the police...its energy and speed set the tone of the movie...awesome!This movie is pure anime.  When you watch some scenes they are manga...there are close ups with just enough room for a thought bubble.  The stop-motion pans set a style of viewing that allows one to see a kick or a punch as a process of many distinct moves.  The bounding, fighting, gunslinging... all very very nice and all very live-action anime stuff (flipping and shooting and fighting, oh my!).Finally, and most important, a sign of a great movie must leave you wanting more.  What decision will they make?   Go see it.",The Matrix

2764,DemetriD,"Maybe, Maybe Not! When's the sequel?",8,16 June 1999,"Great depth in characters, EXCEPT for Neo who is most un-inspiring...the character doesn't inspire sympathy, understanding, excitement or anything (positive or negative) he's just there. He is the weakest part of the film uplifted to the rank of 'Chosen One' - the only reason he was 'chosen' was because it would increase box office takings by having the dead pan Keanu Reeves playing it. But, and it is a BIG BUT, all the other characters are brilliant. MORPHEUS is a superb caricature (I could follow that guy), TRILOGY full of everything human and superhuman (I could fall in love with this one), AGENT SMITH is spine shuddering (I'd run away). All brilliantly acted great dialogue and expertly delivered, I would certainly go out of my way to see any of them again - unlike Reeves...snoringly, boringly banal - they were all totally believable in an unbelievable film. I'd have given it 10 if it wasn't for Neo, I wish he'd have taken the blue pill!The story is fine borrowing loads of references from 'Alice in Wonderland', Japanese animation, pseudo religious themes and even Batman. The basic theme makes the imagination kick in to overdrive for long after the film making it great value for money as a simple flick. The story is full of gaps and missing questions and answers, for instance what IS going on at Zion, what's it about, who's in charge and when is the sequel???SFX - uncompromising in their brilliance - great combination with the Kung Fu - more like poetry than flashy nonsense.Worth seeing, but I reckon the spin offs are more interesting see the web site though it's very contrived.There are no laughs, it's never that shocking and I didn't come out feeling better or worse - I wouldn't miss it if it wasn't there.",The Matrix
2765,lowereastsmile,"Mind-blowing & intelligent, The Matrix is worth the trip.",9,29 March 1999,"What is The Matrix? It would be unfair for me to tell you here, but take the time and see for yourself. The Wachowski Brothers have combined slick, state of the art visuals with a thought provoking screenplay and created one of the most ambitious films I've seen in a long time, and I've seen a lot of movies. The Wachowski Brothers manage to seamlessly integrate story influences ranging from Alice in Wonderland to Terminator 2: Judgment Day, and stylistic influences covering the spectrum from Sergio Leone's spaghetti westerns to the best of recent Hong Kong cinema through their own sensibilities to tell the story of Thomas ""Neo"" Anderson (Keanu Reeves), an ace computer hacker who finds himself a pawn in a larger conspiracy involving world domination. Recruited by band of rebels led by the enigmatic Morpheus (Lawrence Fishburne), Neo becomes the center of a deadly cat and mouse game in which not only his fate, but quite possibly the fates of millions rest on his every move.Revealing more would ruin one of the best joys in watching The Matrix - the way the plot unfolds and the surprising twists and turns it takes. Although The Matrix is being marketed as an action film in the vein of Blade or The Crow, it's much more than that for two reasons:1. The intelligence of the screenplay. 2. Its unwillingness to condescend to its audience.Not only does The Matrix succeed on a visceral butt kicking action film level, but the friends and I who saw an advanced screening of the film were able to pick it apart and discuss the ideas and concepts it presented for *days*.If you're looking for a film to get your brain as well as your adrenaline pumping, The Matrix is it.",The Matrix

The plot is based on the rehashed premise (""What if this is all just a dream?""), but there are enough original twists to make it interesting.  The several action scenes easily outshined the rest of the movie, but the slower parts of the movie were necessary for plot comprehension.  The occasional corny one-liner or holes in the plot are not enough to take away from the awe-inspiring special effects.Until now,I have never left a movie hoping that there will be a sequel made.

Others with a broader and deeper history of films behind them should be pleased to miss ""The Matrix"" and never look back.  Its brother team of directors deserve no reward for any technical gimmickry that might momentarily wow an asocial ticket-buyer, because their ignorance (read it ""sense of what was hot last week"") and disdain for the human component--for people as the best or worst of us really talk and think (or view and listen) damages even actors who know better, such as Lawrence Fishburn.  His appearance, unlucky for him, signals the utter retreat of the film into a doleful pattern of ""Captain Video"" dialogue--yes, accidental historical accuracy in self-conscious, robotic enunciation of unintentionally scoff-inspiring paradoxical phrases--punctuated, de rigeur, by spasms of billowing orange explosion (for the eye) and nattering automatic weapons fire (for the ear).",The Matrix

And what about Keanu, you ask?  Well he's good.  Especially when his mouth disappears.  And credit those Bound brothers, for giving him as few lines as possible.  Unfortunately, they didn't seem to do fit with Fishburne.  And, by the way, when are bad guys gonna be something besides guys in black suits and black shades?

However, I was a little apprehensive about what exactly 'The Matrix' would turn out to be.  I was afraid that this would be another film where the intense special effects would drown out the directors' ambition to create a good plotline.  I can tell you that I was ecstatic with the final results. This film will leave you wanting more like it.  Its like a masterful combination of 'Blade' meets 'Dark City' meets 'Hackers'.  The actors have all gone through intense martial arts training creating some very impressive fighting scenes.  The story grabs you from the beginning and leaves you pondering your very existence.

The brothers Wachowski have created a concept far beyond the imagination of most movie audiences.  I was in awe throughout the film and left feeling as though my dreams were not adequately creative enough to compete with the word of The Matrix.  The film makers were able to conceive visually those aspects of comic books and science fiction literature that have escaped film thus far.  The closest films that have come to this complete visual and conceptual realization might be Blade Runner and Dark City.

It's slicker than a greased spanner, smoother than ice.  In their black leather and PVC gear Keanu Reeves et al. walk around like they own the copyright on cool.Even if it didn't have a decent plot, it would be worth seeing just for the sheer visual fun of it, but the plot itself is pretty good, too.  The whole ""power source"" theory is nuts and doesn't make much sense, but apart from that it builds from confusion through a series of setbacks into a near-perfect climax that leaves you gagging for more.The Wachowski brothers lay on the allegory and ""intelligence"" perhaps a little too thickly (the Alice in Wonderland theme is pushed a tad too hard for my taste), but they have put enough effort into creating a believable and genuinely science-fictional (rather than ""sci-fi"") world, that the film works on the mind as well as on the viscera.All in all, it's a cracker.  I saw it in a cinema with just old-fashioned stereo sound, and with the bottom half of the picture somewhat blurred, but it still blew me away.  It's the first film in years that I absolutely *have* to go back in and see again.  And then buy the video....",The Matrix

2782,TradSka,If you liked THIS action...,9,2 April 1999,"The one aspect of this film that seems to garner almost universal approval is the action.  The reason for this is that the stunt co-ordinator AND martial arts instructor for The Matrix was none other than Hong Kong action director Woo-Ping Yuen, and let me tell you that if you thought The Matrix's action scenes were out of this world, YOU AIN'T SEEN NOTHIN YET.Woo-Ping Yuen's magnificent Tai Chi series contains some of the most beautifully choreographed fight scenes ever to grace a strip of celluloid, and the most impressive of these films is, without a doubt, The Tai Chi Master (1993), starring none other than the now-famous Jet Li.Hong Kong comparisons aside, The Matrix is a visually and conceptually stunning masterpiece (despite an incredibly lame, squirming-in-your-seat, why-did-they-have-to-put-that-in-there, Hollywood-esqe speech from Carrie-Anne Moss during the climactic battle) which will leave you wanting more.  As several previous reviews have stated, Reeves wasn't given enough dialogue to screw up; thus, the film is mercifully (almost) devoid of horrible one-liners.Several critics have accused The Matrix of having no original plot, but my contention is that originality isn't necessarily the key; it's how you work with what you've got that makes all the difference in the world.  I personally enjoyed picking up on the slew of subtle movie references in the film, which include, but are not limited to, Vertigo (I guess this one wasn't so subtle), Superman II, True Lies, and Dark City/Hellraiser, as well as a Looney Tune or two.  There are many more, and seeing them used as tribute rather than rip-off makes viewing the film more fun that it already is.",The Matrix

The rest of the crew were suited in their roles and I was also happy to see that there were even a couple of Kiwi actors in there.Without trying to give the plot away to much (and yes there is a plot) the world is taken over by computers and only a rag tag bunch of outsiders can save the people enslaved although due to the fantastic advances in VR they dont actually realise that they are prisoners.And of course the only way to save them is with some excellent action sequences and masterful special effects, slowed down for maximum effect.

This has got to be the best movie to incorporate new-age special effects...trust me, it makes you go oooh and aahhh!!. The contrast between L.

The only major gripe I have with the film, besides Reeves and the ever present plot holes, is the films tendency to fall back on more action instead of  developing and exploring the interesting philosophical questions it raised.

You can forget the technology involved, you can think (as you do in Star Wars, for example) that the science has evolved enough. But you can't accept when they try to say that A and NOT A are true at the same time. You can't have millions of people (with different ages) living in the same unreal world if it doesn't evolve, if it's always at the end of the 20th century. You can do it by making a special Matrix for every human being (destroying the plot) or making the humans forget every 10 years (destroying the plot).Good special effects.

The Japanimation style the directors were shooting for came across brilliantly. The best visual effect is the still rotations that I just couldn't get enough of.This film goes from mystery to confusion to despair to amazement and all the time keeps your blood racing with intense VFX and action sequences. It's also about time a late 90s film had a compelling plot.This movie is like Dark City meets Hackers meets Ghost in the Shell. It keeps you on the edge of your seat the whole time. If you like action, sci-fi, or just any well-done movie, this one is a must-see.",The Matrix

What if everything that you knew, everyone you loved and you, yourself weren't real.  While I don't want to give away too much of the plot. I have to say the actors did wonderful jobs and I usually dislike Keanu Reeves.  His character, Thomas (Neo) Anderson is played very well along with Laurence Fishburne's character, Morpheus.

When you are leaving the cinema, you are looking everywhere and you are thinking if what you see is what you get. I think that ""The Matrix"" could be a master piece in the ""undermind cinema"" as Dark City. In the beginning you're lost as Keanu Reeves, and you don't understand what's happening. Then comes the surprise: the heroes are not some kind of supermen, but just some people who know the truth, THE REAL TRUTH. The Matrix brings you into a nightmare, a world ruled by computers, a ""ghost world"" where men are virus. This movie is crossing the boundaries of imagination and really makes you think about one thing: is the world is true or just a fake. Keanu Reeves is making a quite good characters (but I think that they could have cast somebody else).Just free your mind...and try to jump trough this movie. You will enjoy it.",The Matrix

Keeanu Reeves gives off a spetactular performance (that new huh) in this sci-fi futuristic action thriller.  This film is sure to be a momentous occasion that may take away some of the Star Wars hype, ""What??"" you say. Put it this way, we have seen 3 Star Wars already and soon 3 more are coming out.

2811,star69,"poor plot, unoriginal quotes, plenty of stereotypes",2,10 April 1999,"`I hate those movies based on special effects with a poor plot,' I told my friend when he suggested me to go see `The Matrix' on its opening night. But when I kept hearing excellent reviews of the movie, my curiosity increased, and I decided to give it a try. Well, I was right: not only I did not enjoy the movie, but I also could not wait to rush out of the movie theater.
First of all: the PLOT was truly poor, and it is clear that most of the scenes were designed merely to show special effects, rather than to transmit a precise message (and at least twenty minutes of the movie could have been cut because of this). The first rule of screenwriting is to satisfy the audience's need for orientation, clarifying since the very beginning who are the characters of the movie, and what is their function. I had to wait an hour to understand that. This method (increasing the suspense of this audience by postponing a real explanation of the characters' roles) could have been effective, only if they were introduced in a more clear way. I often felt lost, as many key aspects of the movie were clarified too late (i.e. the phone transportation).
The DIALOGUES were truly lame and unoriginal (except for some funny references to the Wizard of OZ).The CHARACTERS were not developed at all. Still now, thinking about the movie, I cannot really say what was a peculiar trait of each character: their personalities did not stand out at all. They were rather divided into the stereotypical `good' and `bad' categories.
Still mentioning STEREOTYPES, I think the whole movie was a TT (Temple of Testosterone): the ideal place for the satisfaction of a male audience. Why? Because of great fight scenes, vigorous men with a perpetual grimace who want to either save or `own' the world, women with big breasts who don't talk (the woman in red), and strong but yet submissive women driven by sentimentality (Trinity).
What I SUGGEST is to go see it if you like video games and want some entertainment. But if you are one of those persons who want to step out of a movie theater with a new awareness or  even better  a call to action, I suggest you'd save the 8 bucks for a better cause.",The Matrix
2812,mxyzptlk-2,What an awesome flick!,9,27 March 1999,"I goto school at MSU and they had a free screening of The Matrix on 3/25 and all I can say is Wow! The sfx were out of this world, the fight scenes were the best I've probably ever seen.  The plot kept pace with the non-stop action by making you question the reality of which you live in. The Wachowski brothers have completely redefined what great sfx can do for a movie.  Keanu puts in a great performance, mainly because they limited the amount of dialogue he had, as Neo the reluctant leader of a resistance to free humanity.  The movie immediately grabs you and holds you for the remainder, with the exception of your mouth dropping open during the mind blowing action scenes. Once word gets out about this movie, it's going to make mucho dinero.",The Matrix

It's two hours of good film spoiled by an awful ending.",7,13 May 1999,"Apart from the last 15 minutes, Matrix is one of the best picture of the year; it mixes great action sequences and cool dialogues with original and not obvious considerations about our world and the dangers in it. Although there are some unanswered questions it moves quite well in the world of virtual reality where many films such as ""The lawn mower"" got lost before. What I can' t understand is the ending in a horrible ""soap opera-scene"" and, in the last sequence. And in contrast with the meaning of the rest of the movie, the audience is satisfied like common people of the movie. ""Don't worry"" we are told ""you don't have to fight to get your freedom! A hero is doing it for you"".",The Matrix

I was very hesitant going to this movie due to the fact that Keanu Reeves was the lead.  But, I had no need to worry, he finally proved to me that he is worth seeing in a film.  The fight scenes were amazing along with all the special effects.  This movie surpassed my expectations beyond anything I could have imagined.  The plot was exciting, yet it made you think and ponder about our own existence.  I recommend this movie to anyone over the age of 18 who can definitely appreciate everything that is going on.  Go See It!!",The Matrix
2815,Radha,Must See !! (preferably more than once),10,22 March 1999,"I was lucky enough to attend a press screening for The Matrix on March 20th at Warner Bros.  This movie is awesome!!  Cyper-Sci-Fi at the cutting edge. It has action (incredible stuff), humor, suspense, great camera work and editting, and substance.  It's an excellent, and thought-provoking script, and the cast is super.  The buzz is that they all had to train for 4 months for the martial arts/wire work, before the filming even began, and it really shows.  Much of what appears to be special FX is not - they really did what you just saw (or thought you saw).  This one is a must see - preferably more than once since there's so much packed into the film that it's hard to absorb it all the first time.  But that's sort of what The Matrix is all about.  Suspend judgment until you've actually been there - as Morpheus says, ""unfortunately no one can tell you what The Matrix is - you have to experience it for yourself.""",The Matrix

The dialogue was crap though, if I had a say it was the king of One Liners.  Once again Keanu will score big with what he's best with, action (little speech hard core violence).  Though I say romantic films are corny this movie reached a level beyond corny with its attempt for romance, that scene was plain stoopid!If you're in the mood for anything but intelligent, deep, witty, or life inspiring, go check this movie.  It's still worth it, it's a fun flick.",The Matrix

Not since T2 have I seen such great special effects coupled with action, only this was better in some aspects. I don't know, I just kept laughing a giddy little laugh throughout because of awesomeness of scenes (i.e. the lobby).  Sure, the dialog could have been better, but that's true with almost every film.  But the effects and action make up for it without a doubt.  You say you don't like Keanu Reeves?  Yeah, I know, he's not an actor, or at least not a good one.  In this though, he fits, and makes a pretty cool bad-ass.  So, if you like action in the slightest, I highly suggest this movie.",The Matrix

2819,Seth-33,Woo-ing the action and special effects film going audience.,10,31 March 1999,"The Wachowski brothers bring their stark (and black leather) visions back to silver screen! And how!  Definitely influenced by the Hong Kong Kung-Fu wire pix and the two handed pistol shooting protagonist a lá Woo, the action sequences are some of the best seen in a movie of this type (unless you count the trailers for ""Phantom Menace"" - and they still hold their own). The plot can be confusing at times and somewhat hard to swallow, but... what if?  That seems to be the point that the Wachowski's are getting across. Keanu and Laurence are definitely a great pairing.  This isn't so much a buddy relationship as it is a mentorship.  Reminds one of a similar film (and film series) that may have been mentioned beforehand.  The other supporting characters also lend their presence and aren't just backdrops. Hugo's droll performance for the majority of the film fits perfectly in the wetworks world, until he throws the equivalent machine version of a hissy fit.  It's an intense and involving movie that lends itself to fantasy and amusement.  I'm hooked!  Now only if the Wachowski brothers are involved in the development of the inevitable software game, then I'd really be wired in.",The Matrix

You would think that it had already been done with Terminator, Johnny Mnemonic, etc., but this puts a fresh face on the concept.  The Matrix is an incredibly well directed, well written movie!  The special effects are undoubtedly the best in a while.  But not only that, the story-line actually supports the action and the effects.  It isn't just an effects movie, the story is well thought out and even thought provoking.  The acting is well directed and each actor's strengths are played upon.

2823,Peartree-3,Christ story redefines the effects bar,8,11 April 1999,"The Matrix:  8 out of 10""The Matrix"" raises the special effects bar yet another notch, with stunning high-speed camerawork, Gap-commercial rotation-freeze frame, blur motion effects, and loads of computer-generated effects that amazed me.  I have not seen such a redefinition of the ""possible"" using computer effects since I first saw ""Terminator 2"" and ""Jurassic Park"".  Because of that alone, this movie will make a lot of money.The movie most closely follows in the dark, cyberpunk tradition of ""Blade Runner"", but the plot is essentially the Christ story retold with guns, leather, and sci-fi monsters.Keanu Reeves plays Neo (the Christ figure), who is brought into the true ""Real World"" by Lawrence Fishburne, who plays Morpheus, the leader of a band of rebels from the human city of Zion, fighting the forces of the Matrix, a computer program that has run rampant and taken over the real world.  > I predict this movie will be one of top at the box office in 1999 -- even considering ""Star Wars, Episode I"" will soon follow and suck up the repeat viewer market.The film combines karate, anime, armed-to-the-teeth, dressed-in-black cyberpunk with a thought-provoking storyline about what is ""reality"" and what is ""computer generated dreamworld"".  It reminded me also of ""The Lawnmower Man"", with the Agents as guardians of the the heart of the computers, and Keanu as the hacker who breaks their security.The story does have holes here and there, especially in explanations about the machines harvesting humanity, and why a kiss of love can overcome death, but the action is so rapid-fire and stunningly rendered, it does not ruin the film.The actors all do well, considering the real top billing goes to the special effects.  I thought Fishburne, Moss, and Agent Smith were most compelling, with Keanu playing well but with no surprises.The movie IS ""eye candy"", but that is not a bad thing.  It will be wonderful to compare the ""The Matrix"" to ""Star Wars, Episode I"".Overall:  Above-average.  Redefines the effects bar. Recommended.",The Matrix

The story line is a real teaser and fun to see in action. It leaves a opening for another movie but this won't be an easy shoe to fill. The actors fill their parts and it looks as if they put a great deal of effort in to this movie. A must see for any science fiction or action fan.,The Matrix
2826,halon,wow wow wow,10,1 April 1999,"Ok, first off, I am not a critic or reviewer by profession.  I'm just a regular science fiction fan just like any other.  I like my action fast and furious, my story-line engaging my characters detailed and believable and just as importantly my technology amazing (after all, isn't that what science fiction is about?).Unfortunately for the science fiction genre, movies that have all of these things are few and far between.  There have been decent entries such as (and some may disagree with me here) Starship Troopers and the Fifth Element as well as some movies that i found fun to watch but far from being able to be considered good sci-fi flicks (Wing commander and Johnny Mnemonic).So I was expecting to be fairly disappointed with The Matrix.Boy was I in for a shocker.  The best way to explain the first 5 minutes is by comparing it to the beginning of a roller coaster.  About 40 seconds setting up the scene and then a furious drop into white-knuckle grip action. The way that they show how much more powerful Trinity is than the police and then how much more powerful The Agents are to Trinity is awesome.While the plot may not be 100% original it is very well done and I found it very enjoyable.  The locations give a feeling of confinement even in open spaces which adds atmosphere that fits the story line perfectly.  I don't want to comment too much more here for fear of adding spoilers.The characters in the film are detailed and have quite a bit of depth. Even the minor supporting roles had enough detail to make them believable.  I especially loved Agent Smith.  I could almost watch an entire movie about him because his character and mannerisms were so engrossing.  The characters really draw you into this film.Now for the action and technology.  All I can say is damn.  The action sequences blew me away.  With each sequence better than the previous.  The directors use of 12,000(yes thats twelve thousand) FPS during key sequences provided some never-before-seen effects that made my jaw drop. Trust me, you have to see it to believe it.  And my personal fave as far as the technology is concerned is what I can only describe as an ELF (electron flux gun) that fires off blue-white bolts of lightning.  Incredible.Well that about wraps up my schpiel.  As you can tell I love this movie. Do your self a favor and go see it as soon as you can.",The Matrix

Also I saw Letterman last night and saw a different clip on it which made me want to see it more. A fast paced movie with great effects, action and plot.  I was not disappointed. From the moment it started I was hooked. For action, guns and martial arts, always works for me.  Special effects were quite impressive and very elaborate. The film was equally put together, one aspect did not overwhelm any other. I do have have one slight dislike, and I guess that goes for all action lovers. They tried to add a little feelings to the movie. I'm just glad they kept it like they did.  Just enough to give a  different flavor not drown it out.  For me I will definitely see this one again.",The Matrix
2828,juliank,absolutely breath taking,10,6 April 1999,"This movie blew me away.  I loved how it started off slow.  It introduced you into the world, and gave a chance for the audience to understand and be in that world.  When the amazing action sequences came, they didn't seem as if they were the reason for the movie (which is what I feared).  Everyone always disses on Keanu, but he was alright in this movie.

John Woo isn't making good action movies anymore like HARD BOILED, the Matrix certainly filled my emptiness for some hardcore action movie, you know? I recently learned about this two directors. I enjoyed Bound very much and I enjoyed Assassins very much too. I certainly became a fan of this two directors,, and I thank them for making such a great movie when all the movies coming out these days suck so bad such as that trash movies Armaggedon.

2834,mikey-89,"Overall, a good time.",8,1 April 1999,"Let me break the bad news first.  Keanu Reeves has no martial arts skills. He's stiff as a board and he obviously didn't practice enough before the filming.  His attempts at trying to mimic the late and great Bruce Lee were very sad indeed.  They should have cast Jet Li instead.The fight scenes were an obvious attempt by the Wachowski brothers to grope Hong Kong martial arts films.  And they were sorely lacking in comparison to the truly skilled martial artists of Hong Kong cinema.Not only did the Wachowskis try to bite Hong Kong martial arts movies, they tried to imitate unsuccessfully John Woo's gunfights, two-handed pistol action and slow motion sequences.  Poor Mr. Reeves pales in comparison to the likes of Chow Yun Fat.Now, for the good news:  overall -- despite all the wannabe Hong Kong cinema elements prevalent in ""The Matrix,"" the movie was visually stunning and fun to watch.  The special effects were top shelf, top of the line eye candy. If you can look past Mr. Reeves inadequacies when compared to the likes of Jet Li and Chow Yun Fat, the action was still top-notch.  The action and visuals are well worth the price of admission.Laurence Fishburne is great, as usual.  He plays the role of Morpheus with the kind of level-headed cool we've all come to expect.  The man commands respect whenever on the silver screen, and his performance in ""The Matrix"" is no exception.On one level, ""The Matrix"" does what ""Dark City"" tried to do, but only better.  The premise is somewhat similar, but I don't want to say too much, or else I'll spoil the film for all of you who haven't seen it yet.Watching ""The Matrix,"" I was hoping for a ""Twilight Zone"" type of ending that was lacking in ""Dark City.""  That old television series was great in that the episodes would start off mind boggling, and end even more so because the endings weren't necessarily happy and quaint.  But I was disappointed at the rosey ending of ""The Matrix.""Nonetheless, ""The Matrix"" is a solid piece of entertainment, and is more than worthy of the price of admission.  It gets the thumbs up from this moviegoer.",The Matrix
2835,PoiDog,What was good and bad about the Matrix,8,1 April 1999,"The Matrix scored big points with its over the top special effects and action sequences.  Suprisingly, the script is very strong.  We get a good sense of who these people are, at least the main characters, and why they are doing what they are doing.  The dialogue is simple but not stupid, and realistic. Buzz words don't overwhelm this script.  However, the concept is nothing new.  Similar stories have been seen in ""Dark City"", ""The Terminator""(series), ""Total Recall"", and even some elements of ""Star Wars"" show up in this film (as if there is a Sci-Fi film since that hasn't).  It is though, one of the best cyber-punk films to date.  The script is complicated, but well explained.  You won't be scratching your head in this one.  This role is tailor made for Keanu Reeves.  He fits perfectly in to the role of Neo. The film does run a little long, and dragged in some scenes.  The use of digital effects was superb and NOT too overdone.  Look for really cool digital reflections in Fishburne's sunglasses. The cinematography is top notch, especially the use of filters.  Editing is also very tight.  Possibly the best thing about this film is the fact that although there is tons of violence, there is not a lot of blood and language.

The plot's pretty iffy, but the action is great, the special effects are seamless, and all the lead characters excellent for their roles.",The Matrix
2841,rajo,Very *COOL* movie.,10,1 April 1999,"This is one of the best movies I have seen in a long time. From the beginning to the end, this movie oozes out w/ coolness: the soundtrack, the wardrobe, special effects, dark shades, etc.One of the movies I immediately thought of as I watched this was Ridley Scott's ""Blade Runner"". Both offer a dark view of the future that is realistic and interesting to watch. It also has a lot of guns ala John Woo.In ""The Matrix"", there are a few scenes that seem like a video game--some that are pretty amusing. But the special effects throughout are just fabulous. I'm looking forward to seeing it again!",The Matrix
2842,ViNNiE-15,Possibly The Greatest Sci-Fi Movie I've Seen.,10,1 April 1999,"This movie delivered great acting, an enthralling storyline, action packed scenes,outstanding computer imaging, and the feeling of question that a good sci-fi movie should give you when you leave the theater.  I've seen this movie four times in the past 2 days... I hope to see it again soon. Reeves did a outstanding acting job in comparison to his other movies; he managed to keep the story surrounding him without sinking the plot.  Great performances were given from all of the actors in this movie.  See this film as soon as possible... and you will never again ask ""What is the Matrix?""...",The Matrix
2843,spacebob,Nice surprise,10,1 April 1999,"When I first heard about this movie I thought to myself, oh great another Johnny Mem movie. I read the plot along with seeing one image about 5 months ago and said, ""Nah I'll pass."" Last month I saw a preview in the theaters and said to myself, ""Oh my god this may actually be good."" Then I have to say that each time I saw the preview I started anticipating it more and more. It looks and feels exactly like a comic book story. The shots of the characters in a lot of the scenes feel just like something you would see in a comic book. The action once again follows the comic book theme as does the entire movie. I was well pleased with seeing this movie and will see it again to catch some of the subtle things that went on.If you are thinking about not going due to Reeves acting, just ignore your thoughts cause this movie will have you laughing and cheering and also saying ""WOW!"" all the way through it. GO SEE IT!!!",The Matrix
2844,falcom,A Strong Contender for the Best Action Film of 1999,10,3 April 1999,"'The Matrix' is the best film that I have seen in quite some time. It manages to succeed where other films, such as 'Dark City,' failed. The action sequences are reminiscent of 'Blade,' which for many was the best US martial arts film of 1998.Like 'Blade,' I did not have high hopes for this film when I walked into the theater, but I was extremely happy and excited when I left. The fight sequences were performed by the actors who played the roles (Reeves, Fishburne) and were striking. Rarely have I heard an audience so impressed as after the classic lobby sequence.The film has a number of quirks that seem like flaws the first time around. The first is the stilted delivery of some of the characters early in the film. The second is the occasional feeling that something does not quite match up with earlier statements made in the film, and the third is that it seems to fall into the classic trap of giving a ""love conquers all"" ending to an otherwise tremendous film.However, when you see the film again, you will realize the genius of the writer/directors of this film. The seemingly stilted delivery in the early scenes of the film is actually just a pacing of the speeches, a novel way of breaking up the conversation, which otherwise would turn into an extremely boring lecture. There is a lot of data that needs to be shared, and it could drag the film down very quickly if it were not dealt with in this manner.When you see the film again, the second quirk is also soothed. There is no statement that directly conflicts with the later scenes in the film. The oracle speaks very accurately, and only makes the statements that need to be made. Other characters merely misconstrue her words.The third quirk can be viewed as a fulfillment of an earlier prophecy, and as such can be used to back up a messianic interpretation of the events of the film.Perhaps in a novel, the story would have ended differently, and the third issue would disappear (c.f. 'Blade Runner' v. 'Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep,' two totally different takes on a similar group of characters).The film is filled with little tidbits of information dropped into the story several minutes before a scene. This is neatly done, and sets up the audience to be ready for the high points of the film.The music in the film is also quite good, though for some reason the best material was not included on the soundtrack. It is to be hoped that they will release an album of music from the film at a later time.Overall, a great film, with interesting special effects, a believable future with rules that are meant to be broken, and great music. The direction of the film is top notch, with performances being tightly controlled to add a literary element to the film's conversations and little tidbits to keep the audience entertained. I anxiously await the next film by this writing and directing duo.",The Matrix
2845,Ben Wang,very stylistic cyberpunk action,8,1 April 1999,"At first, I thought this would be Johnny Mnemonic II because of Mr. Speed's role.  After watching this movie on the official wide-release opening night (3/31/99),  I was proved wrong.  I believe some people are meant to enjoy certain types of movies, and some are not.  I was meant to enjoy this one. The cyberpunk, William Gibson-esque motif, the constant action sequences, and that lobby scene... Those who have seen the movie know exactly what I'm talking about.  I grew up reading Neuromancer, (I actually did a book report on it in 8th grade!)and I was hooked on the computer game of the same name. This movie has more style than any cyberpunk type movie in existence.  The only problem I had was that the movie ended too quickly, I wish that this movie was 3 hours long.  Any latin majors out there can correct my spelling but I think ""Deus Ex Machina"" applies to this movie. Regardless, I'm waiting for the DVD. . .  and the sequel!!! (hint, hint)",The Matrix
2846,mrsparkl,Kick ass!,9,4 April 1999,"I've noticed that a lot of the critics out there have put-down the Matrix as incomprehensible or illogical but that's because they're idiots.  They simply don't understand the movie and went into critic attack mode by using artsy fartsy terms to try and hide their lack of technical sophistication. The Matrix's plot is entirely consistent internally and only requires some attention to follow.  I won't reveal the plot since part of the fun of the movie is figuring out what will develop.The action is startlingly fresh and energetic.  Of course the action isn't entirely original (it's not like there are that many kill people) but the way the effects, perspectives and different styles are put to use in this movie hasn't been done before.  Hong Kong wire fighting and John Woo style shoot-outs done in bullet-time with morphing thrown in are possible in the Matrix because the rules of that simulated world allow it (see critics what's so hard to understand about that?).  I won't say that the plot is wholly original but it helps explain the action and bring on the next fight sequence.  Besides, any script that finally provides a credible and funny explanation as to why so many things taste like chicken isn't all bad.The movie kicks ass (literally and figuratively); you'll enjoy it fully if if you aren't looking for something like the Piano or other art BS.  Don't let morons that don't get the movie tell you otherwise.",The Matrix
2847,neo-9,Cyberpunk is Back,10,2 April 1999,If you like the cyberpunk genre than this is the movie for you. It has been a long time sence there has been a good cyberpunk movie.  The last one being Bladerunner.  The effects combined with some good acting (Lawerence Fishburne mainly) made this movie one to see over and over.  I saw it wed. night and then went back on thurs. to catch all the things that I missed the night before. Big time sequel potential.  What is Zion?  Where is it?  Who lives there?  And what of all the people still plugged in? These are just some of the questions that I am sure everyone has.  So if you big Hollywood hotshots are reading this make the sequel.  If you don't I will.  I didn't think I was going to enjoy any movies until the new StarWars was released but I was wrong.  I am in no way comparing this film to the StarWars movies but it is now one of my favorites of all time.  Thank you for the chance to speak my mind.  Keep making movies we will Keep watching them.,The Matrix
2848,varunaX,"""How do you define real?""",10,6 April 1999,"This is one of the very first movies that actually made me think in the theater.  ""The Matrix"" had some very intriguing lines that made you ponder the most obvious things around us.  Such as when Morpheus (Fishburne) says to Neo (Reeves), ""You believe it is the year 1999, when actually it is closer to 2199..."" and he goes on to explain the down fall of our world as we know it to ""AI"" artificial intelligence and machines.  Also, when Morpheus confuses Neo by questioning his definition of ""real"":  ""What is real?  How do you define real?  If to you real is what you can see or touch or smell, then it is simply electrical signals being sent to your brain.""We are born into a world which we do not question or take a 2nd glance at. It is a world based on ""rules"".  It is given to us, therefore we accept it for what it is and nothing more. This is in fact the underlying theme of ""The Matrix"" and how we go on living our lives oblivious.  Making the Fishburne's quote  ""Do you really think that's air your breathing right now?"" very believable.With all this thinking going on, you are bound to miss some of the best martial arts fighting sequences I have seen to date.  Using slow motion to the fullest, the action sequences are given a type of grace, such as when Fishburne is floating in the air in the dojo sequence.  This uncut, kung fu style fighting is sure to leave the audience with a smile of pure enjoyment on their faces. In all, this is the best movie I have seen and must be seen more than once to appreciate the plot, the morals, the action, the camera angles, and excellent acting by all 4 main cast members.  I strongly recommend this movie to anyone who is willing to ""free their mind"".",The Matrix

Not so much based on the acting but on the ideas behind the movie. It really is as original as they come. Also, action scenes don't get much better than this!!

2852,happycat-2,Unoriginal and uninspired!,1,2 April 1999,"I can't believe that anyone would seriously suggest that this film was even average!  It was worst film I have seen in a very long time.The movie had so little to offer, it is hard to only point to specific flaws:1) Keanu has to be one of the worst actors of our era.  He shows no signs of even moderate intelligence or talent, and as a hero, he comes across as flat and unispiring.  It is hard to believe that his character would have anything to offer that would distingish him from your average idiot.  And in action scenes, it was impossible to tell if he is *supposed* to look silly or if he can't help it.  No charisma, no flair, just pathetic.2) Very shallow and poor development of an unoriginal idea.  The idea that our reality is not real at all is hardly original.  It has been the subject of science fiction for decades, and a successful treatment of the subject should delve into some psychological depths.  We should be left wondering whether our world truly is real.  Or we should get a sense of how willing or unwilling we might be to face the fact that our world is an illusion.  We should wonder whether it matters if our world is an illusion, or whether reality is what we perceive as real.  Whatever the protrayal, we should leave the theater feeling intellectually moved.  While the film briefly brushed on some of these topics, it was so brief and shallow that no impression was left.  Instead, focus returned to martial arts which had no real purpose in terms of the plot.3) The story dragged as we were forced to sit through an explanation of the matrix that was completely obvious--a couple of visual effects would have gotten the point across in less than a minute with more effect.  While the characters beat the idea of the matrix to death in the dialogue, it did little to shed light into the hearts and minds of the characters.  What was their motivation, from where did they get their drive and courage?  Why were they able to sense the matrix?  None of the answers are even touched upon, and the characters are flat and unrealistic as a result.4) The idea of the matrix is very poorly thought out.  Instead of creating a believable world and believable rules for the matrix, the plot resorts to physical fighting, which makes no sense at all.  The film obviously had no intention of stretching the mind of the viewer, instead catering to an audience of mindless action-addicts. While action might have added to a well-thought out film, it cannot support a film where the premise is psychological or intellectual.5) No sense of despair, darkness, or power from the futuristic scenes. The future world is portrayed so little that we really don't even have a chance to be overwhelmed by how horrible it could be.  In an attempt to make a happy action film, the dark undertones were completely dropped.The very few redeeming values were: 1) Interesting use of slow-motion action 2) A few nice special effects (no more than an average action film these days) 3) A promising premise.  While not original, the idea has great potential. Several other films, such as Dark City have shown a bit of this potential, and there is a plethora of such plots in books.In short, any thoughtful, insightful, meaningful, or inspired treatment of a potentially interesting idea was completely dropped to show a few almost laughably out of place action scenes.  The fact that people rave about this movie shows that people are willing to swallow the mindless just for some cool effects.  How sad.",The Matrix
2853,rcbloom,Oh YES!,10,2 April 1999,"Only since the beginning of March 1999 had I become interested in this film. I downloaded the trailer from the film's web site, and I became obsessed.

Take the reality-is-not-what-it-seems element of Dark City, add the post-apocalyptic future of Terminator, and mix in the best action sequences I have EVER seen in an American movie (it tops even Face/Off), and you have The Matrix. And with special FX that have to be seen to be believed, I have found my favorite movie of 1999 (perhaps even more so than The Phantom Menace).

2857,Cyrano-14,Already Overrated,5,2 April 1999,"Everybody else has already said most everything positive I have to say about this movie.  Great action, kudos for actors doing their own kung-fu..et all. But. There is a huge downside to this movie that has seemingly escaped everyone else commenting here. These down sides don't keep The Matrix from being a decent guy movie, or a decent techno-geek movie, but they do keep it from being anything resembling a good cinematic movie:Foremost is the cliche'd and campy-as-hell dialog.  Lawrence Fishbourne is a fine actor, and I cringed for his sake every time he was forced to say inane things like ""He is The One"" with conviction every ten minutes.  Much of the rest of his dialogue is just as vague and pseudo-foreboding (The One, The Oracle, The Matrix, The Agents...the horror!  Come on, even mediocre sci-fi should be able to get beyond this).  I was doing my best to believe in a world to support the stunning action, but with each character spewing Total Recall-ish lines and bad Dark City outtake ideas, it was damned near impossible.  Half the lines are embarrassedly half-hearted attempts at lame self-realization, with metaphors like ""the path"" and ""the door"" overused to create an overriding question of destiny, a question which doesn't hold together well enough to ever be answered.  By the time The Matrix tries to answer it, we no longer care what it has to say.Then there's the vague excuse for a plot, the shining moments of which are buried under some truly awful scenes.  The truth behind The Matrix is vague and unexplained, and I got the impression that this was not because of some sly sleight-of-hand by the Wachowski brothers, but rather because they weren't ever able to create an insightful explanation that held together. In my book, any plot where the main character's resurrection is explained by ""Well, he can't die, because I love him!"" isn't any plot at all.Lastly, the plot has holes, chief among them the fact that a near-dead Morpheus does NOT have holes at all after sitting unmoving in the middle of a room that has just been chain-gunned halfway to hell.  I suppose Neo not only controls his aim with his world-bending powers, but also uses his power to make a notoriously inaccurate chaingun perfectly precise?  Also..when you're standing on top of a building, on the edge of the roof, and a terrific explosion happens right below you, the force is going to blow you the hell back, whether or not you're the hero in the movie.Despite all these attempts to make The Matrix just another crappy American action movie, it does stand out in a few ways.  Everything visual is amazing, from the fights to the futuristic scenes (the baby-harvesting scene is enough to make anybody's blood run cold) to the futuristic city set (watch for the black doorman in the tux by the elevator..a great touch.) The scene with The Oracle is also a cut above, with the waiting room and The Oracle herself far more original than the rest of The Matrix.  The spoon-bending kid is especially interesting, even if she is practising Buddhism without a license.On the whole..this movie is at most a 5 or a 6 out of 10, chiefly because of the action scenes.  The dialog is crap, the plot is half-assed, but this movie does a good job of being all about ""guns. Lots of guns.""  It's in the same vein as Total Recall, but better, but don't go expecting to see the next Blade Runner, or even the next Dark City.",The Matrix

Well, I was wrong.  ""The Matrix"" isn't an original idea, or even an original movie. Its originality lies in the fact that all these other films were so seamlessly tied together in the storyline of ""The Matrix"", which makes sense since that's what The Matrix is, or what you are lead to believe it is.The cast is weak.  Hopefully, someday, our wishes will be granted and Keanu will stop being the wooden puppet and turn into a real boy.  Laurence Fishburne can't even save this with his Obi-Wan Kanobi self.On the plus side, the special effects are really well done.  It is nice to finally see a movie where the special effects are part of the storyline and not just for show.  My recommendation: See this as a matinee, don't pay full price.

2865,devlyn,What is real and what is imagined,8,5 April 1999,"I saw ""The Matrix"" on opening day and again three days later.  Any good movie, especially one as complex in message, plot and visuals, should be viewed more than once.I was intrigued by the previews for this film the first time I saw them. They filled me with a lot of questions, mainly, what in the world is this about?  All of my questions were answered.""The Matrix"" is one wild ride that makes a person question what is real and what is the intangible construct of our imagination.  How much of what we see and experience is the truth, and how much is only our perception of the data we are bombarded by and required to process every day?The script was beautifully constructed, the dialog just what was necessary to relay plot and character.  The performances were a joy to watch, easily allowing the viewer to suspend disbelief.  The baddies were spooky, evocative of the mysterious men in black characters traveling in threes that people into government/alien conspiracy claim really do exist in our world. The music was so well applied that I barely noticed it (as great soundtracks should be) as it wove its way though the visuals, underscoring the mood.I was floored when Mr. Smith (a baddie) commented about humans not fitting into their environment, being a cancer on the planet.  I've believed this for years.  Did the writers of this movie read my mind?And, how could I not comment specifically on Keanu Reeves' performance. I've enjoyed his work for quite some time.  In this movie, as in others, he is excellent at playing confused, misplaced and, in the end, victorious characters.  As Neo he struggles well with accepting his reality and his place in the scheme of things.  I'd give his performance in this, on a scale of one to ten (10 being the best), about an 8 1/2.Lawrence Fishburn was enthralling as the rather somber, patient, nurturing mentor, Morpheus.  Carrie-Anne Moss was wonderful as Trinity.  The rest of the supporting cast rounded out the film with style.""The Matrix"" reminded me of other films I enjoyed: ""Johnny Mnemonic"" (in which the main character was also 'plugged-in') and ""Dark City"".I truly enjoyed this movie, and when it's available on video I'll add it to my very selective collection of special movies to enjoy over and over.What is real and what is imagined?  Maybe this review only exists in my mind.  Maybe this movie is only a construct of my warped fantasies.  If that's the case, I invite you in to share it.",The Matrix

The thoughtful use of special effects to convey a fresh story embellished this good storyline.  The fight scenes, performed by the actors themselves, are worth the price of admission (Jackie Chan fans will like them).

From the moment Carrie-Ann Moss floated into the air and did her little Kung Fu maneuvers, I knew the special effects were going to be killer and I was hooked if for no other reason just to see more of that.What I got was not only a special effects ride, but an engaging plot. Laurence Fishburne and his Obi-Wan like character fit him more nicely than I had thought it would. He was quite convincing as the man who has been ""searching for the one"". Keanu Reeves is not a fantastic actor, but he held his own here. He actually had me convinced that he was the ""one"".The plot was incredibly intelligent even if it isn't new - it's the question philosophers have been battling for years - ""What is reality?"" The Wachowski brothers handled this question with incredible skill, however. They took a tired idea and repackaged it for today's vision of tomorrow's technology - the ultimate VR experience.",The Matrix
2870,Breeze-6,The Best Movie of the Decade...if not of All Time,10,3 April 1999,"This movie is riveting from beginning to end.  The action scenes are great. The special effects, fantastic.  The story line, credible. The acting superb!!  This is the type of movie that you must see for yourself...or as Morpheus says: ""Unfortunately, no one can be told what the Matrix is.  You have to see it for yourself.""  Open your mind...(another Morpheus request to Neo) and you will enjoy this movie immensely.",The Matrix
2871,Mysteria-2,This film is not your average special-effects-minus-plot movie.,10,5 April 1999,"I was expecting The Matrix to be a two hour special effects show, something I wasn't exactly opposed to (I love special effects).  But I found it instead to be an excellently put-together intellectual film, with plenty of twists to keep your mind whirling.  I truly enjoyed it, and I'll be sure to see it again!",The Matrix
2872,v22green,incredible...,10,20 April 1999,"First of all...wow!  This movie just absolutely blew me away. It has everything a good science fiction movie needs and more. The fight scenes were great, especially when combined with special effects that set a whole new standard for action movies everywhere.  The way the Wachowski bros. wove together parts from different movies, books--even the bible!--was terrific. They really did an amazing job.  The acting was terrific.  Keanu Reeves made up for all the crap he's done since Speed, and I have forgiven Carrie-Anne Moss for Models, inc.  The directors really sucked every last bit of talent they could from the cast and crew.  Finally, the camera work was fantastic--slow motion fight scenes usually drive me nuts, but in this case I absolutely loved it.  And the way they would rotate the camera angles...kind of like those annoying gap commercials only way more cool. The dipping, rotating shot of Keanu dodging bullets on the roof in slow motion was the best. Anyway, I definitely recommend this movie for anyone.",The Matrix
2873,briander,"Complex, innovative, and a lot to think about",9,4 April 1999,"I could say a billion things about this movie that made it excellent to watch.......  First of all when I was driving home that night after watching the movie I started to think, boy what if all this was an actual occurrence in our natural, everyday, boring, yet sophisticated life?  I don't know about you, but when I watch a movie and it makes me think the way I did that night, I knew that that was an excellent movie! Watch this movie, if you like stright forward movies, unlike titles like ""The Devils Advocate,"" in which Al Pacino really screws with your head, then watch this movie.  Think for a moment that you are just a figment of a computers hard drive, and that your whole existence is fake, and your only source of confort in the end is that you might die some day. Wow, this movie has turned me into some buddist monk contemplating different scenarios with alternate possibilities. Watch this movie, you won't regret it.",The Matrix
2874,JeN-84,A definite must see,10,3 April 1999,"Matrix was extremely entertaining, good graphics. It was around 2 hrs, and 20 minutes..But I was so caught up in the movie that I didn't notice the time. A great flick, a definite must see.",The Matrix
2875,edison-5,Metaphor of humanity's past and future,9,4 April 1999,"Great metaphoric view of future society, with hints of millennia past. Reminds me of Star Wars I (IV) and the transforming possibilities of humanity.  Excellent concept, great acting and awesome special effects action scenes.  Appropriate character names Trinity, Neo, et al.",The Matrix
2876,Bill-371,"Excellent use of anime-style action sequences, good plot. Made it to my purchasing list (and I never purchase flicks.)",10,4 April 1999,"This is the sort of flick I would produce if I produced flicks.  Keanu, building on his cyberpunk image from ""Johnny Mnemonic"" brought in his usual mix of the styled computer geek with a dash of Japanese-anime style drama which may very well become the hallmark of this genre to come. Perhaps what I like best about these ""types"" of movies is the constant dichotomy of gritty, run down holes where the heroes play and the sterile, fortress-like office environments (not wholly unlike the hole I find myself in from 9-5.) where the enemy lay. Finally, this movie may mean the most to you if you've ever buried your head in a Gibson novel or spent hours of your life digging around the underpinnings of our beloved Internet.  These movies forspeak a day when the gearheads of the net become warriors of corporate interest (or worse,) or rats, scurrying about the sewers under the streets, subverting the establishment in pursuit of some crusade.Hey, I liked it, and Ms. Moss' wardrobe crew deserves props for the ultra-spiff outfits. -Bill.  See you on the net. :)",The Matrix
2877,korvaden,Whoa...,9,4 April 1999,"Easily the best movie I've seen in the past 5 years. As I was going in, all the comments from the audience were along the line of ""even Keanu can't screw up this movie too badly"". I think even I was shocked to see him turn in a performance where his usual weaknesses turned into strengths. Wow. I can't say enough good things. The story and plotline are kind of similar to Dark City, but the execution and the little details are 100x better. Even John Woo would be impressed by the gunplay here and the martial arts sequences are wonderfully over the top. To top it all off you've got the best bad guy in recent memory: an indestructible government agent that holds all the cards. If this movie has a flaw it's that the beginning hour moves a little slowly. It never gets uninteresting, just a little slow and it makes up for that in the end. As well, some people may think that the ending is just tacked on as a Hollywood afterthought. Personally I thought it was consistent with the film's ideas on fate and prophecy. When it came time to leave the theater I felt like I'd been put through a 50 mile marathon. Now that's good film!",The Matrix
2878,jana-15,digging the revolutionary subtext,10,4 April 1999,"The Matrix is glossy & exciting, with just the right mix to make it successful - even if the plot weren't as good as it is. But, anyone who sees The Matrix as just another ""action movie"" is missing the point. I dug the whole revolutionary, theological subtext. At a critical point, Laurence Fishburne's character tells Keanu Reeves' that the Matrix is everywhere, and that the ""agents"" could be anyone. You could easily dismiss this as the paranoid rantings of a man who's been running too long. But, when he complains that it's hard to save the regular folks because so many of them are totally dependent on the Matrix, I had flashbacks to Malcolm X, Marcus Garvey, W.E.B. DuBois... Whatever the arena, the revolutionary's main problem is always the same. Not how to fight the system, but how to wake up the people.I am Muslim, but we share a belief in the return of Jesus (peace be upon him), so I also dug the Revelations references sprinkled throughout. From the names - Trinity... to the gestures (look for the ""Last Supper"" on a tray)... to the longing for ""Zion""... to the moment of doubt (on a ledge this time), it was movie-making at it's best. Poetically referential, this is the kind of movie you have to see more than once. And, each time, you'll pick up a different layer.If all that's too deep for you, you'll still cheer for the special effects, and the tight plot deserves an Oscar for Best Original Screenplay (ala ""The Usual Suspects""). The kung fu is ""all that"" and the directing is sweet, with a little flavor from Bruce Lee, Al Capone, John Wayne, Arnold Schwarzenegger - and a dash of Muhammad Ali (check out Laurence's moves when he spars with Keanu).Loved it. Loved it. Loved it.",The Matrix

And o.k., the script is lousy, occasionally ludicrous. But fergetaboutit. This film has the best visuals, the best special effects, the best techno-fight scenes of any movie ever made. As big a step beyond as the original Star Wars was in its time. Had the plot, script and pacing been as fine we would be talking All Time Classic. Instead, it is merely spectacular.",The Matrix
2881,Lum-3,visually stunning,10,4 April 1999,"The Matrix is a feast for the eyes, and don't blink!  It is exciting, scary, funny, and I can't imagine anyone else in the role of Neo than Keanu Reeves. The action sequences have to be seen to be believed, and the knowledge that Keanu, Laurence, Carrie and Hugo were actually doing most of their fight scenes themselves made my jaw drop.This goes on my list of favorite science fiction films of all time, up there with Bladerunner and Star Wars.",The Matrix
2882,chick-11,Impressive acting performance and special effects with interesting story line,10,5 April 1999,"I saw the Matrix and I was completely blown away from it. The special effects were very impressive and well performed. They did not take over the story but worked with it beautifully. It had potential of becoming a bit pretentious but managed to stay away from it.The actors really were amazing and the mix between special effects, martial arts and philosophy worked together fabuously. I will go and see it again and I recommend others to do the same.",The Matrix
2883,Leonator,Bruce Lee revisited,10,6 April 1999,"Wow, This movie is awesome. I particularly like the long action scenes that included Neo kicking some butt martial arts style!! In fact , a little bit of the fighting scenes reminded me of the old martial arts films that featured Bruce Lee!! Like the thumbing of the nose, the slow motion of the waving arms, a lot of it reminded me of Bruce. I must add that this film is the turning point of what we will expect from Hollywood because of its dynamic special effects. I have only seen these effects of the stopping of time and the camera circling around the action in a couple of commercials and I was waiting till a movie would include these effects in their movie!! well, The Matrix has definitely used all of those special effects..... Bravo!!!",The Matrix

This movie has some of the best fight scenes and action sequences I have ever seen.  All superbly shot with cutting-edge cinematography and well-integrated into a plot that could have been a tired revisitation of archetypal themes, yet instead put a slick, lively, and extremely exciting spin on a fascinating theme of ""what-is-reality?""  Great performances by all actors, (particularly by Hugo Weaving and including Keanu Reeves for a change) combined with intense martial arts study added to the film's credibility and well-executed suspension-of-disbelief.  An extremely enjoyable and technically masterful film that I highly recommend.",The Matrix

2889,aussie-10,Awesome Sci-Fi Flick,10,4 April 1999,"This movie separated all of the action movies to date. You don't usually see Keanu Reeves in such a film, but I enjoyed this movie more than any Bruce Willis, or Arnold Schwarzanegger flick, because this movie actually had a plot. Set in a futuristic mode, Reeves finds himself as a hacker, named Neo. The movie is fast paced, and a little technical, but not too technical for those watching. Filmed in Australia with contributions from Hugo Weaving as well as Matt Doran who plays Mouse, shows the world at another angle. The Matrix, lets us see the truth, but leaves us hanging for more. Definitely the best movie I have seen all year.",The Matrix
2890,luskman,Keanu Reeves finally found a role that suits him perfectly,10,5 April 1999,"The Matrix is not only an action movie, but a movie that is intelligent as well.  Intelligence in movies today is rare, but The Matrix is a movie that holds you to the edge of your seat, and also makes you think about your own existence. These types of movies are a dime a dozen.  If you just want action, see this movie.  If you want to challenge your mind, and I mean challenge the thoughts of your own existence, you must see this movie.  Keanu may not be classified as an Oscar caliber actor, but in this movie, he not only shows that he can act, but that he can challenge the realm of our reality.",The Matrix

They would spend all of their money on eye-candy, less care is given to the script or story-line.  The Matrix is the perfect blend of a great plot and tons of eye-candy.  If you are waiting for The Phantom Menace, The Matrix should tie you over for a while.",The Matrix

The story held my interest, though.I thought the pacing and acting were both good.  The fight scenes were fun and well choreographed.  Laurence Fishburne was very good as usual.  Keanu Reeves has never really impressed me with his acting, but he was good here.Worthy of a trip to see it on a big screen.",The Matrix
2893,Golden-4,What is the Matrix?,10,7 April 1999,"This movie is the most intense sci fi movie I watched since ""Dark City"". Powerful and original in use of special effect, W brothers directed this film in top notch.  The casting of the film seems rather perfect.  Keanu Reeves acting as little as possible purposely of course.  The new face ""The Trinity"" character is amazing.  Her act in the film is dynamic and the stunts are superb.  However, the plot of the movie could have been better.. If it is the question that drives them than should have left question lead the plot rather than the special effect.  There is a faint hope of Oscars ( it's that good )  Overall, The Matrix is well worth investment of $60 million dollars for Warner Bro.  I wouldn't be surprised to see The Matrix beat the sales of coming sequel of Star Wars.  I already purchased another ticket for coming Friday.  Hey!!  Can't miss out on such a movie playing on theaters. I have friends going for third time now.  :)",The Matrix
2894,A-Dawg,Boy oh boy.,10,5 April 1999,"Well gee.  I'm not really a fickle person.  I like most of the movies that I see, and I actually enjoy most movies with Keanu Reeves (woah, it's true). Still, I was somewhat more excited to see this film more than others.  And what can I say, two days later, I saw it again.See this film.  Please?It was great.  I can't help but tell everyone that I know that they just have to see this film!  It was more than just a movie.  It really captured my imagination, and made me THINK about it over and over until I had no choice but to see it again just to feed my aching cerebrum.The acting was great.  Reeves and Fishburne made an amazing duo, and all of the other characters really helped to bring it together, as well.  The choreography was top notch - those fighting scenes are breathtaking, especially since you can see that the actors themselves are the ones doing all the insane punching and kicking.The special effects... whew.  Being someone who wants to go into sfx for a career, I will usually see any sfx enhanced movie just for that (I actually enjoyed Godzilla... albeit mildly, and Lost in Space made me drool, as much as other people seemed to not like it).  The Matrix new exactly what was needed.  That ""time slice"" effect seems to be highly overdone as of late, and whoever invented it is rolling in the dough, but it was really well used here, and I think added to the story.   I feel that the characters' abilities to warp reality were shown this way.  The effect made it seem as though they moved so fast that time had to be slowed so the audience could see what was happening, or sometimes that the characters could actually slow time in order to do some of their stunts.  Whatever the case - I thought it worked.The story was so neat!  When I think about this film in hindsight, it's as if this film was a REALLY good comic book that was turned into a REALLY good film.  I could visualize every single scene being re-done into a Todd McFarlane epic.  I'll bet that something not far from that actually happens.In the end, if other people react as I do to this film, it will be a big money maker, probably spawn lots of paraphernalia, goods, more movies, WHO KNOWS?  It may not top Star Wars (that's a movie that I will camp out to see), but it sure kept my mouth watering and will keep my brain at ease as I wait for May 19th.",The Matrix

2896,grappler,An excellent Sci-Fi adventure!!!!,10,6 April 1999,"This is THE movie to see.  This may be the best Sci-Fi/ action movie since Terminator 2, it might even be better.  Not wanting to give away the plot, this movie shows what could happen if we don't watch ourselves.  Fishburn is AMAZING!!! The graphics are the best I have seen!!!!  If you are going to the movies between now and May 19th (Starwars)  then you have to see The Matrix, and even after May 19th, see it,  "" because you have to see it to understand it, I can't describe it """,The Matrix
2897,jomolungma,"Creative Camera/Effects Work, plot drags a bit",8,5 April 1999,"I had read the April issue of American Cinematographer prior to seeing this movie, so I had a good idea of how the effects and camera work in The Matrix were going to look.  Even so, I was truly blown away by the seamless integration of slow-motion, fast-motion, real time, and CGI work in this picture.  The camera and effects crews did a great job.  They picked the perfect pacing to match the intricate kung-fu and gun fight scenes.  They made my heart slow down, speed up, and stop right along with the action, which was amazing.  The action scenes in The Matrix are top notch, and make the movie worth seeing just be themselves.The story on the other hand could have used some work.  I was let down by the weak ending, and the plot tended to drag in places.  There was a lot of background information that needed to be relayed to the audience, and this is where the movie tended to crawl.  The dialogue was uninventive in its attempt to be pithy, and the over-the-top acting of Laurence Fishburne was a bit much.  Keanu Reeves does put in a terrific performance, one of the better performances of his I've seen in an action film, maybe only topped by Speed.  This film works in the same genre as Johnny Mnemonic, and Reeves' performance is ten times better in The Matrix.  The rest of the supporting cast played their roles, but nothing to write home about.  The character of Agent Smith was played well by Hugo Weaving, but again, the dialogue he was given tended to get in the way of that.Overall, The Matrix is well worth the money to see.  The action scenes are top-notch and breakthrough, and the holes in the plot are easily forgotten in light of the effects.  I recommend seeing it in a THX theater, it will definitely heighten the experience.",The Matrix
2898,tjlatta,A must-see in the theatre; don't wait for video.,10,5 April 1999,"By far the sweetest action/sci-fi/special effects flick I've seen in a good,long time.  The acting is superb (especially by the ever-under-appreciated Laurence Fishburne) and the special effects are... Well you saw the trailers, right? Despite the title, fans of William Gibson and Shadowrun won't be nearly as impressed/inspired by this one as players of White Wolf's ""Mage"" role-playing game.  But if you have any love of science fiction at all, go watch this one.  I'm gonna buy it when it comes out.",The Matrix

2900,Mad Czar,"Spectacular, surprising sci-fi action with a dark edge...",9,5 April 1999,"Very few contemporary science fiction movies truly capture my imagination anymore. One too many Starship Troopers and Aliens 19 (""Momma Gets Menopause"") paste-together computer graphics extravaganzas have been shoved down my throat for me to readily suspend disbelief and, for a short ninety minutes, ""witness the future"". The Matrix has renewed my faith in a genre that seemed to be, at best, treading water waiting for Master Lucas to save the decade.To begin, the action --as you probably would expect from the previews-- is steely, breakneck, and plausible (given the premise of The Matrix... which I won't give away!). What makes it all the more enjoyable is seeing the actors handling the high-kicking, twirling, leaping duties themselves --a lot of individual work and dedication has gone into this movie. And here I though Keanu Reeves was only barely agile enough to surf (see Point Break)....Next, the special effects were... well, special. I don't think it will be a major spoiler to tell you that the freeze-frame panning effect made famous by a certain chinos ad is put to good --but not gratuitous-- use. When the time comes to break out the Silicon Graphics workstations' goodies, they are seamlessly integrated into the plot rather than thrust before us as if to apologize for the steep ticket prices in today's theaters.Ah, but then comes the good stuff: the Matrix itself. The plot's core premise HAS been done before, but not, in my recollection, to such striking effect and with such clever evasiveness during the build-up to disclosure. I am an old-school sci-fi buff; I thought, smugly, that I knew what was going on after the first thirty minutes... perhaps the greatest delight of The Matrix was my being proved wrong! I will come as close to a spoiler as I can by saying ""cyberpunk"" was NEVER so dark as this story!In closing, The Matrix is a well-crafted, gripping story starring two easily-disregarded principles who go far to prove that ""they're not just for breakfast anymore"". It comes alive through stunning visuals, a surprising premise, and a fast-paced ride to its conclusion. The only thing driving me to give it a 9 instead of a 10 is that NO ONE should be called ""The Chosen One"" in anymore movies, stories, novellas, epic poems, religious tracts, or political pamphlets! Ever again! PLEASE!The Mad Czar Fnord",The Matrix

If you're looking for an edge-of-your-seat techo-thriller, bursting at the seams with the latest special effects, then ""The Matrix"" is for you. I recommend the third-row. And if you're in that small (but proud) group that wants something to get the old brain saying ""What if...?"" then ""The Matrix"" is definitely for you. ""The Matrix"" is deep enough for Descartes, but chock-full of enough brain-candy to keep even the most distractible viewer glued to his seat.

2904,ZazenBee,stunning and whoop-a**!,10,5 April 1999,"Better than T2, as good as Apocalypse Now, better than Dark City.  I have now seen it twice and will surely see it again in the theatre at least one more time.  I was fully entertained, no boring parts.  The music was perfectly selected.  This movie makes my top 10 list easily.  The effects, while cutting-edge, are not superior to the plot, the style, the cinematography, or the action scenes. Oodles of scenes that will make you say ""How the hell did they film THAT!?""  If you like martial arts, this is simply tantalizing.  If you like existentialism, this movie will more than satisfy.  If you are into hard-core whoop-a** action, few better movies exist.  This movie is so well made, I felt that my ticket price was so cheap, I would pay to see it 5 more times and feel like I got a bargain. The few conceptual flaws, which I root out of every movie, are inconsequential and detract nothing from the flick.  Keanu's agent should get a huge raise, for he could have done nothing better to redeem Keanu's reputation.  Keanu's typical dead-pan and poor acting are actually ideal for this role.

2907,_LiQUiD_,visually a geiger-esque modern day Blade Runner..and far more,10,5 April 1999,The Matrix portrays a futuristic concept that forces its audience to question his/her reality. It doesn't serve up a mere effect ridden action flick on a platter but rather brings the audience on a fantastic ride that leaves the special effects coming in second to a profound storyline that will leave you breathless.

The trailer did a really good job of not giving away ANYTHING about the movie, which is why I was really skeptical about seeing it... it looked like a bunch of random fight scenes with some f/x thrown in.  But it was really cool, even though the plot was very inspired.  It's one of those movies that you can watch again and again and notice new stuff each time.

With amazing special effects and a sound track that still has me reeling this film is top quality.  The costumes were especially well done and the characters had a sence of realism to them that is not commonly found in films today.   Small things hidden in the movie make return visits even more entertaining as the viewer catches something new each visit.   On my list of movies The Matrix takes a close second to Braveheart.   A must see.,The Matrix
2912,Trinity-10,The Matrix Rocks!!,10,7 April 1999,The Matrix is so Awesome!!! For those of you who haven't seen it hurry up! The special effects kicks a** and so do the actors! You have to see it to believe it! Prepare to get blown away!,The Matrix
2913,Artemis-14,Amazing,9,7 April 1999,"As was written previously, this movie borrows a bit. HOWEVER, the package this movie wraps everything together in is phenomenal. The music, the action, and most definitely the thought provoking plot of this movie make it worth seeing multiple times. I have had dreams that were probably some of the most bizarre that have ever been dreamed, but this went well beyond those. Also, there are aspects in this movie other than the plot that require thought. Some of the names and symbology have an underlying theme. Bravo to a movie for thinking people who like a little KILLER action and visual stimulation on the side!",The Matrix
2914,cyanid,A truly amazing movie you will remember...,10,10 April 1999,"What the Matrix is I cannot tell.. but what I can tell you is that this movie is truly amazing. Brilliant actors, spectacular effects and a great story to go with that. The movie is so smart and well done it will hook you from the very beginning and make you want to watch it over and over again. Don't miss out this one or you'll miss something I assure you.. Classic already?",The Matrix
2915,Tamarind,Special Effects Extravaganza,8,7 April 1999,"So this is about the first movie I've seen in a good long time in which Keanu didn't manage to totally hose it up. The effects were impeccable, and the feel was a lot like I felt Dark City was trying to approach. All in all, worth the seven and a half bucks.",The Matrix
2916,Ahzkiker,"The Matrix, a damn fine movie, everything a movie should be.",10,11 April 1999,"I just have to comment on my favorite movie ever, in my opinion anyways. All the good comments about the films special effects and story have already been spoken for, so I'll just agree with that and have no need to add further on that. I also really enjoyed the directing of the movie by those Wachowski brothers. The way the soundtrack and film goes together, it's done so well, that sometimes you don't notice the sound, but its keeping you with the scene so well. I don't know if what I said makes sense, I just woke up and I'm not very alive right now. But The Matrix kicks A$$ in my book, i've seen it 6 times now in the past week, i'll make 8 today. And i don't ever see movies in this frequency.",The Matrix
2917,morpheus-32,Did I mention that I like this movie?,10,11 April 1999,"This movie kicks backside. I love this movie. Previously my favorite movie of the 90's was Dark City, but I enjoyed The Matrix alot more than DC. The special effects are fantastic, and it will be interesting to see how they line up against Star Wars  special effects. And an Aussie gets to play a big role in the movie!",The Matrix
2918,ianc,Exceptional,10,8 April 1999,"Some Sci-Fi purists may claim that there is nothing new to the concept of ""The Matrix"", that it can be synopsised as a derivative of previous works... While this may be strictly true (I'm not such an avid sci-fi junkie to qualatively say either way) the reason for this comment's prevalence in reviews is, in my opinion, because the film has no other negative aspect. The plot has an astounding scope, the cinematography and imagery is top-notch, the special effects and CGI seamless to the point where after the first 30min, you fail to notice them at all...  And the direction is outstanding.  This is a well paced, albeit slightly long masterpiece of modern day science fiction that I'd recommend to anyone as one of the top 5 movies to see this year.",The Matrix
2919,Muad'ib,"At last, BLADE RUNNER has a good cyberpunk movie companion!",8,9 April 1999,"This movie will change Sci-Fi as we know it. Ironic that its released in the same year as PHANTOM MENACE, by two relative unknowns, Los Bros. Wachowski. But despite Episode One, I still think this is the movie that is sparking the most word-of-mouth around the water cooler.  Never before seen, inventive FX, strong themes, some say rehashed, but still made fresh and different.  Exciting leads, perfect casting (Fishburne, as always, magnetic; Moss was icy cool, strong;your villain defines your heroes, and Weaving was superbly evil, but also defined himself and why Agents do what they do;lastly, Reeves always handled the physical roles well, but he also emoted, showed a little of himself in scenes, something we hadn't seen in a while.  Good films and good directing brings out the best in you.  In the words of Morpheus, ""You must experience the MATRIX for yourself!"".",The Matrix
2920,sveta-4,Superb,10,12 April 1999,"The Matrix is one of the best movies ever made. It combines incredibly involved and intriguing script with outstanding visual effects. The Matrix makes you stop and think about your own life and questions that bother all of us ""what is real?"" The martial arts scenes are probably the best ever done by western actors--Bravo! Keanu Reeves (and I am not even a fan). They can be comparable only to Bruce Lee and Jackie Chan. I guarantee that it will become one of your favorite movies",The Matrix
2921,DSP,thats nice!,10,10 April 1999,"The Matrix is by far the best science fiction movie I have ever seen. I usually don't like them, but this movie was the best. The graphics were great, the soundtrack rocks (literally), and anyone who hasn't seen it, should.",The Matrix
2922,dibber,"""...You have to see it for yourself.""",10,11 April 1999,"Wow.  This is definitely my new all-time favorite film.  It's the fantasy of ""The Never-Ending Story"" mixed with the techno-thrills aspects of ""Hackers,"" the hair-raising science-fiction qualities of ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" that made us really made us wonder whether computers could be our evolutionary successors, the special effects that made ""Independence Day"" and ""Star Wars"" so intriguing, the combat that leaves us in awe of people like Jackie Chan, the dark elements of ""The Crow,"" and Lawrence Fishburne's sheer talent of being the ultimate ""badass.""  As others have said, this is a movie that needs to be seen at least twice to appreciate not only the immediately apparent qualities, but also the inherent complexities, hints, and foreshadowing that were all missed the first time as you were trying to figure things out.   Thought-provoking, indeed.  ""Episode I"" better be at least this good.",The Matrix
2923,Polish,Indeed the best movie I've seen this year.,9,11 April 1999,"Although the first hour was rather boring, the following hour of the movie was action packed, it makes up for all the action (or lack of) in the first part. This is a top movie. Great special effects, and great cast, make this movie a must see.Great if you love Sci-Fi movies, I do. 10/10 from me.",The Matrix
2924,nakai,One of the worst of the year,3,11 April 1999,"""Boring"" and ""who cares"" about sums up my feelings of this movie. Boring-I slept through some of it and I was awakened by the buzz of audience chatter through out the movie.  Everyone talks about it being derivative-Really- let me count the ways- Terminator II which I liked a lot- These guys must have seen Disney movies a hundred times each i.e. Alice, Cinderella, sleeping beauty, plus a lot of Roadrunner cartoons- and a lot of people are mentioning a Gap commercial! give me a break-please- Bombarding the senses does not make a great movie.Who cares-There was no characters I cared about or even knew anything about- no plot-no story-no nothing- an extremely clever cartoon-only- that's all folks.",The Matrix
2925,Yemanja,"*breathless* ""Whoaa""",10,14 April 1999,"To borrow a single word from the movie and using it with the same emotion, ""Whoaa...""",The Matrix
2926,Xavier-15,kicked ass,10,11 April 1999,"Not many films have impressed me lately, but this one really did. It was the best film so far this year. However, I do believe star wars - the phantom menace will beat it when it gets out. Meanwhile, I think I'm going to go watch this movie again. God it was good.",The Matrix
2927,Malanc,Good stuff.,10,11 April 1999,"Besides The Matrix, I haven't seen a movie that does a good job of ""waking you up"".  The Matrix offers an answer in the form of an analogy to the question:  Is there more to this life than the eye can see?  Besides being dazzled by special fx and thrilled by funky-tune slow-motion action, I was challenged by being asked where I stood on this planet.  Am I looking for the truth and fighting to inform others about it, or am I indulging myself and pretending that there may be nothing more than what I've been told. This movie explores many things:  Belief, fate, faith, hope, fear, power, etc.  It's all good stuff.  All these things were sort of brought together and, at least for me were, one by one, made sense of.",The Matrix
2928,Fabulous,'The Matrix'; a new name for logical thinking,10,13 April 1999,"A viewer looks for a good plot, good graphics, good acting, and overall a good show. Although 'The Matrix' does not entirely cover new ground, it gives it audience a tremendous plot, explosive graphics, award winning acting, and freakin' good show. It also gives you something to think about after the movie. 'The Matrix' asks us what we truly believe and what makes these beliefs true. 'It' is truly everywhere and in everyone. 'The Matrix' is the question that asks ""how real is what we deem real"". Only one person knows. And that person is...YOU; you are your own CHOSEN ONE.",The Matrix
2929,Whop2,A must see for everyone!!,10,11 April 1999,"When I saw this movie, the words HOLY COW came to mind.  The mind blowing action, the intense ideas thrown at you, and the sets aren't to shabby either.  This is a must see for everyone that has eyes to see it, and even then, have someone with eyes explain what is going on!  This is one of the best movies (and well acted) of Keanu Reeves since his run-in with a bus. And I don't think I've ever seen Laurence Fishburne this good.  I have never seen the beautiful Carrie-Anne Moss either until this, but she be fine by me. With an exciting cast of those above and a plethora of others, this is a movie that you should see even if you have to take off of school or work. See it more then once actually, I have (twice in three days actually). And when it comes out, I recommend that you buy it on laserdisk or DVD, because you will wear down the tape in a matter of days.",The Matrix
2930,Acid-8,Greatest Movie Since Dark City!,10,12 April 1999,"This movie was excellent. Andy Wachowski and Larry Wachowski are two of the greatest writers and directors I've seen in a long time. The shots were the best, the special effects were trippy, and mind-blowing, and the writing was intriguing and pure brilliance. Go see this movie. If you already have, go again.",The Matrix
2931,gurkin,"Excellent, Masterpiece, Awesome",10,13 April 1999,"Let me just say, I don't care if you are a person who doesn't like Sci-Fi or Action or Cyberspace because everyone MUST see this movie.  Forget everything you have ever seen before.  When I walked out of this movie I felt like I had just seen the invention of ""film"".  It is probably my new favorite movie.Granted every movie has it's little flaws, but in this one, the flaws are so minute that it's hardly even noticeable.    You MUST see this movie.  If you don't see it, you will be missing out on a masterpiece.  Make sure you see it in the theater first because if you didn't, it would be like wanting to get on a roller coaster, but instead of going to Disneyland, you get in your car and drive around really fast.  In other words, the Theater is the best venue to see this film (if your city has an IMAX and it is showing there, even better).",The Matrix
2932,ethan-21,Better than Star Wars,10,12 April 1999,"With all the Star Wars hype, this movie may be overlooked. I feel that it has an amazingly intricate plot, wonderful effects, and solid importance. I left the theatre with a glowing feeling after seeing a great hero emerge (Neo.) I never thought I would say that about Mr. Reeves in a film.This movie is amazing and well deserves its success.ET",The Matrix
2933,provirus,Superb,10,12 April 1999,"It was a very good movie. At the beginning we understand nothing, like the main character, and while the movie plays we begin to understand. It was so good that I want to buy it.Go see it!!!",The Matrix
2934,medieval,AI meets Nostradamus and the second coming.,10,13 April 1999,"Very cool story line.  Not being a religious person I was impressed by the ""Coming of the savior"" aspect of the story.  The prophecy of the ""Chosen One"" that would come to be born and would save all of mankind.This movie rocked!",The Matrix
2935,JOEL-43,"Beautifully filmed, with an actual thinking plot, with excellent cinematography.",10,14 April 1999,"For the first time in a long while a movie was made with thought.  A movie that made you think, and having to see it twice to get the whole picture.The special effects were outstanding, along with the cinematography and direction.  This movie was made with care...a 2.5 hour sci fi, kung fu, love story, that had everything for everyone.I am so glad someone is making real movies out there again, not like ""Armageddon""...a movie for the ""short attention span-mtv video edit generation"".My score a 10 out of 10. Awesome!",The Matrix
2936,subzero-9,"Absolutely, positively, definitely the best movie ever!",10,17 April 1999,"The Matrix has the best blend of sci-fi and action that I've seen in a long time. I am big sci-fi and action movie fan and an even bigger martial arts fan. The Matrix superbly mixes Star Wars and Mortal Kombat, adding in some Bruce Lee and Bruce Willis, topping it off with a little love interest. The special effects are so phenomenal they make Jurassic Park look prehistoric. The soundtrack rocks! Laurence Fishburne and Keanu Reeves are excellent in their respective teacher/apprentice roles. I almost never watch the same movie twice on it's original release, but I've already seen it twice! My eternal thanks goes out to The Wachowski Brothers as well as the rest of the cast and crew for reviving my movie going experience.",The Matrix
2937,vaultman,"The Matrix, one of the greatest movies ever!",10,19 April 1999,The special effects have been getting all the publicity about this film.  I feel that that was only one of the things that made this movie great. Granted with out them the movie would not be doing as well as it is but the story line is what really grabbed me.  It was a movie that made me think and not just sit there.  For a sci-fi movie to do that is amazing.  On top of that this is a movie that takes the terminator series to another level. This is a story line that could be true.  Every bit of it could be true.  I would encourage anyone to go and view this movie.,The Matrix
2938,hawthorn-2,A good video game commercial disguised as a terrible movie,1,14 April 1999,"I'm not sure why so many people were so impressed by this movie.  Story? Perhaps if you've never thought about realistic virtual reality, or dreamed you were a butterfly and wondered if you were a butterfly dreaming you were a man.  Then you might be blinded to the huge plot holes. But the script will fit wonderfully to its obvious destination: a video game surely on its way to stores right now.Perhaps the action sequences, if you're the type who likes violence video games so much you'd be happy to sit and watch someone else play one... over and over and over.  The camera tricks and effects were interesting once, but we've all seen them on TV already -- the commercial, in fact, is better than the movie.Certainly it wasn't the characters.  Only Morpheus had any kind of personality, which saved us from having to find out what the other actors might have been like if they'd been called on to act.  Keanu got two scenes that required acting (the kiss of life, and the epiphany), but he missed on both and just laid or stood there.  The rest of the movie, Neo was called The One, but he might have been The Zero -- other than a token reference to him having the trouble with authority figures all action heros are required by Hollywood Law to have (subtlely portrayed by having someone tell him ""you have trouble with authority figures, don't you?"") he had no character, making Keanu a great fit for him.William Gibson, save us!",The Matrix
2939,toc-3,A visual masterpiece,10,20 April 1999,"Although the story is little cliched and the premise a tad dodgy, this movie is a stunning visual rollercoster ride. The direction and style are so compelling that any defects in the story are quickly swept aside.One of the most enjoyable films Ive seen.",The Matrix
2940,eli-36,amazing,10,19 June 1999,the matrix is the most amazing movie i had ever seen in my entire life because its not a simple action movie (like the mummy) it got a complicated story base and a lot of great characters. keanu reeves is playing his best role yet and laurence fishborne is the greatest actor in the movie performing great actor skill he brought with him from the theater. carrie ane moss is as sexy as ever and hugo weaving is the ultimate bad guy. finally i recomended this film very much just go see it!!!!!!!!,The Matrix
2941,Ultra-2,One of the best movies I have ever seen,10,14 April 1999,Absolutely excellent special effects.  The story keeps you in the movie and makes you think to yourself that it could all really happen.  Great movie.,The Matrix
2942,SuPerMaN-22,"Basically awesome, and yeah.",10,14 April 1999,"First I was going to watch Twin Dragon, but the theathre which played the movie wasn't playing any movies and the time. And so I decide to watch The Matrix, And I am very glad that I didn't see Twin Dragon, because Matrix was so awesome,and the fighting scene is just wicked. I saw the movie like 12 times, and I will never get tired of it.",The Matrix
2943,Neo-45,I forgot to breathe...,10,25 April 1999,"The Matrix is one of the BEST science fiction movies ever made. The acting at times is just...acceptable and the story/plot has many elements that have been borrowed from other films, but, the Matrix executes the ideas in a far superior fashion. This movie is eye candy at its best. Every special effect will make your jaw hit the floor. The costumes are extremely stylish--I especially like the fact that the character ""Switch"" wears an all-white leather ensemble as opposed to the all-black outfits all the other characters wear. She stands out. Even Keanu Reeves couldn't sink this one. The action sequences are un-surpassed...the kung-fu is only out-done by perhaps some of Jackie Chan or Jet Li's work... There are some plot holes. But, the movie makes a great deal more sense the second or more times through, but you'll want to see it again for the visual effects. I love this movie. 10/10. Although I admit nothing is perfect, the sheer awe-inspiring effects have influenced my vote.",The Matrix
2944,vivi-14,"vinyl,guns and questioning reality....i like!!!",10,15 April 1999,"Incredible reality-bending effects, a Geiger-nightmare world and the ongoing human struggle to convince ourselves we are not slaves to our own creations, orchestrated to incredible industrial and drum and base and dressed in vinyl trench coats and steel toed stomping boots......cyber-industrial-paranoia-from hell.....I haven't had to scrape my jaw from the theatre floor like this since Dark City.......ddddddaaaammmnnnnnnnn!!!!!And one  more thing....I am very happy that Mr.Reeves has finally been able to break out of the Bill & Ted typecast....you go boy!!!!!!!",The Matrix
2945,Matrix02,....perfect!,10,15 April 1999,"It has to be the best sci-fi movie out there. Maybe even better then Star Wars. ""The Matrix"" has to at least beat ""Titantic"" in the box office. There is no movie out there that could outdo it. The plot and characters were perfect. The plot is very complicated and to me unpredictable. When I went to see this movie I thought,""well another predictable action movie without a plot."" But then afterwards I was so impressed that I was in awe of it for over an hour. I couldn't believe it! Somebody actually made a movie that literally made Star Wars look like a little kids movie.",The Matrix
2946,Nova-11,A sci-fi with many astonishing special effects scenes and an original plot,10,16 April 1999,"This is surely the sci-fi action thriller of the year. The superb acting skills of Keanu Reeves and Laurence Fishburne, combined with the fresh original plot created by Andy Wachowski and Larry Wachowski and the seam less special effects scenes created in Australia! Have united to form a movie to entertain all thrill seekers.",The Matrix
2947,MeliSimp,Truly amazing...,10,16 April 1999,"Never have I seen such a visually astounding movie.  The Wachowski brothers have found the perfect balance of special effects, action, and plot.  Each cast member brought a unique personality to the movie and cannot be replaced by anyone.  Keanu Reeves brings his dark sexy intelligent look, Carrie-Anne Moss shows us that a woman can definitely kick some butt and still be feminine, and Laurence Fishburne brings god-like wisdom.  If you have not seen this movie, I suggest you leave NOW, and The Matrix will have you too. Can't wait for the sequels.",The Matrix
2948,pcwace,A Sleeper of Epic Proportions,10,20 April 1999,"What first appeared to be a ""I'll wait till it comes out on video"" turned out to be the best sci-fi action flik since Terminator 2.. bar none.  The trailers simply don't do it justice.  Perhaps enhancing the trailers would have given the storyline away so I can see where they were coming from. This is definitely a word of mouth film.This movie immerses you into a plot that would otherwise be hard to swallow, even with an open mind.  The screenplay is simply brilliant, and the special effects, well, it's just never been done before.With it's techno-pop soundtrack, intense action and cool shades you can't miss with this one.  See it on the big screen before it's too late!",The Matrix
2949,C2Few,Excellent movie...Effects are unbelievable!,10,16 April 1999,Whether you are a computer buff or not the special effects of this movie will blow you away and leave you dazed.

2950,BHubbard,Best movie I've ever seen!,10,18 April 1999,"Ok, this is the best movie I've ever seen.  Its story really does make you wonder(and I know you have all wondered things like this before the movie) if something like the Matrix is real!  The whole movie is amazing, from the story straight down to the solid acting performance(especially my fav actress miss Carrie-Anne Moss[she's my favorite for a long time now]).  I like the special effects, especially the ""Bullet Time"" that John Gaeta did! I'll have seen it three times once Thurday comes around cause I'm seeing it again on Wednesday!!  Tremendous!",The Matrix

Ever played a cyberpunk-RPG? See this movie. Ideas galore! Dialogue to die for! Derivative? Arguably? Sparse? Possibly. Better than the sum of its borrowed parts?  You Betcha. Gonna see it again without a doubt.",The Matrix
2952,Spyridon,Incredible film!!!,10,19 April 1999,"I had very high expectations going into this film,  The Matrix blew them away!  It's as if they knew exactly what I would think was cool and made a film for MY viewing pleasure! I loved nearly every aspect of this film!  The Kung Fu fight scenes were some of the best I've ever seen (and I've seen a lot)!  Beautiful use of slow motion and sound effects.  Fantastic cinematography!  I can't wait to see what the Wachowski brothers next project will be.  A thoroughly enjoyable movie experience!",The Matrix

At first, I didn't really care about seeing the movie, I could've waited till it came out on video. But my dad suggested it, we saw it, and I was blown away. It's now my fav movie, I've seen it 4 whole times and 2 half times. I know almost every line and have two copies of the soundtrack. Unfortunatly no one can be told what the matrix is, you have to see it for yourself. So get out there and see it, you'll fall in love with all the characters.( and the fight scenes )",The Matrix
2954,ms sapp,A very insightful and entertaining cinematic adventure.,10,20 April 1999,"A welcome balance of talent and execution.  The story, acting, special effects and the music are well integrated; the pace of the film kept me engaged from beginning to end.  I've seen the movie twice with my husband and our 17 year old son.

This film raises many interesting questions, that require the movie to be seen over and over again to before finally getting an acceptable answer to them.Not since Johnny Mnemonic has Reeves been this good.  The movie give an interesting twist to what people perceive as life.",The Matrix
2956,mtr-4,I just don't get the hype.,4,22 April 1999,"While the individual pieces of this movie were well constructed, they weren't particularly well assembled.  The Matrix tried to be a deep, philosophical work, a techno-thriller and a Hong Kong action movie all in one.  The blend just didn't work for me.And the whole ""hovercraft"" flying around the undercity portion was completely gratuitous.",The Matrix
2957,al-171,Overrated!!,6,22 April 1999,"I really liked the storyline. Unfortunately, they could have done a lot more with it.  I felt like I was looking at a mixture of Jackie Chan and Chow Yung Fat (Replacement Killers) with a bit of True Lies and Sleeping Beauty added for good measure.  I don't mind violent movies, but this one was pushing violence for violence sake.  Special effects were technically good, but totally un-original (Look at the Replacement Killers for the bullets bouncing off the floor and True Lies for firing at a building floor from an airplane (Harrier jet for True Lies, helicopter for the Matrix...same difference (I preferred the Harrier).  This movie should have a rating between 6.1 and 6.5",The Matrix
2958,Dechavu,WOW!!!!!!!!!!!,9,24 April 1999,There's nothing I could say about this movie that could fully explain how awesome this movie was.

Too bad Keanu Reeves had to be in it though, but he does it ok really. I guess it is just those of us who still remember him ruining a perfectly good short story like Johnny Nmemonic.

2960,T-Bone-18,"Cyber lovers with a rebel attitude, you'll love this...",10,9 May 1999,"So finally another movie about the wonders of computers. Add that up with super special effects of the next millenium, combat and shut-em-up scenes Woo-Style, and a plot that i'm still trying to work out - and you've got a nice matrix of what is my choice for the best of intertainment in 1999. Keanu Reeves is doing pretty well in this, his baffled look is appropriate for the character of NEO (a.k.a. The ONE). After 45 min. you may find the movie slightly boring, and wonder where all the promised action is, but the last hour will pull you hair back if you're a cyberaction fan. I have only 4 words to say to you right now: GO SEE THIS MOVIE !...it is not real - that's just the way it is...",The Matrix

At least around here effects movies are not expected to have much in the way of story or characters, but the Matrix avoided both by introducing an edgy plot and some pretty decent characters.  I agree that while Keanu is not an incredible actor, he does have a good look and style, which actually worked well.  Laurence Fishburne was excellent, as always, and well casted.  Last comment:  I took my girlfriend to see this movie, and she actually got motion sick!  says something about the effects, in my opinion.",The Matrix
2962,Jebal,Not just the special effects,10,26 April 1999,"Yes, as it has been said, the special effects were wonderful in this movie. But also it must be said that this isn't just a treat for the eye to see; The Matrix, the first of an intended trilogy, is a potential concept that messes with your mind in a way no other movie has yet, in my opinion, been capable of.  The scientific possibilities presented in Jurassic Park, for example, are nothing compared with this, and the dark future lying in wait for the human race could be out there.  I shudder to think of it, as this brilliant movie makes it so real in its presentation of our blinded world.

I don't know what's wrong with some of the people who say the plot's too ""confusing"" to understand as I enjoyed it very much.

The only thing that was missing was true character development.  It was so fast paced, it seemed like the whole movie took place in a couple of real time days.

The idea behind the ""Matrix"" being a dream world, yadda yadda yadda was imaginative, but the story line to the movie didn't go anywhere. Seeing the second and third time, I actually noticed more and more, and it actually adds more to the movie.  For anyone who's seen it once and enjoyed it, I recommend watching it a second time.

Humans are slaves to the machines, living out their whole lives in cocoons where their biochemical energy is ""farmed"" to power the computers.  While their bodies are trapped in these cocoons, their minds are trapped in ""The Matrix,"" a hideously complex computer simulation of late 20th Century.  The humans live happy lives in this imagined world, ignorant of the true reality.But there are a handful of humans who live outside the Matrix.

This has become my favorite sci-fi film of current time.  I just really got attached to the film.  I thought the character interaction was really great.  This was the first film I have ever saw at the theater more than once.  I understand that Keenu Reeves is not the best actor but he was pretty good in the film.  They maybe could have picked someone better but I really think he fit in just right.  I really liked Lawrence as Morpheus. I have never heard of him until this film.  He was great with his acting. He is one who mostly carried the film.  Carrie as Trinity was also very impressive.  She did a wonderful job.  This movie not only had great special effects but a wonderful plot.  It was a good idea it makes you think that this could really happen.  I have seen Bound another Wachowski brother's film and loved it too.  These directors are beginning to be some of my all time favorites.  I am very anxious for a sequel but hope they will not screw it up as other sequels ruin the franchise like Batman & Robin.,The Matrix

It's a very creative vision that provides the viewer with a unique worldview as well as sensory stimulation. Some people don't like the movie, but there is no need to dwell on individual things that you wouldn't like.  As a whole the movie is just plain exciting!  Even if you don't like Keanu, just picture someone else playing his role.  Unique twists, intentionally vague concepts and creative writing backup the awesome special effects.  The soundtrack rocks, too. Although I would have preferred a little less Metal and a little more variance.",The Matrix
2980,Turnkey-2,"Somewhat flawed scientifically, but intriguing ideas",8,7 May 1999,"""Matrix"" was definitely thought-provoking.  I've been a hard-core science fiction fan since I was in my early teens, and am always glad to see a film which draws on some of the more complex ideas of the written genre, as opposed to stereotypical space operas.I did find a few faults with the underlying rationale for the AI exploitation of the human race, however.  Supposedly the machines had been almost entirely reliant on solar power (which I found a dubious premise to begin with), and then we're told that the perpetual smog has blocked out that power source, necessitating using people as living electrical generators/batteries.  The problem with that idea is that a human being (and indeed any form of biological life) requires energy input, and where are all those calories coming from?  There was mention of recycling the dead people and feeding them to the live ones, but even assuming 100% energy recapture efficiency (a practical impossibility), no more can be gotten out of the people than is being put in, and the machines' use of that power represents an external drain on the biological system.  Also, I'm afraid it's absurd to postulate (as the movie did) that Earth's interior could cool significantly over the course of a couple of hundred years in the absence of sunlight -- it would probably take closer to a couple of billion years.  After all, it's almost as hot down below nowadays as it was a couple of billion years ago, and the slow rate of heat loss by radiation into space has had a lot more to do with that than the influx of sunlight.These flaws didn't ruin the movie for me, because I could think of at least one better reason for the machines to be exploiting the human race in an even more horrific fashion.  For instance, the human brain is a much better computer in some ways than anything we're ever likely to build, and I can see how a new breed of artificial intelligences might want to use that processing power for its own purposes.  And since very little of our brain capacity is directly involved in conscious thought, I can see how the AIs might be content to use only the unconscious parts, or possibly every conscious effort by a human in the virtual world could actually be a processing activity for the benefit of the machines in a disguised, symbolic form.  Thus, rather than providing us with a virtual reality merely to keep us biologically functional, the VR could be part of the exploitation itself.For whatever purpose it might be done, the images of people being raised from birth obliviously socketed in endless hardware arrays will be with me for a long time.Of all the ideas presented in the movie, the one I found most intriguing in an intellectual sense was that even if we could be presented with a perfect, utopian virtual reality, our brains would reject it because the element of struggle against adversity would be missing.  And I wonder how at the end, the movie's hero could ever be sure that all his trials and seeming successes within the virtual world, and even the supposedly real external world, hadn't merely taken place in an even larger virtual reality.  How could he ever know that his ""real"" body wasn't still plugged in somewhere? For that matter, how can any of us ever know that ours aren't?  Descartes, who mused several hundred years ago about the dilemma of a person trapped by an ""evil genius"" in an imaginary world indistinguishable from a real one, would've appreciated ""Matrix,"" I'm sure.",The Matrix

Although I'm not a big Keanu Reeves fan, he sort of pulls it off in this movie.  The story, although slightly confusing at first, really came together, even though the ending came a little too quick and left me sitting there waiting for a more complete finish.

The audience was mostly mature and we surely laugh a lot. The following week my kids asked if we could see it again, so we went, seeing the movie for the second time made me realise the hidden subtleties; this time it was a very young audience at the theatre and they did not laugh much, for them it seems to be a more serious affair. To observe this was very interesting.What I like about the movie apart from the cast and the effects is the fact that the heroes look like everyday people, there is no glamour in them, they are good looking people, but normal; their clothes aren't very good, the buildings where they do their dealings don't look like mansions. I like the fact that the top guy is a black man, and that the tough guy is a girl, and that the hero is a bit dumb, and that the main computer/driver/operator looks very Latino!In general I don't like violent movies, with lots of guns and stuff like that; however, this movie blows the usage of those artifacts to such a level that cannot be viewed seriously.The story line reminds me of Teachings of Don Juan and all those books (Carlos Castaneda), which made me like the movie even more.Where is everything?

At the end of it I had to stay sit for a while and thing about it, and most probably I'll go back to see it in the next days. I don't want to say the film is perfect, no way (anyway what does perfect means) but it's very well done, it's a great synthesis of both sci-fi state of the art, movie special effects, and oneiric view of reality.

No matter how good or bad SWs is, The Matrix would've lost a lot of steam following it and The Mummy. As it is, now, I'm fully willing to go to the theater and take advantage of the long lines piling up behind those two theaters in order to squeeze through and put my bucks into seeing The Matrix a second time, something I haven't done since '77 for the original Star Wars film.If you've not seen it, DO IT! The Matrix is the perfect Sci-Fi/Dream-Reality movie.

The story is pretty familiar to most SF aficionados but we'll be seeing this style of film making well into the next decade.The story, though recycled, has a very savy post 90's spin to it that makes it entertaining as hell to most computer cognisati. Among other things it rationalizes deja vu as an online program change and reveals the darker side of intelligent ""agents"". Though it seems to have been dipped once too often in the Zen reflecting pool and been filtered through the crash course of ""The Hero with a Thousand Faces"" the story is still entertaining as well as worth listening to.So in synopsis, a really cool story with some of the finest film making art to come down the pike in a long stretch.",The Matrix

Laurence Fishburne and Carrie-Anne Moss are great too, and did a brillant job of making their characters interesting and appealing.But, aside of that, the most important thing is that there was a PLOT. And we're not just talking about any old piece of junk, the plot was GOOD.Why do I find this amazing, you ask? Well, in most of the action movies I've seen, the plot, if there WAS one, sucked (to put it VERY bluntly).Now, perhaps I'm being a bit demanding here, but I like movies to have good plots. That way you can really get INTO the story.The best movies are the ones in which you feel as though you are THERE, with the characters, experiencing all that's happening. The Matrix did all this, and managed to have TONS of action and mind-numbing graphics too.I was amazed that it was possible to cram all this into one movie.

Nothing could ever beat this film.How mind expanding, how thrilling. (anyway enough about me)This film was not only effective in its delivery of the story line but extremely tension and suspense creating in its camera shots. Technically this film was superb. The action shots were as clear as crystal. You know that sometimes, actually quite frequently in action films, the camera is always cutting the actor out of the frame slightly as the camera is trying to keep up with the actor? It didn't happen at all in this film. I would love to know how this flawless effect was achieved, so that i could interpret this effect into my film.I was very surprised to see Keanu Reeves again, i thought that the moment he said that he wanted to devote his time, no longer to film, but to his band Dogstar i gave up all hope of seeing him on the big screen again.Well that's what i think of the film 'The Matrix' forgive the childishness of my language, but i feel very strongly about this film.It brings up the question, ""What if this is actually the 'reality' that we are missing and maybe some of us will wake up in embryonic casings?'Thanks for reading - i'm a very lonely soul as you can tell.",The Matrix

Carrie-Anne Moss (Trinity) fitted in her role exactly. The roof chasing and the quality of the effects with a very good sound dressing , made this and all the actions scenes very realistic. At first i had the impression that we were in video game. Soon i realize the magic touch of the special effect team work. It was outstanding!!! Everything seemed so real, you could believe you were playing a part in this play. Laurence Fishburne (Morpheus) was imposing.He gives you the sense of safety and thrill at the same time.By far he was the key character of the movie. Keanu Reeves (Thomas A. Anderson/Neo)saw us for another time how promising actor can be ( that cold look in his eyes !). The Wachowski's gave us a new idea of the world to be (machines gathering energy from the people...).They saw us something new and possible to happen. Who knows...

3006,Antigone-3,The Matrix and Jung,9,31 May 1999,""". . . the unconscious, the matrix of dreams, has an independent function."" -- C.G. Jung. We could comfortably answer the question, ""What is the Matrix?"" by saying, ""The Matrix is the unconscious.""  Several times in his book, Dreams, Carl Jung refers to the unconscious as the matrix or the birthplace of dreams. The movie ""The Matrix"" is actually about Jung's idea of the collective unconscious, and there are many references to dreams in the movie which correlate directly with Jung's written material.Sigmund Freud said that the unconscious is a storehouse filled with repressed desires and fears, and that our unconscious dictates our behavior in ways of which we are unaware. However, Jung believed that, not only do we each have a personal unconscious, but we share in a collective unconscious, which is an ocean of cross-cultural archetypes (snakes, mother, Judas). He states that when we dream, our unconscious uses symbols both from everyday life and the archetypes to give us information about ourselves and our situations.  According to Jung, we must learn this symbolic language of dreams in order to decipher their meanings.When Morpheus offers Neo a choice between two pills, he holds one in each hand. The left side has, for thousands of years, symbolized evil while the right represented good.  Jung believed something different, he says that "".leftward movement is equivalent to a movement in the direction of the unconscious, whereas a movement to the right is 'correct' and aims at consciousness.""  He declares that the collective unconscious ""lies at a deeper level and is further removed from the conscious than the personal unconscious.""It is not a coincidence that Morpheus holds the blue pill in his left hand and the red pill in his right hand. He tells Neo, ""You take the blue pill and the story ends. You wake in your bed and you believe whatever you want to believe.""  What he is stating is, ""Take the left path and you will remain ignorant of the unconscious and its contents."" Then he explains that if Neo takes the red pill, he will stay in wonderland and be shown how ""deep the rabbit hole goes."" He actually means that if Neo follows the ""right"" path, he will become aware of his own personal unconscious as well as the deeper collective (rabbit hole).",The Matrix
3007,Pagoda,Once is not enough,10,3 June 1999,"The first time I saw The Matrix, on opening night, I entered the theater with no expectations.  I had seen its commercial during the Superbowl, and all I knew was that it starred Keanu Reeves and some really cool-looking effects.  Even though the people behind me were having a loud, in-depth conversation, it didn't bother me.  I thought, ""I came here to watch some cool effects, not listen to the story.""  I was not disappointed.  I was so dazzled by the look of the movie, that I didn't even notice that it actually had a story.  I came home and told my friends, ""Sure, it has no plot, but it's definitely worth seeing.""  I was unenlightened.Over the next few days, my husband kept bringing up ideas that were explored in the movie, biblical, literary, and cinematic references, etc, and I realized that I needed to see it again.  The second time, I experienced it, rather than just watched it.  I was enthralled.  Now I feel compelled to see it again about once a week, saying, ""I've got to see it one more time before it leaves the theaters for good!""  I'm up to 4 viewings now, seeing something new every time.",The Matrix

3009,Neo-79,I know what the Matrix is...,10,9 June 1999,"When I learned about ""The Matrix"" and first saw the trailer I was very suspicious and didn't know what to expect of the movie. I mean, I love Keanu Reeves but he screwed up more than one movie (including his other Cyberpunk-Thriller ""Johnny Mnemonic""). I also saw ""Assassins"" and ""Bound"" by the Wachowski Brothers (""Bound"" is a strange movie - while watching it I changed my mind few times - Do I like it or not?). In the end I wasn't sure if they could do this. But now I know... ""The Matrix"" is definitely the best Cyberpunk-Movie so far and for me one of the best Sci-Fi & Overall movies of all time. For a reallive-movie it also comes closest to an japanese Manga comic as possible. I really loves the Bullet-Time-Scenes. So now I know what the Matrix is - but how can one destroy it? Let's hope for a sequel...",The Matrix
3010,Mike-765,The Best Sci-Fi Action Kung-Fu Philosophical Allegory Out There (And It Stars Keanu Reeves (!)),10,9 June 1999,"In Hollywood, you get used to a certain way of things - the serious, critic-dependent movies are the ones that will make you think about key issues of our lives, while the shoot-em-up action flicks are supposedly there only for our entertainment.  This flick is the rarest of all birds - a movie that combines revolutionary special effects and the most incredible action sequences ever shot on film, with a strong plot about humanity's dependence on machines becoming reversed, the nature of reality, and the need for rebellion.The Matrix's strength above all is its refusal to talk down to its audience - it assumes you know a little about technology and/or philosophy before you walk in the door.  It is the thinking man's action movie - one that pulls you into a world remarkably like our own, then peels it back, layer after layer, showing you the world of the Matrix.The special effects are fantastic, both in their execution and their restraint - they are used only to undercut the intensity of one scene, or to showcase the otherworldly nature of the three main stars.Speaking of which, the stars of the show do their jobs exceedingly well. Laurence Fishburne plays the role of Morpheus with a type of detached calm, as one would expect from someone whom knows that what they see isn't real. Carrie-Anne Moss is the heart of the movie as Trinity, Morpheus's right-hand woman and a martial arts powerhouse to boot.  Hugo Weaving as Agent Smith does a perfect job as the villain - you hate him completly by the end of the movie, but love him for being so evil.  And questions about Keanu Reeve's worth as any kind of star are put to rest - he seems born to play the role of Neo, a man whom loses everything he ever had, and must relearn everything he's ever known.The Matrix is a movie I wouldn't hesitate to recommend to anyone.  It's a movie anyone can grasp, even if they only appreciate the action sequences, which don't seem shot on film so much as they seem painted (possibly due to the storyboards, which were drafted by comic book professionals - a trend I hope will continue.)  And for those who look deeper, there's a wealth of subtle shading to the story, which fleshes it out - and rewards repeat viewing by hiding many subtle details that you'd miss on the first go-around.  It's the type of movie that restores your faith in movies - that yes, you can combine great action with a great story, and that yes, you don't need to have name directors or actors to make it all fly.",The Matrix
3011,DEDLaw,Science and religious reality?,10,11 June 1999,"See this movie and wonder if it's real.  Is our world real or a dream? Look at the sky and wonder, ""Is that blue?  Or is what I consider to be blue seen by someone else as red?  How would I know if they refer to my red as blue?"". See the movie and they're the sorts of things you begin to wonder.  You may not know what existentialism is, but you'll be thinking existentially.Religious reality?  See ""The Matrix"" and draw the parallels between Neo and the Buddha, or Neo and Jesus Christ.  ""You are my saviour"", says one character in the film.Andy and Larry Wachowski will make you think with this intriguing science ""fiction"" movie and mix it up perfectly with some of the most mind-shattering action sequences computer animation will as yet allow.

Just when your brain is about to explode from trying to completely grasp the concept, a helicopter crashes into a building and there is fire and death and chaos.

3014,danny-92,Does it really get any better than this?,10,19 June 1999,"Would you take the red pill or the blue pill? Such a question of unknown life-changing capability has changed the lives, or the views of their lives of many individuals.A film with such mind-blowing power and complete and utter sense of rocking your every day normal lives needs a lot of explaining, so get this: What if our every day normal lives were really just a dream, and we are used as mere battery packs for the machine world. What if we were stored in gloop-filled incubators with long tubes down our heads? What if. that was the real world (whoa! as Keanu neatly puts it).Such an inventive masterpiece would have to come from the Australian's Wachowski Brothers (Andy and Larry), who co-wrote the screenplay for 'Assassins' in '95 and are responsible for nearly everything on 'The Matrix'. Not often does everything fit in, with an excellent cast and crew. Keanu Reeves' acting skills goes from wooden to quite flexible! Laurence Fishburne certainly proves he's still got it, and Carrie-Anne Moss plays a vital, convincing role as a leather-wearing cyber-space assistant.Thomas 'Neo' Anderson (Keanu Reeves), exec by day, hacker by night, gets contacted by a mysterious Morpheous (Laurence Fishburne) who wants to meet.One red tablet later, and he is in a dark, nuclear-filled sky planet, filled with E.M.P. scared creatures and unbelievable special effects.That's when the fascinating Chinese art of 'flo-mo' (when the camera freezes and spins around) kicks in. But that's not all they have to worry about. Agent Smith (fellow oz, Hugo Weaver) and other agents have the same ability as Neo and the gang and are very hostile.Add a million special effects, each superb and original in it's own way, excellent acting from the whole cast (especially Reeves and Fishburne), and definite room for a sequel or even a prequel.",The Matrix
3015,ChrisMDP,Your mind is in for a rollacoaster ride. Watch out Star Wars!,9,14 June 1999,"Over here in little old England, something of a storm is brewing. The streets have seemed strangely deserted of late, and people have a eerie expectancy about them. No, it's not 'That Film' (Star Wars Episode I doesn't come out over here until July 1999) - in fact, most people are watching the Matrix, which could be the biggest surprise smash of the year. Already proven its worth in the US box office, it had got myself and a few friends whipped up into something of a sci-fi frenzy with trailers spouting unprecedented camerawork and visual effects. We managed to get ourselves into a preview showing a day before the opening weekend. It cost a little more, but, oh boy. Was it worth it.The Matrix stars Keanu Reeves as Neo, a small-time software programmer by day, and a solitary computer-cracking software pirate by night. Apart from the occasional nightmare, nothing troubles Neo until a strange encounter with a woman (Trinity), and a nasty run-in with FBI-style agents force him to start asking questions - are his dreams real? Who is Morpheus? And just what is the Matrix? Confused yet? More I cannot say (you find out about 30 minutes in), except this: if this film is a rollacoaster, this far is the gentle climb up the first ramp to the top. Get ready for a whirlwind ride.Many people will go to see this film because of the gun-toting, spine-tingling effects shots. The camerawork is ground-breaking and un-surpassed. The 'Flo-mo' technology, used for clever spinning slow-motion shots, is surely set to be a regular feature on our movie screens due to the huge fat atmosphere it gives to stunts and explosion scenes. Others will love the superb kung-fu action scenes, practiced for months by the cast with a technique known as 'wire-fighting'. These scenes (I am assured by my Tae-Kwon-Do toting friend) are all genuinely performed and accurate to the art. Others will love the potent plot which, while admittedly recycled from hard-core sci-fi, is given a firm twist of freshness and is guaranteed to turn your head inside out at least twice during the film.For myself, I simply loved The Matrix because, well, it was so darn cool. From the the fantastic camera work and the impeccable fashion sense to the fresh, exciting plot, it looks set to be at least as popular over in the UK as it proved to be in the US. The faults were few and far between - an awkward romance and some slightly wooden ""Keanu moments"" being the only ones I can remember.But the minor niggles don't begin to mar the quality of the film. I came out of the theatre feeling at least a half foot taller for knowing something just about no-one else did - what the Matrix actually was. But, in the words of Morpheus: ""Unfortunately, no-one can be told what the Matrix actually is. You have to see it for yourself.""",The Matrix
3016,L0rd,This movie is just awful...,3,12 June 1999,"Damn, I just hate the ""The Matrix""! The only good visual effects are already shown in the trailer.

It showed enough to intrigue while revealing little.To everyone involved in the creation of this film - thank you. Thank you for not aiming for the ""lowest common denominator"" audience. I have rarely been this impressed with the art of movie-making.To Mr. Reeves, kudos for a strong performance. NEO's quiet depression (near suicidal, I thought) in the early scenes are affective without being obvious. The subtle nuances are fascinating - during NEO's boss' lecture (one can see suspicion of his surroundings even then) and also when being interrogated by the AGENTS. Particularly satisfying is the reaction to being exposed to a horrific reality, and the wondrous serenity at the moment when NEO finally, truly, believes. As for the physical training, it paid off; the fight sequences look fabulous.I wanted entertainment - I got it in a big way.",The Matrix

A good story with decent characterisation, Keanu Reeves best role for some time. Good supporting cast in particular the Men in Black lookalikes.Very atmospheric with good use of dark and light, reminded me of the pilot of Max Headroom.The effects need to be seen to be believed, but they do not steal the show like so many other films. The story can be a bit difficult to follow but perseverance is rewarded in the end.At 130+ mins it is a long film, be sure to visit a comfortable venue, but a good pace on the action and story telling holds the viewer from start to finish.10 out of 10 for an original slant on the ""computers take over the world"" theme.Will there be a sequel..........

The premise of the film - a variation on Pascal's Methodological Solipsism - was interesting, if one didn't look at the details too closely.The film's premise that the machines needed to keep human beings around to generate heat was simply ludicrous.Terminator One also dealt with man vs. machine and did so much more credibly.Still, despite the shaky premises upon which it was based it was still worth seeing on the big screen.",The Matrix

The basic idea of humans forced into an inhuman existence by their own creations is not a new one. (remember Terminator?)  Matrix just puts a more creative slant on the idea.  What makes this movie work for me is the basic idea that human beings can still triumph against inhuman/machine creations despite overwhelming odds and a deceptive reality.  The main character is young, handsome, and intelligent. This introduces an element of romance into the story, and that makes it even more exciting. I like the fact that he is willing to be a part of a team, even though he obviously is ""The One"" . Also, the comic book aspect of the movie enables you to suspend reality and emerse yourself in the story.  Lastly, I like the technical slant.  The idea of someone being able to manipulate a program with their mind is irresistible!",The Matrix

Keanu Reeves looks GREAT. In that wonderful black outfit of his, mmm, drooling garanteed. The fact that he doesn't make the most convincing hacker ever doesn't matter much AT ALL. And the special effects - wow. Trinity flying through the air, looking very, very cool. And the kungfu. Okay, Keanu does some stuff that would have sent you rolling on the floor if he didn't look so good, but on the whole, I thought the martial arts were great. And there's guns.

The one thing that made this film so cool is that they took slow motion to the extreme and you saw bullets flying throught the air, but the camera still seemed to move or rotate around the subject at a regular speed.  They did this with not one, but many dozens of cameras.  Because each frame was from a stationary camera, there was no blurring.

It never takes itself too seriously, and twists and turns unexpectedly, haven't had so much fun since the Usual Suspects or...ohhh.... Vertigo?All the characters are wonderfully underplayed (whether on purpose or not), the visual effects will astound, the plot will turn your brain inside out, and the script will have you thinking for weeks...Destined to be placed high in future Top 100s lists, see this film in the cinema while you can.

A movie has not such luxury. There are time contstraints, dangers of trying to do too much. The writers of 'The Matrix' do an outstanding job of tantalizing the imagination without burdening it with superfluous information. The visual effects are unparalleled in anything I've seen recently (sorry George--there was simply too much to see in TPM), and the presence of humor rounded out this film's combustibility. In addition, the blending of drag-down, knockout, kung-foo commando is very well-done. My one reservation (and the reason why I only gave the film a 9) is the non-conformity of the romance. It was gauche and heavy-handed.  The writers didn't need to dumb things down so much for the viewer. There were several intimations of what the Oracle had told Trinity, and they could have left things less implicit in the end...But in a movie where everything else is done so well, why complain? When all is said and done, I'd equate 'The Matrix' to the 'Ender's Game' of sci-fi novels.",The Matrix
3034,Citan,Keanu Reeves doesn't completely ruin the movie.,2,26 June 1999,"There have been, in the past, films from the science fiction genre that were brilliant & innovative, i.e. 2001 or Blade Runner. The Matrix, however, is more of an action flick than anything else.While it starts with an interesting storyline premise, the story and character development start to disappear about 30 minutes into the movie in favor of the more visually-appealing action scenes. While the eye candy is technically very well done, the actual content of the film slides into the background and eventually fades completely from sight. The one exception to this is Keanu Reeves' glaringly bad portrayal of the hero. His one-liner delivery and annoying poses made me groan in disgust several times. I would think that by now American audiences would have shunned him like the no-talent hack he is. Other performances range from pretty good (Hugo Weaving) to so-so (Carrie-Anne Moss) generally, but Laurence Fishburne's respectable ability is squandered in a role that is not worthy of him.In summary, if you like eye candy -and even I sometimes do- you may be able to enjoy The Matrix, if you completely ignore the main character.

From the first frame of film to the last scene where Reeves flies upwards into the sky you will find your self hooked.Every minute seems to bring a new revelation as Neo (Reeves) is plunged head-first (literally at one point) into the real world.  Other reviewers have compared The Matrix with Alice in Wonderland, and this analogy couldn't be more true.  Reeves plays the Alice charactor admirably well; as he discovers, in the most stylish way possible, that the world is not all it seems and that mankind is nothing more than a living battery to power our future computer controlled nemesis.The scary thing is that this could all be true.  The world as we know it could be nothing more than an illusion to keep us under control.  An excellent supporting cast of Carrie-Anne Moss and Laurence Fishburne help make the illusion seem real.

There is not one moment when you feel that none of this could be happening. This is a movie with action, special effects up the wazoo, and, unlike most action films, it has a superb and enveloping story. The story is somewhat far from everyday life, but that aspect is what makes this film so mystical and intriguing. The concept of the Matrix really makes you wonder if this could be a possibility.

In fact, I enjoyed it so much that I've already been to see it twice and -- yeah, I'm a square -- I've never done that before. Unless you're old and crusty, and/or terminally unhip, you'll love this movie.The central theme revolves around the state of human existence: reality, dream or -- for today's technologically fearless audiences -- virtual reality? A dream within a dream? And, if so, how do we break out? Is this deeply philosophical, hugely meaningful, or merely trite? We're in plot cliche territory. Now add a heavy ""good vs evil"" line and a biblical allegory on death and redemption -- not to mention ""the one"" -- and some love interest and... danger, danger Will Robinson. Sounds way hokey, right?Well, it ain't. I don't know how they pulled it off, but these Wachowski brothers have taken this basic concept and produced a stunning movie: a plot that is coherent, involving, and emotionally moving; a cool script; LOUD soundtrack; loads of great fight scenes; supercool special effects; and good acting (especially Hugo Weaving as Agent Smith, Laurence Fishburne as Morpheus, and -- surprise, surprise -- Keanu Reeves as Neo).This film is LONG, nearly 2 and a quarter hours, but I sat there and enjoyed every minute.

3046,hydro-3,totally breath taking,10,21 July 1999,"Wow, the work and detail they put into this movie was extravagant. The name of each main character in a story represented their attitude and outlook and foreshadowed what would become of them. The animation and graphics were awesome. Nice frames and use of camera tricks creating the illusions of different special effects. The basic outline and plot of the story was amazing in itself. It grabs you from the beginning and takes your mind on a wild ride of ""what if's."" Not only is it great entertainment, but you'll never look at life the same way again. All in all, -wonderful- movie. A definite 'gotta see.'",The Matrix

On the opposite of Mr Lucas, the makers of ""the Matrix"" succeeds in making a high tech future-vision that, in its obscureness, seems plausible. With very little publicity, it really got to me as fresh, new and smart, through all the computers and cyberpunk. It kept surprising me, and it grew on me for an hour after it was over. Seen it, loved it, bought the OST, recommending it.",The Matrix

Carie Anne Moss was great for this role. She started the movie on such a fast pace I was amazed.  The audiance also agreed with there ooos and awes.  The story line was also great.  Those who think it was weak and had no point are those who view life in certain boundarys.  They limit their imagination and don't realize how complex the story truly is.  The story kept me interested and the special effects blow me away.  I recommend it to anyone and everyone.

I don't usually like martial arts in the movies, but this time they were put together with talent, so they weren't boring. The movie really got the grip over me in the first minute and held tight till the very last picture. And as a final pick, the sound track was fabulous!!!!

Some ideas in the film ""the matrix"" about the reality were commented by a lot of people. I.E.: ""Is real the reality"", a book of Paul Watslawick.My impression of the film is the nice way that is interpreted the idea of the reality, and how that idea is communicated to the spectator. Many things are perfect, like the oracle, the matrix itself, the ""deja vu"", the name of the ship and in general all the names, the training programs and a lot more.I think:  Why they can't use cordless telephones to run out the matrix?This is a picture to see several times and to analyse a lot of things of it.Pd: Sorry by my poor english.",The Matrix

I love the fact that its purpose was purely to search and destroy, as so many action movies are.  I like the fact that it has a philosophical side to it that leaves it's viewers with something to think about besides people getting blown away, and buildings destroyed.  Also that in the end all we know is that the ""good guys"" were a step ahead, but there was no guarentee that they would win, so to speak.",The Matrix
3056,sylvana,"Why I liked ""The Matrix""...",10,26 August 1999,"First of all I liked the movie very much. Why? For several reasons. First, I generally like this kind of movies. Second, I personally enjoyed to 'catch out' subtleties and associations concerning other movies or books. Third, I liked the philosophy in the film, more even than the action scenes. And, fourth of the reasons is that I understand quite well the problems Mr. Anderson dealt with in his regular job :) The thing most amazing was that in this movie it was almost impossible to tell what is going to happen in the next minute... Some movies are perfectly predictable - this one is not. Almost. I would also make the end slightly different, but this one was also thrilling. Hugo Weaving is perfect in his role. The Wachowski team did some really good work. I feel afraid to wait for Matrix II - somehow I don't believe it is going to be as good as this one is. I hope, however, that I'm wrong.",The Matrix
3057,w_sdc_1,What makes 'The Matrix' the film of the decade,9,29 August 1999,"WARNING: CONTAINS SPOILERSForget about the screenplay, it's all about the effects`, they said. When I went to see the film at an exclusive midnight premiere I didn't know anything about the film. 136 minutes later I decided to never go to an exclusive midnight premiere again. The punishment was the knowledge that I would not be able to see the film again until its official screening one full week later. Somehow I survived. The story is mind-blowing and discusses a lot of essential questions about reality, everyday life, who each one of us is and who decided it that way.The protagonist, Thomas Andersen, not really satisfied with his existence as an average employee, finally gets the contact he had always been seeking. A group of matrix-resistant individuals share their knowledge about the matrix with him and furthermore tell him that he was chosen to put an end to that fake reality and free humankind from slavery by the machines. The exposition of the story and the characters is great. The film starts within the very first second but still leaves the viewer unsure about what really is going on. Is Thomas A. Anderson only dreaming? Or is he really Neo? Is Neo more than just a night-life name? Is Neo Thomas A. Andersons true identity? The way the story unfolds is thrilling and the turning points come with good timing. One of two weak points in the story comes when the writers-directors must get Neo to confront his antagonist. Trinity at that point has to play the poor part of bringing on the delay. The way we got to know her throughout the film makes it anything but convincing that she would start long talks at that rather delicate moment. Whoever wants to criticize Keanu Reeves for his acting probably has a problem with actors that don't show that they are acting while they are acting. He's not in flirtation with the audience or the critics while he's performing. He's too busy doing a great and extremely convincing job. I have never been a fan or something so please consider me as neutral. Lawrence Fishburne is the most charismatic Morpheus I could ever imagine, and the rest of the cast is the perfect choice also. Carrie-Anne Moss handles the extremes between the cool matrix-trinity and the sensitive reality-trinity impressively well. Stock music rarely works in movies but when Rage Against The Machine hit it after Neo flies away in the end, something just works. The Wachowski Brothers got me. I want to see their next movie. Right now.I don't see The Matrix as bringing on  easy answers. Every answer is followed by a question, and the one in the end only becomes the one because he chose himself to become the one. Nothing more, nothing less. While the matrix is all clean and colorful, reality is dirty and cold. The parts of the dialogue who deal with essential questions (like what is the matrix`) are brilliantly written. (There's just that other  thing that irritates me: when Morpheus tells Neo about how the machines got the power over humankind, he says humans darkened the sky so that the machines would stop working while the humans themselves  depended on the machines and therefore caused their own misery.  I always raise my left eyebrow when I see this part of the movie. Wouldn't it make more sense to say the irony comes from the fact that humans depend on the  sunlight and that way caused their own misery by darkening the sky? That analogy would work well with a lot of short-sighted actions humans have come up with over the centuries.) It's surprising to see subjects like this being discussed in a mainstream hollywood movie especially at that length. Since the Wachowski Brothers had troubles to get the project financed, it might not be that mainstream anyway. In fact, at least the outlook of the film is avant-garde. Ground-breaking camera-technology and breathtaking choreography of the fighting scenes team up with innovative direction. Neo's wake-up scene in the incubator, the showdown or the white room won't be forgotten so fast.Since the first human being was walking the planet, there have been speculations about what is real, if or how that might be proven, and what kind of consequences that might have. Therefore not too many themes could be more classical than the one of The Matrix. But it's not only classical, to some it might be scary: it invites us to see parallels in our world, igniting questions about who based on what kind of legitimacy- makes all the rules and how much power each of us has in that game. The choice of the theme and the way the theme is presented is what truly makes this film the first film of the next millennium. It already has entered movie history.",The Matrix
3058,Jakem,"A fine, well done movie, but lacking in areas",8,20 September 1999,"There has been a substantial buzz about this movie, and with good reason. The Matrix does an excellent job of wiring the audience into the movie, and then leading them on a thrill ride.  Allowing the audience to identify with the main character in all his glory and power, and to desire and lust after the Trinity character, athletic, intelligent, and attractive.  However, I believe the adrenaline generated by this movie (which was a great deal) shrouds some of the other issues.  Neo saved by the kiss of true love (trite and over used in the movie business).  Hitting the audience over the head with the implications instead of allowing the audience to come to the conclusion by themselves.  My friend accurately summed the movies popularity, in my opinion, by saying ""Every class of person loves to be cast as the hero"" and Neo appeals to the young tech heads of today along with the young athletes and rebels.  I believe the special effects were superb, but I believe the unveiling of the plot was a little brutal and lacking trust that the audience would be intelligent enough to draw it's own conclusions. Enjoy the movie, for it is truly a wonderful exhibition of the action/sci fi genre.",The Matrix

I think that The matrix is the best movie I have ever seen combining Sci-fi, action, drama and thriller. I liked the idea of computers taking over the world 'cause it's basically what is happening. The special effects and cinematography was excellent and, I think that , that is what  made The Matrix so special.",The Matrix

It is a special effect and an action showcase extravaganza of splintered, all-be-it cool, scenes of martial arts, chases and digital effects. In short, it's a roller coaster. All I truly needed to make this movie a ride was a hydraulic roller coaster simulator in my couch.Unfortunately as a movie, ""The Matrix"" falls apart. The script is plagued by cheesy one-liners (""Kansas is going bye-bye""? Puh-leeze!), plot discontinuity (such as why didn't the bad guys use powers they use later in the film at the very beginning of the movie which easily could have caught Trinity? The plot has quite a few big holes, but no plot spoilers here...) and a severe lack of characterization (as in, non-existent). The actors are miscast, especially the villains, who while look the part, deliver lines as if they were constipated monkeys. The directing, besides having the actors refrain from doing any acting, is basically sound, although they over did it on the slow motion a bit. The plot is supposed to be centered on Neo, a hacker trying to find out what is dream and what is reality. However, the character doesn't even practically exist. We have no back-story on him and no reason for his exploits except for the shallow explanation that he ""feels something that's not right with the world."" Except in the movie, Neo doesn't appear to feel anything. He seems nothing like the insomniac hacker risking all to search for the meaning of life that he's supposed to be.The sad part of it all is this thrill ride had so much potential as a movie. The ideas behind its premise are well thought out, and had the Wachowski bros. bothered taken the time, ""The Matrix"" could have pushed the bounds between fantasy and reality, man and machine, future and past. Instead, with its poorly written script, miscast actors who ruin any dialogue that actually had potential, and complete lack of characterization, this movie is good only for its special effects.",The Matrix

We are often so content living in our comfortable little lives, that we seldom take note of the little things that are quite out of place.  And when these ""anomalies"" do cross our paths, we tend to either ignore it or write it off as mistaken perception.

3070,spillo,A deep message in a really great film!,10,20 October 1999,"(Warning: light spoilers inside). I do love this film: action, plot and besides everything a story rich of wisdom.In fact it is a clear example of what is human being.  ""Man lives in jail"" says Morpheus to Neo.Man thinks to be integer and unique, but he is just MANY modules, MANY programs. Remember the fight between Morpheus and Neo or when Trinity learns to drive the helicopter. In those moments Neo and Trinity could use their mind, but usually what happens outside loads in our mind another program and we start acting according to that new program, and we think to be that new program: that is the jail.The Wachowski brothers show that there is the possibility to escape from the jail.There is the possibility to awake, to stop sleeping! (following a master - Morpheus -; inside a group - all the others -; through continuous training - like Neo in Nebuchadnezzar -; using the mind and not being used - like Morpheus when jumps over the skyscraper or like the baby with the spoon).And to succeed is necessary to die - and in fact Neo dies -; only after, he clearly sees ""The Matrix"" and starts to be free from it.The Matrix is a great film, and because of the deep message it has inside, that many people vibrate watching it.",The Matrix

One person said that this movie had bad acting and bad special effects. Bad special effects!? I'm not a giant fan of this CGI stuff but if you think the effects in this movie are bad you're blind (see the bullet-time scene again). The acting was great except for Keanu Reeves, but give him a break - he tried his best.The flaws I saw were not that important to other people, but almost ruined it for me. The violence was totally unrealistic. When people get shot they bleed, and out of the all the people that are shot in this movie I only saw one person bleed. Now I'm not all into seeing people getting mutilated when they get shot in movies, but I thought that needed to be shown. The only other thing was the characters always spoke in metaphors which can get VERY annoying after a while. Other than that you have a high quality movie with great action sequences, good acting, excellent special effects, and a great (but unoriginal) plot. You'll have a great time watching this movie.My rating: ***1/2 stars out of ****",The Matrix

With that said... The Matrix provides one of the most powerful symbols of Christ's return in a futuristic setting.  Writers of the matrix felt that to aid the the common movie goer, they would name one of the characters ""trinity.""  How convienient = )Such an odd name, but not out of context.  It becomes obvious that Keanu Reeves is the modern day Jesus Christ as he defies the laws of gravity, physics, and eventually reality.  As he gains support and training from his apostles, he becomes a powerful fighter in the attempt to free mankind from ultimate slavery.  He is the ""chosen one"" that will deliver us from slavery. He is saved by Trinity, who proves that love is the only power greater than all mankind.Consider how you view his actions carefully though.  As Keanu Reeves slaughters mindless SWAT agents he drives farther and farther from what one might consider to be the teachings of Jesus.  But, movies need audiences, and what could be better than the Son of God returning to a computerized world, freeing slaves and kicking some major booty.As an action flick The Matrix is unsurpassed... we get explosions, hand to hand combat, helicopters, and of course, guns, lots of guns.The only city left protected from the mechanical death...

They are way overdone and end up looking very childish, and we've seen these cheezy effects done a million times in commercials even though people may not realize it.All I've heard about this movie is how the effects are amazing, but I say if that is what you are looking for watch The Phantom Menace or The Mummy.

I love this film, and rate it a notch above some of the other great action films of our time (i.e., Terminator, Predator) because it has a really well thought out (although moderately unbelievable) story line.  A lot of thought provoking material, and some interesting subtleties. I've seen it 10 times (I don't usually watch a movie more than once), and I'll watch it a few more. Enjoy!",The Matrix

Keanu Reeves delivers his best performance yet with the possible exception of Speed.

The script is a 'wrapped up' version of Buddhist philosophy.In Buddhist philosophy, the world as we perceive it through our senses is merely an illusion. Nothing really exists as we perceive things to be. This is synonymous to 'The Matrix'. Neo who is 'The One' is synonymous to the The Buddha who has discovered the way to see things as they really are.'The Truth' is the truth of seeing things as they really are. 'The Training' is Vipassana or Insight Meditation whereby the mind is concentrated and trained to penetrate reality into its constituent components. 'The One', comes into his own when he experiences the constituents. That is when Neo sees the reality behind the facade.The scary thing is that we are living in a 'Matrix' (samsara). It is not in the future but has been with us since the dawn of time. However, there is light at the end of the tunnel as there is a way out.Nevertheless, it is a good film.",The Matrix

The chase scenes in the beginning (Trinity, the police and the Agent) are worth paying for the cinema ticket alone. The special ""Bullet Time"" effects could be the very tip of the iceberg which can unleash a whole new way of filming and camera angles.The government Lobby scene and the Kung-Fu scene unite Western and Eastern filming; all four leading characters (Neo, Trinity, Morpheus and Agent Smith) trained for 5 months with a group of Hong Kong martial arts trainers and wirestunt-stunt men to allow them to attain the ""natural"" grace and ability of Kung-Fu. It's not about how well the actor/ress APPEARS to fight, it's about how well the actor/ress KNOWS how to fight.

It doesn't seem like it could happen, but this film is different, somehow.  I can't explain it.  Also, the idea that the movie presents is shockingly plausible. Although, I doubt it, I'm always on the lookout for agents.  If you don't gather anything from the movie, at least get this.  Do not try and bend the spoon. That's impossible.

3114,spoon43,Multi-layered Masterpiece,10,19 February 2000,"When I first saw this film I came out ecstatic. I've seen the film dozens of times since then and my original impression remains.  The film operates on so many levels and is so intricately woven that it withstands such scrutiny. Of course it has its faults, but like its merits, they are entirely dependent on the viewer's point of view.  I kept my mouth shut upon exiting the theatre for the first time, and sure enough, all of my companions praised it, but each for different reasons.  The film acts very much like a mirror in that way: each viewer seems to pick up on the themes that resonate with them the most.  I, for one, relate to the notion that reality is entirely subjective... the world IS as we think it is.  (that, and Carrie-Anne Moss rocks...)",The Matrix

There are so many aspects in the movie one of which I think is the awareness of what is our innerself and God.The movie changes its dimension when neo meets morpheous and the turn is so fantasised that people would think,whats going on?I think the movie is very much a must see and those who havent seen it so far I think they have missed one of the great masterpieces of the century.",The Matrix

The story of The Matrix was not very original, but bent so it feels like something new.  Anyone who has seen Dark City will probably be interested in seeing The Matrix.  The acting was good.  The Wachowski brothers has the talent that John Woo has...They can make anyone look cool, and the outcome is evident in 'The Matrix'.The special effects are you best I've seen.  'Bullet Time', as what the directors call it, is very impressive.  There is nothing like bullet time.

Sure the special effects are great, the sound track rocks, and the martial arts are the best, but what really sets this movie apart is the plot. I'm a practitioner of Buddhist meditation and this movie is like a metaphor for life. In a way, we are all asleep in the matrix of our own minds. Few actually wake up to 'reality'.

Endure if you can.The first time I saw this was with my girlfriend and I was very sleepy at the time but I had to see this movie.  I did nod off a few times throughout the experience and still thought that I had come away with the story.  My first impression was that the special effects were really good and the acting was equally good.  The plot, uh, whatever was my opinion.  Another impression was that the combination of the soundtrack with the action scenes of the movie were especially impressive.My second and third times watching the movie left me with so much more.  I found the plot to be very thought provoking and the characters to be even more likeable than the previous time I saw The Matrix.  All, and I mean all of the actors in this movie contribute the artistic success of this movie. My overall impression is that I'm sure that this is one of the best movies made.  Ever.Lastly, I've noticed a lot of the negative comments I've read about The Matrix are very similar to my first viewing of this film, that its only quality was the special effects.  If the special effects are all you got from this movie then take it from someone who knows.  You need to see this movie again.

Boasting mind-boggling special effects, some of the most adrenaline-pumping action sequences ever committed to film and an ingenious storyline, The Matrix is arguably one of the best Science Fiction movies ever made. It stands up to multiple viewings, and has to be seen at least a second time to be fully appreciated.

3141,andrew01,"The Matrix, what a waste of time",1,9 August 2000,"Wow. After all that this movie was hyped up, I was greatly disappointed. But what did I expect.This movie is typical of the garbage Hollywood churns out, and how typical of the blind masses to eat it all up. There are massive plot loopholes one could drive a truck through (Someone please explain to me, when in this ""virtual world"", why do they need a phone to get out? That's like saying ""Quick, we need to touch a dog to get out of the matrix!)I have never once in my life seen so many good looking computer geeks. All so stylishly dressed as well, but then again, this is a definite ""style over content"" movie, with black clothes being so popular, it's no wonder the producer wanted people decked out head to toe in trenchcoats. After all, why bother to write a decent storyline when you can just fake it, put in lots of ""great"" special effects, trendy costumes, ""l33t computer H@xors"" and have it sell on these points alone? Sorry, not good enough for me.This movie is plain bad, from the moment it starts right up to the moment it ends, with all the blatant overacting inbetween.If you are one of those people that doesn't like to think when they watch a movie, (and no people, that whole ""Oh the Matrix makes you WONDER"" line is just lame, stop it) you'll love this. If you are one of those people that aren't swayed by pretty lights and fancy special effects used to wow most audiences, stay well clear of this.",The Matrix

I personally enjoy stylish all out action movies or smart well written movies with heavy character developement and an intriguing storyline that maintain your interest and challenge your mind!! Unfortunately you very rarely find them both in the same film!! That is why I found this movie so entertaining it delivered on both counts ,brilliantly acted by everyone even Keanu ( yeah Keanu who would have thought totally caught me off guard!!!!)

It didn't help that his charactor was a 1 dimensional cardboard cutout.",The Matrix
3149,mst_crow5429,"An Awful, Awful Movie",3,9 January 2003,"This is one of those movies who relies on two-thirds special F/X, mixed with one-third references to classical literature and Judeo-Christian mythology, with near zero coherence.  Unfortunately, this is almost always nearly enough to dupe the public, which is by and large amazingly stupid and take any sprinkling of metaphysical rumination as the work of a genius, as long as it has enough explosions and ickiness mixed in.  The Matrix stars Keanu Reeves as a Block of Wood, or the other way around, being equally valid. Keanu Reeves, as Neo, or Jesus Christ, Techno-Savior, with Trinity, Mary aka ""the Virgin""/Mary Magdalene aka ""the whore.""  (Maybe someone had a bit of Freud going on, mother is the saint, but also the whore?  Same first name, you notice.)  Also, the Holy Black Man, Morpheus, who may or may not represent God or the Holy Ghost, and a generic Judas, who seeks wealth/power through the destruction of Keanu/Christ.  So basically, all that has been done is take the amendment to the Bible (the New and Improved Testament), slap on a lacquer of nihilism, technology, and explosions, no acting ability from the majority of the cast, a handful of plot holes, a reference to ""Alice in Wonderland,"" and you have ""The Matrix,"" the movie that succeeded mainly because it's on the same level as the general public, which is pretty sad.  However, there is a positive side to this entire SFX debacle.  Hugu Weaving, who just somehow manages to be so sexy and cool, especially in his outfit.",The Matrix
3150,CoyotePuma,Great special effects,7,3 November 2000,"THE MATRIX is a great special-effects movie, setting a higher standard for future releases.  It was for this reason alone I purchased its DVD. Casting, on the other hand, I found to be weak, its leading roles unable to draw on the significant elements of the story.  In this, I failed to sense the peril of a society held hostage in a virtual reality.  Keanu Reeves, as Neo, adds to my disbelief by neither portraying a knowledgeable computer hacker or a savior of humanity.  Laurence Fishburne, as Morpheus, faired little better as a mentor or a zealot..  If there was an emotional highlight in the film's presentation, it must have been the acting of Carrie-Anne Moss.  Her characterization of Trinity showed the loyalty to their cause and the sense of underlying fear needed to make her rebel character believable.Whatever the problems I found with THE MATRIX, watching a new generation of special-effects debut was pure enjoyment.  Future productions will have to reach even higher into our imagination than ever before to match THE MATRIX. Simple copying of its techniques will never produce that sense of wonder found in their first-viewing.",The Matrix

The Matrix wasn't one of them.  It is pretty hard to make a boring action movie, but the Matrix was successful.  The only reason I go to action movies is to see someone bust some heads, and watching the same three bad guys that look exactly the same get beat up over and over got really old after the second time.  All that computer stuff looked really neat on the trailers but I felt let down when I saw the movie because I had seen all the ""cool"" parts already.

Reeves has a great performance mostly due to the casting, which called for a clue-less heroic, that Reeves is very good at.  The special effects were one of the best portion of this film, they were visually great and revolutionary to the industry.  One of my favorite things about the making of this film is that the martial arts scenes were not complete acting.  I loved that the actors were schooled for about 2 months to make it much more believable.  The music throughout the film was also great, being hip and exciting.  Overall I loved this film and cannot see it too many times.",The Matrix

Reality is the only what we see and feel.We can understand the movie in different ways. You will see what you emphasize.

I've been making these thoughts for since i can remember my self....Can this be true?? The scenario is brilliant and the effects are ahead of it's time no wonder why so many films replicated them afterward. This film moved into position No1 in my top film list the moment after he took that pill, it was like i took it. Sci-fi films will never be the same again for me, it's hard having to compare this film with any other sci-fi movie.This one has the best surprise factor ever , and believe me i figured out from the start what was happening in the (awfull) ""Sixth Sense"" Film.

The visual effects are very well done, but the film has an artistic quality that makes it worth watching a second time around just to take in the artistry.  Look at the street scenes (eg. fire-escapes against building) some beautiful almost gothic imagery at times.  Look at the colour and textures of the interior sets.  There are also some curious camera angles; vertical sideways views which help to make this film distinctive.  The music is well chosen.  As the film develops to its climax and a siege ensues, there is much gunfire in the foyer of a building.  The amount of gunfire is a little over the top (but it's a movie after all), but listen to the music, if you can.  The piece was so well chosen.  Looking forward to Matrix 2.",The Matrix

There are a lot of fist fights and shootouts here, but there's almost no blood and nothing graphic is ever shown. The violence in this film is stylized and intense, but is still easily within PG-13 territory. Moderate coarse language is used throughout the film, including the s-word. The music during the closing credits includes a song with stronger language (though this will go unnoticed by most viewers). There are two drug references and one sexual innuendo, but those are closer to PG than R. The film has positive main characters who are willing to sacrifice themselves to save others (though there is one rotten apple in the bunch), and the film contains a lot of thought-provoking philosophical content that will interest intelligent viewers.",The Matrix

Believe me or not this is the truth.,10,18 June 2019,"My English is not good enough, I know and I apologize for my limited words and language skills, but I tried my best.When 1999's I was only 8 years old. Because of this movie my brain just got burnt and I became a Computer Engineer.
After this movie I dig into this life and I tried to understand the Universe, Humans, Animals, Computers, Relegions and I was just 8 years old. I started dive into encyclopedias because world was not meet to internet yet. Computer's was expensive and internet was empty. There was only few web site's and I still followed and I became a Computer Engineer.Today I'm 28 years old and also today I have watched again. After 20 years this movie still is the best movie I've ever seen. It's a life changer. It's a guide, It's a proof...
One way or another humans lives in their brains and all we have just the bioelectric. When we die do you know where it goes? When we got an accident we can lost some of our memorys, or we can lose all of it right? How is that possible if they written in our brain?
Then its just means our memory works like Computer memory. When electricty gone you will forgot everything you remember.
Humans tries to not believe that. People are afraid of being destroyed and they prefer instead to suffer in hell because they want to be exist somehow!
Then tell me if you can lose all of your memory with a simple accident then how you can be exist when plugs out?
YES! There will be an cloud backup system created by god! It must be right? We dont know anything about it!All the books allegedly sent by god are foolish. They all written by humans to control humans. They all are stories!
After 2019 years Jesus and 1448 years Muhammed we have now Technology. If GOD wants to make us a beliver then can do this right now with a simple move! I can not believe after 2019 years! Because I saw nothing!All this books just tries to make you believe to something actually doesn't exist and because of that all of the written religion books attacks to humans like ;
""To be a believer or burn you son of .itch! I'm exist believe me! Look what i did to non-believers! Do you want to become like them? If you dont believe me I will show you who I am!"" Wait what? It suppose a joke! If not then I will prefer to not believe. GOD can not be that simple!Have you ever heard such a ridiculous desire and threat in your life?
Why would a god need you?
To prove himself to something he has created? Atleast what 'Kur'an, Bible, Torah, Psalter"" says that I'm not. Go read it if you won't believe me!End of the day I Dont know anything about this universe. Like agent Smith says ""its like a Zoo"".We're unique! We're strange! We are a combination of different cells
and everything that makes us; We are a few pieces of code written in our DNA. Such a complex piece of code is in a sperm and that is too small to see with your eyes! But sperm will not become something without the ovary! This issue is just like the following question;
""which came first; the chicken or the egg?""Who created the planet? who has been running the solar system for so many years? Just explain me science; what the hack is Virus? How it can live almost forever without doing or eating anything? How they can activate their selves when we got they in our system?
There must be an architect! Who wrote all the different awesome codes? Also the codes has some failures sometimes right? People can born with missing body parts or something else. Maybe we just broke it or maybe its GOD program failure? This brings us a new question:Did GOD created only first base code or is he still playing with our DNA?
If GOD still do not play with our DNA then its mean we're not special! We're just duplicated DNA's with combination other DNA's like dogs.
And today human can barely change DNA or dublicate a goat.We don't know anything right?
We even can not imagine! We can not even describe all of it!
There must be something bigger and smarter then us!I don't think the architect is involved or communicating with us. He's just watching and enjoying. Perhaps God only takes the most valuable of us and let others go to the trash. It makes sense! I would do that. There are many unnecessary people. I can't stand listening and understanding as a human, how can God endure all of the stupitdy?Never surrender! Try to live your life while you can!",The Matrix
3171,GayJesus,Impressive...,8,7 February 2001,"I've seen it five times at the cinema, three times on video and twice on DVD. ""The Matrix"" is probably one of the best science fiction action movies to date. Borrowing fight/action choreography from Hong Kong cinema and drawing on camera work similar to that seen in ""Blade"", ""The Matrix"" fuses them together with awe inspiring special effects. Keanu's acting short falls are well hidden and the pot is well thought out.Most people will love this film, and rightly so, but if you are under the impression that these fight scenes are the pinnacle of cinematic achievement then I am afraid they still pale in comparison to Hong Kong offerings. If you do subscribe to this opinion then I would strongly advise you towards renting ""Drive directors cut"" from your local video store. You won't be sorry.",The Matrix

In my personal opinion, the special effects didn't age very well. The philosophical nuances that the Wachowski sisters added were very successful. There is no better example than the iconic scene where Morpheus offers Neo two pills, one red and one blue that symbolize uncomfortable truth or blissful ignorance. The action is brutal, even if you're not too fanatical. The cliché of the chosen one becomes very repetitive, but I can say in his favor that it was done in 1999 and this was not as exploited as now.

The philosophy of idealism(real meaning) here is nothing new to me, we do live in the Matrix. The fate part is wrong because unless you can change the past(knowing the future counts) then people will only be able to do what they actually end up doing or else its not actually fate. I guess if you never read books and only watch art movies then Matrix would have new concepts for you. I can't confirm but the movie seems to be a ripoff of a better movie called the dark city and a classic novel VALIS. I'm disappointed though that the ""real world"" in the movie is just the same the Matrix world, instead of having it be beyond our comprehension or some crazy stuff. Then it gets into a dull action sequence lasting the rest of the movie with awful slowmotion, camera rotating and guys flying around. Also I thought this as a kid and I still think it now, that Keanu Reeves is too slim to be an action hero and struggle with charisma. This movie also fails badly at doing martial arts compared to real martial art movies from Hong Kong. Also story is pretty power fantasy, although I'll give it that it doesn't really cringe worthy until the final scene. All the enemies are white men in this movie for some reason but the heroes are diverse. Movie is pretty good overall though given my expectation of hating it as with other movies of the decade.",The Matrix

Because of this to many deferent viewers can watch and enjoy it. the top layer is action with too many special effects (Matrix). the second layer is a Sci-fi movie that can nice for teenagers usually (Oracle). third layer that managed very smartly and hidden is triller (The Creator). that is the part of story can make deferent feel for viewers. the final layer is a deep philosophy and religionists part of story. due to my personal experiences just part of viewers that love this movie can get through to this layer, This is the Xion (Zion).",The Matrix

Revolutionary in its cinematography, the movie provides you with eye candy in more than one way.  The special effects are beautiful, to say the least.  The movie begins with you not really knowing whats going on, and your feelings are matched by what Neo is feeling.  Then you are drawn in for a wild ride of sci fi adventure.  Admittedly, the movie is not perfect, examples of this can be found in which characters live and die, and a few choice lines at the end of the movie.

I am not the biggest Keanna Reeves fan in the world, but he was a perfect fit in this role.  The Morpheus and Trinity characters were the real stars of this movie.  The main agent was a close 3.  It is the type of movie you can watch over and over and still enjoy.  The effects were truly astonishing.  Morpheus was the cool level headed leader played by Lawrence Fishborne.  Carrie-Anne moss was a real 10 in her opening scene leather outfit.  You see, you don't need a blonde with big fake bossoms to make a movie enjoyable (dont get me wrong, I'll take the blonde route too).  She just transmitted intelligence and beauty in this one.  And also the Agent had his intriguing ideosyncrasies that made you laugh.

And also, I forgot his name, but the one who betrays Morpheus...he could definitely be linked to Judah, when he betrayed Jesus.

This being my favourite movie, I can name few if any flaws in it, and I have much praise for the brilliant team of Andy & Larry Wachowski, who wrote and directed the movie.For some, the Matrix was just a great action/sci-fi flick, but I personally see so much more in it. Although the idea of artificial intelligence has been used before, The Matrix re-invents the idea very cleverly, and the concepts explored are new and actually quite thought-provoking.The special effects are amazing, with the bullet-time technology especially awesome (however I have to say that sending up the fight scenes in various comedic ways in other movies/TV shows is getting a little tired!).This movie is brilliant, so go have a look - even if just for an adrenalin rush and the special effects if the ideas in The Matrix are a little too weird for you!

3211,Charlieschaller4,Just another Keanu Reeves movie,6,23 January 2020,The Matrix starring the one and only Keanu Reeves with a sci-fi that will leave you on your feet on how to save the human plant and stop secret agents from killing off the world in the 90s the matrix is a movie that might be in your interest. In all the movie was a good film lots of positives was interesting and kept me engaged but it might not be for everybody as it shows a lot of negatives.The movie has a plot of a young man named Neo who is working an everyday job at a tech company and dealing off computer hacking cards we notice he just lives like any man trying to earn a little extra cash he then gets called to the Matrix as he is sent to a different place then his normal 90s life as he is in the Matrix. Now this movie is quite confusing at times I get lost in the plot you are going from the Matrix back to 90s time after time I get lost at times where the setting was and if they were in the Matrix. Now the acting is not the best I would say either now they do have some good actors who keep you entertained and intrigued in the movie. But in a couple of fight scenes we left in aw in how lame the kicks or punches were and how bad they did with some punches in kicks. But we get stunned by how bad Keanu Reeves facial expressions are during the whole film. He only has one face like looking at a man taking a poo in the toilet. In all the acting was decent besides some bad moments of seeing a Keanu Reeves poo face. It did do a good job and really carried the film to make me continue and watch it. The plot does confuse me a lot at times which does throw me off but you should give it a try and see how you think of it.Next thing was the outfits throughout the whole film as they show the people in the Matrix when they get sent back to the 90s they wear such plan easy to see clothes as they try and look discreet but really at the time of the film would be easy to be noticed they wear all black everything except for the one woman who we barely get to hear from throughout the whole film we just assume she is something special then? But overall was just said to see nothing cool and futuristic as it is a SCI-FI film! Now the soundtrack was quite good was great for fighting scenes keep us to watch the film even if the acting was not there but it was nice to hear. If you like simple outfits and a good soundtrack then I would recommend this movie to you.Overall was a movie I would rank a 6/10 which is decent for a sci-fi for me but it was still not as good as some of the older films that I had seen before this. Just know this film will draw you off to maybe check your phone for a call or a text as it might draw you away but trust me the acting will save it and the soundtrack otherwise it's lost like Forrest Gump tryna to find Jennie.,The Matrix

3219,ThewEiRdOne27,What is The Matrix? Greatness,10,24 July 2006,"I remember quite vividly when I first caught a glimpse of this movie a few years ago. Flipping through the channels on a hotel television, I came across the film during the final chase scene and, upon first glance, it made absolutely no sense. How was the guy being chased in two places at once? What were those creatures attacking that ship? What's with him stopping the bullets? Incidentally, I ran into this same spot two nights in a row.When I actually came around to seeing the entire movie (on television yet again) in sequence several years later, I began to realize how great it actually was. I must have watched all the replays each time I clicked on the television. This would later be coupled with my general love for the trilogy that spawned about a year ago at this time.I've seen some of the comments from people who disliked the movie. They either ""didn't get it"" or said it was ""overrated."" The latter has gained more prominence since everyone and their mom has spoofed the once unique ""Bullet Time"" sequence and the general themes of ""The Matrix"". It's kind of sad that the repetition of third parties has detracted from the masterpiece and brilliance of Bullet Time, which was a revolutionary piece of art. I still love watching it (along with the rest of the movie), and I wish I could go back in time to the day the movie was released just to sit with the audience and hear their reactions as Neo bent backwards, slowly dodging and weaving out of the way of the bullets. Beautiful.To further comment on the detractions of the film, I have to say that you either ""got it"" and loved the movie or sat there and hated it. There's no happy medium for this film it seems, though I don't think the Wachowski Brothers mind. To be honest, there are small flaws within the movie, but it never detracts from my viewing experience.But even with all the fight scenes and special effects, what's a movie without actors? Keanu Reeves (Neo/Thomas Anderson) is not someone you would normally pick to play heavy roles, and many can't get past Keanu's ""spaced"" demeanor. Sure, it's definitely a laugh to poke fun at it (""Whoa!""), but within the context of ""The Matrix"", he's perfect. Neo, as others have described him, is the Silent Buddha type: he'll lead more through his actions than with lengthy speeches. If Neo were completely confident, brash, and outspoken, it would be hard to root for him. Thank God Will Smith chose ""Wild Wild West"", eh? Laurence Fishburne embodies Morpheus, the cool-headed leader with the greatest of faith in the prophecy of the One. Morpheus is brought to life by Fishburne and it's hard to imagine anyone else trying to fill that role. The same goes for Carrie-Ann Moss, who convinced me as Trinity that she can and most likely WILL kick your ass, whether you like it or not. Furthermore, she compliments Keanu's laid back style with her own intense approach. I suppose that's why, within the film, Trinity is drawn to Neo.To be honest, Hugo Weaving should get more credit for his role as Agent Smith. Smith helps carry the weight of the second half of the film along with Neo. Weaving effectively gives the Agent his confident, silently-smirking-at-you-constantly demeanor that parallels Neo's character. Much of the appeal of ""The Matrix"" undoubtedly comes from Weaving's performance in terms of mass media. If you put on a black suit with shades, almost everyone knows who you are.The most underrated performance is that of the late Gloria Foster, who portrays The Oracle. She absolutely nails down the character of the all-knowing, disarming grandmotherly woman who is not only witty, but also blunt and to the point. The scene where The Oracle and Neo meet is a very nice exchange, with each actor carrying their own parts appropriately.The best scene? Boy, that's a tough one. I could pick almost any scene in the movie and say why it's good. The best dialogue scenes would have to be either the interrogation with the Agents and Neo, Morpheus revealing in the Construct what the Matrix is, the before mentioned Oracle/Neo scene, or Smith's interrogation of Morpheus. And I'm just slimming down my list here, folks! The best action scene, I believe, is the subway showdown between Neo and Smith. Sure, the rooftop scene had the famous ""Bullet Time"" shot, and the helicopter ride was intense, but this sequence is one of THE best choreographed fight scenes I've ever seen. There are nice little touches, including the Old West-esquire showdown that occurs just prior to the fight. The Lobby Scene should not be forgotten either as it was a beautiful piece of cinematography.In the end, ""The Matrix"" is one of the greatest achievements in modern film making. It's not the greatest film of all time, but in the scope of science fiction, action films, and modern movies (within the last two decades), it ranks among the greats. ""The Matrix"" sets the bar for future films of its type.",The Matrix

In my opinion, the movie has a single interest: its special effects! But when you have seen the best ones of them more than one hundred times before seeing the movie in the traders broadcasted 24h/24 at TV... The actors will not remain in my memory too; and the characters are all but deep (special award to Trinity, ridiculous).The scenario can seem original to those who don't know anything about science fiction.  The others will recognize topics taken from different films ;  the main idea of the movie, the matrix, is close to the usual topics from novels of Philip K Dick too (just read ""The three stigmatas of Palmer Eldritch""! for example).  Shortly, the scenario is not so strong as so many people are telling us, and if the initial idea is powerful, the screenwriters have probably rest after.My conclusion: if you like special effects, or if you don't know anything in Science Fiction, you can watch Matrix Else, watch Blade Runner, Existenz ... or even Star Wars.",The Matrix

3241,WalterEliasDisney,I don't think people realize how profound this movie really is,10,28 September 2009,"Having studied history, religion, philosophy and the secret teachings of the ancient world, I see so much more in The Matrix - than I did 10 years ago (when it first came out). The number of references to the ancient understanding of this world is overwhelming, and the message of the film is so immensely relevant to the world we live in today.As a famous writer once said ""All political theater is always bad, but all good theater is always political"". A great quote, which absolutely goes for the Matrix. I view the film as a GREAT metaphor to our society, set in the light of our history. The characters journey is well balanced, but at the same time, the profound message in it, hits you as a train, if you keep your eyes open.To keep it short. As I see it, the main message in The Matrix: Human beings are by the hour getting increasingly controlled, by a force difficult to define. The level of control, works through money, politics, governmental regulations, social rules, the media, and not to say the least, religious control. By this we give away our greatest asset, - our freedom, even the freedom freedom of thought. As Morpheus said, - A prison for your mind.As said by Morpheus ""What is the Matrix? Control! ... To keep us under control, and turn a human being into this"" - he shows Neo a battery.Thats what the system of today turns us into, a battery: A tax paying, dept controlled, obedient ""brick in the wall"". To break free, is ""the narrow path, and is not pleasant, as ""ignorance is bliss"". But the choice is up to you. The red or the blue pill? ""You will know, as I did.

Your money would be much better spent buying a homeless person lunch.Granted it seems mildly clever at first, but it is actually an underdeveloped story with a completely unsatisfactory resolution. Any comparison to Star Wars or the Lord of the Rings trilogy would an insult the clear superiority of Lucas or Jackson as both film makers and story tellers. I hope the people that profited so greatly from this film can find a way to do something with that money that is socially responsible. Having said all of that, acting was actually OK, though. And the only part of the story that makes the least bit of sense is that technology and artificial ""intelligence"" can be dangerous instead of helpful if abused.",The Matrix

3249,susmitaroyshoshi,The pioneer of cyberpunk movies.,8,16 September 2020,"Ask your self a question. What's the best si-fi cyberpunk action packed mind blowing motion slowing movie out there? Simple enough, it's The Matrix. As we all are suck at home kin this pandemic movies and series have become a great escape for us. As such many of us have started watching old movies again for the nostalgia. And when it comes to old moves ""The matrix"" was the most grossed R-rated film till 2016 when Deadpool took its place. Such a movie is a must watch for everyone for it has the person we love from the bottom of our heart as the main cast whom is none other than Keanu Reeves. So all the BREATH TAKING fans out there, do watch the franchise. The movie won't disappoint you. Its a rare and rich movie which will leave a rich aftertaste in your mouth. It is guaranteed to give you the best cyberpunk feel out there as it the the originator of the genera as well as the pioneer.The Matrix was filmed in 1999 so it has got fairy old CGI and edit considering it being a si-fi action film. The whole franchise is written and directed by the Wachowskis, starring Keanu Reeves, Laurence Fishburne, Carrie-Anne Moss, Hugo Weaving and Joe Pantoliano. The movie got its inspiration from Japanese Anime and martial arts films. Mainly the anime and manga known as ""Akira"" or ""ghost in the shell""
When the heroin Trinity is cornered by a police squad she manages to overpower them with super humane abilities and flees but soon to be pursued by mysterious agents with similar superhuman abilities. In the middle of the chase trinity answers a ringing phone in a phone booth and vanishes instantly.Meanwhile computer programmer Thomas Anderson feels that something was out of place in the world and was puzzled by the phrase ""the matrix"" which kept popping up in front of him ever so often. Trinity manages to contact Anderson and tells him that a guy named Morpheus knows all the answers to his questions. As a team of agents and police comes to search for Neo at his office, he soon gets captured by them. Despite Morpheus's attempt to guide Neo to safety via telephone. Undeterred, Neo later meets Morpheus, who offers him a choice between two pills, red to reveal the truth about the Matrix, and blue to return him to his former life. This is where we get the ever trending meme template from about a blue pill and a red pill. After Neo swallows the red pill, his reality falls apart, and he awakens in a liquid-filled pod among countless others attached to an elaborate electrical system. He is retrieved and brought aboard Morpheus's hovercraft. And so the journey of Neo the chosen one begins.
As someone slowly starts to watch the franchise ant emerges within the original world of the matrix they'll soon come to understand why the movie won 4 Oscars along with 37 other awards and 51 nominations.
That's why I recommend this movie downright to anyone who asks for a old si-fi movie recommendation. And we hope that the franchise will keep up its excellent and stunning work with the newest title coming out in 2022.",The Matrix

3263,finwiz,The first film of the new millennium,10,3 March 2005,"Perhaps the first postmodern movie to be enthusiastically embraced by the public, ""The Matrix"" has not only sold lots of DVD players, but also passed into our cultural mythology. Which all goes to show the power of a great story well told. On a first viewing, it seemed to me that the brothers Wachowski were trying for a Zen myth, but when they got to the crunch, they bailed and went with the tried and true Christ figure archetype. Perhaps it really is still the greatest story ever told.I'm sure that there are nitpickers out there who have totted down the film's supposed flaws and inconsistencies (as my wife says, ""another great adventure story ruined by kissing""), but even after several years and many, many viewings, I find the combination of the writing, the brilliant camera shots and the art direction to be really inspiring.

We've got people fighting machines that keep hostage other people who are encarcelated in oniric reality created and controlled by the machines. Things emphasized throughout the whole trilogy are THE CHOICE and THE BALANCE who in the end turn out to be essential to men and machines alike. Freedom of choice of men brings balance to machine's calculations. Nevertheless it is men who are subject to machines for the freedom of choice is in fact an illusion of men calculated by the machines. The whole thing ends up optimistic though - human nature proves to be uncontrollable. There's of course more.What is The Matrix to The Reality? For a moment think of those who shape your consciousness as of the machines that weave The Matrix. Who are they? Are they one of us? Are you sure? Where do your options of choice come from? Are these the only ones? Is your choice actually YOURS? If not, what does it make of you? - Nothing but a CATTLE that feeds the farmer (or a battery that powers the machine if you like). Those thoughts scratch the surface of conspiracy by some people called 'theory'. I can see The Matrix in power everyday and in my country and in full power every four years before the election day. Its is just as Morpheus says ""The problem is the choice"" both to men and the lords of the matrix. Catch my drift? ""The Matrix has you.""",The Matrix

I really like the concept of the movie, where we live in some kind of dream world called the Matrix and we can escape this to get into the real world. Also I like the fact that Neo the protagonist of the movie grows into his character as being The One, and has to save mankind. It's kind of like the story in many religions where one person is the savior and that there's an oracle telling the person how to be this. Just like in the Matrix where there's an oracle setting Neo on the path to become The One. The whole concept of this all is what makes this such a great movie for me, plus it has a lot of great action scenes, like the on in the entrance hall of an office building, where they go and save Morpheus.",The Matrix

Now when I say realistic, you're gonna have to take that statement with a pinch of salt, as its obviously not a real story but after I saw the film back in 1999 when I was 16, I asked myself the question, wow, how do I know I'm not in the matrix right now? The movie is told in such a way that really makes you believe it could be true, where a lot of films fall short of these types of story lines. A lot of films hit you with crazy ideas too early which forces you not to believe that it can actually happen. But this movie is built and told in such a way that its almost impossible for you to deny it, and that's one of the main reasons why I love this movie so much. And as for originality, this is arguably the greatest groundbreaking movie of all time. Before and till this day, there still hasn't been a story like this in any movie.If you ever have a spare 7 hours, my advice would be to watch all 3 movies back to back and see them as one big movie, truly outstanding.",The Matrix

Especially with its pointless end, the 2nd one was just an ordinary good action movie. Although the characters seems far from having emotions since they grown up in cruel life conditions and have no time to deal with human senses, its strange to see the reason of revival of Neo and Trinity is coming from the depth of their love.

If u just take snap shots of each scene and thier art amongst themselves. The fight sequence, oh the fight sequences. My god i have seen many many Action movies from Bruce lee's to Bruce willis' but nothing prepared me for what was comming! The training scene to the tunnel scene whoa. Bullet dodging WHOA where do these brothers get thier Ideas from? Amazing. But the best part was when each and every word spoken by the Oracle proved o be true. I never understood what she meant by ""U might be the one in another life but not in this"" and indeed he gets reborn after being shot down. Amazing. This movie will be as cult as starwars in the following years. The whole Video and computer game industry is nuts over it. A dozen movies have ripped off the scenes of the Matrix fight sequences (READ: Charlies Angles) and the only movie that will be upto the brilliance of this movie is gonna be its sequel.

I never knew that the name Morpheus is a mythological character of dreaming or that Nebuchadnezzar (the name of Morpheus' ship) was a ruler of the Babylonian empire who defeated his opponents to take over control. Every part of the movie is for a reason and has meaning.  Things like this are what makes this movie great and enjoying to watch!",The Matrix

3310,Morpheas1,The smartest sci-fi movie ever.,10,17 January 2002,"What is Matrix? `Matrix is everywhere, is around us. Is the world they have build front of your eyes to caver the truth' The truth is this: Technical intelligent it's a fact, the machines have identity and they have won the war with humans. The world is destroying and the mankind lives in a digital universe. One rebel group, with his leader Morpheus, battled for liberation, save Neo, a hacker who may be the Messiah and saver of human race. They uncover the truth to him.That what is following is a basic elements mixed from sci-fi movies, cyberpunk literature and comic culture. `Alice in Wonderland' meets Holly Bible and cyber grunge shift to religiously experience. The thinking is more then the action in Matrix. It seems that Wachowski brothers have work out they resources before they make this impressive storm of special effects and intension. Implicate Zen with virtual reality and the storm of shooting with violent flying choreography from Hong Kong, it seems that they invent the action movie from scratch. Special effects are not be used to make the explosions look more impressive, but to build a world from the beginning. They twist the reality, not with unreal way, but extremely believable. Even if the action scenes, from the frenzied chase in the roofs at the beginning until the shoot out at the end are breathtaking, Matrix doesn't exist only for that reason. The style triumphed, the attraction reminds us video games, but the story raise smart questions for thinking and contain an impressive number of ideas. Every detail has not only knowledge and resource, but also fantasy and particularity. Matrix is the `Blade Runner' for the new generation. It has only one `weakness'; it put the ell to high for the coming movies.",The Matrix
3311,DazzlerUK,"Amazing effects, superb DVD, wooden Reeves.",7,18 November 2001,"The Matrix is without doubt the movie that has set the agenda for all other action movies to follow early in the 21st century. You just have to look at some of the action sequences from Charlie's Angels to see it's impact on other film makers. Aside from it's undeniably stunning graphics and images, is the film actually that great?The plot in my view is trying to be far too clever for it's own good. It is totally unbelievable, though I must confess this is probably a problem that lies with me and not the writers. A film has to have some basis in reality for me to grasp and I found the whole 'human beings as duracell batteries' plot a little too dum for this man's taste.Some of the acting from the supporting cast is top drawer, particularly when you consider that a few of these actors learnt their trade in Australian and New Zealand soap operas! Laurence Fishburne turns in an excellent performance, which is just as well as for most if the film he is having to carry the inept and wooden performance of Keanu Reeves.Overall I have to admit I enjoyed The Matrix and it's visual delights, but one of the greatest films ever made? I think not.",The Matrix
3312,yzhechev,"The film, which defined 1999",10,9 December 2001,"The Matrix clearly defined the year of 1999. It was grim, it was witty (at some parts) and it was ambitious. Wachowski brothers sure put a great deal of time to concentrate on absolutely every shot. Notice the green-filled rooms with the dark clothes of the cast. Everything is in a pure harmony, however dark it is, it is beautiful. Not to mention the incredibly sharp and ""right-in-place sound effects. When you watch The Matrix, make sure you turn your attention to the echoes and reverb added to almost every single line, also listen for the ambience effects! Overall, this is one of the best films ever. And I do not speak only in terms of technical masterpiece. The Matrix has a deep plot, and strong dialogues. Actually, the only flop in the film is Carrie-Anne Moss' performance. Although it is not weak by any means, it could have been better. Yet, this is truly a magnificent film, which is best enjoyed on a big screen system with 6+ channel digital receiver, and is best viewed...alone!",The Matrix

3318,bonescan,Often hilarious when it's not boring.,2,13 January 2002,"I tried to like ""The Matrix"", I really did. The commercials looked really cool with all the action shots and slow motion effects and I knew that I just had to see it. When did I give up on it? About halfway through the movie, (after the other 4 people I went to the theatre with had long since began laughing out loud at this silly, absurd, and massively boring film), Keanu goes to the apartment where the great oracle (or whatever) was baking cookies and retarded kids were bending spoons with their minds. That's when I stared laughing too. I'm sorry but my friends were right. This film sucked. Sure there were a couple of sorta cool action scenes but you had to sit through the insanely dull hour and a half of Lawrence Fishburn explaining EVERYTHING that happens in the film before these scenes even appeared. And the movie ""Blade"" had come out around the same time and was a MUCH better surreal action film. As for the silly karate scenes (or kung fu or Judo or whatever), they were no big deal. I mean, did you really think that Keanu was gonna be the next Bruce Lee? Do yourself a favor and rent (or better yet, Buy) the Jet Li ""Fong Sai Yuk"" movies. As for all the psychological babble about what world is real and what world isn't, it only added to the chaotic mess that was called a script for this waste of celluloid. Some say ""Battlefield Earth"" was a horrendous goofy mess. Well, it was, but no where near as bad as this. :)",The Matrix

And what is the truth?Well the truth has a different meaning for every of us. But the important thing is not the truth. It is to realize that what you see may not be the truth.This is what the movie is trying to tell us. To wake us up from our daily sleep and make us try and find what is Real from the things that surround us. From that point on it is our own responsibility to walk the path to get to the truth.As Morpheus said there is a big difference between knowing the path and walking the path. And the later is something that everyone has to do for himself.You cannot be told what the matrix is. You have to find it out for yourself.",The Matrix

We literally have energy sucked out of us due to the fear that the media, life stress etc sucks out of us.

3323,kriskrister,Hey! It´s The Turner Diaries - the Movie!,1,3 March 2002,"For starters, I´d like to say that there are lots of films out there that use special effects to make brutal killings look cool, and I have no problem whatsoever with that. In fact, nothing clears the head better than an hour or two of Arnold Schwarzenegger or Wesley Snipes killing baddies and shouting one-liners. As long as an action movie doesn´t take itself too seriously, nor do the audience have to. But the Matrix is one of those really dumb action movies that aren´t content with serving as eye candy. It desperatly wants to be Thought Provoking and Carry A Message. When you start analyzing that message, you almost get to belive that perhaps the Unabomber or Timothy McVeigh filled in as script doctors. Let´s review the facts, shall we (warning, spoilers down below, stop reading if you really want to be ""surprised"" by this film): After the initial action scenes, the movie gets rather boring while three important facts are established: 1: That even thou ""the Matrix"" is a simulation, nearly all the people in ""the Matrix"" are real people who think they live in the real world, except for a small select group of people who know The Truth.2: That you cannot go from living in ""the Matrix"" to living in the real world without going though excrutiating amounts of fysiotherapy.3: That if you get hurt and die in ""the Matrix"" you also die in the real world.And after that those facts have been implemented over and over, the film goes on to show the heroes remorselessly shooting down and killing hordes of policemen, security guards and the occational homless person, ""real people"" who we have to persume are just performing their choirs and duties in what they belive to be the ""real world"". All this carnige is justified in the name of a Greater Cause, namely to ""liberate"" the inhabitants of the Matrix all at once, even though they will have no real chance of survival once liberated. Am I the only one that gets a bit distraught by this?Oh, and in case you actually didn´t know, ""the Turner Diarys"" is a rather infamous old science fiction novel written by a nazi and treasured by white supremacists.  It tells the ""heroic"" story of a little group of self-righteous fascist terroists who overthrow the American gouverment by instigating riots and killing all the evil FBI agents, among other things.

I was actually very surprised I was watching something that wasn't just made! There is quite a lot of violence, and it was particularly gruesome when the bug crawled in the protagonists belly button, but other than that, this movie should have been rated PG-13, because I have seen many PG-13 movies that are worse than this R one. This movie is a bit violent, but its nothing more mature kids can't handle. It has some good messages in it. Even when Morpheus was captured the Agents, and the others wanted to kill him before he gave them any information, Neo was determined to get him out of there and did. He never gave up on his friend and saved Morpheus's life. The violence and swearing in this is definitely PG-13 and not R.",The Matrix

3329,Buzzcut98,Its beauty is in the details,10,31 March 2002,"Ever wonder what you would get if you combined cyberpunk fiction a la William Gibson, Japanese anime, and Hong Kong action movies together?  Me neither.  But let me tell you, it makes a heck of a good movie!!!Lots of reviewers here have effectively summarized the plot and pointed out the action sequences, but I would ask that you look a little closer at some of the details in this movie that make it great.If imitation is the sincerest form of flattery, then creative team behind ""The Matrix"" must be feeling very flattered indeed.  Think about it: In the few years since this movie first came out, how many other film reviews/summaries have referred to ""The Matrix"" when describing their action scenes and/or special effects?The bad news, however, is that they are all copying the wrong things.Nowadays, ""the 'Matrix' style"" has become synonymous with two things: kung-fu wire-assisted jumps and slo-mo ""bullet time"" effects.  While it is true that ""The Matrix"" did much to popularize these effects (although the wirework had been around for quite some time before them), the imitators forgot that these effects were used to support a well-crafted film with an intriguing storyline and excellent camerawork/art direction.When watching ""The Matrix"", ignore for once the slo-mo John Woo-style shootout and ""bullet time"" scenes.  Instead, look at the other wonderful touches the Wachowski brothers have infused into their masterpiece:Look at the use of color--Neo's workplace and the office building used by the Agents is awash in a pale palette of glass, steel, and greenish-grey dullness.  The buildings where Morpheus and Co. can hack into the Matrix are decrepit, with lots of noir-ish backlighting, as if the very structure of the Matrix is weakened, allowing the intrusion from outside forces.Look at the use of mirrors--the Wachowskis have a fun time using mirrored images to frame certain characters and scenes.  The best example is when Morpheus presents the two ""pills"" to Neo; in Morpheus' glasses, you can see Neo's face clearly reflected in both lenses, but each lens only shows one of the pills, suggesting the two paths before Neo.Of course, don't forget the wonderful set design--the rusty, cluttered interior of the ""Agammemnon"", and the other jury-rigged equipment used by Morpheus; the sleek, menacing, organic-looking machinery of the computers; etc., etc.And all of this is shot with exquisite camerawork by the Wachowskis.  They have a true knack for ""framing"" a particular scene correctly, with just the right angle, distance, and lighting to provide the best effect.  It's something you can also see in their first feature, ""Bound"".As for the story, the plot follows a sci-fi tradition that I'm admittedly a sucker for.  It calls into question the nature of our reality--if humans measure reality by our brain's interpretation of our senses, and if our senses and our brains can be deceived, then how can we know what is real and what is illusion?  This idea is a sci-fi staple, and one that has become quite popular in recent sci-fi movies, such as ""Total Recall"", ""Dark City"", and ""The Truman Show"" (yes, I consider ""The Truman Show"" to be sci-fi). Into this mix, ""The Matrix"" tackles this issue in a grandiose style, fueled with stunning action sequences and visual flair, making it a new masterpiece of sci-fi.I should acknowledge that this film is not without flaws.  First, although it handles the idea of questioning reality wonderfully, its ideas on fate/destiny/prophesy, central to Neo's character, are much more fuzzy and ill defined.  Secondly, it stars Keanu Reeves, need I say more.  Lastly, I find wire stunts in fight scenes to be annoying (I thought the scenes in ""Crouching Tiger..."" were absolutely ridiculous) and thought that a few wire tricks in this movie were very poorly done (namely, Neo's summersault during training, and Trinity's cartwheel during the shootout).That said, I still consider this movie to be one of my favorites, and deserving of the cult following it has received.",The Matrix

3333,salmon25,Possibly the greatest Sci-Fi ever,10,27 August 2003,"You have all heard of the Matrix. The comic-book, apocalyptic world that was created by the Wachowski Brothers. There isn't much I can say that you don't already know. The fight scenes are incredible, the action is out-of-control. Even though much of it takes place in Bullet-Time, or super slow motion, it is hard to keep up with. The dialouge is not the films strong point when you watch it the first time. However every time you watch it, you hear more deep philisophical double-meanings, and hints about what is about to come than in any movie ever. For instance, the line that Neo says towards the beggining of the film, ""Have you ever had thatn feeling where you don't know whether youre awake or still dreaming,"" sounds deadpan and boring at first. But when you realize what the Wachowskis are setting up, it becomes suspenseful and attention-getting. The acting all around isn't spectacular, although I think Laurence Fishburnes performance could have very easily garnered him an Academy Award nomination. Hugo Weaving is perfectly cast as Agent Smith, but other than those two, the acting isn't very memorable. However, lets get to the real reason people see this movie, 8, 9, hell, 20 times! The action. This movie has the best and coolest action scenes in any movie. Ever. Mr Willis, will you please shut up? From the lobby scene (the opening of the lobby scene is my favorite part of the movie), to the training fight, to the part involving Cypher, to the helicopter scene, and of course, the best fight ever in a movie. Neo vs Agent Smith. I won't give you any details about the scene, but it is worth the price of admission.
If you haven't seen this movie, you are missing a Science Fiction as good and as culturally inmportant as the Star Wars trilogy. If will be quite a feat if the Wachowskis can top themselves with the sequels. However, I really hope they don't screw them up: (AGENT SMITH: Neo, I am your father.)",The Matrix
3334,carfonexdo,Glitch In The Matrix.....Glitch In The Matrix,10,26 November 2007,"OK so who still watches out for glitches in the matrix?I am writing this review 8 years after its release because this film still has an affect on people and the Movie Industry. Like Star Wars (smaller scale obviously, I can see the faces of geeks everywhere going red with anger) The Matrix generated a new group/cult/fan base of followers across the world and influenced the way many action films were filmed after 1999. Yes you may say slow mo action sequences have been done before (Face Off 1997) and if you have seen any John Woo films (see The Killer 1989) you will recognize the same fight moves (which are timeless and I love). However nobody forgets The Matrix because of the story and the characters and the biggest of big questions (after the big bang debate) which is: ""Is this real?"" Questioning our existence, no one can ignore the issue and that's why this film hit the spot with audiences old and young and still does today and for many years to come. Everyone questions there existence even if you haven't seen The Matrix.The other two films were just fun/entertaining/money making/visually stunning epics. It was just exciting to see Neo and his posse kick ass! No story needed just more bullets hehe!Have you ever had a dream, that you were so sure was real?

I liked the theme of control that resonated throughout the plot--being controlled, at first not knowing it, then waking up to it and ultimately ""raging against"" such control.I was not taken in so much by the special effects or fight scenes. While I was not necessarily turned off by them either, I did feel they were ""additional elements only"" and that the core meaning of the movie strives to go much deeper.Neo is the hero because he got beyond the control mechanisms in place which deceive and thus imprison. No other human could do it, all others...Morpheus, Trinity, etc...even after their eyes were awakened to what the Matrix was, could not act outside the perimeters of this system. Neo, through his journey of self-discovery breaks beyond the barriers of human perception that defined the containers of this system. He was able to do this because a human was originally programmed into the Matrix, as explained by Morpheus to Neo. So the idea that human perception had helped construct the Matrix opened the possibility that human perception could also be liberated from the Matrix by altering the rules that governed it.We all long to break free of something, and I think that is why this movie resonated on a subconscious level with many people. I would imagine those who said they loved this film very well may have loved the concept of freewill itself. Does it exist and can we access it? How is it accessed? Is it a journey of our inner self? Neo takes such an inner journey does he not?The answer is clear, he does. Because this is how he transcends the Matrix of which others, those awakened to it and those still plugged in, could not do. And it all came down to inner belief, the exercising of freewill. Man's freewill. The idea that external reality, whether physical or virtual reality, does not control us. We define ourselves by thought. And thought itself alters reality, not the other way around.I really feel this is what the Wachowski brothers were seeking to express. I do not feel they made this movie for CGI effects or to make an action film that would be a blockbuster hit as some reviews have suggested. I do feel they aimed at a deeper undercurrent on the nature of our existence, the nature of reality. I do not, however, think they were entirely successful in their attempt which is why I gave the film 7 out of 10.Here is what I feel is detracting from the movie: The idea of combining deep philosophical interjection with typical Hollywood portrayals is bound to create a struggle between the two, which it does, and one usually has to give way for the other. Such as, the ""coolness"" or attempt at coolness (ie leather outfits, guns, sunglasses, martial arts sequences set to hip soundtracks) detract from the intellectual concepts being developed. Such obvious referencing takes the audience in a different direction, to more mundane and traveled territory, yet underneath this (buried in the rubble of predictability) is the highly commendable urge to denounce this very homogeneity and be original. But to be original, you have to go all the way. Once you reference the commonplace, the known and well-accommodated approaches, you undervalue what is fresh and new by the sheer momentum of agreed upon consensus (Hollywood themes) that puts an end to the intellectual exploration that could have arisen. That is, familiarity breeds a lack of curiosity.What WAS fresh and new was at the end of the film when Neo was able to stop agent Smith's bullets by ""intending to"". That was the beauty of this hero. He exercised his own freewill and thus altered his own reality without resorting to fists and guns in order to overpower the control mechanisms.Yet the problem continues, in the follow-up sequels of the Trilogy. Here we see Neo back to fighting agent Smith with his fists and guns again. So what happened to his ability to ""intend"" beyond the Matrix? It seems it is suggested (by the Wachowski brothers) that as Neo intended beyond the Matrix, agent Smith in turn also became able to transcend his own limitations. The idea that the challenger is continually challenged by his opponent, so that when the challenger gets stronger, so too does his opponent.The final in the Trilogy did have the proper ending, in keeping with this intellectual theme of freewill and how to achieve it. It has to do with compassion (Neo's compassion) and the will to surrender the NEED to control. So Neo reached this epoch in his journey (final fight scene with agent Smith). He ceased to fight back, and in doing so he became pure essence (unreachable to the controlling mechanisms). OK, message received loud and clear...or was it?I think many who saw the Matrix, or the entire the Trilogy for that matter, saw the leather and guns and fight sequences without being fully aware of the undercurrent of concepts. Well, I guess if that's what they went to see, then they got what they were seeking and no harm in that. Still, I think less focus on ""coolness"" by the Wachowski Brothers would have helped the esoteric concepts in the film emerge, but may have in turn drawn a smaller audience. We'll never know.Either way, I liked the Matrix and the way the Trilogy was ended. And Keanu Reeves played the role of Neo perfectly. A cross between Buddha and Genghis Khan, conveying that in the end, it is the surrendering of control(Buddhist aspect)that frees one from the Matrix.",The Matrix

3350,steven_wade,"Not Everyone's Cup of Tea, But Certainly a Strong Cup! (POSSIBLE SPOILERS)",10,25 September 2002,"As this movie came out in 1999 and there are over 2,600 comments on it already, I will skip the synapsis and head straight for the critic's chair. This movie features some of Keanu Reeves's best acting to date, and the cast was absolutely perfect. This is a movie of the 21st century: fast-paced, excellent acting, action, stunts, and stunning visual effects. It also sets a new course where Hollywood hasn't gone in a long time: the profanity count was around 10 and there was no nudity. Some parts are violent, but it isn't nearly as bad as other movies I have seen. The camera shots are incredible. The long vertical shots from the tops of buildings, the mirrored images recurring throughout the film, the slow-motion shots--my favorite is the view from the ground looking up at the helicopter with the blades turning real slow with shells dropping down! You can over-analyze the physics and feasibility of the movie, but I urge the viewer to remember that it is, above all, a movie. This movie isn't perfect; there is a hole here and there in the story. Overall, though, you don't notice them much while you're sitting on the edge of your seat with your heart pounding. This movie is guaranteed to provoke thought, argument, and discussion. In doing so, it provides us all with great entertainment.",The Matrix

Never have seen an Action Movie come close to the amount of excellent special effects, great scripts, and super suspense - Will continually vote 10 out of 10 for the Matrix Series. I watch at least 1 or 2 action films per week either on DVD, on Limewire, or at CinemaNow or MovieLink online. The Matrix (3 movies) is definitely the best movie(s) I have ever watched.

""The Matrix"" looked exciting enough in the trailers, so I decided to give it a look. What I found was an amazing movie, with some of the greatest special effects I've ever seen. The camera angles really work for the action sequences and the choreographed fight scenes made me yearn for more. Say what you want about Keanu Reeves' acting. He may not deliver the best dialogue, but his look can carry a film. He was a great choice for the role of Neo. Carrie Anne Moss was great as was the underrated Laurence Fishburne. I highly recommend this film for those who are a fan of visually stunning movies.",The Matrix
3355,gopi-18,Good technology used !,8,2 December 2008,"In common usage, hacker is generic term for a computer criminal, often with a specific specialty in computer intrusion.Computer hacking subculture is often referred to as the network hacker subculture or simply the computer underground.It is common among hackers to use aliases for the purpose of concealing identity, rather than revealing their real names. Members of the network hacking scene are often being stereotypically described as crackers by the academic hacker subculture, yet see themselves as hackers and even try to include academic hackers in what they see as one wider hacker culture, a view harshly rejected by the academic hacker subculture itself. Instead of a hacker  cracker dichotomy, they give more emphasis to a spectrum of different categories, such as white hat (""ethical hacking""), grey hat, black hat and script kiddie. In contrast to the academic hackers, they usually reserve the term cracker to refer to black hat hackers, or more generally hackers with unlawful intentions.

The plot was not predictable and I bet most of you had to see it at least twice to fully understand what just happened.  But the greatest contribution this film has made, is the great camera work.

It was about creation and there was a reason. Some people thought like that; ""We made machines after that they used us producing energy and this is the philosophy!"" after that they noticed an other point of the movie about of the creation and structure of the universe; ""Come on!

Okay, an excellent action movie. Which it is.  It has set new standards in special effects that will be seen for years to come.

I myself found The Matrix to be one of the most spectacular creations of all time.  No doubt the two remaining sequels will live up to the audiences high expectations.  I'd like to see the film-critics find fault with all three.

3384,voncinatomislav,Matrix,10,23 December 2015,"A mixture of philosophy, religion and cutting edge special effects defines The Matrix and the ability of co-writer/directors Andy and Larry Wachowski to keep audiences intrigued all while wooden characters play out some of the best action ever seen on film is a testament to this film's staying power. However, will The Matrix ultimately define the downfall of the Wachowski brothers as all their future projects will be compared to their early blockbuster, or will they one day be able to be considered something more than just the boys that brought us bullet- time?The Matrix centers on Neo (Keanu Reeves), a computer hacker with a low level job at a software company who learns early on he is destined to play a major role in the fate of humanity. An introduction to a small band of rebels led by a man named Morpheus (Laurence Fishburne) soon teaches him life as he knows it doesn't exist. The human development of artificial intelligence backfired resulting in a war of man vs. machine that ended in a scorched Earth and robot domination. Humans are farmed for their energy and ""plugged into"" a virtual world monitored by programs referred to as Agents.Hugo Weaving stars as the career defining Agent Smith, a role he will always be remembered for as it would now seem impossible to see anyone else playing the monotone aggressor. The role calls for such restraint while an impossible emotional turmoil is broiling on the inside. It is by far the best performance in the film, primarily because the dialogue services his character while the others are operating outside of a standard set of rules and still manage to less human emotion than the programs that monitor the system from which they escaped. Perhaps once you are free of the machine's control you have no sense of identity and therefore also have no personality. Who knows, but it hardly matters as spectacle and philosophical substance outweighs performance in this flick.The Matrix could be described as the ultimate homage as it has the look of 1998's Dark City, the near exact narrative of Fritz Lang's Metropolis (as exampled), begins with a Vertigo-Esq rooftop chase and has its own version of a spaghetti western shootout. Traces of ""Alice in Wonderland"" can be found all while the Wachowskis dabble in every philosophical conceit known to man before passing off the protagonist as the Messiah of a new era. This, quite frankly, is where my primary intrigue in this film remains. Connections between fantasy, reality, religion and philosophy has always intrigued me in films even if the connections are subtle. I love to see how filmmakers and screenwriters can think of new ways to tell the old stories in what seems like a unique environment, something The Matrix certainly is despite its ripped off roots.The Wachowskis decided on a perfect actor to play our Messiah character dubbed The One, Keanu Reeves. Reeves is often made fun of for his wooden acting, and considered a bad actor due to his rather lifeless performances but the dialogue in The Matrix calls for just such a personality. One thing you can never fault Reeves on is his ability to choose roles, over the course of his career he has managed to pick roles that suit his style time and time again. These roles play to his strengths making his acting style something of an invaluable ""talent"". Trying to imagine anyone other than Reeves delivering the now classic "" Whoa"" line is damn near impossible, especially considering Jeff Spicoli is all grown up.Whether you look at The Matrix as an incomprehensible mess of mambo jumbo or a message filled marvel, there is no denying the effect it had on cinema with its introduction of bullet-time camera-work that was not only cool, but an effective, and almost vital, way to tell their story; without it this film may have quite possibly failed right out of the gate. It's very rare to find technical advances in film that actually service the story rather than hinder the filmmakers. Quite often a film will get bogged down in effects and the director will forget they are telling a story. Despite the fact this was the Wachowskis' second feature length film they were able to rein in any urge to go overboard and stayed within their narrative structure, giving the audience everything they needed to stay engaged while leaving out just enough to keep them wanting more.",The Matrix
3385,drewluv83,"great philosophy primer, but sloppy",8,11 August 2010,"This is a review of some of the philosophical elements of the film. If that aspect didn't interest you, stop here. If you are the brainy type who is interested in quibbling, though, or are simply curious, then read on.Before I start ranting, I just want to say that I enjoy this film enormously, unrealistic dialogue and not very deep characterization notwithstanding. Great fx/action sequences, good acting, exciting plot, and it's a the best vehicle for introducing philosophy ideas and themes to the uninitiated that Hollywood has ever produced (Malick's 'Thin Red Line' that came out at about this time is also very philosophical, but not at such an overt level). That said, there is a hopeless hodgepodge of schools of thought here that either just don't necessarily mix well or are blatantly conflicting. I was also a bit disappointed with the audio commentary track (on the blu-ray edition) by philosophers Cornel West and Ken Wilbur – though, again, the uninitiated would benefit enormously from it. West and Wilbur (but especially West) spend way too much time talking about(and revisiting) certain themes and not even mentioning certain other things that I thought were central. As an example of the former, West overly discusses the theme that is the most obvious and really does not need the amount of commentary that it gets: that of multicultural/racial/gender-equality; since he is primarily known for his writings on race, this is perhaps forgivable since this is what he knows and is interested in, but in some cases he reads his own interpretation into the film that almost certainly was not the Wachowski brothers' intent. To paraphrase a case in point: at one point he says that (echoing feminist schools of thought that are popular in Academia these days) since Neo, the One, needs help from Trinity in order to fully realize his potential, and thus he is not completely 'one' without her, this film is really about the breakdown of gender identity. West's point about Neo and Trinity being 'one' is credible, as in Christian theology the father, son and holy spirit are all one and the same being; but in line with the allegorical Christian parallels in the film, its far more likely a unity based in the romantic connection at the end, like a man and a woman becoming one through marriage, rather than any notions of gender breakdown (while it is true that, for survival purposes, the women fight and aren't particularly feminine, the reverse is not true – the males are never unmasculine, and there are no Lady Macbeth types). As far as skipping over material, in the very beginning there is a direct allusion to the contemporary social theorist Baudrillard (when Neo is making the exchange at his apartment, he is shown to be hiding his discs in a book entitled 'Simulacra and Simulation') . Neither West nor Wilbur even mentions this point, which I think is a significant one, as it is the only direct reference to any philosophical figure, past or present, in the trilogy. Moreover, it is an allusion that comes into conflict with the clear-cut reality vs. illusion dichotomy that (West and Wilbur DO mention) runs throughout the film (the inconsistency is that Baudrillard thinks that modern technology has created a simulation of reality in which we are all living, but there is no deeper reality behind it – the illusion is all there is). Another problem with the film itself is the lack of resolution between the main theme of the film (good, real humans vs. evil, illusion-producing machines) and Agent Smith's monologue about humans being parasites and machines being the more efficient 'cure' to which good and evil don't apply – evolution is not only an amoral process, but morality itself is a human social construction of which machines have no concept, and no need. Smith makes a good point that not only isn't satisfactorily answered, but it's the last bit of extended speech in the movie (save Trinity's confession of love and Neo's closing proclamation, neither of which is relevant to Smith's view), and is then dismissed to make way for a final half-hour of continuous, nearly wordless (though thrilling) action sequences.Wilbur mentions one specific inaccuracy: the famous 'there is no spoon'line; it was inspired by a Zen Koan (a sort of logically paradoxical parable) in which three monks are observing a flag waving in the wind. The first says the flag is moving; the second says it is not the flag that is moving, but the wind; the third says that neither the flag nor the wind is moving, but only your mind. It's not exactly right to say the spoon does not exist, merely that the spoon is not separable from the mind.This is typical of the film: throwing a lot of not-well-understood ideas together in a sloppy fashion. Wilbur himself is all about synthesizing ideas, but here it is done very haphazardly. That's not to say that a clever enough person can't spot holes in any argument, but here it's like glancing up at a clear night sky. In a good story (whether character-driven or action-driven) there's only enough time to suggest ideas if it isn't to lag (as opposed to developing them), but that doesn't mean those ideas should be on-the-surface inconsistent.Having gotten this off my chest, I realize that I am being overly critical. This is a (very good) Hollywood film, a classic of its genre, so to get as much as we did was a blessing.",The Matrix

Some since they have no clue what they just saw and others coz the just felt the matrix all around them!! The matrix although not released with as much fan fare as its sequels caught the audiences' eye nonetheless. It created fan following amongst almost every age group. I've seen this movie 13 times and never miss a chance to watch it again. The Wachowski brothers have not only paid extreme attention to the story (which is so logically believable) , but also to the costumes, the camera work, the music and every other aspect of the movie.

The people are connected to some machines and live in a virtual world. Neo, in his virtual life, tried to understand some things and he received a message in his computer, that said: ""Wake Up Neo, The Matrix has you Follow the white rabbit"". This message helped Neo to know about the Matrix and found people that knew about it. The acting was good, the actors and actress played their characters very believably. The plot is good because it has a great director and producers. However, the special effects were not so credible because the technology used in the film was old than the new effects and techniques of production.

This has been created to let the people live out of the war. But there is a group, called ""The Resistance"", which lives in a nave and knows the reality. They have been expecting for the one, who, supposedly, has powers to control The Matrix. His name is Neo, and with the group's help he finds these powers. It s a good story to think about. The movie lets us on thinking which one is the real world. Are we living in a world like Matrix and connected to a virtual game? We do not know if the real life is in The Matrix and The Resistance is a group of mad people. But we can also think that The Matrix does not exist. It is probable that we will not understand why the group does not want to live in The Matrix if the real world is a disaster and they used to live well. There is a lot of fantasy in almost all the movie. I would not recommend it to people who hate the fantastic stories, because it has bad science fiction.

Though some dialogs are cliché the storyline, the concept, the action and the execution is flawless. The entire concept though implausible provides a glimpse of what our future may have in store for us. It is more of a continuation of Terminator 2 by James Cameron, which is another Sci-Fi masterpiece and has some break-through special effects. In Matrix the characters are so well formed that it really makes us believe in them and creates an atmosphere on which lays the foundation of the movie itself. The spell binding special effects is one of its kind and do introduce to the famous bullet time effects that we saw in the game Max Payne.In short it is a masterpiece which will be enjoyed for generations.",The Matrix
3393,cybervegeto22,The Matrix Makes a Bold Statement,9,16 January 2014,"The Matrix can be interpreted as a political statement about people being products of society, illustrating how easily people can fall victim to the demands of societal expectations. I use the term 'society' in this review to define the unwritten laws of human culture that systematically critique individuality, and not to define the establishment of a people.The Matrix represents society. Agent Smith represents the effort of society to assimilate and convert. Morpheus and the gang defy these societal expectations within a pocket of opposition, much like human rights groups in real life; but with a central hero that stands alone, which promotes the fact that anyone - in a group or not - can stand against conformity and fight to be unique.A machine with a mind of its own, society attempts to enslave and assimilate us through breaking us down so that we can be built back up under its control. We are told what to believe. How to think. How to feel, what to feel and when. We are given opinions, given identical options to choose from; given instructions for how to choose. Everything else, every choice, every action, every word, is taboo or unacceptable.A fear begins to creep in of anything that differs from society's opinion, completing the assimilation as society's message is accepted by and transferred through its slaves. They complain about and insult those who act out of the ordinary, with popular comments including, ""Why do you hold doors open for people? You must be attention-starved,"" ""You can't dance, why do you try? You're just embarrassing yourself,"" ""Stop working so hard, you're a tool,"" etc., etc.These insulting critiques promote societal standards through their complaints, digging at the minds of others (potential slaves) to corrode their willpower and prepare them for assimilation. Most people concede and comply without putting up much of a fight; it's an endurance race with no finish line, so all it takes for enslavement is time... unless they refuse to run, and instead fight back.The slaves aren't always aware of the societal forces at work here, but if only subconsciously they want to break us down and force our hand. They claim superiority and perfection with no credibility, and too many people listen and give in. This is their hope, their intent, their bliss; this is what the beast of society strives for, and thus also what its slaves desire. There is great power in numbers, and people are taught not to bite the hand that feeds; these slaves will gladly serve without question, as long as they can feel accepted, being fed validation.Neo represents anybody that is willing to stand up and fight back no matter what the cost, with a will that sets him apart from the other characters - in the movie, as a ""Chosen"" bad-ass; in the real world, as a beacon for acceptance of social diversity and individualism. The message here is that even if you're not a Neo, it is better to be a Trinity or a Morpheus and support the Neos of the world, than to be an Agent Smith and drag the world down to monotonous ruin.The Matrix is a well-disguised call to action, one that both excites lovers of entertainment and inspires those who realize that the world needs more prominent Neos to rise up against conformity; to withstand the machine that is societal assimilation. It puts a culture of social obedience on display in a visually stunning and imaginatively thrilling way.I write this just shy of 15 years since its release, and this movie still presents a dead-on interpretation of society's drive to convert individuality into what it expects of people - and the unbreakable will of those that fight for the freedom to be unique.9/10 - A sign of the times, and a movie for the ages.",The Matrix

The Matrix is what people of the future will worship, it simply has everything! To say that it is a good movie is simply an understatement! Your body is a zone of ecstacy-karma when influenced by The Matrix....! To think that all is an illusion is the ultimate test for body and mind! The Matrix is to grand for our time, a trend-setter and impossible to copy. After the first watch I knew it was a special movie, but it wasn't after the re-watch i knew just how grand. It opens a philosophy and way of thinking never seen before, it has the special effects and of course some kick-ass scenes! (HA HA) When you leave the cinema, you leave with the thrusting sound of RATM: Wake Up, and you feel cool like never before, want to jump on to things and wish you had a pair of sun glasses or a long leather coat nearby! But then again, all this only goes with the first movie, (even though in my head, there only exist's ONE), the follow-ups Reloaded and Revolutions are terrible and should have stayed as ideas in The Washowski Brothers head, instead of making them, in hope of landing more green $! What a waste.... So when you grow older and want to show this movie to your child or youngest cousin for the first time, keep in mind they have never heard of 2 & 3, and let it stay that way! (Maybe if we ignore them, in the future they will be forgotten....!:-) All this said, if you have yet to see The Matrix you owe it to yourself, The Matrix isn't a movie, it's an epos!

3400,holbro07,Great movie worthy of multiple viewings,10,13 December 2010,"The movie The Matrix is a nearly non-stop action ride that also manages to be a deep, thought provoking surprise. I would compare it to Blade Runner but with a lot more action. It was first released in the spring of 1999 and was one of the most visually ground breaking movies of its time. It stars Keanu Reeves as Thomas Anderson (aka Neo), Laurence Fishburne as Morpheus, and Carrie-Ann Moss as Trinity.The storyline is based on a world where man has created artificial intelligence through massive machines. The very same machines turn on the humans and humans become the slaves. The entire world is in a dream like state unaware that they are simply living the life the machines want them to believe they are living. Not all humans are trapped in the artificial world, some such as Morpheus and Trinity; live outside on the real planet. These free humans live a constant cat and mouse game against the machines. They seek to ""free"" humans from the rule of the machines and believe Neo to be the savior.One notable theme that occurs is to push against what is accepted in society and to think freely. Another theme that some people see is more of a religious tone but I see more than that in this movie. At first Neo is unable to open his mind. It leads him to being captured because he is scared to climb across a ledge. He has been ""programmed"" to believe that he is really on a ledge and taking a risk he should not take. Neo does what is expected of him and cannot except the world as it is after he is initially freed. He even asks the question to whether he can be put back into the dream world. This is a common struggle many of us face at one time or another. Society tells us that something or someway is the right way when our gut tells us that it is wrong. Going against the norm is never an easy task.Many aspects of the scenes help to reinforce this message of Neo living under a lie. Early on Neo is always in the dark and dim lit areas. It isn't until he goes to work and speaks with Morpheus that the scene is actually well lit. As if he beginning to wake up and realize what is going on around him. After being freed he appears usually in a well lit manor, even when he is aboard Morpheus's ship. The real world may not be a happy place but it comes across more real. The angles of the camera also seem to only view Neo from a distant outside perspective while he is trapped in the dream world. Once he is freed much of the camera work is a close up that draws you into the film. Both of these features only improve the experience. I would recommend watching this movie a few times just to be able to take everything in.",The Matrix
3401,newseo,Interesting subject,10,16 December 2010,"This was a very interesting film. I plan on seeing it again, and I don't often see films more than once.The film rightly questions our view of ""reality,"" and asks ""what is Real?"" like a few other recent films of the past few years (The Truman Show, Dark City), but the characters themselves never leave their own dualism. That is to say, we are to accept the ""resistance"" as _real_, and life in the cocoons as unreal. The heroes don't realize that they are merely abandoning one ""drama"" for another. What would have been VERY interesting would have been if, at the end of the film, we discover that the heroes never really left their cocoons in the first place, and that the whole struggle was merely another virtual drama induced by the Machine to keep the heroes happy.It also would have added to the dramatic tension if the Agents were portrayed as ""good"" guys rather than evil automatons. I.e., they want humanity to be happy and are willing to let us keep our brains intact and allow us to live out any kind of virtual fantasy we like as long as they are able to feed off of our electrical energy and, eventually, our bodies. If the Agents had under-minded the heroes' faith in their ""resistance"" reality, there would have been more emotional tension as they would have to ask themselves if they really want to keep fighting or just relax and give in. The deck would not be so neatly stacked in favor of struggling.After all, that's basically the way it is in duality. You can exchange one virtual drama for a million others, but we all get eaten at the end. During the film, I wondered to myself what a realized sage (like Ramana for instance) would have done if he had suddenly realized that he wasn't really sitting on a mountain but was in fact lying comatose in a liquid-filled cocoon having a dream that he was a sage, while mechanical spiders were sucking off his vital bodily fluids and electrical energy. I suspect it wouldn't make any difference to such an individual.",The Matrix

You wont really understand it, unless you have a slight view on where its taken from and what the purpose of it is.

3409,olodeco,Cutting Edge Sci-Fi,10,20 March 2011,"Keanu Reeves, playing Neo, discovers that he is the key to breaking the world free of a computer-generated ""reality"" by destroying the Matrix. Neo is a talented hacker working a dead-end tech job while searching for Morpheus, played by Laurence Fishburne, who can tell him the truth about the ""Matrix"". Through a series of mysterious communications and awkward moments with Trinity, played by Carrie-Ann Moss, Neo finds that the world is really only a computer-generated world and that reality is really the ravaged Earth now controlled by the computers that have created the Matrix. While this movie has a lot of action and cutting-edge effects work, the story drives it more than anything else.There is one true Alice in Wonderland moment in The Matrix as Neo makes the transition from the imaginary world to the real world, reaching through a mirror and becoming encased in the silver. There are many surreal moments throughout the film, but this one moment introduces you to the effects that one can expect throughout the film. Throughout the film there are two noticeable methods being used to enhance the story and make the film unique. First, the Wachowski brothers have not only created a unique story, but have created an innovative filming technique that will probably be copied in every major action/sci-fi film for the foreseeable future. The action sequences were not only accentuated by the stop-motion method of filming, but also by the 3-D quality created throughout the action sequences. Added to that drama is the fact that all of the camera angles within the movie serve a purpose, not only creating focus but adding to the story by matching words to action. Lighting is also used successfully throughout the film in order to demonstrate the changes between the matrix world and the real world. The real world, though never perfect, is lit more brightly and colorfully than the real world. Part of this is because of the fact that the real world is underground, but I think that the addition of this and the use of color in the matrix world also tie into the fact that there are those in the real world who dream of going back to their pretend lives, unaware of reality. The real world is harsh and rough, which is denoted by consistent dim lighting no matter what the setting is, giving it an industrial feel throughout. The entire movie is worthy of watching over and over again, but what makes The Matrix truly noteworthy is that it combines a great plot line with unique filming techniques that surpass most science-fiction films. There is action,drama, fantasy, and romance all rolled up into one leather and latex ball, creating a story that will always be relevant in the tech world with effects that the next generation will study in school.",The Matrix

The final 15 minutes are exhilarating utilizing a cleverly created pounding sound track and acute film editing.The script is wonderfully written to cling the viewer's eyes to the screen with well developed lead characters to root for.The special effects utilized to ""elevated the actors""in the action sequences have been endlessly copied since the 1999 film.Wow what a great movie.

He joins like-minded Rebel warriors Morpheus and Trinity in their struggle to overthrow the Matrix. ""The Matrix"" is a visually dazzling cyberadventure, full of kinetic excitement, but it retreats to formula just when it's getting interesting. It's kind of a letdown when a movie begins by redefining the nature of reality, and ends with a shoot-out. We want a leap of the imagination, not one of those obligatory climaxes with automatic weapons fire.I've seen dozens if not hundreds of these exercises in violence, which recycle the same tired ideas: Bad guys fire thousands of rounds, but are unable to hit the good guy. Then it's down to the final showdown between good and evil--a martial arts battle in which the good guy gets pounded until he's almost dead, before he finds the inner will to fight back. Been there, seen that (although rarely done this well).",The Matrix
3418,pauldavies-haze,The Matrix Review.,9,23 June 2011,"The first time I heard about The Matrix was at the age of 9 from another student in the playground. As you can probably imagine it was very hard to piece together what my friend was telling me, trying in vain, drawing on all the communication skills a typical 9 year old to explain what the Matrix was. He'd be telling me about ""The Matrix being the real world but not The real world"" and going into it through phone boxes,and characters with unique sounding names like ""Morpheus"" and ""Trinity"" and the Agents who are trying to kill them etc. It was a frustrating puzzle trying to make sense of what he was trying to tell me but, By the time the bell had rung and the teacher had called us all in for a remaining afternoon of sitting on little chairs being bored, my imagination had been gripped. I could not stop thinking about it. The fact that The Matrix had a 15 age certificate certainly helped fuel the fascination of Primary school audiences, however as an adult who has now seen it many times it is still, without doubt one of the coolest films to ever emerge from America. It's value lies not merely in the ascetically stylistic characters, locations, weapons,fight scenes, vehicles, set pieces, ""bullet time"" (!!) but also in it's huge abstract, philosophical depth. The ""true meaning"" of almost every aspect of the film is constantly still debated in internet forums, books, and audience conversation. It is one of those films that turns audience members of all walks of life into philosophers, debating valuable concepts and ideas and enriching conversation. ""How can we be sure we are not living in a reality similar to The Matrix?"" is perhaps the most obvious question that springs to mind as a result of watching the film. Personally,as a nine year old boy with an overactive imagination and tenancy to take things a bit too literally, I lay in bed after seeing The Matrix for the first time, having real doubts about the nature of reality. It is very similar to the more recent, Inception in the respect that it can remind you, as a human being, how little you really know about the universe and your place in it. If everything we experience is dependant on our senses, how can we know that our senses are not deceived, missing something,or unable to detect certain phenomenon. If The Matrix was ""real"" we would not be able to tell. There is also the question of wherever we would want to leave the safety of the illusion for a harsher reality, or remain in the illusion to escape reality (like Cipher).Without doubt,if we were living in a Matrix like illusion, then the illusion is better for film stars, rock stars, and other social groups than the oppressed working class that Marx describes. Some people would want to exit or shut down the illusion more than others. Another very interesting part of the film is when Agent Smith mentions ""going to church"" as part of the experience of being inside The Matrix.If our world was an illusion and religion is a part of our world,does that imply that religion is an illusion. If we woke up, how can we be sure that we didn't wake up in a world where we still don't know whether God is real and we still don't know the true reality of the world we wake up in. Maybe when Morpheus frees people from The Matrix he is really only waking them up from one illusion into another. There are endless philosophical questions and considerations like this that can result from discussing this film. Films that inspire philosophical questioning enrich life with new perspectives to view the world. Films that do this with such uncompromising style, and excitement are quiet rare. It has to be pointed out that The Matrix is not merely a philosophical exercise but on the surface it is also makes hugely enjoyable viewing. In short,The Matrix has everything. The escapism into a science-fictional world with it's own history, Sharp characters, mind blowing stunts, philosophical, and even emotional depth that is displayed through the relationship between characters. It is a perfect, powerful film with many elements that do it credit.",The Matrix

Im a great fan of Kean. Computer programmer  Thomas A. Anderson (Keanu Reeves) is secretly a hacker known by the  alias ""Neo"". He is restless, and driven to learn the meaning of cryptic  references to ""the Matrix"" appearing on his computer. An infamous  female hacker called Trinity (Carrie-Anne Moss) confirms that a man  named Morpheus (Laurence Fishburne) knows the answers he seeks;  however, three sinister Agents, led by Agent Smith (Hugo Weaving),  arrest Neo and attempt to dissuade him from contacting Morpheus.  Undeterred, Neo attends a secret meeting with Morpheus, who offers him  a choice of two pills: A blue one that would return him to his old  life, and a red pill that would allow him to learn the truth about the  Matrix. Neo swallows the red pill, and he abruptly finds himself in a  liquid-filled pod, his body connected by tubes and cables to a vast  mechanical tower covered with identical pods. The connections are  severed, and he is rescued by Morpheus and taken aboard his ship, the  Nebuchadnezzar.

It was first released in North America on March 31, 1999, and in Australia on April 8, 1999, and is the first installment in the Matrix series of films, comic books, video games, and animation.Neo is trained as a member of the rebellion. A socket in Neo's skull, formerly used by the machines to connect him to the Matrix, allows knowledge to be uploaded directly into his mind. In this way, he is able to quickly learn numerous martial arts styles, and impresses the crew with his speed when sparring in the rebels' virtual reality ""construct"" environment. Further training introduces Neo to the key dangers in the Matrix itself. He learns that fatal injuries suffered within the simulation will also kill one's physical body in the real world. He is warned that the Agents he previously met are powerful sentient computer programs with the ability to possess the virtual body of anyone still directly connected to the Matrix, whose purpose is to seek out and eliminate any threats to the simulation. Morpheus is confident that once Neo fully understands his own abilities as ""the One"", the Agents will be no match for him.",The Matrix
3423,pemond,Good but not great by any stretch of the imagination,6,30 September 2003,"People who hold the Matrix's schtick as near-religious belief should read a book once in a while and broaden their cultural horizons a little more; the fact is, the only thing the Matrix has managed to do is steal ideas from countless other genres (mostly from anime and Hong Kong 'blood operas'), infuse them with superficial philosophical crap that would make a high school goth blogger blush and blend it all perfectly into one slick, hyperactive and CGI-laden package. The Wachowski's should pat themselves on the back: the emperor has no clothes and no one seems to have noticed. These glaring flaws are even more apparent in the second installment of the series, where the prodigal brothers finally show us that the only thing they can do is retread the same old ground.Entertaining? Sure; the effects are impressive and the pace never really slows down, even in spite of Mr. Reeve's wooden (to put it mildly) acting.

Keanu gives his second-best performance ever (after Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure). Unfortunately, that is likely merely the convergence of his naturally confused look with the confusion inherent to the character.All things considered a fun action movie provided you don't buy the hype telling you that it is so much more.By the way, stop with this one.

Are we really living the lives we believe we are or are our bodies being used to power machines while we live in a fantasy world?  The Matrix instantly became one of my favourite films after I saw it in 1999 but not only that it changed my way of thinking.  I was never a religious person before because there was always something that was didn't fit about God and His form of control but the Matrix made sense, in a bizzare way.  It would be great to think the world was not real with everything that goes on around us that is so fake in its way.  It is so amazing to think that outside of what we see and feel there is something else, something that we may never see, something that we shouldn't know about but something REAL.  Religion is all about believing in the unknown but I can't believe in something that I may never see or experience.  The Matrix shows you a physical world outside the one we know and that has given me more to believe then the thought of a spiritual being in the sky.

3437,Neoneoneoneoneo,Truly one of the best movies ever made!,10,22 December 2003,"An excellent beginning to a most excellent trilogy!This movie is one of the best movies ever.  It excels in all areas - an amazing story that is intriguing, fast-paced and beautiful to look at. The story draws you in and never lets go.  The effects in this movie, as everybody knows, are groundbreaking and breathtaking.Right from the green and black treatment of the Warner Bros logo (which is typically gold and blue) you know you are in for a different type of moviegoing experience.  The opening action sequence is riveting with camera angles, stunts, and special effects not seen before.  The dialogue between the agents and the police officers on the scene is as sharp as any heard on Law and Order, which now that I think of it is what the opening is (scene-spoiler) a crime scene investigation and takedown about to go wrong, setting the stage for the rest of the movie.Gripping writing! (Scene-spoiler) (Cut away from the beginning of the opening action sequence - a police search of the 3rd Floor of the Heart O' the City Hotel - to the street below where the police have blocked off the street.  Agent (Smith) arrives on the scene with two other agents in a typical mid 80's unmarked law enforcement cruiser.  Smith exits the cruiser and approaches the officer in charge at the scene.)Agent Smith:  Lieutenant ...Lieutenant (to himself):  Oh shit!Agent Smith: Lieutenant, you were given specific orders...Lieutenant:  Hey! I'm just doin' my job.  You give me that juris-my-dick-tion crap, you can cram it up your ass!Agent Smith:  The orders were for your protection.Lieutenant:  Heh, heh.  I think we can handle one little girl.
(Smith signals his agents and together they walk on) The Lieutenant shouts after them:  I sent two units ... (agents keep walking) They're bringing her down now!Agent Smith stops and turns:  No, Lieutenant.  Your men are already dead.(Cut back to the action. OR cut to Law and Order theme!  Hee hee!)
From this point on, the story, action, and effects take you ""to Oz and back"" in a cool New Millenium style way.  This is not one of those ""all flash and no substance"" flicks.  It's ""all substance and all flash"" all the way. You won't always know where you've been, or where you are being taken (at first), but that's part of what makes this film great!  It is a well-crafted movie with a big story to tell.  Brilliantly conceived as a trilogy from the outset, the Matrix tells a complete and very compelling story while sowing the seeds for the larger story.  Every frame has a purpose, every phrase has meaning.  It's no-holds-barred and all holds broken as new technology brings this film to LIFE!
----- Memorable lines (If you can guess each context there might be a little bit of spoilage here, but nothing too serious.):Hugo Weaving's (Agent Smith's) deliberated monotonous delivery of the name ""Misss-terr An-derson...""(sidenote:  Couldn't watch Weaving as Elrond in Lord of the Rings without humourously picturing Agent Smith delivering HIS lines as Elrond.  e.g. to Boromir or Aragorn:  ""Human beings are a disease, a cancer on this planet, a plague. And we (Elves) are the cure."" OR, as the Elves are leaving Middle-Earth:  ""I hate this place, this zoo, this prison, this reality whatever you want to call it, I can't stand it any longer.  It's the smell. ... I feel saturated by it.   I can taste ..(aside to Gimli) your stink.  And everytime I do I fear that I have somehow been infected by it - it's repulsive!  Isn't it?

On your first viewing you will get a good idea of what the Matrix is all about but unless you are particularly sharp you are unlikely to take in all the minor details about the concept of the Matrix, this is not a bad thing and does not ruin your enjoyment of the film, on a second viewing though you may notice these details which you will understand better having seen it once already. secondly, it is very sophisticated on the graphics side, techniques such as ""bullet time"" make it visually stunning in places. On the acting side, Keanu Reeves and Carrie-Anne Moss play their action sequences 'with a difference' well, Laurence Fishburne makes a suitable wise veteran of the team - Morpheus, and Hugo Weaving is impressive in the role of the Agent Smith.However it does have a few less impressive points, at the end of the film Neo still seems to look very much the rookie in the team even after his heroics, this is probably down to too much of the film's time being spent on Morpheus teaching the hapless Neo how to fight and jump across buildings, and Neo only really discovers his power a few minutes from the end after waking from the dead and immediately defeating Smith, which is probably a little disappointing from the audience's point of view because it would have been brilliant to have seen more of Neo in action.To conclude, the idea behind this film is groundbreaking but there were a number of missed opportunities for expanding on the content, (particularly action sequences). However it does make you desperate to see the sequels!7/10",The Matrix
3449,joel-kainz,Solid Sci-Fi story telling.,9,21 January 2015,"Coming up on almost sixteen years, The Matrix still shines as a solid Sci-fi masterpiece. Amazing character and a well crafted universe that compliments dynamic characters. An amazing soundtrack helps create an atmosphere that can only be described as exciting and gripping. Its bizarre to think that originally will smith was going to be cast to play Neo, but gave up the opportunity in order to pursue the roll of James West in Wild WIld West. Thanks to that decision, we get Keanu, in a roll that oddly really suits his personality. His dead eyes and expressionless acting seem to add to the character of Neo. If there is anything that can take away for this experience, it is probably that some of the visual effects are starting to look a little ""seasoned"". Thats nothing to be surprised about considering that this film is a decade and a half old. Great film all around, would recommend it to anyone.",The Matrix

The matrix is simply the best movie of all. The cast and crew of the movie is magnificent. I'm glad to see a movie that does not take the audience as an object that can not think for them selfs.

3452,charlesbroughton,The Matrix Review,10,29 August 2014,"If you haven't seen The Matrix yet, then all you would have heard of it is that it's simply a jaw- dropping action film with this cool 'bullet-time' thing. But it's much more than just another action movie. It's one that raises pertinent questions to the philosophy of what life really is. Praise should be awarded to the Wachowski's for creating the most original science-fiction film since 'Star Wars'. Although the main ideas of the film are difficult to grasp, the Wachowski's have created a modern adaptation of Plato's Allegory of the Cave by placing it in the technologically advanced world we live in today making it easier for modern audiences to understand. The key to the film's success however does lie in it's spectacular action sequences and pioneering special effects that still continue to amaze audiences today. Amazingly choreographed by legendary action choreographer Woo-ping Yuen, the action sequences are ones that are still unmatched in their amazement even today. Whether you are in the mood for thinking and delving into the questions of whether the life we live is real or simply looking for a good dose of 'bullet-time', then The Matrix is the film that will satisfy any film-goer as it continues to this day to be one of the most original films ever made.",The Matrix

For completing this movie, new effects have been created witch appear in almost every movie made since. The bold move to use real anime-styled immages in their storyboards and daring to accually turn them into camera-shots was thee greatest move ever. Every single frame is a piece of art! Even movies made after comicbooks (spiderman,...) used more classical(and 'safer') camera possitions...(wich is agreat shame) I've seen The Matrix a little over 300 times and I still can't resist myself from popping it in the dvd-player at least once a month!!!I LOVE IT!!!!!!!!!!!",The Matrix

I have also seen Reloade and Revolutions but did not feel that they compared to the first on in the trilogy.  I was dissapointed, and expeected a lot more out of the next two installments. I doubt that there will be another movie that can come close to what this movie brought.  There has only been one other movie that I have anticipated as much as this one, and that is Kill Bill which I will be watching tonight.I highly reccomend this movie, 9/10*.",The Matrix
3455,rainfalling,Bad action movie but a pretty good sci-fi movie,6,17 September 2004,"When I first saw this movie it wasn't the finished version, they hadn't even added all of the music yet. And I thought it was much better that way . The lousy music just destroys too much of the feeling in the movie.Apart from the music, this movie is pretty good for being a big budget movie. The background story is well thought out and doesn't have many holes in it, partly thanks to the fact that they leave most of the missing pieces untouched. But the actual story isn't that well written. It just goes along with the standard action movie pattern. Perhaps that was a trick to try to sell it to a broader audience, but it just drains the substance out of the movie. The characters in the movie lacks any kind of personality, which makes it uninteresting as an action movie. It also makes the love story hard to believe. I'm left without any kind of emotions towards these people, and that makes it useless as an action movie. You need to be able to relate to the characters in some way to be worried if they'll survive or not. And when Trinity tells Neo that she loves him I just though ""What? you have just met and barely spoken to each other. Besides, he's a really boring guy."" it takes a whole lot to be in love with someone that deeply and it just doesn't seem reasonable that she love him. And even if that was true, why would he automatically love her back? That kind of cheap solutions just makes me sick. Why not spend a few nights to figure out a reasonable explanation and make the movie believable? Oh wait, we need a love story so the girls we can sell the movie to the girls as well.The special effects were interesting at the time but after a while they just bores you. The actions scenes aren't very exciting, partly due to the fact I described above, but also due to the lack of creativity. If they would have made the same scenes with the knowledge they have today I bet they could have made them a lot better.The acting in this movie is poor. But that's understandable, they are pretty good actors but the characters they play have no personality to work with. Besides, they have to care about all the technical stuff as well. I think it would be hard for any actor to play good with this kind of script in this kind of environment.So is the movie any good? Well, the idea of a fake world isn't new but it develops it a bit further and it's visualizing it in a pretty good way. So as a sci-fi film it's actually a good one. But as an action film it's below average. But I'd take Donnie Darko or Cube over Matrix as a Sci-Fi film any day, because it's better written and more thought provocative. And I'd take Commando or The Rock over Matrix as an action movie any day, because they are actually entertaining.It's not a bad movie however, and it's an important part of movie history, so if you haven't seen it you probably should. But it's no masterpiece that's for sure. Not all movies has to be that anyway.",The Matrix

Like you aren't such a worthless pile of biological scum, one day you might wake up and find its all a computer sim.Beautiful slow motion bullet casings and guns with realistic top-slide action, drool, guns, drool.Machines' taking over the world is plotline that has been done before, but The Matrix takes the idea to a new and well-constructed level.  The idea that the creation of man would be his downfall is nothing new, however the Symbiosis between the machines and man is interestingly portrayed.If only Keanu Reeves could put a little more time into developing his acting ability, however it wasn't overly required for this film, as the confused or apathetic looks Keanu seems to wear quite often is Adequate.",The Matrix

The Matrix is one of those movies like Usual Suspects which holds you from the opening credits and does not let up til the lights come on in the theater. By now we all know the story behind the Matrix and how great the special effects and action was, but I noticed that most people forgot to mention the depth of the story.Yes! Matrix is an action movie, but it is also Biblical in many ways. Neo is Jesus... he is the ""one"" selected to free the people from persecution. Cypher is the disciple who betrayed Christ... he sold out Morpheous for materialistic items and was then was forever banished from the real world. Morpheous is God... the all knowing, he is everywhere, yet nowhere. And Trinity is the Virgin Mary, for it was her efforts which brought Neo to the ""real world"". Other references include Zion,the Nebucanezhar and the Oracle.I have seen this film three times, will see it again at the theaters and I am definitely going to purchase the DVD on Oct. 5.

I ask you: Why Seraph has YELLOW code in matrix ? Do you understand why? Think it.It's one between hundreds of reflections and questions around matrix. If you see The Matrix several times, you can see incredibles references to others movies and authors.

The acting is believable and sincere, and Keanu Reeves suits his role as the main character perfectly. The visual effects are brilliant and all the stunts are executed without any fault. Watching this movie, I could not believe that it was released in 1999 - the effects and camera-work are so good that they would fit in with the movies being released now, 14 years later. I recommend this movie to anyone who loves action or interesting story lines with an exciting twist. This movie deserves its place in the top 250. I give it a nine out of ten.

Its a high tech sci-fi must see film. inspired by different sources (including Japanese anime), The Matrix is a new kind of movie, a visionary mixture of technology, philosophy and thrilling action.Where other films are done in by the freedom offered by computer effects, The Matrix integrates them beautifully.Exemplifies the idea that a sufficiently cool outcome justifies all of the tortured narrative it takes to get there.",The Matrix
3466,zaeem518,Over All Status,9,5 April 2016,"The Matrix...when I first heard about it, I expected just another sci-fi action thriller. Good and filled with insane stunts, but not terribly intelligent.Boy, was I wrong. Oh, the stunts are there in spades, all right, and yes, they are awesome. And the special effects are absolutely amazing (even if similar ones have been used in other movies as a result- and not explained as well).But the movie has plot as well. It has characters that I cared about. From Keanu Reeves' excellent portrayal of Neo, the man trying to come to grips with his own identity, to Lawrence Fishburne's mysterious Morpheus, and even the creepy Agents, everyone does a stellar job of making their characters more than just the usual action ""hero that kicks butt"" and ""cannon fodder"" roles. I cared about each and every one of the heroes, and hated the villains with a passion. It has a plot, and it has a meaning...and lo and behold, a plot does help the fight scenes! Just try it, if you haven't seen the movie before. Watch one of the fight scenes. Then watch the whole movie. There's a big difference in the feeling and excitement of the scenes- sure, they're great as standalones, but the whole thing put together is an experience unlike just about everything else that's come to the theaters. Think about it next time you're watching one of the more brainless action flicks...think how much better it COULD be.",The Matrix
3467,cezar-freitas-barros,Amazing sci-fi classic,10,6 January 2017,"Matrix is a incredible movie about a dystopian future when the humans lost the war against the machines and are used as crops for generating energy, while a fantasy world is created to give us an illusion as our body energy is drained. The philosophical ideas and discussions held in the film are very deep and well thought, making us think about our own existence and conceptions of reality.The action is amazing and revolutionary for its time, being extremely influential to this day, especially with the so called so famous bullet time, and other things like its art design, costumes, special effects and choreography.The first movie is the best in the trilogy, but if you want to have a better comprehension of world imagined by the wachowski brothers you must watch Matrix: Reloaded and Matrix: Revolutions. These movies are not as good as the first one, but they conclude its philosophy and have some nice dialogues. ""The animatrix"", a animated series of 11 episodes about the universe surrounding the matrix, is very good also, depicting different characters, styles and stories that can be related or not to the movies, and offers an alternate look to the movies! 10/10",The Matrix

But really the main concept in the is actually now turning up in mainstream science. Even though the follow up movies to Matrix weren't able to keep up the standard according to my opinion but this one was really one in a millions. Perhaps this movie can be played in Cinemas again.

I have seen another 1000 movies in the same time frame but The Matrix has a charm and attraction attached to it like none other. Its sleek, stylish and so much substance. This is one movie that makes a compelling case against people who argue that only books have depths, because this movie describes its story, characters and events in a manner that mere words cannot capture.This is my first review on IMDb.com and I am a sort of computer geek and I am being biased and this is my ultimate movie. But when I say I, I am confident that I describe the sentiments of a generation that has grown up under the influence of this movie.That should say it all, but among the many fine qualities of this masterpiece, two stand out for me. One, The Matrix is no doubt the finest computer based science fiction there is, the concept is clearly one of the most imaginative and vivid and detailed piece of genius, and it presents a parallel reality, the possibility of which cannot be completely denied, and its theories on machine and AI development still make sense after 14 years of its release. Secondly, this movie is slick and fast paced, layered with actions sequences that set a precedent both in terms of the creativity and technology with which they were shot, but their emotional, spiritual and existence in the story itself.If you are reading this review after watching the movie (as I often do) then all I have to say is watch it again, there is more there then what you have already seen.Enjoy!!",The Matrix

Another film that is of a different nature but has a similar theme is The Recruit starring Al Pacino and Colin Farrell. In this film set inside the CIA, where Farrell is trying to make sense of who's working who. While the theme and plot of this film are quite exceptional, the most remarkable thing about this movie is the editing. The producers chose to use slow motion in the fight scenes to make the audience feel as if Neo was really faster than a bullet. This type of editing was not new to films but the Matrix definitely perfected it. The editors skillfully created a variety of transitions throughout the film. In some scenes they used inside/out editing to skip from one place to another unfamiliar place. This can be seen in the scene right after Neo takes the pill, the viewer goes from thinking the entire thing is bs, the scene changes quickly to the inside of an incubator-like apparatus that keeps Neo alive to harvest his bio-electric energy as it dumps him out of the waste shoot where he is retrieved by Morpheus, we see rows upon rows and stacks upon stacks of the same type of apparatus that Neo was just in. Another type of transition the editors use is flip frame. The scene abruptly changes from one place to another.",The Matrix

Neo's transformation up until the last movie was pretty much the same though. If you like fighting, shooting, philosophical questions, awesomeness, slow-mo, then this is the movie for you. Neo flying at the end was a bit to much but i guess it fits with him being able to conquer the world that once controlled him. the part where NEO enters Agent smith, that part was a bit puzzling for me, I didn't understand why he would have to do that. Neo needed a new body? he came back to life. what was the purpose of he going in to SMITH? I'm sure Neo didn't know he was going to destroy SMITH by going into his body. or else he would've done the same to the other agents that were in front of him. Then again, he was in a hurry to save Trinity and Morpheus. Oh that's right he was, instead of running to his right to get the phone which he had enough time to do. He goes stands there, stops the bullets, runs into SMITH... Trinity and Morpheus hold on... scares the other agents away, then he runs back to the phone. i guess what I'm trying to say is that the ending could have been better and more rewarding. Neo is basically immortal in the Matrix, his heart stopped, nope, come back to life he says. Smith tried to control him, nope, denied he says. If Neo can defy physics by flying, by stopping bullets in mid air, and coming back to life. why not use that power to stop SMITH in the first place, he stopped bullets, what is he using to stopped them. couldn't he use the same power for other stuff or does it only apply to bullets? If Neo had never gone inside Smith, smith wouldn't had multiplied. I guess Smith was needed to move the plot forward for the next two movies. eventually ending the war between man and machine that went on hundreds of years with a lame truce.",The Matrix

It is not the average ""action packed thriller"" for it is one of few movies that involves so many philosophic implications when concerning the nature of reality. This movie will leave viewers with a plethora of ideas, questions, and inquiries that provide ripe circumstances for post-cinematic discussion. This is what makes the movie so dichotomous: it is a movie for the thinker, the intellectual, and the philosophically bent, and also fills ones desire for two hours of stimulation with thrill and excitement. The movies' psychological implications can best be described in terms of Cartesian dualism, the philosophic term that broadly encompasses Descartes idea theory of perception. What The Matrix and Descartes have in common is the hypothesis that human beings do not have a direct link to reality, that our sensory organs are mere buffers to perceiving reality, therefore, our perception of the physical world exists only within our minds. The question then becomes, if we do not directly see reality, and reality may not resemble what is outside of us, can an outside agent cause and control our ideas? To understand The Matrix is to understand this argument. Obviously, the Wachowski brothers understood this, creating a two-hour psychological and philosophic experience not to be forgotten.",The Matrix

People will say what they want to say about how good The Matrix is but the bottomline is this: finally there's a philosophical film that has cut through this generation. My generation.

At another level the philosophy is also absurd. A key feature is that the Agents are able to go beyond the limitations of the Matrix and perform ""superhuman"" actions. Our hero is someone who - after much searching by Morpheus - is also able to go beyond the limits. However, since all we are talking about here is going beyond a set of computer generated rules why is our hero limited to the same level of skills as the Agents? Why is he not able to go beyond their rules to a still higher level?It was just a flimsy excuse for some fancy effects.",The Matrix
3506,meniscus_lexie,What is the matrix?,10,8 November 2005,"What is the matrix? This is the question we are constantly asking ourselves, as we are absorbed into the web of the film written and directed by the talented Wachowski brothers, Lary and Andy, the creative minds behind the less popular but critically acclaimed 1996 film, Bound as well as the Matrix Trilogy. The Matrix, the first film in the trilogy is about Birth and as we delve deeper into Neo's (Keanu Reeves, Speed, Constantine, Something's Gotta Give) world, the answer to the nagging question unfolds in a slow sprawling way, much like the eerie text of the Matrix code. One doesn't need to be an expert in the field of computer science to understand the techno babble and jargon used by the 'hackers'; a strong background in religion and mythology could be more useful. Throughout the film, the directors rely heavily on religious motifs for places, (the Nebuchadnezzar, Morpheus' ship, which refers to a Bible passage) names, (Neo  referring to The One in Greek mythology or The Saviour Jesus Christ, Trinity, in reference to the Holy Trinity and Morpheus, the god of dreaming and heaven) and events (Neo being killed by the machine-world 'agents' only to be resurrected seventy two seconds later by Trinity, similar to Jesus Christ).All the way through the film, imaginative choices have been made by cinematographer Bill Pope, and art director, Hugh Bateup, which subtly add to the cold harsh world of the Matrix and in contrast, the 'real world'. All the scenes that are set in The Matrix are bathed in a sickly green glow, echoing the text of the Matrix code. Along with this, Neo is always inundated with a harsh, white light, making him appear helpless and week before he is 'unplugged' or enlighten by Morpheus (Lawrence Fishburn). Juxtaposed with this is the metallic blue light that shrouds all the scenes shot in the 'real world'. This contrast isn't noticeable overall, but it delicately and ingeniously gives the audience the feeling that something is slightly off plum within the world of the Matrix and makes for an intensely dramatic and thoroughly thrilling experience. The original score by Composer, Don Davis is spine chilling and foreboding. Relying heavily on brass and percussion for creepy effects, the score, coupled with alternative heavy metal songs, add a manic feel to the film, which accurately depicts the state of mind Neo is in.As well as the impressive casting, Carrie-Anne Moss who completes the threesome as Trinity as well as the rebels nemesis, Agent Smith, played by Australia's Hugo Weaving, whose mechanic voice and excellent expressions are a highlight, the special effects and martial arts are the films greatest achievements. With the legendary Woo-ping Yuen, the master behind such films as Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon and Kill Bill, Vol.2, he brings his speciality of the famous Chinese 'wire-work' to the film, enabling Neo to fly over the city streets and partake in some of the fastest and well choreographed scenes ever seen on film. Coupled with the martial arts are the revolutionary Special Effects, specifically 'Bullet Time' invented by Special Effects wizard John Gaeta which is a technique developed for The Matrix, using a series of still cameras to capture a three-dimensional image of an action whereby the passage of time is slowed down so that an observer can see individual bullets flying throughout the scene at a conceivable rate, usually with their trails made visible. It is often used to create a dramatic effect, and some variations involve rotating the camera view around the slowed-down scene. It was previously referred to by some as ""time slice photography"" but changed for the Matrix due to the scene where Neo dodges the 'agents' bullets for a breathtaking spectacle. It's sure to get audiences clapping in their seats. This film caters for all audiences, the sci-fi fanatics drooling over their computer screens, the interested movie buff, or the ordinary person looking to be blown away by a dazzling concept of an Orwellian future. For those not up to the challenge of an exhausting mental thriller, waiting for the DVD will be equally rewarding, enabling you to watch the film several times to fully grasp the layers the Wachowski brothers have pain-stakingly crafted into the film. The Matrix has been a long time in the making, but it has been well worth the wait and is the type of film that needs to be made to alert people to the brilliance film can still produce. As Agent Smith says, 'That is the sound of inevitability.'",The Matrix

I really liked the first one when it came out. I wasn't at that time aware that there was gonna be two sequels and was pleasantly surprised by the two sequels. When I first saw that scene with The Architect in the second movie I was kinda dumb-founded. But after watching that scene multiple times I have kinda begun to understand what the writers were trying to say. There were sum really good scenes in all these movies be them action scenes or philosophical dialog scenes. I would recommend this movie to anyone who is into action in any way and of course to people who are into watching sumthin that just might touch your mind as well.I cant say that this is my absolute favorite movie because I do have a few others that I like more.

3509,Riley_Hughes,"""The Matrix,"" A Genre Game-Changer",10,27 August 2013,"When the Wachowskis released ""The Matrix"" in 1999, it marked the dawn of a new age for the science fiction and action genres with the numerous technical and aesthetic innovations it contributed to the film industry. These would go on to earn it the widespread recognition of being one of the most important films of its generation, as well as quite arguably one of the greatest sci-fi films of its generation. At the time, few could have anticipated that such an edgy, high concept, and quasi-religious film would achieve the blockbuster success in which it did. Most assuredly technological advances in graphics, such as the ""bullet time"" technique developed specifically for the film, and an innovated aesthetic to the complexity of choreographed fight sequences, are factors contributing to its earned acclaim. However, one of the most critical elements, which has and will continue to contribute to the film's success, was the innovative postmodern hybrid score that Don Davis wrote for the film. Davis made unique orchestration decisions that were foreign to the popular trends in scoring at the time, and he constructed textural motives instead of themes to portray concepts pertaining to the film as opposed to the more traditional approach of creating thematically driven material designed to quite often score the characters. In doing so, he offered a unique sonic perspective and aesthetic quite fitting for such a mind-blowing and thought-provoking film which persuaded the critics, cult enthusiasts, and fans alike to take the red pill and happily tumble down the rabbit hole.",The Matrix

One can surely get an Ph.d degree working on it. These are exteriors which are beautifully sculpted. But the main thing which makes the movie outstanding is it's message which it tries to convey. The idea that we are in a matrix(mayajaal) from Indian philosophy. & this is where it triumphs . Neo is a seeker of truth. Morpheus being his rightful guide(spiritual Guru). Agents being different form negativities which will try to block your spiritual ascent. The computer generated world is what we see in our daily life but would never understand till we'r self-realized, as Neo in last lines says to get connected i.e. to the all pervading superpower & only then we will know our real powers surely we will may not start flying like superman, but may be it's a possibility. But surely one's perception will change a lot, (symbolically: Neo sees the code going through matrix).

The rest of the trilogy was still good because it was an entire story. I feel like the 1st Matrix was just so eye opening. The way the writer described the world makes it believe that we are truly living in a Matrix. Since this movie came out I feel like the world has slowly opened their eyes to this idea of an alternate reality. There is no one else that could have played Neo but Mr. Reeve's.. He was talked bad upon because of the way he acts but that's him. If Will Smith would have locked down the role of Neo I don't think I would have liked the movie the same. Morpheus was such a big role for anyone to play. He is the reason why the Matrix exists. Without him finding it and trying to find the one, everyone in the world stays asleep.. I also feel like we are in a Matrix and wish Morpheus would call me to give me a pill. Favorite line from the movie... "" Yeah everyday, it's called mescaline.""

When enter the virtual world, the participant's senses interpret the experience of taste, touch, smell, hear, and see as real. In the virtual world, pain feels real, and fatal injuries in the virtual world can lead to death in the real world. The world of the matrix is attractive to participants because of the supernatural ability and unlimited potential they experience in the Matrix. In the Matrix, you can jump distances that defy the concepts of time and gravity; one can even dodge a point blank incoming bullet. Doesn't that sound like the 2010 movie Inception? The Matrix is one of those movies that introduced a new idea to the big screen. Written and directed by Lana Wachowski and Andy Wachowski, The Matrix wind around the theme of extraordinary human reflection. The movie stared Keanu Reeves (Neo), Carrie-Anne Moss (Trinity), Laurence Fishburne (Morpheus), and Hugo Weaving (Agent Smith). The success of the movie had called for two more movies, and in 2013, Agent Smith made a small comeback with a Matrix style commercial called ""Agent of Good"".Just when everyone was waiting for the coming of Y2K, the movie The Matrix brought a very brilliant idea around the thought that advance technology may be appealing, but there also is the what if possibility that the machine we have created will one day take over our world. While the idea of the human race being menaced is not original to The Matrix, the graphics, and editing work make placed it in category above the rest. From the opening scene, begin with a fast changing computer code that formed The Matrix and the secret conversation between two agents' conversing on a secured telephone line that will soon be breached by Agent Smith and his other virtual team of police officers. In this early scene, the director introduced the technique of freezing the action and zoomed in camera movement to illustrate speed and unbelievable human reflexes. This technique is called time slicing; it is used throughout the entire movie.The movie gave a more modernized version of those Chinese Kun Fu masters who can jump and make precise fighting moves that we imitated and admired as kids. We will always love movies like that; they inspire us, they make us believe in the possibility that we too could be someone of incredible abilities. We can only imagine how long it took the crew team to make such a great blend of graphic and sounds that makes The Matrix the king of time slicing techniques.",The Matrix

They've made a fundamental discovery about the world: It doesn't exist. It's actually a form of Virtual Reality, designed to lull us into lives of blind obedience to the ""system."" We obediently go to our crummy jobs every day, little realizing, as Morpheus tells Neo, that ""Matrix is the wool that has been pulled over your eyes--that you are a slave."" The rebels want to crack the framework that holds the Matrix in place, and free mankind. Morpheus believes Neo is the Messianic ""One"" who can lead this rebellion, which requires mind power as much as physical strength. Arrayed against them are the Agents, who look like Blues Brothers. The movie's battles take place in Virtual Reality; the heroes' minds are plugged into the combat. (You can still get killed, though: ""The body cannot live without the mind""). ""Jacking in"" like this was a concept in ""Strange Days"" and has also been suggested in novels by William Gibson (""Idoru"") and others. The notion that the world is an artificial construction, designed by outsiders to deceive and use humans, is straight out of ""Dark City."" Both of those movies, however, explored their implications as the best science fiction often does. ""Dark City"" was fascinated by the Strangers who had a poignant dilemma: They were dying aliens who hoped to learn from human methods of adaptation and survival.",The Matrix

Not merely because I thought it was cool and had a lot of action in it. No, the reason why I liked it was because there was so much truth in it. The idea behind The Matrix was that the ""real"" world is veiled to humans. The world that humans live in is an world full of indulgence and ignorance. This connects to the beliefs of Christianity, and that the world we live in is controlled by Satan, who wants us to believe that we live in a good world. Because of this, we are blinded to the truth. Neo and the other rebels connect to today's Christians, who understand this fact, and do their best to rebel against the enemy, which is the world they once lived in. This analogy that the directors used is great way to unveil the truth of the world, and for that reason I give it a 10.",The Matrix

3522,JonConstantine,Dodge This.,10,22 March 2005,"Let's start with the basics. If you've seen The Matrix, you know all about the surface story - how Artificial Intelligence created a computer construct (The Matrix) of OUR present day world and, through a hardwire directly into the brain, fed it to us humans who were, in reality, kept in incubators and used for their energy output as a power source for the Artificial Intelligence. In other words, our ""reality"" exists ONLY in our minds. Everything we ""experience""; everything we ""do"" - it's all just a dream! But a small band of FREED humans live in the real world and fight against the subjugation of mankind by the machines. Their ultimate goal is to destroy The Matrix and end the domination of the machines. How do they go about doing this? They find a man within The Matrix (Thomas A. ""Neo"" Anderson) who develops the ability to defeat the Artificial Intelligence within the Matrix and begin the process of restoring man to his rightful place as THE sentient species on the planet. The Matrix is a very fine high-tech, futuristic, sci-fi action flick. But,.....look deeper,.....there is so much more going on in this film ........ This is (without a doubt) thee best movie out there, therefore i give this flawless dream movie a perfect 10/10 stars.

This movie became a part of history of cinema and in peoples mind, because still nowadays this movie comes up on any conversation that people have about cinema, and in cinema is quite easy to notice the effects that this movie had, we just need to compare the way of filming actions sequences,the photography and the visual effects in the movies before 1999 and after 1999. Even in publicity we notice that. In my opinion there are three big changes in cinema history, they are: the black and white movies to colour movies, the silent movies to sound movies and before Matrix and after Matrix. Probably without the making of the Matrix, movies like Lord of the Rings couldn't be done in this early century but only, perhaps, twenty years from now.

How totally unrealistic the scenario was, with people, objects, bullets and other stuff flying around in slow motion, with things going on in his head and also not, at the same time. Make up your mind, I would say. It made watching this thing very very boring, enough to switch to an ordinary program on TV.

It explodes with dazzling visuals and a transcendent sense of excitement. Where other films are done in by the freedom offered by computer effects, The Matrix integrates them beautifully. Inspired by different sources (including Japanese anime), The Matrix is a new kind of movie, a visionary mixture of technology, philosophy and thrilling action.

No just political views of directors, but also strong influence of directors religious ideas are put in this movie. Never the less very much worth of watching!

There aren't many films where the final conclusion remains unclear, but in the case of this story, it works well. the underlying theme is how we are fooled by the system,somehow controlled.This first instalment sets the pace and clues for the viewer to THINK about the film. As the trilogy unfolds, it is suggested that Neo's actions and predicaments have been played out over and over again. Zion's citizens may not have achieved freedom this time round - or have they? This film quickly establishes the characters,and the actors deliver a great performance that is a challenge for such a cerebral film.

Just the confrontation with philosophical questions of our life and the ""fantasy of science-fiction"" makes this movie to one of the must-seen films in history. I don't think that Matrix just got his success with the really cool presentation, more important the mix of the really well told story, character development and environment complexity gives the movie the required plus to be a 10 Star movie.

3534,joshsykes20,Truly brilliant in every way,10,6 May 2015,"Firstly the brilliance of this film cannot be justified within a review, every aspect is fantastic and well thought out. I watched this for the first time as a purely action film and I was not disappointed the visuals are spectacular and still are even today 16 years later which is utterly astounding. An example of a film from the same time frame would be The Mummy, with a larger budget and a similar focus placed on visuals it does not come anywhere close to the same standard as The Matrix. The story is equally fantastic, it is beautifully complex and engrossing. The basis of the story is simple enough that the world is controlled by machines and effectively the world that every one lives in is purely a computer generated fantasy designed to give the illusion of living. There are however layers upon layers to the story which you realise the more you watch it. You are never bored and there is always some aspect that is new each time you watch it. There are also different connotations within the film to various philosophies, beliefs and religions, some easily noticeable such as Neo being a Messiah figure and a saviour to all that follow him (like Jesus). Others are maybe not as obvious but the philosophy of ""thinking for one self"" is also heavily featured in the film, as is the degree of choice we possess in a modern world, therefore posing the question are we truly free? These factors make the film more and more interesting every time, spotting various little factors you may miss. Keanu Reeves as the main character Thomas Anderson/Neo may not be the best performance in the film but his portrayal is exactly what the film required and therefore is brilliant. All the other characters are all also fantastic with stand out performances from Laurence Fishburne and Hugo Weaving as Morpheus and Agent Smith. Fishburne conveys his characters beliefs and wisdom with such ease it is almost soothing, as you are also convinced yourself of his beliefs watching it. Hugo Weaving on the other hand manages to produce a sadistic evil character without really using emotions or changing his voice, instead he uses an almost monotonous tone and his emotions are translated through the use of language which Hugo conveys masterfully. The battle internally with his relationship with both machine and human is effectively shown through the characters language and actions. All the actors/actresses produced great performances and it I could i would praise them all, other notable mentions of underrated performances are for Joe Pantoliano and Carrie-Anne Moss as Trinity and Cypher, both totally different but equally convincing in there roles. Overall from my point of view I don't feel there is a more complete film, The Wachowskis have made a film that transcends across most genres making it a film for everyone. I don't think there ever will be another original film ever that poses so many questions and gets you thinking more than The Matrix. You can almost see yourself as at least one of the characters in the film and have an ability to relate. The most important factor to me however is the fact that it leaves the mystery of whether it is real or not, as you could never technically know. I like the fact is makes you question yourself as to whether this could be possible, obviously some sci-fi films are totally ridiculous and cannot happen but this forever will pose the question.Simply put, to me this film is the greatest ever made and possibly will be for some time to come.",The Matrix

I'll be honest I wasn't sure Keanu Reeves could pull off such a dramatic role, but like so many others, I was relieved to be proved wrong. I believe to this day this movie still feels fresh and does not seem dated at all. I loved the entire trilogy but as most will also attest the first one made the best sense!

I cared about each and every one of the heroes, and hated the villains with a passion. It has a plot, and it has a meaning...and lo and behold, a plot does help the fight scenes! Just try it, if you haven't seen the movie before. Watch one of the fight scenes. Then watch the whole movie. There's a big difference in the feeling and excitement of the scenes- sure, they're great as standalones, but the whole thing put together is an experience unlike just about everything else that's come to the theaters.

3538,hayes_tanner,Originality and Direction,9,17 February 2014,"Is the world that we know today really what it seems? Does it seem like we live an orchestrated life defined by what society deems as important? And does it seem that our lives are overly governed by the many rules of both man and nature? These questions are the main currents of Andy and Lana Wachowski's movie The Matrix which challenges what we see as reality today. Thomas A. Anderson, an orchestrated computer programmer during the day, lives a dual life where he is known as Neo online through his late night computer hacking. Beyond his day job Neo, played by Keanu Reaves, has always sensed and imagined that there was something hidden elsewhere beyond what he considered reality at the time. After receiving messages and a phone call from an unknown source later identified as Morpheus, played by Laurence Fishbourne, Neo joins a rebellion and becomes aware of the struggle to battle a war against machines in a post human driven world known as the matrix. The matrix is a software system imposed on humans by machines that limits their understanding and capabilities of reality. Neo becomes ""the one"" as referred to by Morpheus. He is pressed with the problem of breaking the bounds of the matrix and freeing mankind from the control of the machines before the last known unrestricted humans are eliminated. Neo along with his arch rival Agent Smith, who is a machine within human form, counter each other's personalities in a way that makes the distinction between man and machine that much greater. Agent smith, played by Hugo Weaving, illustrates the emotionless task oriented function of machines. His name in particular suggests the generalization and uniformity of machines. Neo's name contrasts this generalization expressing the individuality of humans as a representative symbol. Hugo Weaving's deep monotonic tone compared to Neo's softer relaxed tone contrasts each other's characters further against one other leading to an even greater distinction between man and machines.Adding to the distinction of the men controlled by the machines and the men aware of the society ran by the matrix, is the acting of Laurence Fishbourne. Fishbourne as Morpheus is part of the rebellion against the matrix and separates himself from the matrix by his aurora as an all knowing character. His elevated presence and his subtle cues of knowing what is to come next lead to the greater disparity between himself and the people around him. These details portrayed by the main actors lead to the best illustration of a thematic idea unprecedented in a movie up until today.That unprecedented idea is a movie based on what seems to be reality versus what reality actually is. Likewise artificial intelligence used by mankind in turn fights itself against man in a way that ironically makes humans look less human in the machine made artificial reality. A complex and highly in depth idea for any person to think of let alone direct and visualize clearly. Irony plays it's part also in the scene that describes how machines took over the world during the turn of the 20th century. Instead of humans using machines to help in their energy consumption, Andy and Lana Wachowski have turned the tables in this film. Machines instead farm humans in order to get their energy to run and operate the matrix. The dominator and dominated have essentially flipped roles. The originality of the futuristic film The Matrix questions the viewers perception of what is and isn't real while the actors used within the film support the direction that the film takes which ultimately leaves the viewers questioning and wanting to see more!",The Matrix

Directed by Andy Wachowski and Lana Wachowski, this film takes you on a journey and is full of top notch action. The concept of this film is the magnet that pulls you into the center of The Matrix. The journey of ""The One"", is definitely not your typical hero scenario. Instead of a hero who is established or aware of his abilities you see a stranger amongst strangers trying to adapt to a new life. As Neo's consciousness matures so does his faith and belief's. This well sculpted film requires imagination in order to grasp the story. In my opinion, The Matrix does not fall short in any area. It is a nonstop entertaining ride which leaves you on the edge of your seat wondering what will happen next. I honestly, did not want this trilogy to come to an end.

3544,aitelmaalem,this is a best movie,9,4 May 2014,"The Matrix is a 1999 American science fiction action film written and directed by The Wachowski Brothers, starring Keanu Reeves, Laurence Fishburne, Carrie-Anne Moss, Hugo Weaving, and Joe Pantoliano. It depicts a dystopian future in which reality as perceived by most humans is actually a simulated reality called ""the Matrix"", created by sentient machines to subdue the human population, while their bodies' heat and electrical activity are used as an energy source. Computer programmer ""Neo"" learns this truth and is drawn into a rebellion against the machines, which involves other people who have been freed from the ""dream world"".The Matrix is known for popularizing a visual effect known as ""bullet time"", in which the heightened perception of certain characters is represented by allowing the action within a shot to progress in slow-motion while the camera's viewpoint appears to move through the scene at normal speed. The film is an example of the cyberpunk science fiction genre.[4] It contains numerous references to philosophical and religious ideas, and prominently pays homage to works such as Plato's Allegory of the Cave, Jean Baudrillard's Simulacra and Simulation and Lewis Carroll's Alice's Adventures in Wonderland. The Wachowskis' approach to action scenes drew upon their admiration for Japanese animation and martial arts films, and the film's use of fight choreographers and wire fu techniques from Hong Kong action cinema was influential upon subsequent Hollywood action film productions.The Matrix was first released in the United States on March 31, 1999, and grossed over $460 million worldwide. It was generally well-received by critics, and won four Academy Awards as well as other accolades including BAFTA Awards and Saturn Awards. Reviewers praised The Matrix for its innovative visual effects, cinematography and its entertainment. The film's premise was both criticized for being derivative of earlier science fiction works, and praised for being intriguing. The action also polarized critics, some describing it as impressive, but others dismissing it as a trite distraction from an interesting premise.Despite this, the film has since appeared in lists of the greatest science fiction films, and in 2012, was added to the National Film Registry for preservation. The success of the film led to the release of two feature film sequels, both written and directed by the Wachowski Brothers, The Matrix Reloaded and The Matrix Revolutions. The Matrix franchise was further expanded through the production of comic books, video games, and animated short films in which the Wachowskis were heavily involved.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cfFYzZ6w08g",The Matrix

3550,edward86-34-405121,15 years later The Matrix's still shows strong.,10,22 June 2014,"With another Wachowski brothers movie on the horizon, I thought it appropriate to go back and review their first ambitious offering. For a movie that was produced in early 1999, everything about the movie still feels new. Of course some of the tech has changed over the past 15 years but it's not a hard stretch to picture that this movie takes place in today's world. The movie challenges the viewer with questions we have all asked ourselves, What would I do to preserve or gain freedom? , Is reality real? and Do I control my future or is it already decided for me by fate? The theme the Wachowski brothers present in the movie is one of basic human needs, one all humans can relate to, freedom and freewill. This theme is presented early as we discover Thomas Anderson, played by Keanu Reeves, is leading a double life. One where in the day time he is working for a successful software company as a developer and at night he is known as the underground hacker Neo. For those that know, working a 9 to 5 job is necessary but sometimes feels like a prison. I believe this is why the alter ego of Neo personifies the act of expressing freedom. By actively defying the man, Neo shows that there is something missing in his existence that he is trying to fill. This is where Morpheus, played by Laurence Fishburne, comes into the picture. He offers Neo a chance to find out what true freedom is by offering a way out of his normal routine with a simple choice, red pill or blue pill. Neo chooses to ""go down the rabbit hole"" and this is where he and the viewer discovers that the reality presented previous to this moments was all a simulation known as the Matrix that robots had created to simulate actual existence in order to keep the humans complacent as a power source. Once Neo is ejected from the Matrix he learns that the real reality is one that is bleak. The world has all but been destroyed in a human versus robot war that lead to the near extinction of the human race and the near destruction of earth. He is presented with a reality were humans are not the dominate species, but one that live a life of fear and seclusion. This motif paints a desolate picture and makes the viewer and Neo question wither it was the right decision to leave the Matrix. This plays well into the threat to the real reality, as among them, Cypher, played by Joe Pantoliano, does not think the ""real"" reality was the right choice at all and would do anything to ""be ignorant"" once again. Once we learn of the Matrix, the Wachowski brothers use some interesting techniques in their filming to highlight the hyper-reality of the matrix. They accomplish this in many of the action scenes of the movie by using the slow motion effect to emphasize the speed at which the humans that are jacked into the matrix can move. One scene in particular is where Neo successfully avoids being shot by moving out of the way of bullets as they are hurling towards him. The main conflict in the story is between the machines and the humans. The machine want to extinguish any remaining human resistance so they can continue to use the human as a power source unchallenged. They do this in the real world by deploying very aggressive, seek and destroy tactics executed by Sentinel robots. Likewise in the matrix there are regulator programs know as ""Agents"" that are actively policing any anomalies like foreign minds in the system. These oppressive concepts tie right back into the main them of freedom and freewill, the one thing the humans are seeking for themselves and all of the other humans trapped in the matrix. The key component in this conflict is Neo. He is recognized as ""The One"" that can over through the system, however it is not always clear if he is the actual One or not. There is a scene shortly after Neo exits the matrix where he is taken to see a prophet known as The Oracle, played by Gloria Foster. In his meeting with the Oracle she tells Neo that he is in fact not the one and challenges him with a life or death scenario. This is where the theme of freewill versus fate come into the balance as Neo struggles with what was revealed to him. As the movie plays out Neo is revealed to truly be ""The One"" as he chooses to not let Morpheus sacrifice himself based on what was revealed to him by the Oracle. In this act he reveals that he indeed can manipulate the matrix to his own will. However it is not fully revealed until Neo actually dies. In this scene the sound is focused on Trinity's voice, played by Carrie-Anne Moss, as she explains that Neo cannot be dead because the Oracle told her that she would fall in love with ""The One"". Just at the nick of time as the Sentinels were destroying the human ship, Neo reanimates and now has full control of the Matrix and destroys Agent Smith , played by Hugo Weaving, just before exiting the Matrix in time to destroy the Sentinels with an EMP. The Matrix does a very good job at emphasizing its theme of freedom and freewill. The use of a great story and ground breaking visual effects for its time, really make this movie withstand the test of time and makes it and instant classic. I do not anticipate any time in the foreseeable future that a viewer will not be able to relate to the theme presented in the movie. If history has taught us anything, it's that freedom and freewill will always be front and foremost on the minds of all human beings.",The Matrix
3551,piyush-sharma301,Blew me away,10,1 October 2016,I was blown away when I first watched the Matrix. The story is quite interesting and innovative and raises a lot of questions. Are we living in a computer program and How do we find out? How much advancements can we make in the field of AI? The movie stayed true to the Computer programs in the real world. It explains quite beautifully each and every aspect of the Matrix and how it linked the computer world to the real life aspects in the Matrix. This movie really is an exercise for the brain. The direction of the movie was great. I enjoyed the action sequences. Also the Choreography for the Kung-Fu sequence was great. I also liked Keanu Reeves and Laurence Fishburne as Neo and Morpheus respectively. I think that The Matrix is one of the best Sci-Fi movie ever made and is a must watch for anyone related to computers.,The Matrix

The Matrix is not a typical cliché full sci-fi movie as it gives you another meaning to life and the scary and very possible chance that it could be real. I won't give much away as it would ruin the movie completely. I rated The Matrix 10/10 straight away because the movie blows your mind as it is action packed, full of awesome scenes and a selection of great actors. The Matrix is currently 19th on the IMDb top 250 movies and deservedly so as many people would agree, the Matrix is definitely of the greatest movies ever made.

3554,abhi-iitk16,The Matrix - Are we really free and self controlled ?,9,1 September 2014,"The Matrix is a science fiction action thriller movie. It depicts a future in which humans are being controlled and their world is being simulated by large network of machines and highly intelligent programs. And everything that any human senses (touch, feel, see) is just a dream. The human body's heat and electrical activities are being used as energy source by the machines.Meanwhile there is a group of human beings who are free and are fighting for freedom. Their leader Morpheus (Laurence Fishburne) believes that Neo (Keanu Reeves) is ""the one"" and that one day he will free them all. In dream world Neo is hacker, he is approached by Morpheus to join them.Initially he hesitates but at the end Neo joins them. Initially Neo doesn't believes that he is ""the one"" but at the end he realizes about his unbounded power and fights against the machine's protector programs and kills one of them, which was thought to be impossible till then.The movie revolves around Neo , Morpheus , Trinity(Carrie-Anne Moss) and agent Smith(Hugo Weaving). Neo and Trinity like each other but Trinity reveals it only at the end. Overall its an action packed movie. Initially it is really hard to understand what's going on in the movie. As movie begins by redefining the nature of reality but when one starts to understand that what is going on it becomes very interesting. Since its an imaginary world the action scenes are quite amusing and exciting. The Matrix did not bore me at all except for the starting half hour. But later the plot turned out to be very interesting. At the end I was so much interested that I watched its part 2 and part 3 on same day. For part 1 I had hoped that something more would have happened at the end of it. But anyway, overall it was a nice movie. A recommended movie to watch for those who love action , science fiction or thriller movies.",The Matrix

So what makes this movie so memorable? There are more than one reason for this situation. This movie reconstructed the genre of science fiction as it worked the story. Just like a 2001 space saga. Of course, the use of visual effects that have not been seen before has a great share in this. Movie script editing acting is another point in the eyes of cinema lovers with its way of telling the story, sound montage and camera angles.
The philosophical sub-texts in its content are also among the topics to be discussed.
We see that there are also clear references to the anticipation of the human being.

3557,o_watkins,Whoa...!,1,28 October 2005,"I mean really, how can this drivel make it into the all time greatest top-40. I baffles me, stupefies me, that so many people really like this movie. Keanus acting was so terrible I felt like my mind was going to explode, while all the other actors moved about in such a pretentious solemn stupor that I just couldn't care for the characters they were supposed to represent. Excessive use of sunglasses, trench-coats and ""revolutionary"" stop motion action sequences just added to the pointlessness of the film. When the plot got so confused and muddled two thirds of the way through, the only solution is to bring out the big guns and have a mass gory bloody shoot-out, which completely offsets the amateurish philosophical babble at the start.Like many others on this board that gave it a one, I tried to see the film a few more times to ""get it"" or whatever.

She likes watching him. How long has she been watching him? We get a possible clue from the transmission date.

3564,lsowders2,Innovative Elements: The Matrix,9,16 December 2014,"Innovative Elements: The MatrixComputer programmer by day and computer hacker by night: Neo, played by actor Keanu Reeves, is led down a path to discover what the matrix really is. With the help of Morpheus (Lawrence Fishburne) and a rag tag team of computer hackers, Neo makes a choice to seek the truth. This Sci-Fi action thriller is full of mind-bending chases, gravity-defying action, and kung-fu-packed fight scenes that blow your mind time and time again. Neo is contacted by a mysterious message that appears on his computer asking, ""Do you want to know what the matrix is?"" As he is following clues to the truth, the path becomes shaky, and he does not know if he is dreaming or awake along the way. Neo eventually discovers the answer, and the dream quickly becomes reality—a reality leaving Neo wondering if he really wanted to know the truth. The Matrix was filmed using a dark green filter, creating an eerie ambiance that contributes to the mystery behind Matrix. The main setting for the movie takes place in the dark side of New York's grimy subways, back alleys, and abandoned buildings. The New York backdrop makes for some great chase scenes with characters ducking in and out of buildings, leaping across rooftops, through apartment buildings, and down fire escapes. The movie is full of groundbreaking special effects that set the stage for what we see in movies today. The director uses multiple cameras, slow motion effects, computer-generated imagery, and the help of guide wires to create an out-of-this-world experience that defies physics. The tone of bad-assery is set in the opening scene where the character Trinity (Carrie-Anne Moss) has been captured by the police, but not for long. She explodes into the air, and the frame is frozen; the camera circles around her creating a 180-degree swooping effect before she unleashes a furious kick to one of the cop's chest and sends him flying into the wall. In another scene, Neo dodges three bullets with an incredible back bend. The scene is in slow motion, and the viewer is able to see the bullets ripple in the air, embellishing Neo's prowess as the ""Chosen One."" The high-action fight scenes are full of gravity-defying maneuvers that to the viewer are made believable because of the amazing special effects. The Matrix was a stepping stone for modern-day special effects; compared to today's standard, they seem a little slower and not quite as polished, but it's important to recognize how cutting edge this movie was for 1999. The camera work throughout is amazing, as multiple views and cameras are used throughout the whole film. This is one of the main ingredients in creating drama, suspense, and unbelievable action. The scenes are all well thought out with meticulous attention to detail. One scene in particular, where Neo is asked to take the red pill or to take the blue pill, takes place in the reflection of Morpheus' sunglasses. You are able to see both of Morpheus' hands—one holding the red pill in the right sunglass lens, one holding the blue pill in the left sunglass lens, while Neo debates his choice—all in the reflection of Morpheus' glasses. The film is full of these little details and camera tricks that paved the way for movies today. Though the movie is fast paced, it is also long and at times hard to follow. If one doesn't have patience, or does not particularly like science fiction, this movie might not be the best choice. As in most sci-fi or action movies, the dialog can at times be a little cheesy, and the viewer might find some of the acting a little over the top. If you have been passing on The Matrix, its time you stop. The choreography and setting dance hand in hand to a techno-driven soundtrack that never skips a beat. This film is packed with action and backed by a complex story that leaves the viewer anticipating the sequel. Be prepared for your mind to be blown! This classic is cutting edge for its time, crossing multiple genres and delivering on all levels. The Matrix leaves the viewer thirsty for answers and questioning existence.",The Matrix

Every time I watch I focus in on philosophical side and this makes you see the movie in a new different way. The sequences looses a bit of this element, thats why for me this is the best of the 3.

Both in style and theme I think there is a fair bit of eastern influence. I can't cite exact examples but some of it's obvious. Namely the marital arts centric style of violence. The Matrix is a unique film that was of course influential but also it wasn't, in that it's digital brand of mysteries that shift the paradigm of reality has never been totally topped.

3574,tijmenmassier,Philosophic,9,4 March 2015,"The movie ""The Matrix"" is going about Neo. Neo lives in a fake world called the Matrix, the real world is taken over by robots. The people who are still in the Matrix, don't know anything of the real world. Plato, a Greek philosopher, had a passage called the ""Allegory of the Cave"". In this passage, Plato says: people has to imagine that everybody lives in a cave. We are prisoners and we can't escape or move. We only have to look at a wall with shadows. Plato says that we will think these shadows are the truth. when a prisoner is outside, the outside will be really sharp (example: a sharp sun). but once he is endorsed, it will be way more nicer outside. This is nearly the same as in the movie ""The Matrix"", we all live in a fake world (cave=matrix) and there are some people who want to go out the fake world (Neo). So the Matrix is a really psychological/philosophic movie. That makes it a really nice movie! Watch it! (Also a psychological/philosophic movie: They live)",The Matrix

A landmark science fiction masterpiece, that set a whole new standard for out-of-the-box film-making. Keanu Reeves may be dryer than a stick under the scorching California sun, but I still think he was one of the greatest of all possible casting choices for Neo. The true scene-stealer of the film, however, is the mesmerizingly brilliant Hugo Weaving, as the chilling and calculative Agent Smith. He isn't the typical villain, but an extremely intelligent baddie, whose every utterance is a fascinating piece of his multi-faceted, yet cold-hearted mind. Of course, the real crowd-drawer here though, is the visually spectacular special effects. At the time of release, they made everything that came before it virtually obsolete. While it isn't a perfect creation (no movie truly is), it's still pretty much as close as you can get.

3579,dominicgreyson,NR · 2010 · 2hr 16min · Sci-Fi,8,13 August 2015,"I agree with mambubukids review about the matrix here is what he said.The story of a reluctant Christ-like protagonist set against a baroque, MTV backdrop, The Matrix is the definitive hybrid of technical wizardry and contextual excellence that should be the benchmark for all sci-fi films to come.Hollywood has had some problems combining form and matter in the sci-fi genre. There have been a lot of visually stunning works but nobody cared about the hero. (Or nobody simply cared about anything.) There a few, though, which aroused interest and intellect but nobody 'ooh'-ed or 'aah'-ed at the special effects. With The Matrix, both elements are perfectly en sync. Not only did we want to cheer on the heroes to victory, we wanted them to bludgeon the opposition. Not only did we sit in awe as Neo evaded those bullets in limbo-rock fashion, we salivated.But what makes The Matrix several cuts above the rest of the films in its genre is that there are simply no loopholes. The script, written by the Wachowski brothers is intelligent but carefully not geeky. The kung-fu sequences were deftly shot -- something even Bruce Lee would've been proud of. The photography was breathtaking. (I bet if you had to cut every frame on the reel and had it developed and printed, every single frame would stand on its own.) And the acting? Maybe not the best Keanu Reeves but name me an actor who has box-office appeal but could portray the uneasy and vulnerable protagonist, Neo, to a T the way Reeves did. But, come to think of it, if you pit any actor beside Laurence Fishburne, you're bound to confuse that actor for bad acting. As Morpheus, Mr. Fishburne is simply wicked! Shades of his mentor-role in Higher Learning, nobody exudes that aura of quiet intensity than Mr. Fishburne. His character, battle-scarred but always composed Morpheus, is given an extra dose of mortality (He loves Neo to a fault.) only Mr. Fishburne can flesh out.People will say what they want to say about how good The Matrix is but the bottomline is this: finally there's a philosophical film that has cut through this generation. My generation. The Wachowski brothers probably scribbled a little P.S. note when they finished the script saying: THINK FOR A MOMENT ABOUT YOUR EXISTENCE. What is the Matrix, you ask? Something that's closer to reality than you think.",The Matrix

3581,creator_of_lightnings,Matrix Trio - The Best I've ever recommended !,10,27 June 2005,"From the first part to the third, Matrix affected my own life in a way no other movie ever had. The ""will"" element and its power against one's determined destiny mixed with one other powerful factor - ""love"" - have been shown to become enough material in man's possession so as to fight against the most powerful beings at the era in which the movie takes place. The three parts altogether raise Neo from a ""simple hacker"" to ""someone special"". And during this, he learns how his own will can help him to step on the way to fulfill a prophecy he first didn't even believe to exist. The movie also warns about the cliché of ""rise of machines against human race"" which is way more outstandingly depicted within ""The Matrix"" (specially in the third part), compared to its other peers. The dialog between Neo and Morpheus in the first part and the one between Neo and The Architect at the third part are seamless. Overally, the movie begins with the action-philosophic first part, rolls on with the action scenes with new ideas in the second, and ends with a fantastic plot in the last part.",The Matrix
3582,dylanwaby,Overrated but still fun,5,31 July 2016,"The Matrix is overrated. Accept it, and move on. Anyway, with that out of the way, my review. The Matrix, which is heralded as a modern masterpiece of action cinema is actually a fun if silly piece of light entertainment. The action is exciting, but it is weighed down by a dull script and endless, boring exposition. The second act is essentially just lots of talking, and exposition, which isn't a great idea when your plot is stupid and your characters one-dimensional, although Keanu Reeves is always fun to watch. The action scenes are extremely slick and stylish, and mostly cgi-less which gives them an edge over modern action scenes. The art design surprised me, as it looked unique if a little Alien inspired. Overall, it was a fun if slightly pretentious and shallow action movie.",The Matrix

The CG for all the 3 films were very well done. The acting by the whole cast was spot on and I never felt like disinterested. The action scenes were great and they always brought something new in each film. Each film also brought in new heroes and villains to keep the storyline going while further seeing new faces. The pace of the storyline was great. Starting off slow in the first then picking it up more in the second and then delivering a huge finish in the third film.

3587,blackmailer-1,The Matrix or the beginning of a new religion,9,6 September 2005,"What can we say about The Matrix except it's a preview of a new religion !Indeed, the movie of the Washowsky brothers is nothing more than a preview of a new religion. Perhaps not a new one but it takes all the characteristics of a religion. The heros, Neo or Thomas Anderson, is a character that is present in every religion (Moïse for the Jewish religion, Jesus in the catholic one and Mahomet for the Muslims). The one who, even if he doesn't know who he is, will reveal the Truth to all the Humans ... Moreover, as in every religion, there is the character of the believer. In this movie this character is present through Morpheus. A character whose the faith is blind and will lead him until, if it is necessary, his death. Morpheus believes so much in Neo that he is ready to give his life if it will help Neo to destroy the machines ... And as in every religion, the Good is fighting against the Bad side of the universe. In The Matrix, this Bad side is representing by the Agents and precisely by one : Agent Smith. And this Bad side is nothing more than a version of the Good one but a version which made the wrong choice. The choice of the Evil ...All in all, this movie is nothing more than a new preview of a religion. All the components of a religion is so present in the movie of the Washowsky brothers. But a question remains : is it the movie or the book of which it is inspired (The Necromancian), which defines the beginning of a new religion ...",The Matrix
3588,skirsme,Nice movie,9,31 July 2015,"This is really nice movie. I liked all movie of this series. Use of technology is amazing. quality of site is wonderful. ""The Matrix"" is a visually dazzling cyberadventure, full of kinetic excitement, but it retreats to formula just when it's getting interesting. It's kind of a letdown when a movie begins by redefining the nature of reality, and ends with a shoot-out. We want a leap of the imagination, not one of those obligatory climaxes with automatic weapons fire.I've seen dozens if not hundreds of these exercises in violence, which recycle the same tired ideas: Bad guys fire thousands of rounds, but are unable to hit the good guy. Then it's down to the final showdown between good and evil--a martial arts battle in which the good guy gets pounded until he's almost dead, before he finds the inner will to fight back. Been there, seen that (although rarely done this well).Too bad, because the set-up is intriguing. ""The Matrix"" recycles the premises of ""Dark City"" and ""Strange Days,"" turns up the heat and the volume, and borrows the gravity-defying choreography of Hong Kong action movies. It's fun, but it could have been more. The directors are Larry and Andy Wachowski, who know how to make movies (their first film, ""Bound,"" made my 10 best list in 1996). Here, with a big budget and veteran action producer Joel Silver, they've played it safer; there's nothing wrong with going for the Friday night action market, but you can aim higher and still do business.",The Matrix

These movies are slow paced but worth the watch. Make sure that you can control the volume because it seems that the dialog can be quiet and action really loud. It took me a couple times to watch it to fully understand it. I had my wife watch the matrix and its sequels, and she enjoys them as much as I do. Although, because its the first movie I was hoping for more of a in- depth explanation of what exactly the matrix is.Overall, The Matrix is a great movie and worth the watch.

When another hacker named Trinity contacts him she tells him a number of unbelievable, and seemingly impossible things. When his questions just lead to more questions he agrees to meet a man named Morpheus. Neo is given a choice, learn the truth about what he calls reality or stay blissfully ignorant to the truth. After choosing ""truth"" he finds the real world as he knows it isn't real at all. It seems that in the early 21st century, there was an all-out war between human beings and advanced machines, resulting in the triumph of artificial intelligence.

3591,jelliusbeanus-1,Superb Film,10,18 August 2005,"There seems to be a concentrated effort to pull this film out of the top 250 ranking list by people rebelling against the success of this film. Time for a little perspective.*** Possible Spoilers *** The reason this film deserves to be in the top 250 is because it is a strong science fiction film, with very few plot holes; is well cast and acted; has stunning effects, and is beautifully shot and scored. I've seen comments where people slag this film heavily - claiming that machines using people as a power-source is unrealistic, but recommend films like T2 (a good film BTW), or Superman (not-so-good), or Star Wars (varies in rating depending on which episode). I can't understand why someone thinks it's realistic when spaceships break laws of physics by traveling faster than light, or beings from another world who happen to look just like us have X-ray eyes and can fly, or killer-robots from the future travel through time to eliminate a future threat; but machines can't enslave humans to their own purpose. That is simply an attempt to justify an nonobjective view. Does that mean I believe humans could be used as a power source? No - but within the context of the film it works.Yes, there is a blending of genres and styles within this film. Yes, the philosophical questions that it raises have been raised before. Yes, there is a tie to religious ideology. But THIS particular blending is unique. I will never forget the awe and excitement I felt the first time I saw this film when Neo awoke in his little pod - it made me feel the same way I felt when I was 10 and saw Star Wars for the first time. THAT is the magic of this movie - it allowed me to believe that there was hope for the industry after all.Final notes: The script is very tight - Plot is well revealed, and the dialogue is natural. The cinematography is superb - probably the most beautifully shot film I've ever witnessed. Every still, every frame is a masterpiece. The special effects are seamless, and do not overwhelm the viewer or shatter the story or plot. The musical score is remarkable, and the seamless blend of the score, the story, and the various industrial/electronica songs meld perfectly together. The acting by all parties was believable - with special kudos to Keanu for underplaying the role; to Lawrence for being the anchor of the tale; to Hugo for being a truly machine-like villain; to Joe for being a believable turncoat with realistic motives; to Carrie-Ann for being a strong female role; and to the departed Gloria for injecting a sense of the surreal with class and humour. Lastly, a huzzah for the Wachowski brothers for putting the whole package together to create one of the finest films ever put to celluloid.I cannot recommend this film enough.",The Matrix

3593,thelachster,Revolutionarily awesome.,10,16 September 2005,"I still remember the first time I saw The Matrix. It was a Thursday afternoon (the day it came out) and my family went to see a movie. I didn't particularly want to see The Matrix but I was fine with it. And when I came out I was absolutely blown away. The obvious feature is the action, which was inspired by Chinese Kung Fu movies, with a bit of a tweak. The other obvious feature is its ""bullet time"". It was the first movie to use it and immediately influenced other movies. But what is truly brilliant about this movie is the concept. It takes an old, cheesy idea like ""the chosen one,"" and makes it cool. And once you've seen it a few times, over a few years, you start to understand the philosophy and hidden meanings. From things as simple as ""Neo"" being an anagram of ""one"" to larger concepts like imprisonment and even racism (machines to humans).Overall, The Matrix is a revolutionary, action packed, sci-fi, fun, philosophical, brilliant movie with a hint of comedy. It is well sequenced, well acted, and brilliantly scripted. Whether you like movies for deep stories and meanings, or you just like awesome action sequences, this is the movie for you.",The Matrix

3598,suhbzer0,Don't be afraid of reality,9,29 March 2014,"I could say this is a modern day allegory of ""The Cave"", but it is so much more. I believe the movie redefined the science fiction genre film from what I first saw it 15 years ago, and has even opened up new gateways for various philosophies.In my opinion, this movie is all about taking chances and breaking free from the monotonous dealings of everyday life; along with making changes to be free from the shackles of one's personal limit.Another one of the themes it asks us: nothing is what it seems. It gives us a sudden realization of what is hidden from us from plain sight and the opportunity to see what's ""underneath"" the curtain of illusion. It gave us the idea to question ourselves and the potentials of our minds and our bodies.Say what you will about Keanu Reeves, after 15 years I cannot picture anyone else for the role of Neo and that's saying a lot for the character he has portrayed. He plays a convincing role of a frustrated man living a normal life until he takes the pill of salvation.It is my number one best movie ever released, go see it!",The Matrix

3600,nebojsamax,No.1 movie on my list,10,2 October 2015,"There are lots of movies that I like and picking the favorite one among all of them seems unfair, like saying that the others lack something important. That said, I still have to be fair to my favorite movie which really tops them all and puts them under its feet. Yes, that is what The Matrix has done to other movies and still manages to do so.When I first saw it I was blown away by its story, not so much with acting and visual effects, although both the acting and the visuals are fantastic (it won the Oscar for best effects – sound and visuals). The performances put in by Keanu Reeves and Laurence Fishburne really transfer the audience into the reality of the movie, making the viewer understand and experience to some point the diverse emotions felt by the protagonists.The metaphors that the movie uses make the Matrix a great tool for understanding our reality. It doesn't uncover the secret societies that rule our world, or similar cheap schemes, instead, it deals with more important personal approach towards everyday life. It puts general people's perceptions, fears, love and desires into such a perspective that shows what those emotional states really are and how our understanding and relation to them is inadequate if not entirely false.It starts with the question of what is the Matrix. At first, it is not clear whether it is a complex machine or the program running that machine or maybe an idea that wants to impose itself onto others. In order to explain this, the movie slowly leads us through scenes of philosophical discussions, contemplation and even fighting. The amazing action scenes are there to entertain us, but more importantly, they serve to show us that our capabilities are only limited by our own mind. The Matrix suggests that if the mind lets go, our strength can go beyond imaginable, beyond what we consider to be real. Hence the unrealistic scenes of dodging the bullets and similar. It leaves it up to viewer to reveal the similarities between the Matrix and the everyday life which makes those revelations personal hence more believable. It doesn't try to lead us into believing that something like Matrix can exist somewhere in virtual world it rather shows us that we already live in such a world.But hey, what do I know. This is only how I was affected by the this movie. Not everyone would agree with me but that is exactly what the Matrix has proposed. People are enslaved within their minds and if they do not break free of the old patterns of looking at things and if they don't try to look deeper then the reality will never reveal itself. Since the only way to go there and live the reality is through personal growth, it all starts with the individual and takes one person at a time. It can't be massive, it can't be done in some revolutionary fashion, it needs to go from within of each and every one of us. Powerful message!",The Matrix

Another example of the trend of satisfying the culturally deep-rooted links from adolescents with fantasy of British-Scandinavian origin. Makers - and now already our new young generation on the European continent- managed to forget that what was 'foreign' some 15 years ago now belongs to our cultural heritage. Gigantic marketing campaigns on all levels since the mid-90ies were a huge success. I am in my mid-forties and I'm afraid it is too late to expand my own early cultural roots, mainly based on what the brothers Grimm and HC Andersen gathered. Sure, this does not diminish the merits of adding other cultural influences. It's perfectly clear that film distributors aim for maximal revenues.

I loved The Matrix, and only a few minor contrivances associated with the climax caused the film to miss a 10/10 rating. The movie is kinetic, atmospheric, visually stunning, and mind-bending. It toys with the boundaries between reality and fantasy in unique and interesting ways. In its approach and content, The Matrix is undeniably science fiction, but, unlike most pictures claiming that association, it never falls into the boring, expected patterns of space battles and laser gun shoot-outs.

It's kind of a letdown when a movie begins by redefining the nature of reality, and ends with a shoot-out.We want a leap of the imagination, not one of those obligatory climaxes with automatic weapons fire. In ""Matrix,"" on the other hand, there aren't flesh-and-blood creatures behind the illusion--only a computer program that can think, and learn. The Agents function primarily as opponents in a high-stakes computer game. The movie offers no clear explanation of why the Matrix-making program went to all that trouble. Of course, for a program, running is its own reward--but an intelligent program might bring terrifying logic to its decisions.",The Matrix

3619,joe-38370,It's a great spin on the Jesus Christ Story,9,23 February 2016,With a great cast and an amazing spin of the story of Jesus Christ and its bible references I enjoy this movie time and time again. The only complaint I would have with The Matrix Trilogy is we all wanted more...but there is rumor of one in the works I only hope it to be fact. And with how technology has advanced it can only be that much better. can't wait to see if more come in to play. I know as an actor if they came up with a 4th movie I would really try to audition. What would the world be like if everyone woke up...could we defeat the machines and get the revenge we deserve. And would the main characters be willing to return for more even if it went strait to Netflix i think this would satisfy fans...it would satisfy this fan.,The Matrix
3620,henrybyalikov,Best American sci-fi ever,10,4 March 2016,"Best American sci-fi ever can't say enough good about this title. Even as I watched this the first time as a teenager I was struck by it. It is an incredibly thought provoking film, so well written and so well acted out. From the visuals to the camera shots to the lines in this film you can't help but be transported when you watch. The otherworldly feeling is nailed and to me true art does that. Moreover true art leaves you with a thought provoking educational message. Whether it is to spark conversation or simply to teach you something true art will make that happen. The Matrix does exactly that in making you question your own life and leaves you ultimately responsible for making the choice to choose the easy way out or the righteous enlightened way. Love love love this epic movie!!!!!",The Matrix

3622,cherry-24904,Is the Reality We Accept the Real Reality or a False Reality We Can Handle?,10,18 March 2016,"The film The Matrix is about the journey of Neo as he travels through the mundane life as a low level hacker and software developer of a large company into the only hero that can save suppressed humans from the ""real reality."" Neo's mentor Morpheus introduces Neo into the Matrix, which is the real reality of how the robots took over mankind and use their bodies as sustenance. Morpheus and his team, including Neo's eventual love interest Trinity, guide Neo and help him develop into ""The One"" that can save all. In essence, he is mankind's savior and the only one that can defeat the army of artificial intelligence. The theme in this popular film is the struggle of human dignity and the search for one's own purpose. In the beginning of the movie, we see Neo growing incredibly unsatisfied and bored by his daily routine. For a new scene, he follows his clients (who he recently retrieved hacking information for) into a club, where Trinity begins his journey of what his purpose is and what the true reality is. By mentors Morpheus and Trinity, Neo discovers that his entire life was nothing but a front to keep the humans alive, while the cyborgs continue to feed on them while also populating them only as a food source. Throughout the film, viewers can relate to the struggle of trying to find a sense of purpose. Many struggle through hurdles and may find others' expectations quite overwhelming. The theme that one can succeed and accomplish their purpose leaves moviegoers with a positive note and a can do attitude. One of the high points of the film that is easily forgotten is the point in which Morpheus has been kidnapped by the Agents and is slowly dying as they attempt to hack his brain for codes in order to track the freed humans. Just when we think Morpheus might breathe his last breath, Neo and Trinity arrive with a helicopter facing the opening of the exposed office in the high-rise building. Soon, bullets fly from both the Agents and the team of Trinity and Neo. In this shot, time appears to slow as we see rain fall slowly towards the office floor and we can see the bullet paths as a vacuum of air is created at such a high velocity. This is what makes The Matrix great. It created action scenes and breathed new life into them by changing the way the moviegoer sees it and forces them to focus on details that would be impossible to see at a normal speed frame. It creates a high appreciation for things that we normally would not pay attention to in a typical action scene. The talent of cinematographer Bill Pope is highlighted in scenes such as these, making The Matrix one of the best action films to date. There are two techniques which highlight the theme of the film and keep the story interesting in The Matrix are freeze frame (and slow motion) as well as camera angle. For a majority of The Matrix, the movie was filmed from an objective view and often at eye level. This view helps the moviegoer see the awesome graphics that may have been missed if filmed from a subjective view. For example, when Trinity is first cornered by the local police in the abandoned building, the viewer would likely assume that action is going to take place, but they are unsure of what. Based on many action movies of the past, one can assume it will involve a lot of rapid movement and somebody being hurt and killed, which nothing too surprising, especially at the beginning of the film. On the contrary, in the midst of Trinity fighting the officers, we suddenly see her frozen in mid- air with a kick flying toward and unfortunate officer's face. The camera circles Trinity as we see cops in mid action preparing to win the fight against the lone woman. However, as time assumes to normal speed, one sees Trinity fighting and the camera rapidly moving around her and her victims. From here, the film takes off in the action-plot film. Another example of cinematic effect would be the slow motion of the last fight as Neo fights Agent Smith. As Neo discovers he truly is the one, he seems to fight Agent Smith with overwhelming calm as the we view from a spectator angle the action that keeps us held to our seats. Neo fights slowly but tactfully in slow motion and ultimately defeating Agent Smith. These techniques help us pay attention to the detail of each action-packed scene, and reminds the moviegoer of Neo's purpose, which was defeating the agents. His journey reminds us that we all are searching for our purpose in life and must overcome barriers in order to find it. In conclusion, The Matrix is a great film to watch. The theme of human struggle to find one's own purpose is obvious and can be seen highlighted in the action points. Throughout each physical conflict, time is slowed and characters are frozen to see the detail of each battle. It gives the viewer time to think instead of forcing one to follow a fast motion scene, to focus on Neo's personal struggle to find his calling. The film is a little dated, but the techniques used to enhance the plot and the action make The Matrix a legend.",The Matrix

3624,second_coming_of_oz,"Somewhere up there, Ed Wood is smiling...",2,8 August 2005,"1959 saw one of cinema's greatest achievements, 'Plan 9 from Outer Space'. Widely regarded as the worst film of all time, it featured a plot unrivalled in absurdity.Then came 'The Matrix'. Apparently robots (or space zombies, or some variety of scary CGI monsters) have enslaved humanity, and are harvesting them for energy. To keep their living batteries entertained the robo-zombies (or space alligators, it doesn't really matter) have created a giant computer game called 'the Matrix'. With a devil-may-care disregard for the first law of thermodynamics, this game runs on the energy of the people it simulates.But some of these people break out of the computer game and live in a rusty metal bucket and eat gruel. Being heroes, they plan to overthrow their demon-squid robot overlords and free humanity, so they can all live in rusty metal buckets and eat gruel. There are some philosophical pretensions and religious references in there, but these are too simplistic and crass to be worth going any deeper into.Keanu Reeves gives a very believable performance of bad acting, while the rest of the cast mince around in sunglasses and trench-coats, delivering dialogue which serves no other purpose than carrying the plot.The first fifteen minutes of this film are quite watchable, which is why I am giving it a generous two out of ten.",The Matrix

The only underlying 'philosophy' or 'message' that seems to exist in these movies is that any type of conflict can only be ultimately resolved through violence - Neo always ends up in one of his bizarro kung fu fight with Smith, suggesting that good and evil are universal constants and that they will only ultimately conflict. It's a premise that only exists in storytelling, and it's a pretty timeworn metaphor. The Matrix is just professional wrestling in high gloss. The 'philosophy' is just psycho-babble gobbldegook meant to confuse, and (I guess) when certain members of the audience are confused, they seem to think they must be in the presence of something beyond their ability to comprehend, and so it must be 'philosophy'. and therefore 'profound'...kind of like aboriginal tribesmen seeing an airplane and thinking it's amazing, something more than they can comprehend.

THE MATRIX challenges what's real and what's part of an elaborate, fake cyber-reality, so it can be confusing for both the audience and the characters in the movie, which is heavy on special effects and brooding paranoia, light on plot, dialogue, character, and even coherence. In other words, it's the ideal movie for the kind of teen who wishes that video games could come to life. Though rated R for violence (some pretty gross, including an icky bug that enters the hero's body through his belly button) and language, most teens 14 and up who are begging to see it should be able to handle it without a problem.Given a budget that encourages their kinesthetic skills, the filmmakers tend to go on a bit, but it's mostly a kind of quick, glancing hipness that's being indulged here.",The Matrix

Even the fightings are mediocre, If you throw sfx you can see that the choreography is average and that the actors are really awful in it, but making them jump 50 feet high or break wall tends to hide their poor limitations, I saw a lot of kung fu movies and i can say that Keanu reeves with his manicured hands doesn't fit at all.

3631,yones-57445,Life is about choices we make,8,16 June 2016,"The Matrix is an action packed, special effects driven master piece that is sure to catch the attention of any futuristic film critic. Several chase scenes utilize cross-cutting techniques to establish action occurring in two different locations. As I watch this film, I am reminded of two films from memory -Enter the Dragon (1973) and Stand by Me (1986). Both films reiterate the theme from Matrix, struggle with choice and the consequences of those actions. Spoiler Alert: Neo, played by Keanu Reeves, is a software writer who struggles to find his place in the world and as a result turns to computer hacking to escape his mundane life. At the party Neo is approached by Trinity, played by Carrie-Anne Moss. Trinity is driven by her love for Neo and her unwavering loyalty to Morpheus (Lawrence Fishburn). Imaginative Mise-en-scene is created during the first scene between Neo and Morpheus. Morpheus can be considered a profit; he predicts the coming of ""the one who will save Zion."" Morpheus offers Neo a life altering proposition-a choice between taking a red pill (which reveals the truth of the Matrix) or the blue pill (which will doom him to the old life which Neo struggles to escape from). Neo's adversaries are a group of three steely faced agents simply known as ""The Smiths."" The Smiths are agent programs who keep order within the Matrix by dispatching their own form of law and order. Throughout the film as Neo, Morpheus, and Trinity battle the Smiths, Neo subconsciously begins to believe in himself and the power he holds inside. By the final show-down, Neo has miraculously developed a skill to stop bullets. In each situation he discovers that the path he wants has been laid in front of his feet like a red carpet. The only thing stopping him from taking advantage of the gifts bestowed upon him, is his own reluctance to ""go for it.""",The Matrix

3647,jexcracker,Good,10,3 January 2017,"I'll have to forego the usual plot description, since the movie deliberately works hard to confuse the viewers about what's going on. For the first half-hour, it seems that what we're witnessing is a peculiar sequence of dreams, each of them ending with the dreamer waking up inside another dream. It seems that someone wants Neo, a famous hacker-for-hire, also known as a software engineer Thomas Anderson (Keanu Reeves), and this someone has big plans in mind.The opening half an hour is very effective in putting the viewer in the same state of mind as the confused protagonist. Cinematography is all muted dark greens, the set is that of a foreboding metropolis, the mood is that of a spooky dream, non-realistic yet compelling in its private logic.And then, Neo wakes up -- for real. This sequence alone is worth the price of admission, with the revelation being truly, utterly, grandly shocking. The sheer imagination, both visual and narrative, combined with some of the most impressive special effects work up to date, result in a sequence which works on two levels: it's horrifying, on the most basic primal level, with the horrors springing to reality as if from a nightmare; and it's exhilarating, taking both Neo and the viewers on a wild ride through an alien landscape.There is absolutely no way the rest of the film could have been as grand as these three minutes, and indeed the remainder is not -- but it's still clever and entertaining in its own right, although the film a bit overdone -- too long, too elaborate, and too ambitious. In any case, I'd rather take all of that over the usual thoughtless fakery of Hollywood standard-issue blockbusters.Because this production, done on a relatively large budget (although the question is how did they get some of this images at any budget?!), is not a standard blockbuster -- it's very much a private artistic vision of Andy and Larry Wachowski, the two brothers who have previously made only one film, a romantic thriller Bound. They wrote and directed The Matrix together, drawing on such disparate influences as the Western ideas of technology-based (or, rather, technology-enslaved) society and the cyberpunk ethos, and the Eastern styles of kung-fu fighting, Hong Kong action films, and Japanese anime.The results are nearly amazing, with some action sequences being as tense and exciting as they get. There's too many of those sequences, and each of them goes on for a bit too long, but there's no denying the style and power of each of them. There's no denying that what we have here is a really smart script, carefully delineating the rules of its world and following them without running into any plot holes.The film runs into some weaknesses in its last ten minutes or so, with the superfluous and somewhat cheesy romantic subplot, and a rather silly closing shot, entirely too upbeat for a dark vision the film presented for the preceding two hours. And then, of course, we have Keanu Reeves.To be fair, he is one of the most consistently improving actors working today; each of his performances is markedly better than the previous one, and this film is no exception. On the other hand, Reeves is not getting better very fast, and where he started wasn't much to write home about anyway. But, for the most of The Matrix, he's fine -- until the last half an hour, where his character acquires a messianic aspect, and here his acting choices are somewhat suspect. These acting choices, by and large, mostly involve Reeves channeling that excellent dude, Ted. There's a welcome dose of self-depreciation in this, for sure, and it gets funnier when you notice that Neo does use phone booths as portals -- but I wouldn't say this is the best way to play the Savior of the World.He still looks right for the part, though; whether executing a slow- motion flip while dodging bullets and firing from two guns at once, or jumping from a helicopter to catch another person in mid-air, Reeves keeps the unflappable air of an Everyman who doesn't quite understand precisely what's going around him and, exactly because of this, is capable of doing the wildest thing.Overall, The Matrix is a story about the victory of human mind over the soulless machine; and whether it applies to Neo's fight with The Matrix, or the Wachowski brothers getting their vision without being subjugated to Hollywood dumbing-down modus operandi, that doesn't really matter. What matters, is that The Matrix is a whole lot of fun.",The Matrix

3652,aliciagodmasch,A Visually Stunning Film,10,4 May 2017,"I was about 23 years old when this film was released. Before watching The Matrix, I had an inkling that my impressionable years filled with comic book binge reading sessions had left some irreversible geek stamp embedded into my brain. But it wasn't until that epic moment of Trinity's first kick in this film that I realized beyond a shadow of a doubt that Science Fiction was indeed my happy place. This film is a series of one jaw dropping special effect to the next. Additionally, I found the storyline to be quite interesting. I have watched many Sci-Fi movies since this film's release, but I have yet to feel the same awe that I felt when watching The Matrix for the first time. It's almost as if The Matrix created the mold for all Sci-Fi films to come and then smashed it to bits. Filmmakers may come close to replicating the originality of this pivotal picture but personally there always seems to be a little something missing.",The Matrix

3654,ramazankarakehya,KeBooB,10,20 January 2017,"Unleashing two film sequels and altering the course of Keanu Reeves' career, The Matrix made its U.S. theatrical debut on March 31, 1999. Days earlier, The Hollywood Reporter appraised the title, predicting box-office glory for the film. Read the original review below: A cyber sci-fi blowout of wetware-boggling visual effects and advanced comic book storytelling, Warner Bros.' The Matrix will open mightily and have a wide-open month to become early 1999's biggest hit.Word-of-mouth will be giddy, with young and mature males lining up for a technologically stunning movie that furthers the genre and features crowd-pleasing performances to go with the frequent scenes of gunplay and violence. Kudos to the writing and directing team of Larry and Andy Wachowski — who debuted impressively with the small-scale, tightly wound Bound — for fashioning a brain-twisting, eye-popping thriller that recalls The Terminator, Total Recall and Stanislaw Lem's great novel The Futurological Congress. The lead character played by Keanu Reeves discovers that everyday reality is a computer-created illusion and that future humans are locked in an epic struggle with intelligent machines. Opening with an explosive sequence in which a leather-clad woman named Trinity (Carrie-Anne Moss) with amazing leaping and fighting abilities is chased by cops and scary men in suits, Matrix is an adrenaline rush from the start and pushes the envelope in stylish, inspired action sequences. But the characters are not forgotten or secondary, and many of the best moments belong to the actors. A loner with a cyber-identity, Neo (Reeves) lives in a metropolis of the near future and through Trinity he's warned that ""they"" are after him. ""They"" are the men in suits, led by Agent Smith (Hugo Weaving), who nab defiant but naive Neo at his work and insert a metallic bug in him, hoping he will lead them to the mysterious Morpheus (Laurence Fishburne).But Morpheus and his comrades get to him swiftly, remove the bug and offer Neo the chance to join them, though by the nature of the situation he doesn't know what awaits him. Speaking cryptically about the ""truth,"" Morpheus says he must choose to take a journey like Lewis Carroll's Alice, one with irreversible consequences to his understanding of reality. So Neo takes the plunge and the movie takes a big leap conceptually when it's revealed that the story is actually taking place hundreds of years from now when humans have lost a globally catastrophic war against machines created by artificial intelligence programs run amok. Vat-bound humans are bred by the machines to provide power, with each ""battery"" hooked up to the Matrix, a virtual construct that resembles Earth as we more or less know it.Morpheus, Trinity and Cypher (Joe Pantoliano) are rebels who have unplugged themselves from the Matrix and sought out Neo because ""he's the one"" prophesied by the ""oracle."" Neo might just be able to defeat the machines. Absorbing when it isn't going a little overboard — like it does during a John Woo-like gun battle in a lobby — Matrix has several super kung fu sequences, including use of Hong Kong-style wirestunt work and what the Wachowskis have dubbed ""bullet-time photography"" or ""Flow-Mo,"" an awesome physics-defying effect inspired by Japanese anime. Reeves is good as the somewhat fragile but adaptable hero. Fishburne is savvy casting as Neo's guide and protector, and Moss and Pantoliano also are impressive. But the big scene stealer is Weaving as the relentless opponent and embodiment of the Matrix's creators. His deadpan delivery and ultra-serious demeanor is chipped away with growing frustration, and the Australian contributes much of the film's nervous humor.",The Matrix

Keanu Reeves' best performance ever came at the perfect time, and, if nothing else, look at how many awards it won. I thank the Wachowski brothers for this brilliant eye-opening exploration, and I cannot wait for the next films in this series.

The story doesn't progress and you're just waiting for the story to start and progress. The main reason you would want to see this movie is because of the special effects and at some points a lot of action is going on but... the story isn't going anywhere which makes you feel like the movie just goes on and on and on...

3661,ivansyzran,Very good movie with deep meaning,9,17 April 2017,"The movie ""The Matrix"" (which was written by The Wachowski Brothers) was shot in 1999 in USA. The film's genre is a science fiction thriller. The main theme of this film (in my opinion) is the exposure of a reality that is terrible for a usual man: the world in which people live is only an illusion created by a supercomputer, and people are just sources of energy necessary for a supercomputer's work. The plot (very briefly): a young programmer and hacker Thomas Anderson (Neo) learns that the whole world in which he lives is an illusion created by artificial intelligence to enslave humanity, and that only Thomas is able to stop it, because he is ""The Chosen One"". For this, he is trained in martial arts under the guidance of his patron — Morpheus. Neo must fight with the ""agents"" of the Matrix — a kind of security programs. As a result, Neo defeats agents led by Agent Smith and tells people that he will show them that they live in reality live in a world without borders, and soars up into the sky. In leading roles: Keanu Reeves as Thomas A. Anderson / Neo, Laurence Fishburne as Morpheus, Carrie-Anne Moss as Trinity, Hugo Weaving as Agent Smith. As you know, the success of the film depends, among other things, on the actors' play, on their ability to convey the emotions experienced by their characters well to the viewer. An excellent game of a well-chosen cast allows you to immerse yourself in the atmosphere of this film to the end and feel the main idea: people do not need to live in a limited world that kills creative potential in a person; first of all, a person needs freedom for happiness... The film made a strong impression on me, making me think about what I had never thought before: how is modern man free in making key decisions in his life? Is it really possible to call a person's choice easy in any situation? Thoughts on this topic led me to the main conclusion: many decisions in modern society are taken under the pressure of various compelling circumstances. It is necessary to reduce such circumstances to a minimum, thus ensuring maximum freedom of choice. This will be the first step on the road to happiness. I think this is the most important thing that I brought out of watching the movie ""The Matrix"".",The Matrix

3665,wzxdrm,"Even the Columbine killers were ""Matrix"" fans",1,22 February 2009,"Warner Bros. Pictures issued a statement denying any tie between real-world violence and the virtual violence of the ""Matrix"" movies: ""Any attempt to link these crimes with a motion picture . . . is disturbing and irresponsible.""Yet criminals themselves keep making the connection. When Lee Boyd Malvo, teen half of the alleged D.C. sniper duo, goes on trial for murder in Chesapeake, Va., tomorrow, his attorney confirms that he too will weave ""The Matrix"" into his insanity defense. Malvo told FBI agents that they should ""watch 'The Matrix""' if they wanted to understand him, and jailers found lines of dialogue from the film scribbled on paper in his cell. Even the Columbine killers were ""Matrix"" fans. (From Boston Globe By Mark Schone, 11/9/2003)Neo finds himself in an alternate reality, aware that he once was ""unconscious"" in a computer-generated virtual reality and killers are chasing him. He must resort to fancy footwork and plenty of violence himself in order to save the world. All that he once believed has proved false as he's designated the savoir and learns his secret super powers. What Neo does serves a higher purpose, which gives his violence noble flavor. But that's a movie. Or is it? Apparently, some murder defendants have come to believe they were in the matrix and that killing others was therefore justified. Lee Boyd Malvo, was devoted to the movie. In jail he made many jottings, including a plea that people should free themselves from the Matrix. He told the FBI to watch the film... In San Francisco, Vadim Mieseges, 27, killed and dismembered his landlady, and in his defense he said that he'd been ""sucked"" into the Matrix. In Ohio, Tonda Lynn Ansley also attacked her landlady on this premise, but was certain she had not really done so: it was only a dream. She had targeted three others as well, to free herself from their mind control. In Virginia 19-year-old Joe Cook, who claimed he did not realize what he was doing when he dressed like Neo, grabbed his twelve-gauge shotgun (purchased because it resembled one in the movie), and shot both of his adoptive parents to death.

3678,dotmavriq,It's pretty damn good,8,4 January 2021,"""The Matrix"" reuses the premises of ""Dark City"", turns up the warmth and the volume, and acquires the gravity-challenging movement of Hong Kong activity films. It's fun, however it might have been more. The chiefs are Larry and Andy Wachowski, who realize how to make motion pictures (their first film, ""Bound,"" made my 10 best rundown in 1996). Here, with a major spending plan and veteran activity maker Joel Silver, they've played it more secure; there's nothing amiss with going for the Friday night activity market, however you can point higher and still work together.Cautioning; spoilers ahead. The plot includes Neo (Keanu Reeves), an unassuming programming creator by day, a dreaded programmer around evening time. He's enlisted by a cell of digital radicals, driven by the significant Morpheus (Laurence Fishburne) and the cowhide clad champion Trinity (Carrie-Anne Moss). They've made a crucial disclosure about the world: It doesn't exist. It's really a type of Virtual Reality, intended to hush us into lives of visually impaired acquiescence to the ""framework."" We dutifully go to our messy positions each day, small acknowledging, as Morpheus tells Neo, that ""Grid is the fleece that has been pulled over your eyes- - that you are a slave."" The dissidents need to break the system that holds the Matrix set up, and free humankind. Morpheus trusts Neo is the Messianic ""One"" who can lead this insubordination, which requires mind power as much as actual strength. Showed against them are the Agents, who resemble Blues Brothers. The film's fights happen in Virtual Reality; the legends' brains are connected to the battle. (You can in any case get murdered, however: ""The body can't live without the psyche""). ""Jacking in"" like this was an idea in ""Bizarre Days"" and has likewise been recommended in books by William Gibson (""Idoru"") and others. The thought that the world is a counterfeit development, planned by pariahs to bamboozle and utilize people, is straight out of ""Dim City."" Both of those motion pictures, notwithstanding, investigated their suggestions as the best sci-fi regularly does. ""Dull City"" was interested by the Strangers who had a strong problem: They were biting the dust outsiders who would have liked to gain from human techniques for transformation and endurance.In ""Network,"" then again, there aren't fragile living creature and-blood animals behind the figment - just a PC program that can think, and learn. The Agents work basically as rivals in a high-stakes PC game. The film offers no away from of why the Matrix-production program went to such difficulty. Obviously, for a program, running is its own prize - however a savvy program may carry startling rationale to its choices.Both ""Dim City"" and ""Bizarre Days"" offered fascinating inspirations for villainy. ""Network"" is more similar to a superhuman comic book in which the destiny of the world comes down to a titanic clench hand battle between the assigned delegates of good and malevolence. It's merciless, truly, to put enticing thoughts on the table and afterward request that the crowd be happy with a shoot-out and a hand to hand fighting duel. How about we expect Neo successes. What happens then to the billions who have quite recently been ""unplugged"" from the Matrix? Do they actually have occupations? Homes? Personalities? All we get is a mysterious voice-over admonishment at the film's end. The conundrum is that the Matrix world obviously takes after in each regard the pre-Matrix world. (I am helped to remember the vivified child's film ""Doug's first Movie,"" which has a VR experience in which everything is actually similar to, all things considered, aside from more costly.) Still, I should not overlook the film's temperances. It's incredible looking, both in its plan and in the active energy that powers it. It utilizes immaculately coordinated embellishments and liveliness to envision areas of the internet. It makes fearsome animals, including mechanical octopi. It transforms bodies with the desert of ""Eliminator II."" It utilizes f/x to permit Neo and Trinity to run on a level plane on dividers, and linger palpably sufficiently long to convey karate kicks. It has jumps through space, exciting groupings including battles on housetops, helicopter safeguards and fights over psyche control.What's more, it has exhibitions that locate the correct notes. Keanu Reeves goes for the unconcerned Harrison Ford approach, ""acting"" as meager as could reasonably be expected. I guess that is the correct thought. Laurence Fishburne finds a harmony between activity legend and Zen ace. Carrie-Anne Moss, as Trinity, has a hair-raising title arrangement, before the film reviews that she's a lady and transports her into help mode. Hugo Weaving, as the central Agent, utilizes a level, threatening tone that helped me to remember Tommy Lee Jones in uninvolved forceful overdrive. There's an all around acted scene including Gloria Foster as the Oracle, who like all Oracles is maddeningly puzzling.""The Matrix"" didn't exhaust me. It intrigued me so much, in reality, that I needed to be tested significantly more. I needed it to follow its material to brassy ends, to show up not just at triumph, yet at disclosure. I needed a consummation that was groundbreaking, as city ""Dim,"" and not one that essentially tosses us a shocking activity arrangement. I needed, to put it plainly, a Third Act.",The Matrix

Most of the weapons that this sound is associated with only make this sound when 'charged' or cocked. This action is accomplished long before raising the weapon for firing and most always cannot be executed as the weapon is raised and certainly not one handed.In The Matrix it is evident almost every time a weapon is raised by Neo, Trinity or any other character.

If you actually watch the extras on the DVD release and realise how strong Weaving's Australian accent is in real life it is even more believable.On top of that, check out Carrie-Anne Moss's catsuit - she didn't need the padding that was required for Ms Pfeifer in Batman (and to top it all, she was pregnant for the third film).I've only seen the film about 70 times so I am no expert but to me, it was a revelation at the time - not least with the new filming techniques used by many films now - including Toy Story 2 I believe and certainly employed in Shrek 2.

3687,chunterfujiwara,Keanu Reeves kicks machine ass and saves human kind,10,17 October 2017,"Don't you enjoy watching movies where people get shot in the head in slow motion? Observing the blood spray out from the back of a head, or a bullet cutting through the air. Watching movies where the main character has crazy super powers or combat skills and defeats the antiheroes by using a very sophisticated plan. Although all action movies have different characters and motives, they usually all follow the same, generic story line. In the beginning, something bad will happen to the main character and throughout the movie, they will come up with a crazy and dangerous plan to take their revenge. Some action movies with this type of story line are Kingsmen, Wanted, and Deadpool. The directors of these movies use computer generated imagery to create special effects such as ""bullet time"", causing a sense of unreality. These great movie scenes were all derived from the single film that innovated movie production forever, The Matrix. When The Matrix first came out in 1999, there was very little hype about the movie because nobody knew what to expect with the new special effects. The Matrix was a movie with a story line and graphics people have never seen before. When it hit the box office, the audiences were blown away and it smashed old records, winning many Oscars. This movie was extremely successful because it was a complete original film, from the story line to the special effects, The Matrix was like no other movie of its time. If you are not familiar with the Matrix story line, it is the baseline of where most modern day action movies come from. The story opens with the main character, Neo Anderson, living in a false reality with most of the other people living world. We later find out that robots rule the real world, harvesting humans as a source of power by sedating them in an alternate reality where they live their ""lives"". In order to keep the human race from becoming extinct, a select group of humans are chosen to help fight against the robot army. Their only hope of survival is to find ""The One"", a select individual with supreme fighting skills that is destined to defeat the robots. As the story goes on, ""The One"", Neo Anderson, travels between realities to find the robots' power source. Over his missions, he achieves great power, having inhumane physical abilities, resurrection, and the power to stop bullets. Since the story line is original with all the new abilities and powers, the special effects and stunts also have to be original. The Matrix's special effects team, ESC Entertainment, reinvented the meaning of special effects and created an entire new world for the production of movies through their work. There are scenes in the movie that required a new style of special effects because characters would jump from buildings, walk on walls, and have super speed. Before The Matrix, people have never seen these types of stunts and effects in other movies because it was beyond their time. So the crew had to come up with their own, spending weeks on thinking of the best ways to portray these scenes. The Matrix movie invented a very popular effect in which many action movies today use, Bullet Time. When Neo is fighting off the the robots in the matrix reality, he is able to stop and dodge bullets that are flying at him. In these scenes, we are able to see the bullets fly through the air up close and in slow motion. We are also able to see characters dodge these bullets, moving at inhuman speeds. Overall The Matrix is a movie that has innovated movie production today. Ever since this movie came out, the world of special effects has grown exponentially. In movies today, people can't tell that some scenes are fake. The only thing separating them from this unreality is logic and knowing that it is humanly impossible to reenact characters' actions in the real world. Since I do not want to completely spoil the plot for the readers, I will end with saying The Matrix has every aspect of a great movie, an original story line, tons of action, and mind blowing effects, so I highly recommend that you watch it.",The Matrix

It's kind of a letdown when a movie begins by redefining the nature of reality, and ends with a shoot-out. We want a leap of the imagination, not one of those obligatory climaxes with automatic weapons fire.I've seen dozens if not hundreds of these exercises in violence, which recycle the same tired ideas: Bad guys fire thousands of rounds, but are unable to hit the good guy. Then it's down to the final showdown between good and evil--a martial arts battle in which the good guy gets pounded until he's almost dead, before he finds the inner will to fight back. Been there, seen that (although rarely done this well).",The Matrix

Perfection in every bit, story, cast, performance, CGI, all still astonishing up to 2017 standards and beyond.. but.. I wish they stopped there, just at the perfect first installment, as for the Matrix Reloaded and Revolution (Part 2 and 3) they were stretched sequels with no significance added to the amazing elements that were established in the original movie/story. The other drawback of such a great movie (and every other great movie), is that it sat the sealing and expectations so high, that almost everyone worked on it got locked into its legacy! From the Wchoskis through to Keanu Reevs and every actor and artist who got his/her name put on its title; despite the great works they pulled afterwards. I would put the Matrix on top of the list of the movies that never ages (hello Keanu!) the list that have the 2001 A Space Odessey, the Godfather, Citizen Kane.. Oh please Hollywood don't come near to those and ruin them with remakes!",The Matrix
3692,mikemacalint,There is No Spoon,10,26 October 2017,"The Matrix is one of the most iconic sci-fi movies in all of cinema history. The story follows a computer hacker named Neo who discovers that all life on Earth is nothing, but an elaborate ruse created by cyberbeings who use human beings for fuel in the real world. Neo escapes from his world known as the Matrix to find out the truth, that everything he thought was real was just a facade. The main premise of The Matrix revolves around the concept of reality and how we perceive it. This premise is most explicated by the famous ""There is No Spoon"" scene. What makes this scene so important is its ability to explain The Matrix, and how it questions our thoughts on expectations and reality.The scene starts when Neo is sent to the home of the Oracle, the so called ""mother"" of the Matrix. Neo enters the Oracle's home where he sees a child bending metal spoons. Neo is mesmerized by the bending spoon which appears to be manipulated by the child's mind. The child gives the spoon to Neo and says to him ""Do not try and bend the spoon. That's impossible. Instead... only try to realize the truth. there is no spoon. then you'll see, that it is not the spoon that bends, it is only yourself."" (The Matrix). Neo then looks at the spoon and tilts his head. As he moves his head the spoon bends and mimics his movements. The dialogue in this scene perfectly sums up the primary purpose of the movie by questioning reality. The child is saying that the spoon only exists in the Matrix. Knowing that the spoon was not real allowed Neo to bend it with his mind. We know that bending a spoon with our mind is impossible, but once we are told that the spoon does not exist we are given a new perception. If the spoon does not exist, we can perceive and manipulate it however we see fit. This scene reveals the truth behind the matrix. The matrix is only real if you perceive it to be real, knowing that it is not real allows Neo to shape the matrix however he wants. The child is conveying that the world inside the Matrix is an illusion and it does not exist like the spoon. The spoon in this scene is meant to represent the Matrix itself. This scene explains how Neo can perform all the unnatural feats throughout the movie. To escape from the reality of the matrix, Neo must free his mind because it is his mind that interpret and define what is real. Just by accepting that the matrix is not real he is able to move in superhuman speeds, jump extreme distances, fight in hand to hand combat, and fly.The world as we know it is governed by laws of physics and probability. The Matrix brings up a philosophical question on whether these laws are our true reality. Everything we can see, touch, and feel are what we perceive to be real. Our reality is set with expectations, when we go to sleep at night we expect to wake up in the morning. When the sun sets we expect it to rise again. The Matrix questions whether our expectations and reality can be manipulated. If you don't believe that the sun exists your reality is, you don't expect it to rise in the morning. When Neo is told that the spoon is not real he was able to move it. To manipulate your reality is as easy as changing your beliefs and blindly following them. Neo is also told that it is not the spoon that bends, it is himself. This brings up another question, whether reality is fixed and cannot be changed. If the spoon is in fact not real Neo is faced with a choice, whether to accept the reality. If Neo chooses to accept the reality he will be able to bend the spoon. Choosing to either accept or decline the reality allows Neo to bend his own perception because of his power of choice. This concept of choice is what drives Neo throughout the rest of the plot in the movie. Neo is faced with the choice to believe in the laws of science, if the Matrix is real, or if there really is a spoon. The Matrix in my opinion is one of the greatest movies ever created. It isn't just your average sci-fi action flick, it asks interesting and introspective questions about our existence and how we live our lives. The movie is both brilliant and entertaining. There is no doubt that The Matrix is one of a kind.",The Matrix

3695,casandra-roades-2,Weak Imitation of Dark City,2,15 January 2009,"I had seen all three Matrix movies and my first thought while seeing Dark City, was how shockingly similar DC is to the Matrix series. I wondered for a brief moment if the creators of the Matrix and DC were the same, then I just figured that the Matrix stole the idea and created an overly long, overly hyped 3 part yawner out of it. For that is all the Matrix is compared to DC...one giant Yawn!! I mean they tried so hard to make a bigger, better and more complex version of DC and all they accomplished was a weak and glitzy imitation. You don't need 6 hours and gratuitous amounts of trickery to tell this story. DC told the same story, in a much more interesting way, in the span of one movie.What I find hilarious is that most people believe that the Matrix was a truly original and mind blowing concept...the world we live in is fake, run by machines in some twisted quest for self preservation. DC started it, the world we live in is fake, run by beings in some twisted quest for understanding and self preservation....Neo was the chosen one, holding power over the machines...John was the chosen one, holding power over the evil beings....C'mon people wake up and smell the Goldfish!",The Matrix
3696,abrarthescholar,"Great idea, horrible execution",3,7 February 2020,"Here is a movie that makes a very good job at making you question and think about what exactly is real and what isn't and whether that even is a meaningful question be begin with. On that part, the movie does a great job. But unfortunately for me, that's all it seems to do.
The Hollywood cliche love having mysterious powers, e.g. bringing back a dead man back and the 'chosen one' bull just doesn't fit in with science fiction stories. Once you're dead, you're dead. There's no bringing you back. And when a female character who uses highly sophisticated technological machinery on a daily basis refuses to understand this simple biological fact, it makes you wonder how 'real' the character is.
On top of that there is all this fate and prophecy stuff that doesn't fit in with everything else. Unless you have hacked into the matrix and have control over every single thing that happens in there, there is no way you can tell what the future is. And that's the future in the matrix. Guessing the future in the real world is almost impossible. A machine that has overthrown almost the entire human population has no chance of losing to a single individual.
Also the situation portrayed in the movie is so unrealistic. If AI really did take over us, and if what is shown to happen in the movie really did happen, then resisting against them wouldn't have been as easy as they make it seem. With the amount of energy source they have, they would have flooded the entire sewers with bots. Heck, within a matter of days they'd realize they could do better and dispatch a swarm of nanobots which would be too small to detect with the current technology and literally zero technological advances of these puny humans.
No, if this really happened, then resisting the machines will be much more complicated and harder. By underestimating the machines, this movie does two things:
1. It makes the inexperienced viewers feel like humans are 'special' . That they have an edge over the machines. And that some humans are just chosen by fate to do big and important tasks (and machines aren't? No, because only humans are special). This is good for the movie. By taking advantage of the insecurities of the human viewers, it increases the chances of this movie making more money.
2. It misses out a chance to be more unique than it really is. A true, real fight against the machines would be so much harder. At every step, the machines would always be a step ahead of us and the only way we could win is by using an unconventional yet highly creative and imaginative method along with a huge stroke of luck. By taking the safe way out, it narrows itself down to a simple action movie instead of expanding into the more promising genre of action-adventure.",The Matrix

But I couldn't find anything similar to my thoughts. Soon I became bored with reading same stuff again and again. So I decided to say something myself anyway.The movie is very good but it has some flaws.1. The idea of using humans as batteries is lame. What about nuclear or thermonuclear power? Do you know that scientists work on TOKAMAK nuclear fusion reactor? One reactor will be enough to supply all cities with electric power on the Earth. 2. The idea that machines have to fight with humans is boring. I understand that movie makers want to exploit it to attract people looking for action. So they think that showing humans working with machines in harmony will be dull. I disagree. I think that construction is much more interesting than destruction. It gives more freedom for imagination. 3. The idea to use human minds for creating Matrix network is not logical. If people learn how to connect human mind to a computer then next logical step will be to move the mind to the computer. It is obvious that future computers will be much more powerful than human brains. Besides it is almost impossible to destroy human mind inside a computer network. Take a look at the Internet. It was created for protection from being destroyed in a nuclear war. So if one joint is destroyed then this doesn't affect whole network because everything is duplicated. So in this case we can talk about human immortality. I don't understand why other people can't see it clearly, maybe because they don't know much about technologies.I think if you want to watch SFX and really understand and enjoy it you have to have a technical background. Otherwise it will be just a set of special visual effects for you and not the whole picture.",The Matrix

We want a leap of the imagination, not one of those obligatory climaxes with automatic weapons fire.I've seen dozens if not hundreds of these exercises in violence, which recycle the same tired ideas: Bad guys fire thousands of rounds, but are unable to hit the good guy. Then it's down to the final showdown between good and evil--a martial arts battle in which the good guy gets pounded until he's almost dead, before he finds the inner will to fight back. Been there, seen that (although rarely done this well).",The Matrix
3754,RITAHicksluvYa,Awesome!,9,4 November 2018,"Such a great movie. If you love sci fi it's a must see. Keanu Reeves should of won a Oscar;) Hope they make another one. Wish I would of got a chance to see in theatre. Great Story, great actors and great effects.",The Matrix
3755,Bold_RobinHood,Expected much more.,8,20 November 2018,"I was expecting much more from the Matrix. The action sequences were very 90s but it still aged very well. I especially enjoyed the martial arts scenes.The story wasn't as intriguing, as I expected. The story makes you think about certain philosophical ideas but in my opinion it falls short. The main cast was amazing. Standout performances from Keanu Reeves, Carrie-Anne Moss and Laurence Fishburne.This movie is a mixture of action and science-fiction with couple of memorable scenes. The science-fiction portion of the film needed more directing.I will definitely re-watch this in couple years",The Matrix
3756,liverpool-68242,The best film of all time,10,1 December 2018,You will read alot of reviews about this movie and unfortunately there are people out their that do not understand everything they see. So would only recommend to watch it.,The Matrix
3757,AkeemBanksSmith-12395,Is this a reality?,10,18 November 2020,I'm just wondering if this movie has a real connection to our lives day to day and where we're headed as humans.,The Matrix
3758,ediz398,someone that understands,10,25 November 2006,there is nothing more to say about matrix.Someone that understands shows us the realities of the system in the movie.We can find ourselves during the movie.It is just unbelievable.Because in every day we wake up in our same lifes.Every step that we have taken in our life is the same as the steps we take before.So in that point we are just living same days.Somebody should say stop...And this is he neo or the brothers you name it...Anyway someone had already said there is something is terribly wrong and in this point we as the codes of the matrix should wake up and follow our ral path.Wake up world just wake up and see what we are in!!!,The Matrix

3760,denisbabak,New meanings,10,25 December 2018,"The Matrix is one of the best science fiction action film directed by The Wachowski Brothers. The film has influenced both the cinema industry and the computer entertainment industry. When you watch The Matrix for the first time, it looks like perfect action movie with high-class special effects and good actors.Time passed and we remember only a black cloak, two hands shooting, kung-fu and running on the walls.Recently I watched it again and I was amazed that there was so much hidden behind the spectacular scenes that I needed to watch this film several times, and I would probably find something that I had missed earlier. Reality is the only what we see and feel.We can understand the movie in different ways. You will see what you emphasize. Slavery, the fight against the system, the role of man in this system and the system in life, fanaticism and faith, chosenness and resurrection.I suggest watching The Matrix even if you've already watched it.",The Matrix
3761,arendvandertoorn,Very nice.,10,14 January 2019,This is one of the most influential movies for me personally.,The Matrix
3762,nyquistnwaukwa,Welcome to the Real world,10,15 January 2019,"Without a doubt one of the best and most influential movies of all time, the Matrix is the defining science fiction film of the 1990's and the biggest leap the genre has taken since Stanley Kubrick's 2001: a Space Odyssey and Ridley Scott's Blade Runner. The Matrix is a ground-breaking motion picture that not only raised the bar for all the science-fiction films to come after it but also redefined the action genre with its thrilling action sequences and revolutionary visual effects.The film tells the story of Thomas Anderson a computer hacker that in the world of hacking goes by the alias of Neo. When he is contacted by the mysterious outlaw Morpheus and having always questioned his reality, he is awakened to the truth that the world he's been living in is a simulated reality called the Matrix and that he's nothing more than a slave in this dystopian world, created and controlled by A.I powered machines.The direction and script by the Wachowskis is fantastic, as they drew ideas and inspirations from every other great sci-fi and cyberpunk movie and anime before the film, combining it with stunning action and putting it into one picture that has enough style, substance and subtext that everyone ended up giving their own interpretation of the story. The research that went into the preparation of the screenplay is quite extensive but the manner in which it is presented on the big screen is also very impressive. Every character presented on the film, has a well-defined arc and a purpose, and their motivations are clear.The cinematography is impeccable. It was very innovative in the use of the camera angles and movements, the zooms, the slow motion captures and the different color palette used to differentiate the Matrix and the real World. The editing is flawless, as it makes sure that every scene is integral to the story and ensures the pace of the film stays ferocious through its entire runtime. Each frame is also packed with so much visual information for the viewer to devour. The visual effects introduced us to the bullet-time effect and their impact can still be felt in today's movies. The performances are also incredible. Each member of the cast gave their best performances and brought the characters they portray to life, but the one that stands out the most is Hugo Weaving's disciplined rendition of his character, Agent Smith; a powerful computer program made to search and destroy the human rebellion, in undoubtedly the greatest performance in his career.In conclusion The Matrix is a masterpiece everyone should see. It is one of the most thought provoking, inventive, pioneering, influential and stylish movies of all time and it's also full of philosophical and religious allegories. Immortal for its contribution to cinema and pop culture, its brilliant combination of inventive visual effects, excellent vision and exquisite action easily makes it one of the best, most influential and most entertaining movies ever made.",The Matrix
3763,wiserkid7,Timeless in its own right!!,10,19 January 2019,"When The Matrix first came out, I was way too young to appreciate its beauty. Inside, the film began unravelling layers of reality. Like an onion. And like an onion, it potency is unmatched in its own family of similar genre'd films. It begins, as society shapes the roles we play within in. A cycle, hopelessly dependant on the system, but slowly and surely, we learn the truth. And from there on, the rest is history. My go to film, no matter what the mood. A titan of a film, and the best film ever made, in my opinion.",The Matrix
3764,johnnyblues,a great movie,10,17 March 2006,i think it is a great movie i like the way neo doesn't know what is about to happen to him and how Morpheus is better than him but when they made matrix 2 and 3 i think they got worse and worse they got a bit too into it they went a bit too far but they were all great and i would love if they did make a 4th but i don't think they could continue on with that story any more.i also liked the music within the entire film its was great it really fitted the mood of each scene.but overall i would give all the matrix films a 9 out of 10 they were all great.And i also like the way they made the anmime matrix and the matrix game to add it all up to the full story its was great fun playing the game and great enjoyment watching the movies,The Matrix
3765,jendobe_photoshop,"A very, very good film",9,18 March 2006,"The Matrix is a fantastic film. It is visually stunning and offers a story that i think if executed differently would be unbelievable; however, i had no trouble accepting this gem of a plot. The special effects of this film were second-to-none and almost every scene boasts something original, unique and breath-taking. I was brimming with awe whilst consistently being subjected to stunts which electrify, sharp and stylish choreography, and camera work which shows the mark of genius. Keanu Reeves trademark seriousness and focus was perfect for the role whilst the acting of Carrie-Anne Moss and Lawrence Fishburne was cool, sophisticated, and complimented the subtleness of the film immensely. Joe Pantoliano's contribution to the cast list was also clever and appropriate. The film is a work of art and I believe marks a watershed in cinematic history for many reasons, most importantly- computer graphics and administering original ideas. Bravo.",The Matrix
3766,lnavarrocr,Great film,9,29 January 2019,"One of the icons at this era, it changes the way I saw life and movies.",The Matrix
3767,ArchieInk,Question your current reality....,10,1 February 2019,After watching this movie i had serious doubts about my sense of reality. A must watch movie. Keenu does a great job with the character of Neo.,The Matrix
3768,genivalvb,The better,10,17 February 2019,"This movie is the best.
For back this movie there are a true that happend every day.
This movie is about rat race my friend.
Excelent movie.",The Matrix
3769,niladam,History before your eyes,9,28 June 2014,"The film is a great mix of action, sci-fi and drama. It takes you to heights you've never been before. It can probably glue you to the chair and keep you from doing anything else.The directors did a great job with the movie. The detail of the effects set higher standards for the industry and probably will get placed in history as 'the matrix' effect.The actors are incredibly believable and can keep up with the movie's rhythm and tone. The dialogs are not-your-every-day-movie ones but instead lead you to actually believe whatever the movie states. Fishburne does a great role and this is probably Reeves' greatest role ever.",The Matrix
3770,LalaMusicLand,Not for me.,4,22 February 2019,"I understand why it got so many nominations and awards but I don't understand how it became so popular. This movie was in my opinion not made for a wide audience. As someone who does enjoy some the genre, I was surprised at how hard it was for me to actually get invested in the plot and like the characters. Regardless, the acting was gripping and the cinematography of the movie was mind-blowing for its time.",The Matrix
