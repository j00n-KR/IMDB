0,SnoopyStyle,almost o.k.,5,20 August 2021,It's the origins of G. I. Joe team member Snake Eyes (Henry Golding). Nobody asked for this. Nobody is really looking for this. The story is fine. It's a functional origins story if somewhat uninspired. Golding is fine. The actors are all fine. The action is fine but the constant CG work does make it repetitive. The last act drags as the repetitive action goes on and on. This is trying to set up for more G. I. Joe movies but that is unlikely to be successful.,Snake Eyes
1,nogodnomasters,Strike with Honor,6,11 August 2021,"This is the back story to Snake Eyes in case you grew up traumatized not knowing the story about your doll. Some may call it an ""action figure"" but a doll by any other name is still a doll. His father is assassinated at an early age at their ""safe house."" Snake Eyes grows up as a fighter and becomes a member of the Yakuza (with multiple pronunciations within the film Yak-u-za and Ya-ku-za) in exchange for information on the man who killed his father. This involves a number of characters, double crosses, and challenges. He has to go ""Uma Thurman"" over half of Japan and everyone in Japan carries at least one katana.If you are into the martial arts stuff or GI Joe, then this is your film. Samara Weaving as Scarlett was the only character who wasn't stiff like cardboard. She had the best lines. Too little time on screen.Guide: One muffled F-word (I missed it). No sex or nudity.",Snake Eyes
2,Sleepin_Dragon,Lost the plot.,3,19 August 2021,"I was genuinely so excited to see this, the trailers looked amazing. High octane for sure, but the total absence of a plot made this really tough to engage with.If you like random fight scenes, you'll probably enjoy this, they move from one to another, to another, but at times you'll find yourself wanting to check your phone for a distraction. It was as if nobody bothered to read through a first draft of the screenplay, and just thought, it'll do.How on Earth could such a movie be boring, but that's the story I'm afraid. The best element here for me was Andrew Koji.I was glad to see the credits roll, and walked out of the cinema, wondering what on Earth I had just sat through.",Snake Eyes
3,paul_haakonsen,This was not one for the records...,5,17 August 2021,"Having grown up with the ""G. I. Joe"" cartoons on TV and always liked them, I must say that my expectations for this 2021 movie ""Snake Eyes: G. I. Joe Origins"" weren't exactly sky high, given the previous live action movies based on the cartoons.But still, of course I sat down to watch this movie and see what writers Evan Spiliotopoulos, Joe Shrapnel and Anna Waterhouse would come up with.And while ""Snake Eyes: G. I. Joe Origins"" certainly was a watchable movie, this was essentially a no-brainer. You just disconnect your brain, lean back and munch the popcorn while watching the action on the screen. In terms of proper contents for a deeper storyline or a fulfilling storyline, then ""Snake Eyes: G. I. Joe Origins"" is not the movie you should watch. Nay, this was just mindless action with a ""G. I. Joe"" template dragged down over it to sell it to a wider audience.I must admit that I sit here with a feeling of this being a rather unnecessary and unfulfilling movie, now that the movie came to an end. Sure, the movie was a cheesy action flick and watchable enough for what it turned out to be. But this was by no means an outstanding movie from director Robert Schwentke.The action sequences in the movie are good, and they are what keeps the movie afloat. That, and also some nice visuals and special effects. But other than that, then this movie was a shallow shell.The cast ensemble was interesting, though, I will say that much. I am not familiar with Henry Golding, but he did a good job at bringing Snake Eyes to life on the screen. And actor Andrew Koji was definitely a good choice for Stormshadow. Now, it was really great to see the likes of Iko Uwais and Haruka Abe in the movie as well.I doubt that I will ever return to watch ""Snake Eyes: G. I. Joe Origins"" a second time, because the storyline just barely had enough contents to support the first viewing.My rating of ""Snake Eyes: G. I. Joe Origins"" lands on a very mediocre five out of ten stars.",Snake Eyes
4,BandSAboutMovies,A complete let down,3,31 July 2021,"Have I ever told you how much I love G. I. Joe?If you know me in person, the answer is probably yes. In addition to an entire room of our home being devoted to movies, there's an entire room for my collection. Did you know that they made an aircraft carrier that's bigger than your coffee table? I do. It's in my house.When I first started dating my wife, the entire upstairs of my house was devoted to this toyline. And not just a figure here or there. I'm one of those maniacs that troop builds, which if you don't know, be happy that you're a normal human being and not devoted to buying and outfitting hundreds of the same army figures and building gigantic platoons of them. Hey, to be fair, Peter Cushing did this as well, so I cling to the knowledge that at least one respected person also played with toys, but I doubt Peter Wilton Cushing, OBE ever had a woman say to him, ""Why do you have thirty of the same tank?*""I'm telling you all of this to tell you that there's no way that I can be objective about this movie.Snake Eyes has the same problem that comic book movies had before the Marvel Cinematic Universe did something incredibly simple: they just followed the source material. Sure, the problem is that there's all sorts of source material. G. I. Joe has multiple comic books, toy lines and cartoons, but perhaps the best version of the story are the Marvel Comics that came out written by Larry Hama in which Snake Eyes was the central character**.Snake Eyes looks at that source material, especially the central story of two sword brothers who fate has torn apart -- actually, it's super close to Enter the Ninja -- and says, ""Well, we can do some of that. But what if, and go with us on this, there was a meteorite that people can use like a laser?""The issue is that there's an audience that knows G. I. Joe from the silly cartoon stories***, an aging out audience that angrily only loves the comic and toys, and then there's the audience you want: the general ticket-buying public, the ones that actually make a movie successful.Look -- if you plan on watching this movie and don't want perhaps its dumbest plot point spoiled -- sneak out now.I'll get to it. Trust me.Snake Eyes is not a soldier in this movie. I understand that the Vietnam War was decades ago and the story needs to be updated. I'm also not even remotely upset that Snake Eyes is now Asian-American and played by Henry Golding, who is a fine actor and really went all out to do the physicality that this movie needs. And I get it -- the idea that Snake Eyes lost his father and it put him on a path of revenge is also not a bad idea. There are tons of movies based on the very same idea and it works.In fact, a lot of the movie works up until the middle of the film, when a moment just tanks the concept (and it gets worse from there).A Yakuza boss named Kenta (Takehiro Hira) discovers Snake Eyes fighting in an underground MMA circuit -- how that gets him close to the man that killed his father is debatable -- and hires him to put machine guns into fish. One day, Kenta asks Snake Eyes to shoot a traitor -- it ends up being Tommy AKA Storm Shadow and Kenta's cousin and yet he doesn't recognize him -- but our hero ends up saving the man's life. But to double back on why he didn't recognize his own cousin it turns out that it's all a ruse and Snake Eyes is really the bad guy, sent to infiltrate the Arishkage Dojo, a family of ninjas that has protected Japan for centuries.Trust me -- other than Akiko (Haruka Abe) most of the Arishkage are complete morons who just allow a stranger into their midst and show him every single one of their secrets.Which brings up one of my biggest issues before we dare go any further. There are moments of great drama in this movie, like when Snake Eyes and Storm Shadow slice their hands open and become blood brothers. We know that this should happen, but we're never given a dramatic reason why they should be so close when it's all based on a series of lies, which makes Snake Eyes seem to be a manipulative jerk instead of the hero we should get behind. And don't give me the redemptive journey excuse -- this is the first time I've met the hero, I guess, and I want to like him.The film cannot decide if we should know the source material, because if we do, we're going to dislike lots of this. And if we don't, we're not going to understand the dramatic reasons why so many things are happening****.The dramatic event that causes Storm Shadow to turn away from his family -- in the comics -- is when Zartan has infiltrated their dojo and uses technology to murder the Hard Master (he had intended to kill Snake Eyes for Cobra Commander, as Snake Eyes' family and the evil leader's brother were in a car accident that ruined both of their lives). This makes it seem as if Storm Shadow killed his uncle out of jealousy, so the ninja clan dissolves and Snake Eyes leaves for America. The two are destined to battle again and to become brothers once more after all of the intricacies of fate are untangled.Contrast that with Snake Eyes being hired by the Yakuza and Cobra -- kinda shoehorned in with the Baroness (Úrsula Corberó) appearing to battle (and team with, awkwardly) Joe representative Scarlett (Samara Weaving, who deserves to be the lead in movies like Ready or Not and not a second banana) -- to steal the Ariskage source of power, which leads to Storm Shadow using said McGuffin and being kicked out of his ninja clan while Snake Eyes just asks to be forgiven and everyone says, ""Well, you got our entire base burned down and lots of our people killed, but at least you said you were sorry"" while Storm Shadow quite understandably flips out.But back to the point that ruined this for me.Snake Eyes must get through three trials. The first one is a great lesson in selflessness, as he must take a bowl from the Hard Master without losing his bowl. The second seems like straight-up Luke in the cave The Empire Strikes Back moment. And finally, he must descend into a pit and be judged, as the third trial kills most of the people involved.That's because -- seriously, this is the spoiler -- deep in that cave there are a whole bunch of sacred anacondas that can sniff out whether someone is pure of heart so that they can be ninjas, which are killing machines when you come to think of it, which reminds me of how Wanted went from an order to supervillains in the comic to sacred assassins all listening to a loom that wove fabric that told them who to kill for the good of humanity in the baffling goofiness of the film.The moment I saw a gigantic snake start judging this film's hero, I just sat into space, staring and said, ""Well, I'm out.""If I can say anything nice, there's a decent neon-lit Oldboy influenced battle at one point. Scarlett's costume looks a lot like the new Classified figure. And it remains a thrill to see the Cobra logo on the big screen. Yet the majority of the fights grow too dark, too oddly cut and too small for what should be a big and bold action film.I really think the potential to make a G. I. Joe move exists. Actually, it's called The Expendables but that's a moot point. It's just hard to watch filmmakers make a simple concept more difficult than it needs to be. The story beats have been lined up for you. And if you follow them, they can help make a movie that makes sense. And yes, giant snakes are silly, but if they work for the story, they can be forgiven, because I watched an entire film where Cobra Commander devolved into human snake while clinging to Roadblock and bemoaning how he was once a man and then Burgess Meredith leads a Lovecraftian world of bugs against the Joes. As dumb as G. I. Joe: The Movie is -- and the first five minutes remain the best distillation of what a movie with these characters could be -- it's somehow nowhere near as daft as this.I really wanted to love this. Hasbro stopped making G. I. Joe toys for years and shuttled the fan club just to reset the brand for this. But hey -- as bad as the movie is, at least I have new action figures. If that's all I get, as most Joe fans, I've learned to be happy***** with it.*That same woman, nearly a decade later, said to me at the end of this movie, ""All this time, I thought Snake Eyes was the bad guy."" I have failed.**Which is interesting because Snake Eyes is the whole reason I was allowed to have these toys. My parents were hippies who were very anti-guns and military. The inclusion of a ninja allowed them to see that this was not all just army figures. To be deeper, the comic series was an integral part of my brother's development, as it was how he learned how to read -- he's somewhat dyslexic -- as my mom and he would read it together. He had the opportunity to tell this to series creator Larry Hama, which is a treasured memory.***Snake Eyes once dressed as a disco woman with a dancing dog on the show. Yes, really.****Why does Akiko change her mind and see anything in Snake Eyes when all he does is act like a jerk to her and repeatedly sneak punch her in the face? Why does Tommy give Snake Eyes his sword when they've known each other for all of a few days and not years like the comic? Why does the word of the man who killed Snake Eyes' father mean more to him than nearly everyone else in this entire story? Why does the film wait until the end to give you what you want -- Snake Eyes and Storm Shadow taking their names and costumes? Am I the only one that remembers that it took 90 minutes of sheer dross for Jem to give audiences what they wanted when Kesha showed up as Pizzazz right when you realized that there was no way a sequel was happening?*****It's still better than the first movie, which is the lowest bar ever even if that movie has a Brendan Fraser cameo as Sgt. Stone, and about the same as the second, if only for that film's astounding ninja mountain battle scene and because it has the Rza as the Blind Master.",Snake Eyes
5,CinemaSerf,G.I. Junk?,5,15 September 2021,"It's one thing offering us Henry Golding as a pretty chap you'd want to take home to meet your mother, it's quite another telling him to abstain from shaving for a few days and hope that turns him into a convincing, highly trained ninja! That's what is in store for us here as this latest GI Joe spin off presents our hero as the rescuer of the heir of an ancient Japanese clan - ""Tommy"" (Andrew Koji). Once he is thoroughly ingratiated with this noble family, it transpires that old ""Snake Eyes"" has an agenda all of his own - and it's not exactly honourable! The rest of the film follows a well trodden path of suspicion, betrayal, reconciliation and - of course - loads of epic looking sword fighting and gravity-defying action scenes. As with so many films in this genre, way too much emphasis has been placed on the look of the thing - the characters are instantly forgettable, the plot thinner than any rice paper could ever hope to be and the ending dragged this, quite unnecessarily, over the two hour mark. It needs a big screen to do the photography and visuals justice, but maybe just pay daytime rates?",Snake Eyes
6,oscaralbert,This film raises the eternal question:,7,10 August 2021,". . . Do snakes REALLY have eyes? Certain serpents, such as garter snakes, are so small that it's nearly impossible to see their visual orbs--if any--with the naked eye. During SNAKE EYES, giant anacondas play a key role in the plot. No one needs a magnifying glass to see THEIR eyes, which are bigger than basketballs. However, are these REAL serpents, or are they mere ""special effects""? You decide.",Snake Eyes
7,siderite,A fantastic cast completely wasted on a stupid story,3,12 September 2021,"First of all, this has *nothing* to do with G. I. Joe, as it is a medieval story about two Japanese clans and the protagonist is caught somewhat in between. Yes, it happens today, but 90% of all fights are using swords and the prize of the war is a magical stone. It's like someone took an existing Japanese samurai and ninjas script, added an extraneous character and made him the protagonist, then plastered on a Joe/Cobra connection and brought it into the present. And the way they added this stuff is like fixing a broken mirror with industrial sticky tape on the visible side.And what a cast this had: Andrew Koji from Warrior (I still crave for a new season), Iko Uwais from Raid, Peter Mensah from Spartacus, Takehiro Hira (who in my mind did the best job in the film, even if he was the villain and had a really dumb role), Samara Weaving from Guns Akimbo. Not to mention Eri Ishida, who did more in a few scenes than ""Snake Eyes"" in the entire film. They did nothing with all of this. The fights were fractured and made little sense, focused on form and ignoring substance. Two people fighting 50 and succeeding because they all used swords and the heroes had unlimited stamina, the usual running (slowly and awkwardly) from bullets scene, people running in the sword range to fire a gun, ugh! It was incredibly ugly. Even the motorcycle and car scenes were ridiculously bad. A team of 5 snipers could have finished *everybody* without loses.Worst of all, it's called G. I. Joe Origins and it features a character who has never heard of the Joes in a time when both Cobra and Joes have been established for a long time. There is no origin story at all! There is no story, really!Bottom line: this film is something that whole teams of people should be fired because of. A 100 million dollar film that manages to waste every resource it bought. Avoid it like it's the plague.",Snake Eyes
8,thesar-2,Snake Eyes Begins,7,25 July 2021,"Found it (Dr.) Strange this movie, the BumbleBee of the 'Joes, didn't come out years ago. This felt very 2005.One of the perks for me to see this movie was the breathtaking sight of Henry Golding, but he had to know, if this was successful, none of us would see OR hear him again. Honestly, since that's the case with the character - he's mute + never takes off his helmet, they might as well save money and recast him.But, I digress. This movie was pretty good, beautifully shot and probably the best of the G. I. Joeverse. Also: it was horribly edited with action scenes at times incomprehensible and predictable as all hell. And I'm not just saying that because it's a prequel of sorts.Bruce Wayne, sorry, I mean ""Snake Eyes"" sees his dad murdered right in front of him and spends his off-screen time growing into adulthood by seeking revenge and becoming a clawless Wolverine. Lucky for him, two different Japanese clans want to use him.Cue music: Some of them want to use him. Some of them want to get used by him. Some of them want to abuse him. Some of them want to be abused.Still fits. Anyways, my other draws for seeing this opening weekend: I played with, watched and read G. I. Joe as a child and Snake Eyes was always my favorite and the best-looking Asian actor/martial artist, Iko Uwais, had a part. Mercifully, Iko's in it a lot more than I expected. I thought he'd play a bit part, but he was a good scene stealer.I liked the rest of the cast and characters, especially Tommy (the bro,) Takehiro (the Anti---hero,) Blind Master (the cliché,) Baroness (the always great bi+ch) and Scarlett (my favorite Babysitter.) They all did what they could with their roles as the story could've been better and took a long time to get where we knew it would evolve to.So, despite feeling like the recent Black Widow - both 2021 ""Origin"" stories, but feel dated already - it's a fun action/adventure with tons of action and gorgeous Asian men.***Final Thoughts: I'd have to rewatch the first 2 - haven't in probably 7 or so years, but I'd have to say Snake Eyes was the best one. I recall not liking the 2nd one much and the first, I was a huge defender of. It was everything I'd hope the Transformers Movie would've been and more. (I grew up with both toys and liked Transformers way more than G. I. Joe, but with the movies, this series far outdid the terrible Michael Bay films.)",Snake Eyes
9,FeastMode,the plague of shaky cam,4,30 July 2021,"You had one job. Good action, good fight scenes. You failed. As with many action movies, i could tell from the first fight it was going to be bad. And it was, throughout. You can't see anything. Constant close-ups and shaky cam. How is this still a thing? The action and fight scenes in G. I. Joe: Retaliation in 2013 were significantly better. I know this because i rewatched it the day before. Sm damn h.On top of that, many of the scenes were dark. Lots of poor editing choices and quick-cuts. And worst of all, allow a fight scene to happen for more than 5 seconds. This seems to plague most hollywood movies. A fight will last 5 seconds before something interrupts, or one of them tackles the other and fall down a shaft. Can we just see a fight? Maybe 60 seconds? Or at least 30? Is that too much to ask?YOU HAVE IKO UWAIS (from the raid redemption, a GOAT martial arts movie). How do you waste him? He can do anything! And you give him a two minute ""fight scene"" involving bowls of water??????? And another 30 seconds late in the movie??????? Unbelievable.I also want to complain about another stupid hollywood trend. THIS MOVIE SHOULD BE RATED R. It's about ninjas fighting with swords, sais and throwing stars. There should be blood and stabbings, but we see none. Grow some balls plz. Or at least release the unrated cut simultaneously so we can choose. Sm damn h againOther than that, the movie was mediocre overall. I was invested in the story most of the way, but then it delves into madness. I like the two lead actors, and i was invested in the characters, especially tommy. But it didn't amount to anything.There were some really dumb moments and things that make no sense. Like using swords when you have guns. Or a guy with a magical stone that incinerates ppl but not using it to prevent his defeat. Also, in a movie entirely based in reality, a magical stone feels so out of place.All in all, this wasn't a good movie, but i could have enjoyed it if the action was good (1 viewing, 7/28/2021)",Snake Eyes
10,UniqueParticle,The IMAX experience made it better otherwise pretty good,6,23 July 2021,"Fairly exhilarating intense quite fast paced but very meh in many aspects! I understand the hate more than usual, Snake Eyes felt very stale and the best chunk of the movie is the last half hour. I loved the action more than anything otherwise I wouldn't recommend at all unless you watch purely for the thrill ride then you'd be pleased! I'm sure if there will be a sequel it'd be much better.",Snake Eyes
11,cruise01,"Boring story, decent origin set up, and action.",6,27 July 2021,3 out of 5 stars.Snake Eyes is a fair action film that is an origin story for Snake Eyes. It may seem like a disappointing origin set up. With the film having a boring revenge story. Decent action sequences. And flat script that makes the characters forgettable.The plot follows Snake Eyes (Henry Goulding) ever since he was a kid. Witnessing his father being murdered. He plots a revenge scheme to find the killer. Even if he has to join a menacing clan. Until he escapes with Storm Shadow (Andrew Koji). Which he invites Snake Eyes to his family clan. Where he will master fighting skills and become part of the family. While Snake Eyes is keeping and searching for his fathers killer.The plot is boring. A revenge story that feels flat. It does have some set up for G. I. Joes. Like a short introduction of Scarlett (Samara Weaving) and Baroness (Ursula Corbero). And hint of a shadowy organization like Cobras. The script does not help but give dull characters and a flat story.Henry Goulding is great with the role. Andrew Koji is forgettable. Along with Ursula Corbero. Samara Weaving is decent with the character.The action sequences is decent with its fair share of action. Director could have shot it better. It was exciting to see once. But forgettable after it is all over. There is a mid credit scene that plots away for another sequel.Snake Eyes is an okay film which could have been better. But a far drop to setting expectations high for a franchise.,Snake Eyes
12,Fella_shibby,Atrocious editing ruined the action sequences. The locations are top notch though.,4,29 August 2021,"I saw this mainly cos of Iko Uwais n got terribly disappointed cos his footage is less n he doesnt get to kick ass.Then i thot lets just enjoy the action but then again none of the fight scenes are noteworthy.Recently i saw Lee's Fist of Fury n i loved the Japanese garden. This movie too has some some beautiful gardens, lakes, hill tops houses, etc.The editing ruined everything.Cos of the shaky cam n fast cut editing, one cannot make out what is going on during the fight scenes.The character of Snake Eyes is more spiteful n the character of Shadow Storm more sympathetic.How conveniently the clan n the Major Scarlett work together with Baroness, a Cobra member.Also how easily Snake Eyes forgives his dad's murderer n after that fight alongside Baroness inspite of knowing that Cobra gang gave the orders to eliminate his dad.I miss those old ninja movies man.",Snake Eyes

14,DarkVulcan29,Seems to similar to Batman Begins,7,27 July 2021,"I didn't like G. I. Joe : The Rise of Cobra(2009), but did like G. I. Joe : Retaliation(2013) a little more. Now they have decided to build a G. I. Joe universe, by rebooting the franchise.Now the story is almost the same has Batman Begins(2005), I believe this movie took inspiration from that. Now Henry Golding has Snake Eyes is a mixed bag, when it came to the fight scenes, it's clear he does not have much experience in martial arts, cause it goes to many cutaways to the point I was guessing the parts where it was and wasn't him. But his acting really shines through playing Snake Eyes has very conflicted, not just one noted.Action scenes are pretty descent, not great but descent. The rest of the cast are pretty good too, even Samara Weaving has Scarlett, like the action figure came to life. Does he become the character we know from G. I.

15,generationofswine,An Honest Review,1,27 July 2021,"Well... if you know nothing about GI Joe, I guess it's good, except that Snake Eyes comes across as sort of an, well, an A-Word for most of the movie.And if you are a fan of GI Joe, this has nothing to do with Snake Eyes, the character isn't Snake Eyes, he's not even mute or horribly scared, and the movie absolutely sucks.But then, I guess if you are a fan of GI Joe, than you are toxic and the movie isn't made for you because it's made for the people who, I guess aren't GI Joe fans and is just reliant on the fans who it's not made for to make the box office returns that it didn't have because the fans who it's not made for are toxic for not seeing it.... or something like that.Anyway, it's not really a GI Joe movie, the character's aren't at all the same, and what you have is really sort of a bad kung-fu movie with choppy action, that doesn't even really work as a generic kung-fu movie because even that seems out of place and done in short and choppy motion that leaves the viewer kind of sea sick with no real idea who is doing what or what is going on when the fighting starts.So, I guess if you don't know anything about GI Joe, it might only be a bad movie and not an absolutely horrible movie.",Snake Eyes
16,stevendbeard,Reboot of the Hasbro Universe,7,23 July 2021,"I saw ""Snake Eyes"", staring Henry Golding-Last Christmas, Crazy Rich Asians; Andrew Koji-Warrior_tv, Fast & Furious 6; Ursula Corbero-The Tree of Blood, The Broken Crown and Samara Weaving-Bill & Ted Face the Music, Ready or Not.This is a reboot of the G. I. Joe-and Hasbro-universe that will contain other properties, such as M. A. S. K., Rom:SpaceKnight and The Micronauts. This is a spinoff of the Joes and is an origin story for Snake Eyes. Henry plays the iconic character that saves the life of Andrew, who, unbeknownst to him, happens to be a powerful man-You will also learn how Snake Eyes got his name. In gratitude, Andrew takes Henry into his clan and teaches him the ways of the warrior-and treats him like a brother. Of course, conflict enters the picture in the form of Cobra, lead by Ursula, aka, The Baroness. You do get to see one of the G. I. Joe team members; Scarlett, played by Samara. Lots of sword-and other weapons-fighting, plus gun battles and a magical jewel that everyone seems to want. By the end, you will know why Snake Eyes and Storm Shadow don't get along. There is a scene-just as the end credits start-that portends future installments in the series, but nothing at the very end.It's rated ""PG-13"" for violence and language and has a running time of 2 hours & 1 minute.I really enjoyed it and I would buy it on Blu_Ray.",Snake Eyes

This movie is directed by Robert Schwentke (Red) and stars Henry Golding (Crazy Rich Aliens), Andrew Koji (Fast and Furious 6), Peter Mensah (Spartacus), Úrsula Corberó (Money Heist) and Samara Weaving (Ready or Not). The storyline for this is very straightforward but fun for fans of the original animated series to watch unfold as traditional characters slowly get introduced into the storyline. I loved the action scenes throughout the movies. The street fights, sword fights, and action scenes on the motorcycles are all over the top and well done. Overall this is an action genre junky fans dream that I would score a solid 7/10.",Snake Eyes

I. Joe Origins is a very positive exception for me and a movie that is much better than its lukewarm reception might indicate.First and foremost, this film is a feast of martial arts fans. Back in the seventies, there were four new martial arts films at the cinema every week but these days they are hard to come by. In this film, we see ferocious fist fights but also the use of daggers, pistols and swords and even some elements of magic. The choreography is stunning and the pace is at times breathtaking.Up next, the locations for this movie have been chosen with care. The film starts with a series of different locations from a cabin in the woods over a shady underground fighting circuit to a port infiltrated with criminals. Most of the movie however takes place in a Japanese ninja dojo that looks absolutely stunning. This starts with the traditional buildings and continues with the surrounding forests, gardens, temples and shrines. The settings are very detailed and ooze with atmosphere.The acting performances are also very decent. It was a great pleasure to see Iko Uwais on the big screen again but he doesn't play a ferocious martial artist but rather a wise teacher in this film which suits him surprisingly well. The same could be said about Peter Mensah as a blind master whose words are filled with philosophy and wisdom. My personal highlight is however Abe Haruka who appears as an analytical security boss at first but turns out to be an empathic, foresightful and intelligent woman.The story is also very interesting as it offers many twists and turns and makes viewers ask themselves how they would react under similar circumstances. If I were on a quest to avenge my family but were invited as a friend to a ninja dojo controlled by such a charismatic security boss, I would probably not pursue the path of betrayal.At the end of the day, Snake Eyes: G. I. Joe Origins is much better than its reputation and turns out to be a charismatic martial arts action film that should appeal to a much larger audience than those who are only interested in superhero movies.",Snake Eyes

Joe Origins: A good adventure story, MMA, sword fighting, gunplay, Ninjas, international conspiracies, motorbike chases and a lust for vengeance.

23,masonsaul,Weakest G.I. Joe adaptation so far,6,18 August 2021,"Snake Eyes: G. I. Joe Origins is the weakest G. I. Joe adaptation so far with an extremely dumb plot and the G. I. Joe stuff feels pointless but it still manages to be a fun action thriller.Henry Golding gives a great lead performance even if he doesn't feel like Snake Eyes by the end. Úrsula Corberó, Samara Weaving, Takehiro Hira and Iko Uwais are all really good and Andrew Koji is definitely the standout.Robert Schwentke's direction is solid apart from the action sequences which, whilst extremely stylized and impactful, are hard to comprehend at times and too short. It's well paced and the music by Martin Todsharow is fantastic.",Snake Eyes
24,rgkarim,An Origin Story Whose Eyes Fell From the Prize,7,24 July 2021,"LIKES:Decent Pace:
The first G. I. Joe dragged its feet to get to the good parts and the second just sacrificed everything else, Snake Eyes origin managed to meet middle ground for this reviewer. An event that drives the character sets the stage for an emotional foundation, that dives into modern era and gets us into the chronicles of shadows that he will soon start writing. The movie then keeps a pace going that is fast enough to not be bogged down by details, but also not shallow to deprive us of a story. I enjoyed this balanced pace and the attempts at telling a story that had action support it.The Special Effects/Sound Editing:
For a big blockbuster, you always hope that special effects and sound effects to bring the full experience to the theater trip. Snake Eyes is a prime example of Hollywood's effects lab in full stride with high special effects moments, intense sound effects of sword clanging, explosion blasting, gun blazing goodness that we love to see in these kinds of film. There is seldom a quiet moment in this film and I really enjoyed the attention to detail to help keep things looking real without diving too much in CGI cheesiness. In addition, I appreciated that slow motion was only used a little bit here and there instead of at every turn (take a lesson Zack Snyder) utilized for only those choice moments to emphasize a kill or awesome move.Story is better:
I'm not saying it's gold or complete, but the story is miles better than what we got years ago with Channing Tatum. Characters don't feel too cartoony anymore, simplistic forms brought to real life and feeling out of place and forced for the sake of humor. Snake Eyes origins have a little more depth to his involvement, giving the character a darker set of morals to balance in his quest to be a hero. The ninja has deeper levels than simply slashing and gunning, and I liked seeing his skills develop with his character alongside several other members of the ninja league. Throw in the ties to the G. I. Joe universe and you again have a good potential restart like Bumblebee before it. The origins story certainly does have its limitations, but it still was lightyears better with its character and story development compared to the corny origin of Cobra commander in the previous installation.The Action:
The highlight for me is the action sequences in this film and how much it feels like something out of G. I Joe cartoons. Sword fights are the primary means for fighting in this installment, but it delivers on the promised cling clang, Kungfu, slash and slice that trailers showed. There is some bite to the fights, and lots of those ridiculous, off the wall moves that have been made famous from Bruce Lee movies that adds that campy edge to make it fun. I felt they managed to keep things relatively dynamic in terms of the arenas they fought and enjoyed getting distracted by the quick bouts in those pinnacle moments.DISLIKES:Some Of The Acting Is Cheesy:
There are times that the acting drives down a different pathway, one that is less fun and weaker given the direction they were going. Mostly during the emotional moments, these soap opera like cries are funnier than emotional and thus feel out of place. Some temper tantrums and set up scenes are also a bit more melodramatic, trying to set up an epic fight that then sort of fizzles out in the long run. A few other characters need some more time to help get the full acting effect, but this is rather minor for me compared to some of the other limitations.Story Limitations:
While the story is an improvement, there are still things that need work in terms of making this a quality tale. Predictability is a big part, with so much foreshadowing and leading dialogue to help scream what is going to happen with our crew, especially if you are a GI Joe fan. Second is the fact that there is a lot of introductions in this origin movie and not necessarily all were needed to the extent we saw. Snake Eyes' journey into the ninja world feels a little rushed and simplified given the buildup, with several trials and training montages skipped for some reason. Meanwhile, the inner workings of the Yakuza are sort of blunted as well and the obsession of certain components sort of makes for a lame reason for why they are doing what they are doing. Throw in certain characters from the Joe universe making early, sometimes in your face, appearances and it again throws a wrench in the smooth workings of the machine this movie was starting to be. Sadly, the other thing I did not enjoy is the big plot device that sort of tied the arcs together. In terms of the cartoons, it could work when the war gets established and Cobra Commander starts to look for alternative options. However, this magical artifact that is in this film is sort of standing out given all the other avenues of technology and warfare they could have chosen. It makes the movie jump into the corny realm and away from the direction it was going. In addition, I believe there are those angry with the fact that Snake's new origins may be insulting to the good name of the character, and the purists who prefer him silent and stoic will most likely not enjoy the direction they took in this film.The Action/Camera work:
While I enjoy the action's pace, the sound effects, and the energy, I can't lie and say there was more coordination that was still needed. For one thing, more edge and suspense with the fights would have been nice, adding rivalry, stakes, and a few close calls that could have made them more exciting. The knowing that most if not all parties would survive thanks to that foreshadowing took a bit of that suspense away from me. Second, the fights could have evolved a little more past pure sword fighting, bleeding the gun play and sword fighting Snake will eventually find normal when working for the Joes. Third is more time with other characters showing their moments, as many of the extra characters had only fleeting glimpses of awesome moves when there could have been so much more merging of styles the way the Avengers did in their movies. Fourth, the unnecessary involvement of other Joe's characters sort of interrupts the flow of things, and though some cool moves could be seen, I would have liked them to not be randomly inserted into the fray with little logic or purpose. However, the biggest limitation is the camera work and the masking of the editing involved with the sequences. Why shaky camera syndrome and new angles switching is popular I don't know, but it got in the way of what could have been awesome displays of martial arts and sword play. Not the most nauseating, but still would work on full sequence shots and less editing to make it seem full sequences would be a major improvement.The VERDICT:
Snake Eyes was more enjoyable for me than I had expected and managed to bring some promising elements to the table should the G. I. Joe verse rev up. I liked Golding's class and poise, and I felt that there was plenty of time with many characters they introduced. Snake Eyes' journey to his ninja status has some heart and layers, helping give some better character development than the past. With a good pace and some action sequences that are very comic book like , with great sound effects/special effects flair, high energy, and keeping the movie going. Yet, the movie still has some work to do to get the universe set up to the crème de la crème it wants to achieve. The acting does fall into cheesy territory at times, with the story limitations forcing our group to have to go into soap opera drama levels that take ways from the better performances. This new origins tale does sort of squash Snake Eyes character that most know and has predictability patterns that mess up some things, but it's the fact they tried to cream so much into the movie again fails for this reviewer. As for the action game, the jittery camera and uneven editing take away from what could have been the next stage of action for this series, alongside unneeded interruptions from a fight that could have been the perfect bite to the Joe army. Overall though, it's fun and promising for G. I. Joe to return if they can help add some finesse to the foundation.My scores are:
Action/Adventure/Fantasy: 7.0
Movie Overall: 6.0

25,rannynm,The Thrilling Adventure Of A Lifetime And The Perfect Origin Story,10,22 July 2021,"Snake Eyes: G. I. Origins is the thrilling adventure of a lifetime and the perfect origin story to such a beloved character. With motorcycles, swords and a mystical gem - you will be a part of an incredible mission.The movie is a spin-off around the character of Snake Eyes (Henry Golding). Holding onto the trauma of his father being murdered, Snake Eyes is on the hunt for his father's killer. He trains with the Arashikage clan to become a top ninja. Meanwhile, he makes a deal with some unlikely allies to find his dad's murderer.Snake Eyes: G. I. Joe Origins is an action-packed movie and is not to be missed. The fight scenes are incredibly filmed, using long one-take shots to capture the film's actors fighting with swords. The cinematography is iconic, with some night scenes shot with bright neon lights and others with a calming, peaceful, bright light. It's so cool to watch modern-day ninjas on motorcycles fighting one another on the streets. This film is perfect for fans all around the world that enjoy amazing battle sequences, especially for G. I. Joe fans. Familiar faces are shown like the Baroness and Kenta. We also see a teaser for Snake Eyes' most popular villain, which leaves the movie open for a very exciting sequel. The film is a wonderful origin story, telling the tale of Snake Eyes, showing just how he became affiliated with the Joes and where he's off to next, while sprinkling in some major plot twists.The moral of the story is to trust yourself and always do the right thing. Many times Snake Eyes is tempted to kill his father's killer and throughout the film he learns the meaning of honor - to others and yourself - and makes a surprising choice. He also learns how to find inner peace with many of the things he's done and moves on to the next chapter of his life.I give Snake Eyes: G. I. Joe Origins 5 out of 5 stars and recommend it for ages 13 to 18 plus adults. It is available only in theaters July 23, 2021.By Heather S., KIDS FIRST!",Snake Eyes
26,vengeance20,It's Alright,5,26 August 2021,"So, having only seen the first 2 G. I. Joe Films & none of the others that I've yet to see, I went in to see this only because of the G. I. Joe name & because I've seen the first 2 films & thought they were pretty good.The film follows an ancient Japanese clan called the Arashikage who welcomes a tenacious loner Snake Eyes after he saves the life of their heir apparent. Upon arrival in Japan, the Arashikage teaches him the ways of the Ninja warrior while also providing him something he's been longing for: a home. However, when secrets from Snake Eyes' past are revealed, his honor and allegiance get tested, even if that means losing the trust of those closest to him.I found the film to be alright, it's not amazing or outstanding especially given the first 2 films I've seen in the G. I. Joe Franchise which from what I remember were pretty good. The story seemed a bit all over the place & blurred as you didn't know exactly who to root for. The films runtime was too long & could've been shorten, the pacing also was an issue here in this film.The fights were good, but pretty tame for my tastes given I'd of like to have seen some gory gruesome fights. The end part with the pit of Anacondas was pretty good & there was some eye candy here & there so that was also something.Overall, it's not particularly an amazing or outstanding film, but it's alright at best.5/10.",Snake Eyes

28,arungeorge13,"Poorly written, poorly staged set-pieces! [+32%]",3,19 August 2021,"This movie really sucked both as an origin story and an action flick based on a once-famous toyline. The writing is so damn bland that you won't care for a single character. Samara Weaving's there in a blink & miss role, and she's the only one in this mess who commands decent screen presence. The less about the main cast, the better. Henry Golding looks uncomfortable in the role of Snake Eyes and struggles to carry it all the way. I did like Andrew Koji's portrayal of Storm Shadow to an extent. The plotting is, however, the worst. How can you stage a ninja clan feud so terribly? Badly shot (too much shaky cam) and weirdly edited, the action scenes are not what you'd want from a G. I Joe movie. I thought this would make for a great popcorn actioner, but what I watched turned out to be one of the trashiest films of the year.",Snake Eyes
29,martimusross,Great Origin Movie!,7,28 August 2021,"Snake EyesI really enjoyed this marshal arts romp from start to finish and we really got a comprehensive origin story. To be frank Henry Golding has the look but not the depth of acting talent to have a movie rest solely upon him, this deficit was self-evident in Monsoon. However for this, quite superficial role, he was well cast and raised up his game from the level of eye candy!So much was good, the contrast of good and evil, the fight sequences, fighting granny, brother chemistry, supernatural events, styling, scoring the list is endless. But to my mind what made this great was the tongue in cheek light touch of the script and direction.I am not sure why there are so many mean reviews on here, but comic purists always find fault, well wake up and smell the coffee, art products must be judged on their individual merits as to whether they rise or fall, we must judge what is before us, not what we want or think should be before us, as this would be unfair!The ""spirit"" brother Tommy, played by Andrew Koji was great as was the entire ensemble.I wasn't expecting much but this movie pleasantly over-delivered. It was a slow start but rose to a crescendo! I'm giving this a firm 7 for pure entertainment.",Snake Eyes

31,Vivekmaru45,"Mediocre, hugely generic action movie based on the hit 80's cartoon.",5,28 August 2021,"This is the G. I. Joe origins story of Snake Eyes. I have never seen G. I. Joe while growing up and there have been other memorable cartoons like He-Man and Masters Of The Universe and the 80's Spider-man cartoons.So I don't know a lot about the backstory of all these characters. As a newcomer watching this movie, the feeling of it is like a sci-fi ninja film at some times with elements of mythology and the supernatural. They have crossed many genres making this one.The film is not that dull and will hold your attention but after starting to watch this one you will feel a compulsion to finish it and find out what happens at the end.For me the farcical parts of the movie were just plain ridiculous and when it turned to the mythological from being a straight-up ninja film, I knew that the ending would be pointless, but I sat through till the very end.For those who have watched that cartoon series in the '80s, no doubt you will be sorely disappointed. It is nothing like what you have been used to before. Still in a manner of speaking it is better than the Black Widow movie I have seen.",Snake Eyes
32,abisio,Two hours of pure entertainment,10,23 July 2021,"I really do not understand other critics/users this movie keeps the action moving 90% of the time.The character development is excellent but instead of long monologues or low paced moments like in F9 (basically a Mexican Telenovela / soap opera) with cars; or the better but not by far Black Widow; basically a CHICK-FLIC drama disguised as super-heroines movie, here is incepted within the action.So instead of soap opera dialogs and tears we get images an action to define the betrayal between two friends.Yes; is not as light as the others. Snake Eyes and Shadow Storm hate each other and the first reason is explained by this movie; and even if the movie is called Snake Eyes, he is not such a good person; he betrays everybody to reach his own personal motives.Robert Schwentke has a nice resume with medium budget movies. He is able to keep a very fast pace, very decent action scenes with outstanding stunt work (seems the main characters make many of them) and avoid ridiculous digital fights like in the las MORTAL KOMBAT. He is also able to pay with cliches but not let them take over the movie. There are some obvious ""for the picture"" scenes but just one or two.Contrary to other action movies; the acting here goes from very good to excellent. Henry Golding (Snake) and Andrew Koji (Storm) are incredible good. Golding has charisma to spare but Koji has a dramatic depth difficult to match. You feel his pain sorry when he is betrayed by his friend and punished by his family. It makes the love-hate situation quite believable.Takehiro Hira as the bad bad guy, is almost as charismatic as Golding; sadly the final showdown use a magic stone instead of his charisma. Iko Uwais got better luck on his few scenes; some fighting and comedy.The rest of the cast has very good funny moments; specially Ursula Corbero as the Baroness.In brief; this is not an over priced production. There is excellent action and acting but little in digital imagery; so if you enjoy good fights, impressive skills and a decent story; this is your movie.",Snake Eyes
33,kuarinofu,"""Did you see that? Snake Eyes is on our side""",4,19 August 2021,"The title is the quote the film completely lost me with around 90 minutes in.Don't get me wrong, it wasn't that engaging before that point. But the first 20 minutes were actually ok, all the Yakuza port stuff was pretty good if not for the shaky cam.While watching it, I felt like I was trying to like it more than I should. It was almost like it was trying to get good, but never quite reached that point.There are lots of weird things going on in this production in general. First of all - Robert Schwentke. The name rang a bell so I checked and yes - I've seen Der Hauptmann. Why Snake Eyes? I don't know, maybe it's the paycheck. Then there are weird tonal jumps, serious and gritty (but basic) mob-revenge plot mixed with magic giant anacondas (and flying grandmas). I understand the simplicity of the source material, but why make it as serious at times? Kids won't enjoy it since the actions scenes are mostly short and shot with shaky cam. Adults are never going to take this story seriously, especially after the clownery of the past 90-minute mark. After the magical reunion, it just became a complete farce.I think that this film was salvaged by all the talented people that were in it. Andrew Koji was a saving grace of this film, I liked his acting a lot. Then there's Iko Uwais, but they mostly wasted his skills since we barely see him doing anything. The CGI was surprisingly good for such a film also.Snake Eyes is extremely unlikable and gives you no reason to root for him. Maybe this was intentional, but his ark never feels accomplished.The film had a couple of nice sets, although I'd wish they would have all the Japanese scenery set in wintertime, that would've been great. Also, I had a feeling that the film was set in the 90ties but when it came to product placement it suddenly switched to modern-day cars, embarrassing.I didn't like any of the other cast besides Takehiro Hira as Kenta. Baroness was a joke, Scarlett's presence in the film wasn't justified at all, just have more giant anacondas instead.Overall, I can't say I expected anything at all, and there was no reason for the film to exist. It's not like there is a demand for G. I. Joe origins whatever-verse. In the end, I just feel sad about the talent of the film. Hope everyone was well-paid for this.",Snake Eyes
34,Movi3DO,Not a good origin story,5,24 July 2021,"Ah now we have your average Joe.I haven't watched any G. I. Joe movies, so I have no idea about Snake Eyes coming in. Because of this, I judge this movie only as an independent action, hoping it to be a great summer blockbuster. And I was disappointed.Before the movie began, Henry Golding shared that there's gonna be a lot of action. That's true, as there were multiple sword fights. However, each fight was short and unsatisfying. The camera angles were bad, and I couldn't see the choreography clearly. Iko Uwais was in this movie, and he's a fantastic martial artist actor. However, he got little screen time. It's almost like they don't have the budget for long fight choreography.The story was boring and not special. Snake Eyes was a bland and bad protagonist. I don't care much about his journey, and the ending for his character felt unjustified. It's not that Henry Golding's acting was bad, but the direction for his character made him like a side character.The acting was okay across. Only Andrew Koji stood out as the Storm Shadow. He was pretty badass with the swords, especially his serious face. I think he stole the spotlight from Golding's Snake Eyes.Overall, a mediocre story with unsatisfying action scenes. 5/10.",Snake Eyes

Suffice to say, such impulsive execution did catch me by surprise (and not in a good way).Right off the bat, it appears to be incongruous, or to simply put plain ridiculous at times. So much so that even the most decisive moments (Plot points) look so arbitrary in here! Moreover, I reserve the same criticism for the Screenplay as well. Which seems to have had absolutely no idea about its purpose or any kind of incentive whatsoever!Thankfully, the action doesn't disappoint as much. Although it gets a bit repetitive and wearisome (Mainly due to the excessive use of Shaky Cams) after a certain period of time; but in general, it does tick most of the boxes.Now speaking for the Characters, I can't remember the last time I had seen such a confusing group of individuals who don't even know what are they supposed to do in the first place.

This action thriller is a G. I. Joe spin-off centered around the character of Snake Eyes. Upon arrival in Japan, the Arashikage teach Snake Eyes the ways of the ninja warrior. But when secrets from his past are revealed, his honor and allegiance will be tested. The dramatic thriller is directed by Robert Schwentke.Critics have scored this film fairly low, but I enjoyed it. Thank you to Paramount Pictures for inviting me to a press screening IN THEATERS! I've missed that movie theater popcorn!THINGS I LIKED:
The first time Henry Golding really got on my radar was when he starred as the leading man in the rom-com Crazy Rich Asians. Then, I saw him in another romance called Last Christmas in 2019 and as a gentleman in A Simple Favor . He absolutely proves himself as a skilled, believable action hero in this movie! He's from Malaysia and got his start as the host of a travel show on TV there! The original Snake Eyes character was actually Caucasian in the comic books, but I love Henry Golding in this role. This is, clearly, Henry Golding's big breakout movie that proves he is a star!The talented cast also includes Andrew Koji, Haruka Abe, Takehiro Hira, and Peter Mensah.Lots of cool transitions.I've actually been to the Imperial Palace that's featured in the film. It's ridiculously beautiful outside and inside. What a great set for a movie!Japan is the perfect location to film the fantasy elements.Gorgeous cinematography.Beautiful set pieces.The first challenge that Snake Eyes had to accomplish with the water bowls was super entertaining with a lovely end of the scene. Ninja training!The title gets its name from a sinister roll of dice, as well as actual snakes.There is some visual and spoken humor that the audience loved each time.Those electric motorcycles showcased in many scenes are so slick and cool.Keep watching during the end credits for several teasers that lead into the G. I. Joe franchise.THINGS I DIDN'T LIKE:
I don't know anyone who has been talking about the G. I. Joe franchise, nor asked for this origin story, but here we are.Sexy Ursula Corbero and Samara Weaving appear in movie posters and the trailer, yet are only in a few short scenes.It's pretty predictable.If you watch the trailer and think it looks dumb, then don't watch the movie because you probably won't like it. If you think the trailer looks cool, you'll like the film.The final battle gets messy.TIPS FOR PARENTS:

44,sbweightman,A good traditional action movie that takes itself far too seriously.,6,19 August 2021,"A good old fashioned action movie that takes itself far too seriously and doesn't seem to have much to do with G. I. Joe. The story isn't complex and is lacking in scale, but it has lots of Japanese culture and style and plenty of fast paced and exciting action scenes.

The sound design was noticeable satisfying, and I have no complaints in regards to cast is very good in general (no bad/annoying roles or deliveries). Although some are underused, and their response to movie-situations is questionable at times.Sadly, this is a very bland movie.. and as a G. I. Joe movie it is even worse! More so for the character of Snake Eyes (has to be seen to be understood, and a little investment on the character is required). This is because I didn't particularly enjoy the role given to the main lead and his development is undercooked. The story itself is nothing new (even with the addition of certain details). A configuration of things we've seen before many times making it not only predictable and a tad forgettable. And all in the service of a conclusion that is nothing short of a disappointment..It's no wonder word of mouth didn't help, but it can still be watched.

director: Robert Schwentke
starring: Henry Golding, Andrew Koji, Haruka Abe, Takehiro Hira, Eri Ishida, Iko Uwais, Peter Mensah, Ursula corbero, Samara Weaving etcAn ancient Japanese clan called the Arashikage welcomes tenacious loner Snake Eyes (Henry Golding) after he saves the life of their heir apparent. Upon arrival in Japan, the Arashikage teach him the ways of the ninja warrior while also providing him something he's been longing for: a home. However, when secrets from Snake Eyes' past are revealed, his honour and allegiance get tested even if that means losing the trust of those closest to him. Yikes what a mess this film was.Let's be nice and start with some positives as there was some. The set up and character motivations was good. As well as the strong action and cinematography, likeable characters and performances. I thought the set-up scene was strong. It set up good chemistry and motivation for snake eyes as a character and was an intense and emotional opening that started the film off well. This character motivation set up a good arc for snake eyes and had importance to the plot. The action was also very strong, apart from a lot of issues with the editing the action scenes for the most part were great. They were inventive, fun and thrilling and incorporated swords and creative weapons in a fun and entertaining way. The cinematography was also very strong. Visually the film was stunning, with some amazing uses of colour and shots that really enhanced and played around with the colour, the scope of the film was also very impressive with its action scenes. I also thought the film had likeable performances and characters. In particular with Haruka Abe. Her character and her performance was charming, emotional and she was amazing to watch. The performances from Henry Golding and Andrew Koji were also particularly strong.My first few negatives would be the unlikeable character decisions, rushed pacing and annoying shaky cam. As well as a passive main character. The film made all the characters very unlikeable especially the main character. And when you don't like the main character there is an issue. He was forming genuine friendships and a new family with the clan but decided to backstab them on multiple occasions just to get revenge for his father's death that never really materialised, but by the time this happened they had gone too far and made Snake eyes a very unlikeable character, it also didn't help that the characters turned on each other every 15 minutes. The film also had very rushed pacing, it would rush over so many scenes that would leave them underdeveloped or not explained, leaving a lot of plot holes or cutting to scenes that you didn't really know what was happening, it really made the film clunky and messy. The shaky cam was also very annoying. The action scenes were often ruined by extremely shaky cam or way too many cuts. It made it hard to concentrate, didn't show off the action well at all and was very frustrating to watch, taking a lot of the fun and entertainment out of the action sequences. Finally, the main character was very passive for a lot of the film. For a lot of the film Snake eyes was just doing what other characters were telling him to do and being influenced by others, never really being an active protagonist, he would just go from scene to scene following the other characters, this didn't make him a compelling character to watch at all.My final few positives would be the set locations, interesting twists. Some fun and intense scenes. As well as a strong female cast and entertaining action scenes in the final act. The films set locations were beautiful. The clan's home and the general setting in Japan was so visually stunning and just amazing to look at. There were also some interesting twists, I didn't see a lot of the twists coming which I respect. And a lot of them added an interesting layer to the plot and characters that kept me invested just long enough to care about the plot in parts. There were also some fun and intense scenes. The scenes involving Snake Eyes training were a lot of fun to watch, as he learned to think like the Arashikage, also the scenes involving the massive snakes were inventive and tested the characters to see if they were pure of heart, with some very intense scenes incorporated throughout. I also thought the female cast was very strong. There was a healthy mix of male and female characters. And the female characters could easily hold their own within the action scenes and the plot, and it was just nice to see such strong female characters. Finally, the final act had some entertaining action sequences. The final act itself was a mess, but it did deliver with the action. They toned down the shaky cam and therefore the action scenes were much more enjoyable to watch, and the final act was action packed so it did have some entertainment factor.My final few negatives would be the inconsistent character motivations. The lack of character depth, unsatisfying character arc and a messy final act. This film had so many inconsistencies with its character motivations, snake eyes switched about 5 times from working with the antagonists to get revenge for his father's death, but also building a family with the clan and finally having a home. It was never clear what his motivations were and that didn't add mystery, it made the film lazy and inconsistent. There was also a complete lack or character depth. All of the characters were very one-dimensional including snake eyes as a character. His only form of depth was his dad's death and how that impacted him, but it became so repetitive and stale that the character lacked any form of like ability or depth to connect with him. The character arc for snake eyes was also very unsatisfactory and poorly executed. The film built up an arc for Snake eyes to get revenge and justice for his father's death, but it was so sloppily executed. The man was just handed to him, and then there was a bland twist and Snake eyes let him run free for that one reason and it made so much of the basic depth they gave the character seem pointless. Finally, the final act was an absolute mess. The characters turned on each other every 10 minutes and the dialogue was terrible. With some lazy and oddly executed character decisions, and a bland set up for more films, and a frustrating set up, with the GI joe helmet that is iconic to the franchise was used in 1 scene for 10 seconds for a sequel that almost definitely isn't happening.Overall, Snake eyes has some visual appeal and entertainment factor. With some likeable performances. But is a jumbled, messy and inconsistent train wreck. That didn't have a clue what to do with its characters. And is the perfect example of all style no substance.Overall rating 37/100.",Snake Eyes

I really did not feel like this movie was good the cinematography is awful which sucked the trailer sold me the movie did not work sadly this is one of the most disappointing movies I saw this year the action does not work the thing that works is the cast performances and the Tokyo setting is great that is really it the villain sucks Tommy is an alright character this movie sucked so I give Snake Eyes G. I Joe Origins a C+,Snake Eyes
56,movieman6-413-929510,The new G.I. Joe reboot has a messy beginning.,4,24 July 2021,"Snake Eyes G. I. Joe Origins is a reboot of the G. I. Joe movie series. This reboot is directed by Robert Schwentke, the director of RED and R. I. P. D.In the film, Snake Eyes (Henry Golding) is allowed to join the clan after rescuing the future new leader of the Arashikage clan. Here he gets lessons to become a ninja. During these lessons, Snake Eyes is confronted by his past, causing the clan to question his honor and loyalty. To successfully complete his training, Snake Eyes must regain the clan's trust.The script and eventual story of the film was written by Evan Spiliotopoulos. He had help from two other writers for this, because he was also busy with his own fan film The Unholy. Because of this pressure, he has finished the script of this film a bit messy.In addition to the messy script, the film is also filmed somewhat messy. Most action scenes are filmed moving and zoomed in, so as a viewer you don't get a clear picture of what exactly is happening. Other scenes in which characters walk alone are even filmed flexibly, making it almost as if this film was filmed by a director just starting out. For example, the art of Asian martial arts is lost in this film.The special effects in the film are also not believable. Some creatures show that they were placed in the film with CGI, as well as some flames and explosions. The film is also sometimes a bit too hastily put together where characters move from place to place at a rapid pace. If they had just started the scenes where the characters went, the final movie would have been clearer and shorter.Despite the lesser script and directing work, Henry Golding tries to make the most of his role. Together with Andrew Koij he does have good chemistry in the film, while with another character he suddenly jumps from a difficult to a passionate relationship. Other characters are in the film more in reference to the G. I. Joe series. Although fans of the G. I. Joe series can recognize the names of some of the characters, they often have to get used to the way they appear in this film.",Snake Eyes

58,darkreignn,Horribly filmed action ruined this movie,3,25 July 2021,"I'm a big fan of Yakuza films, so when I saw the trailer for ""Snake Eyes,"" I was ecstatic - a gritty, grounded origin of one of G. I. Joe's most beloved characters, in the form of a Japanese mobster movie, seemed too good to be true. And lo and behold, it was! ""Snake Eyes"" seems to suffer from an identity crisis; there is not enough gangster politics to be a successful gangster movie - there is not enough character development to be a satisfying drama - and perhaps the worst offense: there is not enough well-filmed action for this to be a great action film.Let's jump right into why ""Snake Eyes"" isn't a good film - the action. When you hire master choreographers to create beautiful action sequences, why would you then destroy them by choosing to film your action with close-up, handheld, shaky cam? This stylistic decision is infuriating and unforgivable. There was only one sequence in this movie that was well shot; other than that, literally every other single action scene was made incomprehensible due to the filmmaking.There were so many set pieces that could've been memorable and exciting if only the cameraman would've put the camera on a tripod, prepared a wide shot, and stepped away. You have scenes of small armies engaged in katana-on-katana action, and you won't be able to see any of it because the cameraman is standing two feet away and shaking the camera like it owes him money. This filmmaking decision literally ruined the action in this film, and as a consequence, ruined the film itself - because when the action in your action movie sucks, your movie sucks.That said, perhaps the storyline and the engaging characters can add some sort of entertainment value? You'd be half right. The story itself is pretty interesting, if not very engaging. There's enough to keep you slightly invested in what's happening and why, but again, everything is framed around terribly filmed action sequences that damper the fun. The acting was serviceable, but nothing too breathtaking. Henry Golding as Snake Eyes had a certain tenacity about him that was fun to watch, but the script seemed to try a little too hard to make him ""cool."" Samara Weaving was gorgeous, as always, and pretty good here - however, she barely has any screen time, and isn't introduced until about half way through the film. That said, she is a show stealer when she's on screen.""Snake Eyes"" did have some cool cinematography to bask at - if you enjoy Asian cinema, you'll certainly enjoy the look of the film. That said, if you enjoy good action, you're going to despise this movie. I'd recommend only checking this out if you're a big G. I. Joe fan - if you're not? There's a million other Yakuza action films at your disposal; don't waste your time with this.",Snake Eyes

62,nidhunmoviebuff,A shambolic origin story for a beloved GI Joe character!,5,18 August 2021,"The GI Joe franchise has been moderately successful due to its over-the-top, Fast & Furious style action sequences and not over any great depth in screenplay. Director Robert Schwentke seems to have forgotten this, delivering a half-baked product in 'Snake Eyes', the origin story of one of the most beloved GI Joe characters.Henry Golding stars as the iconic Ninja warrior and we catch him right from his tumultuous childhood as he grows up on the streets after losing his dad. Andrew Koji is fantastic is his arch nemesis 'Storm Shadow' and we see how they go from blood brothers to arch enemies.The usually dependable Úrsula Corberó (Tokyo from Money Heist) was given precious little to work with in a villainous role, with the writing wearing this on too many occasions. With cliches twists and repetitive action sequences that fail to wow you, 'Snake Eyes' reduces to a tiring watch.With the wide canvas of a fresh GI Joe origin story open to him, it is criminal that the director wasn't able to paint a better picture of the beloved children's toy series. Samara Weaving is abysmal as the Joe agent 'Scarlett' and Takehiro Hira is more comical than menacing as the diabolical 'Kenta'.A big let down, especially given how much of a fan following this character has. Not recommended!",Snake Eyes
63,kenzibit,Not Worth the $25 digital purchase but will stick with it.,6,17 August 2021,A great selection of characters with a pretty weak origin story for one of the most decorated and favorable characters in G. I. Joe. Yakuza films are known for their organized crime actions and dealings but this movie had less to do with that. Was kinda weak to the lore and they kinda ruined the great action sequences with close-up shots and shaky cameras. I kinda get disappointed when a great fighting sequence gets cut for a new scene and gets you wondering why they didn't show the whole fight for the sequence to be memorable. Was a bit fun nonetheless and will stick with it....hope to see a sequel.,Snake Eyes
64,PCC0921,That Pivotal Moment Was Lost,5,2 August 2021,"Released: July 23rd, 2021
Viewed: July 28th, 2021Looking back over the last 12 years, since the first GI Joe film came out (GI Joe: The Rise of Cobra - 2009), the landscape, that this type of film inhabits, has changed some since then. In the years since 2009, a new type of film-franchising has taken the world by storm. Of course, I am talking about the cross-over franchise universes that are the Marvel Cinematic Universe and the DC Extended Universe. Both have managed to create self-contained film/TV universes, teaming with characters and worlds, full of stories to tell, for the next many decades to come. It even has helped earlier franchises, such as Star Trek and Star Wars, find/expand their franchise limits even further as well. Heck, even the Legendary Pictures Godzilla/Kong Monster-verse seems to be working also. Looking at this new form of film franchise creation, from a Hasbro production perspective, creates a certain problem for the success of this film.When looking at Hasbro's success since the first Transformers (2007), came out, the money is definitely there, but the critical response has been a difficult road for the toy/entertainment giant. That is the part we want to concentrate on here and not the monetary value of the IPs. We should be honest here and say that Hasbro's best film was Battleship (2012), which never got a sequel and maybe, half of the Transformers movies were better than fair. We also should note that, the first two GI Joe movies were not really great either. Could Hasbro do something to correct the course that this seemingly damaged IP has? Can it learn a lesson from what came before it without being a modern day film cliché? What really is worse is, these are just the beginning of the hurtles that Snake Eyes: GI Joe Origins (2021), needs to face in order to be good.Snake Eyes picks up on many film clichés, new and old, such as, the fact that it copied the X-Men Origins concept by making it GI Joe Origins. I saw some Guy Ritchie inspired text placements (see Wrath of Man - 2021), throughout this film. Many of the motorcycle scenes looked like they were pulled right out of Akira (1988). It even had the standard superhero lineup that happens right before the big climactic fight scene commences. There's even an after credits scene. In fact this totally looked like a carbon copy of a Marvel attempt. Also, don't release this film in a year that is already teeming with Asian-inspired, action-type, plot lines. We just saw the release of the Mortal Kombat (2021), remake. A new Kung Fu (2021), show just debuted on the CW. Plus, we have been gearing up for the last 18 months for the soon to be released Marvel film, Shang Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings (2021). There is going to be content saturation that will effect originality.The producers try to salvage the GI Joe film series by placing all its hopes on exploring the origin of one of its main characters. The problem stems from the fact that this type of character has been seen before and may not be as original an idea after all. They decide to pick a character, who is mostly a faceless, dark, shadowy, ninja type of persona. He is always seen that way in the GI Joe films, known for wearing a dark black hooded mask, who usually doesn't say much either. Now we have a backstory about this guy, which doesn't hold your attention much, because the character was so one dimensional already. We learn how he becomes Snake Eyes and what contributions the snakes play into his story, but that aspect starts to counteract the whole original form of the character. You begin not to care. It is a GI Joe story, but it becomes boring and dull. There are some good action scenes that seem hampered at times by the slow script. The excellently choreographed stunts begin to look all too familiar.That by no means implies that this is a horrible film. Not by a long shot. There are some good points to this film. Some interesting aspects that make it compelling to watch. If you look at this film based on basic technical film principles then it is a perfect film. It has all the polish, professional perfections that any Hollywood film made today has, but after 125 years of movies, that isn't always enough. The film was way too long and when we finally get to the part of the movie centered around that pivotal moment when we finally learn the GI Joe connection with Snake Eyes, is fumbled. That great moment when these two huge pillars of the plotline first meet, becomes almost an afterthought.What saves this film is the excellent acting by the superb, almost completely, Asian cast. One of the great aspects of Snake Eyes, who is from Asian-descent, named after a pair of dice, is completely American (since he was captured as a young child and grew up in Los Angeles), gets thrown into a situation in this film taking him all the way to Japan and he can only speak English. He is that real American hero, who needs his captors, allies and enemies to speak English to him or else those big speeches at the start of fights won't fall on deaf ears. So by casting a good, competent, professional group of Asian actors, who can articulate their lines well for the main character, as well as, for the audience, is done quite well in this film. The acting is top notch in this one. It brings in the non-perfect, human aspect of the equation, that makes Snake Eyes' character more interesting.There also are many cool camera shots of Tokyo and other surrounding areas of Japan. I enjoyed some of the action scenes that did have an aura of familiarity to me. I am giving Snake Eyes an E+ for Effort and I still recommend seeing the film in theaters to support the excellent work of the Asian cast. GI Joe fans might like this exploration into their most famous and popular character, but for everyone else in the audience this film may feel too long, familiar and at times boring. I just hope GI Joe fans weren't as mad as I was when that pivotal moment, when Snake Eyes learns about the Joe Organization, ends up being less exciting then a yawn. The snakes were silly too, but nerve-wracking.5.2 (E+ MyGrade) = 5 IMDB.",Snake Eyes

I like the action I thought it was really cool personally. I like the effects when they were in Tokyo cool lighting effects and stunning to look at. The Humour wasn't to bad I mean some jokes didn't land for me if I'm being honest with you. I thought the acting and the score of the movie could of definitely been better and the CGI in certain parts of the movie as well. They needed a better script in all honesty not laughably bad or necessarily bad but could of you know been a little more witty and more of a journey but it was Fine. It's okay. Nouthing to write home about but it's certainly passable hope this review helps.,Snake Eyes

78,garethvk,Snake Eyes: GI Joe Origins Delves Deep Into The Mysterious Character And Provides Fans Just Enough Action Along The Way,6,22 July 2021,"The latest film in the G. I. Joe cinematic universe has arrived with ""Snake Eyes: GI Joe Origins"". The film was originally planned to arrive in March of 2020 but faced delays due to cinematic closures during the Pandemic.The film opens with a young boy being orphaned after a group of thugs kills his father. Years later the man is still obsessed with finding out who killed his father and earns a living in underground fighting known as Snake Eyes (Henry Golding)His exploits get the attention of Kenta (Takehiro Hira); who hires him into his organization with a promise to help him find the man who killed his father.Snake Eyes soon finds himself working on the docks where he smuggles guns into fish bound for Japan. Despite his misgivings working for criminals, he befriends a man named Tommy (Andrew Koji); who teases him about his demeaning work by calling him ""Fish Boy"".When Kenta forces Snake Eyes to kill Tommy for being a spy; Snake Eyes refuses and the two make a daring escape to Japan. It is learned that Tommy is next in line to run his clan and that Kenta was banished years prior and plans revenge.Despite mistrust from a trusted associate named Akiko (Hakura Abe); Snake Eyes begins his training in the Ninja Arts which should he survive will make him a valued part of the Clan which Tommy believes is correct thanks to his Blood Debt to Snake Eyes.The film focuses on various aspects of training before branching into the larger story of divided loyalties and honors which results in a few battles and chases along the way.While the film does space the action out; it does provide some great cinematography and the action is entertaining even if it lacks much tension.The biggest issue is that the G. I. Joe/COBRA connection seems a bit forced as The Baroness (Ursula Corbero) arrives to move things along but it is mainly for the purpose of getting characters to do this and get that so the film can move towards the climactic action.Samara Weaving does show up as Scarlett but she does not have a very large part in the story and aside from a few limited action moments; she seems to be more of the token G. I. Joe representation.Golding and Hira are very good and their intertwined and complicated relationship is giving plenty of time to develop as their past is a large part of their futures and the film does a good job in explaining their past and future motivations.The film blends Asian and Western film styles and in doing so creates an enjoyable film that for me was more enjoyable than the prior films in the series. To me those films focused mainly on action and this one was focused on developing characters.While it remains to be seen what direction future films in the franchise will take; it would be interesting to see more of Snake Eyes story down the line.3 stars out of 5.",Snake Eyes
79,gabethedinosaur,Snake eyes is a jaw dropping gi joe summer flick,10,3 August 2021,The actors and actresses in snake eyes were so awesome and ass kicking . The storyline of snake eyes backstory was so awesome and action pack . The filming in Japan was very exciting. The sets of where snake eyes origins takes place was a lot like tmnt 2014 and 2016 . Snake eyes is a lot like Leonardo . Same expressions and katana which is the same ninja blade Leo uses and snake eyes same thing.

80,coljam21,Very low budget,3,25 July 2021,I don't know anything about snake eyes or GI. Joe movies so I went to watch this with no expectations. The only thing that saved the movie for me was the 2 leading men were very handsome. Otherwise the movie was a snooze fest. I mean they had high speed chases on electric motorcycles and the only car featured was a Hyundai Sonota. An electric one at that. Sigh.....all the action sequences were hard to follow because the cameras were so shaky. Couldn't tell if the leads were actually trained martial artists ar faking the funk.

81,impressivesgirl-37857,On its own it is a good movie BUT,7,18 August 2021,"I like it - nice actors, nice ninja stuff and action, nice story (I know every review about these is very negative but I liked it - it's the perfect Sunday afternoon popcorn movie that you only watch once and you like). Yes, it is a bit shallow, but let's keep in mind that the same people that think this movie is bad have given 8s and 9s to ""The suicide squad"".On its own Snake eyes is very watchable. The problem that I have with it is that it doesn't connect nicely or at all with the other G. I. Joe movies (especially the first one). Snake eyes is kinda the bad guy, while Storm Shadow is the good and misunderstood one?! Why? Also, why is Snake eyes talking? That was one of the main characteristics of him. All that contradicts the narrative of the first movie, not to mention the backstory. Knowing the story from before and watching this movie creating whole another story is like bringing Han over and over again and coming up with different explanations every time in Fast and Furious saga.P. S. This movie looks more like a Mortal Kombat movie than the new Mortal Kombat movie.",Snake Eyes
82,theemuhammede,"slow, no depth, no Snake Eyes",2,23 July 2021,"How is it possible to take such an amazing character like Snake Eyes and make t terrible? Well, the short answer is this movie.This movie had such a slow pace for an action film. Snake Eyes is one of those characters that brings you to the edge of your seat because of his unparalleled ninja abilities, infantry, and hand to hand combat. But this Snake Eyes lacked each of those. The movie spent too much time attempting to tell a dynamic story about him, but it was so slow that it barely gave any depth about him. He was not likeable. He kept on taking many blows in his fights and repeatedly needed assistance. He just was not Snake Eyes. He really was not. Even his notorious suit was not a thing until the end of the movie. Two hours and one minute of total run time for this movie, and the last minute is when producers/directors decide to finally show him like that. That is lazy writing and I feel robbed.Overall, this movie was a sleeper.",Snake Eyes
83,arod_85,Meehhh...still better than the other G.I Joes,6,26 July 2021,"I love Henry Golding and was so excited to see him in an action movie. He was handsome as ever, however, I was a little disappointed with the movie as a whole. The plot was a little weak, the first half of the movie is way too slow, and the fight scenes were a bit stale. I did appreciate that they took the movie more seriously than the other two G. I. Joe movies that were as cheesy as the cartoons. It was an entertaining movie, but there were so many missed opportunities. My review is similar to Black Widow in terms of the supporting character surpassing the titular character (BW took a back seat to Yelena as Snake Eyes took a backseat to Storm Shadow in their own movies). I actually think the actors that played Storm Shadow and Snake Eyes needed to swap roles. Henry Golding lacked the grit to play a hardened criminal doing what he needs to survive on the streets. He is too much of a pretty boy and too charming which worked exceptionally well with his previous roles in ""Crazy Rich Asians"" ""A Simple Favor"" and ""Last Christmas"", but didn't quite work for Snake Eyes. The actor playing Storm Shadow had a more stoic and menacing presence and better fighting skills. I would have probably bought Henry Golding as a shrewed, debonair, next in line clan leader treated somewhat like a prince where others do most of the fighting for him. He did well in ""The Gentleman"" as a ruthless, yet suave, villain but I'm not buying the stealth and lethal ninja with a newly developed conscious. I do think the movie was better than the rating it was given, but it was not a really solid movie.",Snake Eyes

85,jsucie,A fun but very predictable slow ride,7,27 July 2021,"Seeing this is an origin story there won't be anything that surprises you if you know anything about GIJOE lore. There are more than enough hints throughout to figure characters and plots before the reveal.This was a lot slower of a movie than I was expecting it to be. The action scenes that were there were quite fun to watch but not much in the way of ""WOW!!"". I'd say one oh the biggest miscast or at least definitely misuse is the cast of ""Hard Master"". Iko Uwais is far too talented as a martial arts expert to be cast in such a role with very little fighting airtime. If you never saw the 2 films that made him more of a North American name, go watch both The Raid 1 & 2. Those movies will show you his true skill. The casting of Storm Shadow was a perfect casting and Andrew Koji played the part well. Henry Golding as Snake Eyes I'm not sure if I'm as sold on. Maybe it was how selfish they made him throughout most of the movie; mostly it's because as far as I remember, Snake Eyes is a chosen mute. This was not that.I don't think you can really tell a decent origin story of these characters without being a little more adult rated in the script. They made just one F bomb just for comedic sake but also because they can get away with one without raising the rating. The amount of people stabbed and slashed in this movie yet there is only one spot where they show any blood makes this far less believable.All in all I still enjoyed being back in the theatre watching a movie on the big screen so I have no regrets with this one.",Snake Eyes

89,MovieWarfare,Another bad attempt at starting a GI Joe movie franchise,4,22 August 2021,"GI Joe was never my thing when I was growing up. My only experience with this IP was the two big blockbuster GI Joe movies and they were terrible. Snake Eye was the best aspect of those terrible movies though as he was a badass mute ninja. I was a little surprised and intrigued when it was announced that there would be a prequel/reboot focused on him before he was mute. The premise is ""An ancient Japanese clan called the Arashikage welcomes tenacious loner Snake Eyes after he saves the life of their heir apparent. Upon arrival in Japan, the Arashikage teach him the ways of the ninja warrior while also providing him something he's been longing for: a home. However, when secrets from Snake Eyes' past are revealed, his honour and allegiance get tested -- even if that means losing the trust of those closest to him"". So is the Snake Eye origin a story worth telling or is it just another bad attempt at the GI Joe franchise?Firstly, Henry Golding is good as the titular character. It is clear that Henry is giving 100% in every scene. There is an emotional moment in the final act and Henry gives a very convincing performance during it. Andrew Koji is also great as Tomisaburo Arashikage/Storm Shadow. He has a really strong voice and presence that is great to watch. I also love the moments between Henry's Snake Eye and Andrew's Storm Shadow. The chemistry between the two is great and it does feel like they were close friends or brothers. I also really like the gorgeous set design from the Japanese style of the Arashikage base to the neon-filled city. There is also a pretty good action sequence with long takes in the rain at a neon-drenched alleyway that was visually good to watch.Unfortunately, the rest of the action sequences in this film are forgettable. The director, Robert Schwentke, implements shaky cam during close-ups of fights and also uses a ton of quick cuts which ruins the scene. It's such a shame as the alleyway fight scene shows that he could easily do entertaining fights but doesn't. The music score is also very generic with this electronic thump sound throughout the movie that occurs in action and even non-action scenes.The biggest issue with this movie has got to be the terrible screenplay and story. The titular character, Snake Eyes, is an unlikeable main character that is difficult to root for. Without spoiling things, he does questionable things for the sake of revenge for the death of his father. Additionally, his redemption arc happens right at the very end of the movie and by that point, I could not like his character anymore. He didn't deserve any forgiveness whatsoever. Furthermore, Tomisaburo becomes the famous GI Joe villain, Storm Shadow, through some stupid logic. The first two acts of the movie is a grounded ninja, martial art movie but the final act is a tonal shift with it feeling more in line with superhero movies with silly magical power garbage.Overall, Snake Eyes: GI Joe origins is the best GI Joe movie so far but it is still a bad movie. This movie succeeds in ruining the titular character by turning him into a dumb idiot. It also has forgettable action sequences that feel more aligned with generic action movies than the famed martial art movies. I don't know if this will get a sequel or another reboot in 10 years but I hope the next entry is a lot better than this...",Snake Eyes

It's like they couldn't decide if they wanted to make a movie for the kids who like the newer GI Joe shows, or the adults who grew up with the originals, and simply failed to live up to either.The story is just bad. Honestly the original cartoon had more elaborate and well thought out plotlines. This was just cliche as hell and so by the numbers it's painful. The writing is terrible. No real banter, no real emotion beyond the ham fisted stuff they put in to try and give characters some sort of drive, but it just makes them feel horribly artificial. A lot of the decisions characters make are completely nonsensical. And there's just no real flow.There's also a great deal of blunders, plot holes, and just mistakes made throughout. Things that make no sense. Not to mention the insanely annoying cliche of the guy who's trained for a month somehow being better than people who have dedicated themselves for years. So tiring to see characters pick up a weapon and suddenly being an unstoppable god.The combat scenes are terrible. Just full of endless jump cuts so they're a chaotic mess with no real impact. Not only jumping between views of the characters but also jumping between different fights. It's painful trying to keep track of who's fighting who and just what's going on. When will directors learn to use actual choreographed fight scenes instead of a hundred 2 second pieces?The special effects were lackluster. Nothing big was needed, but even what little they had just felt like an afterthought.If you're a dedicated Joe fan, you might want to watch this for completion's sake... or just to make yourself angry.

I don't know why they went with ""GI Joe origins. Don't they know how that turned out for X-men? Probably won't go better for them. Between the nauseating shaky cam, Henry Golding's inconsistent accent, and the ham-fisted naming, it was a far cry from masterpiece. In the case of the naming, it didn't even make sense in the case of Snake Eyes; he was taking his name from a random statement made by the man who killed his father. Couple that with the VERY half-baked universe tie-in, and a contradiction of their own lore, and you have a movie that's ok go to downright meh. Worst of all (for me) is that, by the end of the movie, there was no vow of silence.On the other hand, there were some things that were great about the movie.

126,kangarooconnor,Throwing things at a wall bad,1,26 July 2021,"Snake eyes was a movie I was extremely excited to see, movies have been lacking lately and after watching the bloated and awful ""Black Widow"" I wanted a gritty and enjoyable action movie. I went in fully expecting it to be bad, I hoped it would be better than the previous Joe movies but was only really there to watch action people do action things. But my disappointment was immeasurable and as I walked out of the theater with my friends all I could think was ""that was garbage.""Let's look at the bad things from the beginning,The first 20-30 minutes were way too rushed, first he's seeing his father killed by some dude with a big coat, then he's getting beat up in an underground fight ring (which had shaky cam so bad it could rival the Bourne movies), then he's approached by a Yakuza member and then he's working at a fish market putting Guns in fish. It was one thing after another like a check list being ticked off, no real weight to what was happening and they just kind of happened. Now it wasn't horrible but based on the beginning I could tell this movie was just going to gloss over things as fast as possible to get to other events.After the initial few scenes we meet Tommy and the ensuing fight begins where Tommy and snake eyes escape the yakuza. It wasn't horrible but the action felt sub-par, camera was moving all over, dozens and dozens of stunt men with swords were running into frame causing such clutter that if there were mistakes it made it be too hard to tell. The sword fighting also felt way too pre 1990s with the backwards flips and the duel sword swinging, it was just too campy for a movie that was selling gritty action. They escape and snake eyes wakes up on a plane and the first of 3 Major long exposition monologues from storm shadow begin. The actor for storm shadow (no offense to him) felt like he was trying to put emphasis of every word he said without putting emphasis on the actual point trying to be portrayed.Now snake eyes is in Tokyo at the clans temple, and not only does Storm shadow pretty much say ""you will be ninja and you will like it"" but he then expects snake eyes to be thankful for this man (who he saved) pretty much making him become a soldier for this clan. And the middle section of this movie was the most horrendous jump from plot to sub plot to plot to subplot I've ever seen.A: Iko Uwais the legend himself is paid to be the hard master, yet he never does anything, his fights near the end begin then jump to another character and by the time we return to the Hard Master, his initial fight is over.B: There was absolutely no training what so ever, no fighting, no practice, no days upon days of brutal running or combat mastery. Nothing, just a simple exchange water cups, heres an LSD trip that was not explained in any way (there was no explanation as to how Snake eyes was able to see the vision nor how the clan was able to give him one) and finally and the most bizarre of all, three giant snakes that can ""sense your true feelings."" By that point I had mentally tapped out of the movie, I thought it was supposed to be a hyper action movie with ninjas and swords but now they have thrown in giant snakes with emotional feeling powers.C: the relationships in this movie we're also atrocious, Snake eyes and Storm shadow were supposed to be friends but never felt like they actually liked being around each other. The girl and snake eyes had a ""I'm suspicious of him until he lies to my face and then all of a sudden I'm happy and have some feelings for him. Snake eyes as all of a sudden just feels like betraying Tommy? Not only has Tommy given him everything, a home, food, clothes, a purpose and a fancy sword he feels like he needs to betray Tommy to steal some rock so he can get the dude who killed his father? Here's an idea, get the super secret, super rich fancy spy clan you work for to help you find your fathers killer? And what is his justification to Cobra for why he's mad at them ""I didn't sign up to work for terrorists."" After actively signing up to work for the Yakuza shipping weapons illegally acronym borders.But I'd have to say the biggest and most dumbfounding thing in this movie, was the magic glowing boom rock. So apparently this ninja clan is protecting an ancient rock that, based on whoever is holding it, can telepathically blow up anything. People, buildings and even bullets out of thin air, and the guy who is using it, never takes the initiative to just immediately kill everyone in his path. Literally all he has to do is squeeze and think and the people go boom, but whenever a major character is in range the main bad guy just fumbles around and allows them to get away.Bad guy is defeated by being lured into the snake pit by snake eyes, the fight ends and the temple even though being set on fire numerous times is in no way damaged, Storm shadow is ousted by the clan because he used the rock one single time against the bad guy. Storm shadow now hates Snake eyes for betraying the clan by giving the rock to the bad guys, gets some fancy tech, learns his dad was a G. I. Joe, joins the Joe's and then leaves the clan.The Joe lady wasn't good or memorable, the Baroness was neither attractive nor clever, the main villain was boring and unoriginal and Storm shadow suddenly joining the Cobra's was so out of character for this version of the characters background that it felt like a forced cliffhanger for an either unfortunately terrible or nonexistent sequel.Now for the extremely short list of things I liked:
The visual camera work for the movie (excluding the action scenes) was nice, Japan is a pretty country and the colorful pallets of Tokyo went over quite well. I think Iko Uwais as the Hard Master was a good choice even though he was wasted completely. And the cgi was mostly up to par. Other than that it was a garbage movie with little to no redeemable factors.Do not watch this unless you really really want to, and or it's free.",Snake Eyes

This shambolic film, however, simply comes across as a mega silly endeavor, pathetically sanitized for consumption by children.The plot arc follows a pretty predictable revenge thriller for the first 15-20 minutes, which is fine, Except that in the execution it gets more and more ridiculous to the point where you just want to fast forward through the whole thing. Racially diverse ninjas? You got it. Magic? You got it. Love affairs after a few sentences? Sure why not. Snake eyes is so damn charming he can get a woman, who is initially suspicious of him, to lay her life down for him, Just by smiling and batting his eyelashes. Move over James Bond.This blunder is conspicuously lacking in any meaningful dialogue, character building, humor, gravitas or basically anything to really connect you to the characters. Snake eyes goes from a drifter engaging in street fights for money to a master swordsman virtually overnight. How does he develop the skills? Who knows. Maybe we'll need another origin story to get into that.At some point Disney has to learn that simply mindlessly stringing together bland action sequences does not make a movie.

134,afrocut,BEGINNINGS,6,24 July 2021,"My first thought, after ""Snake Eyes : G. I. Joe origins"" ended ,was simple, I enjoyed it. It is fun, quick, action packed, and has enough character moments to satisfy its story. It also serves as a good starting point for possible G. I. Joe movies, if they ever come to be. Which I have doubt about. That's because the fun comes at a price, that price comes at a cost of logic and questionable direction. It's a shame that it's many fighting set pieces come at an over kinetic shakey cam and multiple quick edits. The camera whips and zooms in with every hit and you become dizzy and numb to it. Even more disappointing is the characters become increasingly super human as mystical elements start to rear their heads. These elements don't actually affect the characters, they stay human, but the plot starts acting like more is going on without telling us. This removes the weight behind each action and choice. And Most of those are bizarre and irrational. No one seems to be an actual good guy, well except Scarlett who shows up in an unnecessarily forced bathroom Brawl, placed just so we know that she's a badass. Still though I liked Henry Golding in the role even though he feels less like Snake Eyes then some fans will like. But if this is what the series could look like going forward, I see potential in its growth.",Snake Eyes

Implausibles abound.",5,17 August 2021,"This is supposedly the prequel to the two previous GI Joe post 2000 movies, one with Channing, and one with Dwayne Johnson. In those two films, snake eyes was the wayward student of a dojo who had killed his ""master""; the one that joined the GI Joes was a White orphan taken in by the Master.In this ""prequel"", ""Snake Eyes"" is the Eurasian son of a former GI Joe who was assassinated in front of his eyes at a wooded cabin ""safehouse"". The son didn't know all this, and there was no mother in the picture. The boy was about 10 years old.A few things don't add up:
1. If a father was a widowed, Black Ops assassin, why wouldn't he have made arrangements for his son to be placed with a trusted family? This is against previous ""parent is professional killer, child is prepared mentally.""2. Why wasn't there ANY form of surveillance - even guard dogs - at the so-called ""safe-house"". The trio sent by Cobra to assassinate the boy's father could have simply picked him off at distance; why go to the trouble of driving right up at night, entering the house, and then the silly dice game? How could neither the father, nor the bad guys not notice a 5 inch gap of an open door?3. How did the orphaned boy, whose birth had never been registered, grow up to be literate?4. The plot had so many holes and inconsistencies, you almost wonder if they first choreographed the fight scenes and wove a story, badly, around them. It involved the protagonist (Henry Golding) who infiltrated a Japanese clan, then betrayed them. Then, despite dispatching dozens of men with his sword, claims to be concerned about working for a Yakuza, and for an evil cabal, Cobra, that kills people in acts of terrorism.If you are brain-dead, like the ""art"" of movie martial arts, and don't mind an hour and half of pretty but forgettable entertainment, then this move is for you.I'm surprised that Henry Golding, the Eurasian star of Filthy Rich Asians probably took on this role as he has a very hard time finding suitable work. He looks sufficiently Asian to be in the role of an Asian-based person, but probably doesn't speak anything besides his native English, and this role is simply a typecasting. Even the secondary role is played by a Eurasian; aren't there any actors who are fully Asian to play protagonists?I mean, we are no longer in the 1950s when ""Charlie Chan, Detective"" was played by a White Actor with pulled-eyes and speaking like a demented cookie.",Snake Eyes

But the fomer two movies had some style, were entertaining and created new worlds with likeable or at least interesting characters in it. This movie has nothing of all these things.The style of this movie was intended to be Japanese. But why? Snake Eyes isn't Japanese, nor is the majority of the actors portrayed in this movie. Andrew Koji is half Japanese but Iko Uwais is a very well known actor from Indonesia and Peter Mensah is undeniably from England.And why did they decide to take the Japanes castle Kishiwada as a filming location when it is widely known as a museum? Also most of the other locations are so narrow, dense and artificial, it literally screams ""film studios!"". Even the material from places like Shibuya Crossing looked like stock material and added up to the rather cheap feeling of the movie.In addition, not one of the characters was of any interest to me. If they live or if they die, it just didn't matter to me.

As usual with this type of movies, it tells a story that ends with the main character being the person we wanted to see in the firsr place, and planting the seeds of a story that looks far more interesting than what the part one presents. Actually, to see the actual story that the filmakers want to tell in the sequel, we just need to watch the previous GI Joe movies. I think this was made only for inclusion, to make an american movie with mostly Asian actors; but for that we have a lot of Chinese movies on Netflix. The action scenes are shaky and dark, so they are no even enjoyable. And the movie is very violent, but without blood or gore, so that's the PG-13.At least it wasn't boring, has a moral worldview for the main character, and makes a very good casting for Henry Golding as the next James Bond.I'd rather prefer to have seen The Tomorrow War in a theater than this movie, in relation to the Paramount pictures that were sold to streaming during the pandemic.",Snake Eyes

Social media regularly outs many in our culture as entitled, ignorant, and entirely self-absorbed. I should have known better, reading all the reviews I thought the movie was going to be a major bomb, I mean Suicide Squad levels of cinematic malaise and incompetence.Then I watched it and two things stood out, other than Samara Weaving, (Hugo Weavings niece) not to many Americants are going to recognize this Asian heavy cast, save for maybe Uko Uwias, which is great! A Yakuza movie SHOULD be set in Japan and have a majority Asian actors.The second issue is at time the movie seems like an A- or B+ production, and that is going to upset the clueless, Social Media crowd, who think every rebooted hot property should have at minimum, $200 million dollar budgets, and a script that follows the Kevin Fiege way.No thanks to corporate made ""Happy Meal"" movies, and while this isnt a top notch Hollywood production, I enjoyed this more way more than WW84 or the last 3 Marvel produced movies I've seen.",Snake Eyes

170,MJL_Uncensored,Close But No Cigar,6,1 August 2021,"Snake Eyes: GI Joe Origins is a good movie that could have been better had the filmmakers decided to build the universe and give meaning to the mask. Henry Goulding is fantastic as Snake-Eyes, and the social media whining about his ethnicity is the kind of stuff that's suited for less evolved minds, so I have no patience for that complaint. But for the fan who is concerned about the core story of Snake Eyes as a disfigured military veteran, that is a valid concern that alters the dramatic tension of this film.The Good: The Modified Origin
Snake Eyes: GI Joe Origins works as an astonishing Yakuza tale with the looming influence of COBRA. Snake Eyes and Tommy (who is later revealed as Storm Shadow in the film's trailer) have a fraught brotherly relationship that allows the orphaned mix martial arts fighter to join a secret clan of ninjas that protect society. There's the usual test of character trails you've seen in many martial arts films, and these are unique in their own right. In the dual-agent nature of Snake Eyes and Storm Shadows' relationship and the betrayals that underlie their relationships, the story is the strongest.The Bad: The Introduction of GI Joe
Scarlett O'Hara's intro is a direct rip-off from Black Widow's Avenger's interrogation scene. And Scarlett and the Baronesses sultry femme fatale act is a bit dated, overacted, and feels out of place in this film. You welcome their presence because it connects the universe, but at the same time, it's so poorly utilized that you don't care at all other than the first few moments they appear.I bring up Scarlett because fans of the comics and the 80's TV series know there's a strong bond between her and Snake Eyes. At no point do you get the sense that these two will become lifelong besties. They are as disconnected as two strangers on Twitter. And this is where the decision to change his origin story hurts the film. In the comics, Snake Eyes saves Scarlett during a helicopter crash, resulting in disfigurement and loss of speech. In the later years, she goes with him to experiment with plastic surgery procedures as Snake Eyes longs to have a love life of his own. I'm sure the producers didn't want to scar Henry Goulding's beautiful face. Still, the absence of that history makes their relationship topical and the arrival of his acclaimed mask...well, meaningless.The Ugly
The plot has a lot going for it when you pay attention to the themes the director is trying to convey. The conflicted nature of Snake Eyes makes him a bit of a jerk but still, one we can empathize with him. Where the story goes wrong is the introduction of the infamous secret weapon that you expect in a GI Joe movie, but it's so poorly introduced that it feels like an afterthought to create a more great third act. Another exploit of the snake theme already lies in a film about a man named Snake Eyes with an enemy known as Cobra. It's a bit hokey and unnecessary to the film; it also shows a lack of creativity by the filmmakers. The film also misses the mark to make the universe feel bigger. It's a smaller self-contained story which is fine, but it doesn't do enough to make you want to know more about the world awaiting Snake Eye's future.Overall: An fun pop-corn movie
While it may seem like I'm hard on the movie, I'm rooting for it because I am a huge fan of GI Joe. A trip to my garage will reveal thousands of dollars of collectibles tied to that franchise. But Hasbro still hasn't figured out how to use this franchise in a way that makes it to the next level. Because there is a lot that's done well in this film, the cinematography is just suitable for this world--gritty enough to add tension but stylish enough to feel like a comic-book-themed universe. The actors are practical, not perfect. And the action is reasonably well done. So there's still a lot of work to be done before GI Joe lands it big at the box office.",Snake Eyes
171,jvg37,Shoddy Film - Bad Casting - Disrespects Source Material,3,23 July 2021,"Saw the movie last night and was not impressed with anything I saw. The makers of this film have either no idea of the origins of Snake-Eyes or they intentionally destroyed the character. Aside from the fact that Snake-Eyes was always a Gaijin (white guy) he was also honorable in all that he did. This version has him as a two-faced, lying, thief. The feeble redemption arc in the final act was too little - too late, and unbelievable. The casting choices also left me a bit confused. Golding was never a good choice for Snake-Eyes and as much as I love Samara Weaving, she was a horrible Scarlet. The actress who ineptly portrayed the Baroness was too young for the character and was not even close to being believable. Iko Uwais was great as usual but would have been a much better Storm Shadow or even Snake-Eyes! Andrew Koji did do a good job as Storm Shadow and his was the best performance in the whole film by far.The story was subpar, even for a genre piece, and the script could have been written by a middle-schooler. The action was decently choreographed and wasn't too over the top. It seemed like it couldn't decide whether to be gritty or cartoonish in its approach to the action, which was a letdown. There are several continuity issues as well; a brawler raised on the street with no formal training can automatically hold his own against highly trained ninjas (can you say Rey Palpatine?) or a girl who had been a devoted part of the clan for over a decade breaking sacred rules to save someone she just met?All in all, this movie sucked!",Snake Eyes

I.

That's one simple example of how bad the movie is.The entire movie looks like a tutorial on things that shouldn't be done in an action movie. The action doesn't register because the shots are shaky or/and too close. These tricks are employed when the actors are incapable of fast movements or doing action sequences. But in Snake Eyes the entire cast in the movie are martial dance experts (and Iko practically redefined action movies in his lean and mean Raid movies) and yet it feels like watching action in that last Star Wars movie.Anyway, if you have nothing else to watch on a lazy Sunday afternoon, you can pick this movie.

Making him the hero despite the fact that he is basically selfish and a traitor whose actions cause the annihilation of a whole clan whose only goal was to serve and protect is beyond me and forcibly making Andrew Koji the villain in the end makes no sense, he was the most likable character, with his grandma of course.Akiko seemed interesting at first until she fell for the hero's sob story.

The action scenes were serviceable but many times the reason for the fight left a lot to be desired (So much so I was tempted to give this a 3).The acting seemed forced and cartoonish.

I'm sure if you take a camera around Japan long enough you can get most of these shots anyways.I do like the character development between Snake Eyes and Storm Shadow. I knew Henry was a good actor but Koji really held up his own considering nearly all of his scenes were opposite Henry. I felt that the movie overall was well cast. I wouldn't mind seeing these actors reprise their roles in future G. I. Joe movies. The story is well told but I'm thinking most people won't like the story. I can't get into details without spoilers.I also want to mention that if you're a big G. I. Joe fan that this movie may not do much for you. The G. I.

Not everything can be a massive cinematic universe; Hollywood needs to calm down.The worst offender is the action. It's not well coreographed nor well shot and edited poorly. It was so bad that it almost felt like they tried editing out a lot of the combat and just cut action scenes short for some reason. Does action look bad with Henry and they tried saving the movie? I guess we'll never know because there's so much shaky cam I could barely make out what was happening. I was wincing and shaking my head whenever another action scene came along; it was almost nauseating to watch.Now that the character is established, I'm hoping that if there is a sequel that it will be in a much more digestable story. Also, since everyone is complaining about it, get an action director with a steady cam and pull the action scenes away from whichever editor chopped up these scenes.",Snake Eyes

I can't forgive a production that finds it appropriate to show the only JOE agent to be a female and be so fixed on diversity and feminism that it actually ruins the movie experience. This had potential but opted instead to showcase some of the typical action sequences you've seen a billion times, where the fantastical computer generated characters take over in all the big set pieces and the fight scenes are edited in such a way that you barely care to follow because you know the girls are all going to be amazing and the guys not so much. I understand it is made for a kids audience, but it really could have had some blood or at least one decapitation considering the entire cast has swords. The actual story arc of the characters is also a real disappointment, culminating in the most ridiculous of end boss fights. The whole cast lack any charisma too, no endearing characters and no one really of any depth other than the normal run of the mill family gangster scenario where 2 guys are fighting over taking control of the family from the aging matriarch.

But as a origin for my favorite gi joe character it was not good the first two gi hoe movies we're terrible but what they got right were snake eyes and storm shadow. I really wish it was more accurate to the character. I do have to say that the gi now characters of scarlet and the baroness were really good and I really enjoyed the cobra references. The action was really good. I really like the martial arts and big action scenes. I didn't like how they had snake eyes talk and show his face throughout the whole movie. I think it really needed to be more actuate in that part. I hope if they make a second one that they are more accurate. I give it a 6.5/10.,Snake Eyes

My main gripe with the film is the poor writing that a bunch of decent actors are saddled with.But even more that that is my (pet) peeve with films today that use accents instead of finding actors that can speak/learn the language. If you insist on having the actors speak English, then just freaking let them speak naturally. It is not unheard of, and additionally, Andrew K can pull that off without affecting the immersion (as he did in ""Warrior"").Watching an (supposedly) ancient Japanese culture in action in Japan with members speaking English to each other, some in Japanese accents, is not a good look at any time, but should be unacceptable in this day and age, and I wish studios would just stop tolerating it. Especially since it is not necessary. It's just disrespectful.Combined with all the other poor writing elements (will let others expound), this is almost unwatchable. Even with the half decent fx, which tbh is the very least we can expect with the budget, it will keep making you scratch your head or roll your eyes multiple times.Just sad, more than anything else, because I really wanted to like this one.",Snake Eyes

243,madorosh,Unnecessary retelling of a story that Rise of Cobra did well in just five minutes,2,30 July 2021,"I previewed The Rise of Cobra for my neighbour's young teenage son in anticipation of seeing SNAKE EYES. The original G. I. Joe film got a lot of negative reviews, but I loved it. As one of those young males who scooped up both the 3-3/4"" toy line and the Marvel comic books, the film version was definitely coloured by nostalgia. I was pleased that the boy next door liked that film as much as I did. The action was constant, the plot mostly made sense, and there were all kinds of colourful characters with rich back story that was laid out in fast-paced scenes. I willingly overlooked the physical impossibility of it all (sinking icebergs, anyone?) with the same spirit GI:Joe fans wrote to Marvel Comics to exchange plothole explanations for No-Prizes.Snake Eyes couldn't be a more different experience. There were long, plodding scenes - and if they had been exposition, it might not have been bad. But it wasn't even that - they were long soliloquys with platitudes about honor and loyalty and honesty. The crux of the film is Snake Eyes facing three challenges to join a Japanese 'clan'. But none of it makes any sense. You have a sword fight on a Los Angeles pier (why wouldn't they just bring guns - I mean, the whole job at the pier was as a gun smuggler), and a magic jewel and some death defying motorcycle stunts. You have low-rent copies of the Baroness and Scarlet from the G. I. Joe films. The actors they selected have no gravitas at all (Yeah, it would be hard to match Siena Miller's performance in the original.) And you have a little wokeness thrown in; the African member of the family, the super grandma in charge (patriarchy=evil, matriarchy=good).Wanted badly to like this one, but it was mostly just an incoherent mess, certainly in contrast to the character's original development in the comic books, which was echoed in Rise of Cobra in a couple of succinct flashbacks. Those flashbacks were far more entertaining than this, unfortunately.Positives are the lead actor's acting and some nice visuals, particularly of Japan.",Snake Eyes

But I'm not entirely sure that rewriting the entire origin story of two main counterparts of the GIJ-universe, is the right way to do it.The complete change of Snake Eyes character and background, as well as the family connections and affiliations of Storm Shadow, just makes for a very confusing and at best ""desperate"" attempt to be as different as possible from the generally accepted hitory behind this toy-to-movie fantasy world.I won't say the movie is not worth watching. There are some cool action scenes and at least in a few moments some spectacular fighting coreography. But sadly it can't hold up this entire movie, and especially since some characters are more a parody than even the previous G. I. Joe movies managed to present.

The character was unlikable, the fights and choreography was terrible (I have done martial arts both jujitsu and kung-Fu since I was 5 and I have had children do better fight scenes for demonstrations!).The story had a very weak premise a lot like superman vs batman the whole redemption at the last second thing with one thing uttered yet they where utterly relentless through out the film.The whole super sized anacondas being all mystical along with a super stone that somehow makes people burst in to flames making the entire thing ridiculous, we are used to high tech gadgets but super powers in this franchise!?Of course the creation of storm shadow from someone who again started on the other side of being honourable and it being deep seated in to his psyche, all of sudden turns in to a villain! As fast as snake eyes finds redemption!Lets not even mention the fact we have the head of security constantly stating that she thought bringing snake eyes in to their ranks as dangerous and a bad idea, of course its stated that they don't have to listen to what she says, just so it gives reason for them constantly ignoring her but again her change in heart for NO REASON what so ever even down to saving snake eyes life and the hammy look snake eyes is fighting on our side... line...I have to say the originals where not great but they where better than this mess!",Snake Eyes

260,jenniferbellydancer,Not half bad,7,28 July 2021,"As someone who knows little to nothing about the GI Joe series, I can't give my opinion on how accurate it is, but compared to the predecessor movies (meaning the ones in the 2000's), this was pretty good.The difference between the characters in this movie and the GI Joe movie with Channing Tantum is a couple of things. The first is there is not any rampant sexism or over-sexualization of the female characters. In this one, the Baronness and Scarlet are actually interesting characters. Although you don't get any background stories from them (since the focus is on Snake Eyes), you see them as strong characters and Baroness actually seems to enjoy being evil whereas Baroness from the previous one just seemed to have this lame reasoning for going evil just to get back at her ex for breaking his promise 🙄. And Scarlet is not some socially awkward person, but is a total badass and she knows it too! And Storm Shadow's grandma, she's a fighter! Not to mention, there are no lame cheesy liners that can be borderline sexist in this movie.There is also the fact that this movie doesn't white-wash Snake Eyes character like the Cobra Kai movie did. Although, yes, Henry Golding is half-white, he is still Asian and is bringing representation to the screen. I have no idea if the original Snake Eyes is Asian or not, but the way Cobra Kai movie depicted him as white and Storm Shadow as Asian seemed to set this old ideology (even if it was unintentional) that white is good and Asians are not, so it is nice to see him as Asian, given the background he had from the Cobra Kai movie.And Storm Shadow has an interesting background to the rivalry with Snake Eyes. Instead of having this hatred for him just because, there is a reason to it and he tried to be good, but there is also a lot of rage and impulsiveness within him that basically leaves him no longer the heir to the ninja clan; thus, making him hate Snake Eyes for it. In my opinion, that is a much more interesting reason to their rivalry than the one in Cobra Kai.Overall, very good and entertaining movie and I wish people would take the movie for what it is: pure entertainment. Would I see it again like I would say Black Widow or a Marvel movie? Probably not, but if this movie streams on Netflix along with other GI Joe movies, I would probably watch this movie over the others.",Snake Eyes

If you want to be bigger than life, then you need it to be entertaining.

When you have plot-armored main characters, the action scenes don't have any sense of danger or even interest. So you need to make them entertaining in other ways, and this movie fails at that.

It would have been better had it just focused on Snake eyes and a smaller scope story with introducing the larger themes in the sequel. Cause they didn't really even finish Snake Eye's backstory, this was more like a introduction when it could have had a nicely contained story with many sequel strings. The guy playing Snake Eyes and Akiko were wonderful to watch. Ever scene between them was great. The Trials were awesome. The car fight was entertaining.

This is not necessary bad but it may take you sometime to process it.Snake eyes is a skillful, cunning and accomplished character and all these are fulfiled at some level. However there are many unanswered questions regarding character's past and his training as a kid or his oath of silence. We see an already grown Snake eyes that sometimes seems powereless against other fighters and other masters despite that he is considered to be a grand master himself, expert in a dozen of martial arts.

Going in i figured it would be like the 1st X-men movie with Hugh Jackman as Wolverine. It was. The Snake Eyes character is kinda similar to Wolverine. Pit fighter, trying to find his place in the world, haunted by his past. This reimaging of Snake Eyes is a mix of that along with Han Solo. It's totally different than the Marvel version but I'm fine with it. I loved the action and the arc that the character goes through. It's very much like the 1st X-men where is not a ton of plot but mostly character development and dialog. It's good fun like a Fast and Furious movie.

Then it's heavily influenced by Hyundai vehicles. That's a Korean company and has no business in Japan! Let's ignore that too. The story is all over the place and confusing. Let's ignore that too. They have an amazing cast of fighters and stunt doubles yet they do the stupid shaky camera which immediately downgraded the value of the fight scenes. Let's ignore that too. The sword props look like actual toys in majority of scenes taking away from the immersion. Let's ignore that too. A lot of behaviors don't make sense in the movie meaning a normal human won't make such stupid moves. Let's ignore that too.So what's left? A clueless director directing a movie with a confusing screenplay and no matter how good the actors and actresses were it was so bad it made original gi joe movies stand out as the good ones.,Snake Eyes

Even if you are taking the story in a different direction, how can you miss Snake Eyes's vow of silence? One of the biggest thing about Snake Eyes is that he doesn't speak! By choice!The film even had a perfect scene where this happens. When Storm Shadow leaves the clan, he could have killed everyone there and wounded Snake Eyes. It would have been the perfect moment for Snake Eyes to then take his vow of silence. But that didn't happen.Also, the Baroness was out of place in this film. I feel like she should have had that one scene where she spoke to Snake Eyes then never appeared again or very quickly in the shadows. Cobra needed to seem more mysterious, powerful, and ruthless. Maybe have her cut ties as soon as Snake Eyes and company began to win. The Baroness joined up with them way to quickly for being apart of Cobra.

It's characters have no depth, and you take no interest in them. Nor their story arc.Storms shadow, look like a cheap pimp, who belongs more in a cheap suit.Snake Eyes/ Henry Goulding is terrible.

Well...I didn't get that.The movie I did get is a totally different story. Not a bad story, but disappointing to those who didn't want a different story.I believe I would've enjoyed this movie more if they just called it ""Ninja Movie"" and gave these characters different names. Atleast I wouldn't be judging it in a way that I'm comparing it to the source material.

The result was a mixed salad of poor writing, pitiful dialogue, freshman level acting, and a dull storyline.During one shot we were exposed to the first glimpse of the infamous Cobra logo on the inside of a crate full of weapons. That and that alone was the only element that peaked my interest in what became two hours of me looking at my watch and being thankful that I only paid for the matinee.What will it take for someone to put together a script that actually does justice to the GI Joe genre? Maybe Disney should just buy the label up and create a Joe Universe (GIJU) in which we can see the characters truly develop and the creation of a world that brings to life the GI Joe/Cobra battle on a true global scale.",Snake Eyes

332,justineprather,What happened to snake eyes?,5,26 July 2021,"*Disclaimer there are no spoilers in this review*
I don't usually agree with a lot of reviews in movies (mostly the negativity) but I actually agree with the bad reviews on this one. There's is to much confusion that wasn't cleared up in this movie and the lack of storyline. Now I've never read any of the comic books for G. I. joe. But I do know the storyline for snake eyes based off the comic book. The movie did not go by the G. I joe comics what so ever. I've never actually given a negative review. But here are a few ideas of what's wrong with it.1) It doesn't explain how snake eyes became snake eyes and if you have seen any of the G. I Joe movies there were scenes when snake eyes was younger with storm shadow. So you knew they grew up together But it doesn't explain that or clarify any of that in this movie
2) Storm shadow and Snake eyes relationship is confusing and very hard to understand. Again if you have seen any of the other G. I joe movies you would know they grew up together. In the snake eyes movie it had a whole different point Of view and it made you think ""what?""
3) the way snake eyes was trained didn't make any sense and was slow and didn't add up either
4) very slow at first and then towards the end was the ""big fight scene.""
5) fight scenes where shaky at first which no one likes and was hard to keep track who was fighting who.For a character that everyone loves like snake eyes. You need to have a strong movie and go off the other G. I joe movies which would only make sense and add up for this snake eyes movie. Advice for anyone who was apart of this movie if you ever are going to make another one don't screw it up.P. S the actors and actresses did very well though.",Snake Eyes
333,actionherosuperstar3,Well done,7,11 August 2021,"I thought this movie was awesome. It's getting slammed by critics but you have to understand that while they are getting paid to analyze and criticize movies, people like me are paying money just to enjoy them. Overall this movie inspired me because of Snake Eyes' character arc. I really enjoyed seeing him grow as the movie progressed. I will say though there is quite a bit of shaky cam so if you get dizzy easily this might not be the movie for you. I really liked it though. I hope it does well enough in terms of box office for a sequel.",Snake Eyes

Golding doesn't suit the role, nor does he seem to understand that hunching his back and scowling does not make him fierce.3. Koji should have been Snake Eyes.4.

It is clear the script got a major rewrite at some point just before or during filming. We are never sure why Samara Weaving character, Scarlett, is in the film.

We didn't know the answers to most of these questions from the current movies.From start to finish, I was not disappointed with this movie. Each fight had careful and detailed choreography. The characters and acting were also great, so I'm not sure why people didn't like this movie? I'm not sure what they were expecting but the movie was exactly what I expected. Probably because I am a GI Joe fan so I already knew about the story a bit.It was a great prequel. I would advise anyone to watch this movie with an open mind.

It amazes me that snake eyes, the least charismatic character on display is the main one and the one we supposedly have to root for, his redemption arc is disastrous and doesn't feel deserved at all. On the other hand, Storm Shadow, the character that becomes evil just feels stabbed in the back by the writers forcefully establishing him as a villain when he wasn't near of becoming one.In the end it just feels as a hollow film that had potential and could've been much better but it just crashed and burned before establishing a reboot to the franchise.",Snake Eyes

I Joe team. I think it's safe to say that this film woefully under-delivers on the ""cool and badass"" factor.Henry Golding does his best with what he's given - although he does fall out of the American accent every now and again - which to be fair, isn't much in the first place. Samara Weaving - introduced about halfway into the film - is a scene stealer in all of the two scenes she is involved in. Ursula Corbero is a phenomenal Baroness, and Andrew Koji plays his character really well too.In my honest opinion, the main reason that this film fails so spectacularly is due to it's PG-13 rating. This rating is a major disservice to the badass specacle that these kinds of films are supposed to be. The sheer amount of Katana v Katana action scenes is enough to get you excited, but HOW ON EARTH is there not one drop of blood shown on screen? This film really should and could have been given a hard R18 rating and really doubled down on the violence and bloody fight scenes.All in all, there IS enough in this film to have me intrigued about a possible sequel (and franchise), provided they give each follow-up film an appropriate rating, get better writers on board and employ cinematographers that know how to shoot action sequences.",Snake Eyes

Becuz he is infiltrating the Arachikage clan, by being treacherous.

But Snakeyes is still trying to deceive them.Even it's a ninja , spy , soldier movie, but it swung too hard on to the magic fantasy side of things.Conclusion...
Too many plot holes, too many Shaky cam action, no character build up that continues to a terrible payoff, wasteful casting, Snakeyes is a douchebag and really doesn't redeem himself.

Andrew Koji's performance as Storm Shadow was brilliant, both in terms of acting and action shots. That's it, that's all good about this film.The whole film Horribly directed, badly paced, story makes no sense and full of plot holes. Scripts and dialogs feels like written by some armature hobbyist who just started writing fan fiction on their personal blog.The main protagonist Snake Eyes played by Henry Golding's emotionless acting performance is as dry as desert sand. Except Storm Shadow rest of the casting was just wrong for the characters they portrayed. Iko Uwais as Hard Master, Úrsula Corberó as Baroness & Samara Weaving as Scarlett, they have proven themself good actors in their other works but they fell short in this movie just because they were horribly misused by bad directing.This film is just full of stereotypical martial art clichés, contradictions, bad dialogs, a magical power rock and some mystical giant Anacondas.",Snake Eyes

The problem I saw was that they cast was very good enough to execute great action scenes yet that way the director/choreographer showed it was bad and kinda ""cheesy"". If you have watched Iko Uwais (and even Andrew Koji) movies, you know what action is! Alot of close shots where you can barely see whats really happening (also alot of dark scenes) and camera was shaky. And not hating on Henry Golding but I didn't feel connected with his character. Andrew Koji gave the better performance in this movie. It felt like he was leading the movie.Little spoiler: AlertAnd the training doesn't make sense lol.

Indeed, franchise loyalty generally does the rest, and studios have to do little else besides through this tired formula into the action grinder and churn out scenes strung together with bumper sticker dialog, comic and literary plots for dummies, and mind numbing lack of continuity and you have the new Hollywood. Occasionally, they through in some horror for the even less evolved... if that's even possible.So why would Snake Eyes be any different? It leaves one with the feeling of a little kid reading big brother's comic books..... you don't really understand the story, but some of the pictures are nice.

We know that snake eyes was a Caucasian orphan that was taken in by a noble house of samurai. As a child he trained and when his master was killed took a vow of silence and ended up with the Joe's.

Now when this movie was first talked about I said it would suck and be absolute trash. I went to see it anyway and I went with an open mind. Now there was a few times I muttered some curse words under my breathed but I still keep an open mind. I really liked this movie.To enjoy it you must forget everything you know about G. I. Joe. There was a good storyline, great action scenes, and the characters, especially Storm Shadow, were well written. It was a great movie. There is a few spots that take away which I'm not going to mention, but even with those it doesn't kill the movie. The best thing is it definitely leads into a new Joe Universe.Give this movie a chance, just go into it with an open mind.",Snake Eyes

In my eyes this was actually fun & entertaining. I also would say it was the best of the 3 movies. I collected JOES as a kid and watched ever episode, so I'm a bit of a purest. If I was to say one negative about the film was the poor casting of Scarlet & The Baroness. They didn't show much flare when it came to acting . But for an origin film it was work the buck.",Snake Eyes
423,lerelene,For the potential,10,15 August 2021,"I loved the ingredients that went into this movie even though the end result could've been better. The actors were great, the costumes and visuals outstanding. The shaky cam thing should die a horrible death because the people who did the action WOULD'VE looked better in static wide shots but they were robbed of the chance to show their talents.I give it 10/10 solely for the potential that it has because Andrew Koji is not just a fighter and Harry Golding is not just a pretty face - they have incredible chemistry and given a good script they can deliver top tier dramatic performances that will stay with you after you leave the movie theater. And one thing that was good despite any logical expectation is that they made both characters completely OOC but somehow it worked exactly the same way as in the original story because you can FEEL the heartwrenching potential of what could've been. It just works.",Snake Eyes

Alot of the action in the movie is not even fun to watch since it´s to much close-up chaky camera in it to make it good.

The story is vastly different from Snake Eyes origin story in the comic books so I get that.But personally for me and my other friends who watched it? We don't care about G. I. Joe so what ever changes they made to the story didn't bother us. We wanted an entertaining film with a fine story, good acting and great action scenes and that's what we got.Could it have been better? Yes absolutely. Samara Weaving's acting as Snake Eyes was weak compared to the west and the director went with 'shaky camera' at times. Fight scenes were cut off pretty often and that's a shame when you have the legendary Kenji Tanigaki as the fight choreographer (Kenshin movies).",Snake Eyes
458,jaiduhra,😂😂😂😂😂😂,1,23 July 2021,"In short, they butchered a pretty cool character for absolutely no reason.The overall movie was painfully predictable, but in a slightly different way to the typical bad film. To elaborate, each scene makes you hope the stupid things you think will happen, won't happen. Tragically, they happen so abundantly that the plot literally twists itself out of existence and the main character's only accolade by the end of the film is that he's successfully ruined another supporting characters life.Brief Breakdown:1) There's barely any character development, Snake Eyes is unjustifiably proficient with a katana when he's never been trained to use one.2) It's clear that the script was poorly written, there was no depth and a lot of cringe dialogue.3) Impactful scenes had zero build up, hence they weren't impactful.4) As a testament to how poorly produced the movie was, they somehow left in a scene where the main character spoke in a British accent (accidentally - there was no reason for the British accent in the scene, it literally doesn't fit and must've been a mistake).5) Every scene featuring the magical stone that can make anything spontaneously combust makes no sense other than to drag the story on (countless times where the villain doesn't just kill everyone for literally no reason - someone's grandma literally vaults 20ft over the villains head and he just watches the whole thing).6) The main character achieves nothing but ruining a friendly characters life and ultimately turning them against him.",Snake Eyes

The interactions between Snake Eyes and Storm Shadow and their love/hate relationship was developed exceptionally well by both actors. The plot twists brought a level of depth that most movies of the genre fail to bring and it leaves the audience wondering who is the good guy multiple times through the film. The action sequences are incredible but unfortunately shot in a very shaky style that conflicted with the precision martial arts on display from nearly all the cast.

466,homodeuslee,Mediocre and badly written - one great film saving performance....,6,26 July 2021,"So this is now essentially the third attempt to bring GI Joe to the big screen. Lorenzo Di Bonaventura returns at the helm and proves once again - he does not really care...
Honestly - how this film actually came to be is beyond me - a group of professional people working in the industry collectively decided that firstly : this film should be made - then that Evan Spiliotopoulos (who has hardly written a single great film to date) should write the damn thing - then add a director, Schwentke (who has a track record of terrible blockbuster films) - and let's top it off with TV travel host/Rom-com break out - Henry Golding to play Snake eyes himself. Shocking....SO - It definitely is not the Snake eyes that people know and love. He does bad things in this film and unfortunately, Henry isn't a skilled enough actor to make you like him. I disagree that it was purely in the writing - a great actor can make you care for the most despicable characters but Golding proves here he should stick to Rom-coms...and his own accent. His physical skills and acting feel forced and awkward and in my opinion needs a lot of work if I would ever buy him as a legitimate action star. He does have some charisma and good looks though.It seems like the majority of the articles and social media agree that the film's saving grace is Andrew Koji's Storm Shadow. He adds nuance and depth to Tommy (even though he is dealt the rough hand with having to deliver the majority of the exposition) He commands the screen whenever he is on and delivers us the most layered Storm Shadow in almost any medium to date - just too bad he is let down by an awful script. Koji steals the show with his performance and to top it off you can tell he knows how to move - his action moments were by far the most fun to watch - although he was let down by a terrible filming style there too. I definitely want to see more of Koji. Jin Sakai for Ghost of Tsushima!The rest of the cast are great in their limited roles - Samara, Ursula, Iko and Peter Mensah - all do great. They are well cast but under utilised. Hollywood SERIOUSLY needs to stop thinking they know best with martial arts action sequences - Iko and Kenji Tanigaki's team is absolutely wasted here.There was a lot of potential with a GI Joe reboot. There was some potential for a good Snake eyes film - but these people clearly are not the right people to do it. Paramount needs to learn. You would have thought Lorenzo etc would have learnt something since the last films 10 years ago - but clearly not. They have not only destroyed many people's favourite character - they have simple made a bad film and wasted a lot of money and talent....5.5/10.",Snake Eyes
467,cilliangrey,Andrew Koji saves this mess of a film,6,27 July 2021,"Went to the cinema to see if Henry Golding could pull off being an action star. To me, he certainly does not. I don't get all the fuss about him. He is good looking sure but he is NOT a great actor. Charisma used to be about being compelling or having an intriguing energy - most people are mistaking charisma for charm. Yes he is quite charming but NO he is not charismatic. His acting feels fake...his accent is all over the place....he is not the Snake eyes people wanted.Koji on the other hand was phenomenal...his acting was powerful, magnetic and has a depth to him. His physical skills clearly outshine Golding's too. Perhaps Koji looks too asian looking for Hollywood to be a lead...so we get Golding leading instead and Koji having to play second fiddle...although even then Koji manages to outshine him in my opinion. This is the Storm Shadow a lot of people wanted. Should have been called 'Storm Shadow'The film however....god...when will hollywood get it right. Shaky cam, poor writing and so many other terrible decisions. Lets hope it bombs so the producers learn a thing or two - but let's face it...they probably wont.",Snake Eyes
468,puremixdj,WE ROLLED THE DICE AND LOST WITH SNAKE EYES,5,28 July 2021,"Am I the only one that remembers that Snake Eyes was a white guy and never spoke? In the original Joe movies, Snake Eyes and Storm Shadow had a rivalry since childhood due to the murder of their master. Snake eyes takes a silent vow to never speak until he finds his masters killer. WTF! This origin movie flips the script and makes up a completely incompetent not so action movie. They lost the opportunitiy to do justice to the beloved characters and story development. It dragged and within the first 10 minutes you'll realize this was going to be a mess.. My family and I saw this (including two 12 yr old boys) and we all agreed this was the worst movie we've seen in a long time. The previous GI Joe movies were way better than this and portrayed Snake Eyes as an unbeatable Ninja. They didn't do him justice in this movie. Lazy writers, director and cinematographers produced a made for TV movie full of lackluster fight scenes with shaky camera shots, plot holes, poor character development, magic rocks, giant snakes with magical soul seeking abilities and one dimensional characters. They literally had the potential to make something special here. They had the actors, sets and the groundwork from the original movies. How do you mess that up? We took a gamble on this movie and lost! Save your money and your time.",Snake Eyes

Joe.Admittedly, the story was everywhere in the first half an hour. Going from his childhood, to the prison fight, to the packaging plant, to Tokyo in such a short amount of time made it feel disconnected and rushed. After the intro, it smooths out, and I don't think the plot is fundamentally terrible, but it definitely could've used some polish.Taking the movie at face value, it's alright. The action was cool enough, although obviously unbelievable at points, and the overall plot makes enough sense to not be confusing. The acting was convincing most of the time, although certain dialogues were difficult to understand without subtitles.I do appreciate the attempt to wrap up Snake Eyes' and Storm Shadow's history with eachother, but it could've been executed way better. The inclusion of Scarlet and Baroness was a cool sight to see, but they contributed next to nothing in the long run.It's a novelty film, nothing more, nothing less.",Snake Eyes
470,pandlan,Bad acting and bad storyline,3,13 September 2021,The bad choice of actors and acting brings down the movie. The way they chose to film some sequences was just destroying the movie and fighting scenes. I hoped it would be better. The worst thing is that they didn't stick to the true Snake Eyes storyline. Instead we get a weak storyline and bad acting. Hollywood needs to wake up and clean out the bad things of weak minds. We deserve better!,Snake Eyes

472,tendonguyen,Good...the beginning of the end of Lorenzo Di Bonaventura's career (hopefully),4,2 August 2021,"....at least with GI:Joe. Three big multi-million blockbuster attempts to make one decent GI : Joe film - I mean really...clearly he has NO tability in making quality films. This film, most likely - as others speculate - was probably made in a hurry to retain the rights of the franchise which he should just let go of.He should feel ashamed at this terrible waste of money that could have been put to something useful and good into the world. Look at his CV over the past 10 years....nothing of any QUALITY. Sure, he can get some bums on seats with good marketing - but he makes AWFUL films and this is another he can add to the list. Just give it up and let some younger, talented producers/film-makers take the reins from now.I say this because I have been an extra on several of his productions including this one in one of the opening scenes - the atmosphere was horrible and no one was happy. The actors and crew were doing their best - most of the fighting I saw must have ended up on the cutting room floor because I saw none of it in the final product. It was actually quite dangerous for people doing the action and it wasn't even worth if unfortunately. Other sets I work on are so much better in almost every way. I would say steer clear of this man's filmsAs for the film itself - the cast do a good job - I can never buy Henry Golding as an action tough guy - he's too soft and certainly not my Snake eyes - I remember his double was used a lot too - which is probably why they needed to cut a lot I guess. The writing is awful and plot holes galore - how mature decision making adults could have read the script and thought it was a good idea to go ahead with is beyond me. People are speculating Golding was a replacement for Charlie Hunman who would have been way better.This film had the possibility of being good but with terrible decision makers up top - it'll never happen and they'll waste so much money and lead so many people on with false advertising - it needs to stop.",Snake Eyes

There are a lot of lines that are funny, but in a way that I do not think the writers intended for it to be funny at all LOL But if you just let yourself laugh at them, it will increase your enjoyment.I genuinely thought I wasn't going to make it through the movie before it started because I haven't watched a full movie since pre-covid, but I enjoyed it so much that I was up the whole time poking fun at it in my head while still appreciating the story.",Snake Eyes

There were quite a few twist that I never saw coming. I could tell from the reviews that most hardcore Joe fans went in wanting/expecting the comic or cartoon Snake Eyes instead of the reimagined version. To me, a movie would not be enjoyable if it followed exactly what we read in the comics or watched in the cartoon. Marvel was very successful with their updated take on characters and it was amazing and well received. I grew up on GI Joe and had the comics so I am a hardcore fan. I was very disappointed in the first live action GI Joe movie. The best part of the first movie was Cobra Commander. I enjoyed the second GI Joe movie more, but Snake Eyes had a more serious tone. It was a hell of a lot better and placed itself in a higher echelon than the others. I was disappointed in Scarlett and wanted more Cobra, but other than that, I really enjoyed it.

Then I would strongly suggest you readjust your expectations coming in. This is an origin story thru and thru!The casting choices turned out to be spot on, Golding said Koji were fantastic together as the leads, and I thought Corbero's Baroness to be a marked improvement on what we got in Rise of Cobra! Weaving brought the heat as Scarlet as well, the only casting choice that is criminally under utilized was Uwais as the hard master...If you're not familiar with Iko Uwais then check out ""The Raid 2"" or ""The Night Comes for Us"" and you'll understand! In a nutshell he's an AMAZING martial arts talent and isn't afforded a real moment to shine in this film given the caliber of action awesomeness he's known for.The only criticism that I've read repeatedly that does have a bit of merit (imo) was the over editing on some of the fight sequences particularly in the beginning, but I didn't find this to be the case for the majority of the film.Overall I think this film accomplishes what it set out to do: tell the origin of Snake Eyes AND set the table for future GIJOE films.I enjoyed it and found this take on Snake Eyes and Storm Shadow's back story to be compelling and entertaining!

I would say many of the fight scenes are done in an Asian style reminiscent of old Hong Kong movies from the eighties and nineties. This style is not for everyone, hence some low reviews. Both Henry Golding and Andrew Koji did a good job in their respective roles, even though I didn't care much for the other characters who were a bit cartoonish.

The fault of this monstrosity is not due to the acting.Alright, so this is NOT the Snake-Eyes origin. This is pretty far from it. This is a Snake-Eyes ""inspired"" movie. Whomever wrote this pile, either had no clue as to who the characters really were... or simple didn't give a damn and disrespect them and the fans.If you have been a fan of Snake-Eyes or G. I. Joe in general, from the original comics or cartoon, then do not watch this. If you weren't or couldn't care less about it, I still warn you this is not a good movie. The writing really is atrocious. There are holes all over the place, and even suspending your disbelief will not allow you to accept a lot of what they try to shove down your throat.The action could be good, if they let you see it. Whomever decided that these camera shots would lend well to the action, didn't have a clue. It hides a lot of the action, which the actors seemed to be able to provide. So why take away from that?I will say Golding's accent came out way to often. Which is one critique I would provide. That said, the actors all seemed to do their jobs well, despite the terrible writing.The cheesy 80's action movie item of power was just so cringeworthy, that you simply lose all hope that they maybe... just maybe, pull this out of the toilet and turn it around. Which may be a good thing, as any more disappointment of this sacrilege could push you to slit your proverbial wrists to put yourself out of your misery.In the end, I wouldn't suggest this to anyone. And to the studio, don't ever let whomever wrote this garbage... to ever write for this kind of movie again. Don't disrespect the IP or the fans like this. You want our money, but you've lost our trust. Why would we want to watch anything more you put out? I know you won't be getting my money again.
