0,MartinHafer,Pretty awful...but in a good way.,8,8 May 2021,"When this movie begins, Frank finds a strange looking puzzle box. He manipulates it and out pop fish hooks and his face is torn apart and he ends up in a hellish world run by Pinhead.A bit later, Frank's brother and sister-in-law arrive at the same house where Frank met his end. The brother badly gashes his hand and blood is going everywhere. When it hits where Frank was sucked into the other world, a new Frank starts to grow...but it's not fully formed and is really creepy looking. The sister-in-law, Julia, discovers this quivering mess of an embryonic Frank...and it talks to her...begging her to bring sacrifices to him so that he can somehow return to life as the sweet old Frank and not this weird 'thing'. And, given that this woman is evil and loves hot sex with her brother-in-law, she proceeds to lure folks up to this room...and to their doom. She beats them to death and somehow this is supposed to complete Frank's transformation...at least once he's gotten enough of their flesh. Clearly Julia has some issues...as does dear old Frank. As for Pinhead and his other assorted freakish friends, they don't realize that Frank had left their domain....and now that they know, they want him back.As I watched this VERY spooky film, I was amazed that the film only had a budget of about $1,000,000. It's also hard to believe that it was made so long ago, as although some of the special effects are cheesy, they were absolutely amazing for 1987. Overall, a scare the crap out of you film....and while NOT the type movie I enjoy, I do respect what it was and how economically it was made.",Hellraiser
1,TheLittleSongbird,Rise of the macabre,8,25 October 2018,"Despite appreciating horror very much (with a lot of classic ones out there, such as 'Halloween', 'Nightmare on Elm Street', 'The Texas Chainsaw Massacre', 'Night of the Living Dead' and 'The Exorcist', plus the best of Hammer House of Horror), even if not my favourite genre, it took me a while to get round to watching the 'Hellraiser' franchise. Due to having so much to watch and review, and the list keeps getting longer and longer.This is the film that started the franchise off, and not only is it by far the best of the 'Hellraiser' films it also for me, and quite a few others it seems, is one of the stronger horror films of the 80s, though not quite of all time. What is meant by being by far the best of the 'Hellraiser' films is that it is the only one to be above very good, the nine sequels were very variable (leaning towards the disappointing) and the latter films particularly are suggestive of the franchise having run its course.'Hellraiser' is notable for being the directing debut of celebrated and extremely talented author Clive Barker. His books have always been hugely compelling, with intelligent exploring of ambitious themes, vivid attention to detail and characterisation, meticulous atmosphere and distinctive chills and sense of dread, his popularity is more than well deserved. He also adapts his source material 'The Hellbound Heart', a terrific book and even better than this already very good film, and all those qualities are lifted off the pages onto the screen. It is also notable for introducing us to Pinhead, who would justifiably become a horror icon.By all means 'Hellraiser' is not a perfect film. The ending is schlocky and at odds with the rest of the film, which was up to then very disturbing and remarkably intelligent and the ending felt like it belonged somewhere else.Also felt that Barker's direction did occasionally show his inexperience, namely in some unfocused and not always necessary close-ups.Most of the time though he does a great job, capturing the spirit and atmosphere of the book with ease and the momentum is never lost. 'Hellraiser' is genuinely scary with plenty of chills, unnerving dread, nail-biting suspense and a hair-raising sense of claustrophobic tension. It is very graphic but not in a cheap way, going over the top with the shock value and not pointlessly so, traps that it could easily have fallen into and ones fallen into so many times in horror. Personally thought the Cebonites were used well, they are still terrifying and using them as catalysts rather than focusing too much on them (mentioned already very well) added to the mysteriousness, they look good too.It's not just scary though. 'Hellraiser' has truly inventive storytelling stemming from a unique premise back then and seldom equalled now. It also has some abitious themes like pain and desperation that are handled intelligently, giving the film some emotional power and surprising dimension not always found in horror, it is just so wonderful to find a film with a great concept seen recently that lives up to it and exceeds it even. Just want to say this is not trying to knock the genre at all, in case it's sounding that way. 'Hellraiser' holds up well on the visual front, some eerie camera work and lighting, the effects are far from amateurish and the make-up manages to be some of the most effective of the 80s.The script is thoughtful with Barker's prose all over it and the characters show his attention to detailed characterisation, nobody is bland or annoying. The music doesn't seem to have pleased everybody, for me it was haunting and didn't dimish the atmosphere at all. Was surprised too by how good the acting was, have seen some terrible acting in horrors recently so this was refreshing. What a staggeringly frightening performance from Doug Bradley and Clare Higgins is particularly good of the rest of the cast.Summing, very good with many great elements. 8/10 Bethany Cox",Hellraiser
2,Leofwine_draca,Grim and grimy...everything a horror film should be,10,25 September 2012,"Let's make this clear from the outset: HELLRAISER is a classic. A low budget British movie, packed full of gore, torture and grisly images, it sounds like just the kind of film that gets made and then disappears only to be rediscovered by horror geeks some twenty years later. Not so. There's something about HELLRAISER that stands it head and shoulders above the rest, and that thing is the presence of writer/director Clive Barker. Barker brings a level of originality and visceral intensity to this film that raises it to the heights of similar fare like Wes Craven's A NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET.The story is overshadowed by the presence of Pinhead and his fellow demons, each of them an S&M-influenced being who delights in causing pain and suffering. However, the main thrust of the film isn't actually about Pinhead and pals at all; instead, it's about the ultra-creepy and depraved character Uncle Frank and his destruction of an otherwise ordinary family. Uncle Frank is truly one of the most sickening and twisted creations in cinema and the thought of him hiding in that attic room is enough to give anyone chills, I imagine.In any case, this is a solid and eventful film; it's action packed, fast-paced and witty with it. The characters (especially the ones you love to hate) are well observed and the horror comes thick and fast, presented in a matter-of-fact, in-your-face fashion. Barker is just happy to get stuck in and get on with it, and it works. Yes, this is a film of the 1980s, so watching it today it feels a little cheesy. The rubbery special effects are dated – especially that upside-down demon, clearly pushed about on a trolley – but there's something endearing about them these days, and I'd still take them over CGI replacements. As an exercise in pure horror and skin-crawling revulsion, HELLRAISER works a treat.",Hellraiser
3,SnoopyStyle,amateur actors and some fascinating creatures,6,10 February 2015,Frank Cotton purchases a puzzle box in the middle east. He solves the box and it opens a portal to the Cenobites who are demons to some and angels to others. They are sadomasochistic explorers to the depths of pain and the edges of pleasures without differentiating between the two. Frank's half-brother Larry decides to move back into his childhood home despite his new wife Julia's objections. It's been years since he has been in the house and they find Frank's belongings. She starts to have visions of her affair with Frank. Larry's teen daughter Kirsty decides not to live with her stepmother. Larry accidentally slice open his hand and the blood drips on the floor. The blood resurrects Frank who surprises Julia and commands her to harvest more blood so that he can be fully restored.The acting is amateurish. Ashley Laurence is doing little more than a forgettable pretty damsel. More is required for Clare Higgins but she doesn't really deliver much. It's hard to tell if she's a victim or a co-conspirator at first. The most interesting characters are the Cenobites and their leader Pinhead. There are some fascinating aspects of this horror but it's not scary at all. The problem is that the human characters are not compelling enough.,Hellraiser
4,gavin6942,"Without a Doubt, One of the Key Horror Films of the 1980s",8,29 March 2009,"A young woman (Ashley Laurence) faces of against her wicked stepmother (Claire Higgins) and her uncle Frank, who recently returned from the dead. Throw some demons from hell into the mix and you have got yourself a nightmare incarnate.I have seen ""Hellraiser"" numerous times, on VHS, on DVD, on Netflix streaming and now (thanks to Anchor Bay) on glorious Blu-Ray. There is really nothing anyone can say about this film that has not been said over the past twenty-five years: Clive Barker is an amazing writer and through ""Hellraiser"" he became an amazing director. I do not know anyone who has seen this film that was not left with a positive impression.The effects in this film are great, perhaps second only to John Carpenter's ""The Thing"". How they were able to create Frank's body piecing itself back together, I have no idea. The effects in ""Hellraiser II"" are similarly good, but the original stands head and shoulders above the rest.This is also the film that introduces us to Pinhead (Doug Bradley), easily one of the most iconic faces in horror. Only Freddy Krueger and Jason Voorhees are his equals as far as 1980s horror goes (with Michael Myers as an honorable mention)... and I am hard-pressed to think of a single 1970s or 1990s character that compares. Pinhead is in a league of his own, and it is Bradley's stern performance that sells this character.Hair historians can look back on this film and study the hairstyle known as the permanent wave. For some reason, everyone in this film (besides Frank) decided they needed to have a perm. By the second film, this is thankfully corrected (and Clare Higgins' appearance improves dramatically because of it).You have probably seen this film by now, but if you have not -- see it! Anchor Bay's Blu-Ray treatment will give you the best picture and sound imaginable, so if you do not already own it, this is a fine time to spring for a quality copy. Those who already have the DVD may not be ready to invest in the Blu-Ray just yet. I would, however, recommend the Anchor Bay box set. Although I think it has some flaws -- I would have liked to see more discs in here -- the packaging really makes the purchase worthwhile. The box itself, whether used for storing your DVDs or not, will look impressive on your shelf.",Hellraiser
5,lee_eisenberg,tearing souls apart forever,10,27 November 2009,"I should say that Clive Barker's ""Hellraiser"" is a pretty gross movie: one torture scene after another. But it's still a horror classic! This is not your typical slasher flick. In fact, it's not a slasher at all: no, this is much darker, with some truly ugly stuff. Clearly, the Lead Cenobite (Doug Bradley) - commonly known as Pinhead - has become as much of a horror icon as Freddy Krueger. I suspect that they had fun making the movie. As I understand it, for the scene where the creature crawls out of the floor, the filmmakers made a wax model, melted it, and showed it melting in reverse.So, I definitely recommend this movie. But not to the squeamish. Really fun.",Hellraiser
6,jboothmillard,Hellraiser,7,21 July 2006,"From director Clive Barker, based on his own novel, I saw this popular scary movie once before, but I don't think I really got it, so I am glad I gave it a chance and watched it again, the second time around was much better. Basically the film opens up with Frank Cotton (Sean Chapman) somewhere in Morocco buying an antique Chinese puzzle box, the Lament Configuration, and solving it he unintentionally activates its power, releasing the Cenobites, extra dimensional demons who enjoy intense torture and masochism, and dissected they take him with them to their dark world. Later, his brother Larry (Dirty Harry's Andrew Robinson) arrives at the house with his second wife Julia (Clare Higgins), who had previously had an affair with Frank, while Larry's teenage daughter Kirsty (Ashley Laurence) is living in her own place, but does visit. While moving in Larry deeply cuts his hand with a nail on the wall, and a lot of his blood drops onto the floor of the attic, and somehow this blood is absorbed by one of Frank's dissected body parts, and partially restores his body and brings him back to life. Julia finds monster Frank (Oliver Smith) in the attic, and he is still obsessed with her after their previous passionate relationship, and she agrees to help him fully restore his body so they can reignite their love. To do this she starts picking up men in bars to bring them back to the house, convincing them that she wants to have sex with them, but in fact she murders them with a hammer and Frank absorbs their blood and internal organs. Kirsty coming to visit spots Julia with a man, and spying she sees one of the horrific murders, and she gets into a struggle with Frank, he is desperate for her not to touch the puzzle box which he still has, but she throws it out the window, and running away picks it up again outside and escapes. After collapsing from exhaustion Kirsty wakes up in hospital, and she solves the puzzle, summoning the Cenobites, the four demons being leader Pinhead (Doug Bradley), Chatterer (Nicholas Vince), the Female Cenobite (Grace Kirby) and Butterball (Simon Bamford). They originally plan to take her to their realm, but they agree to possibly spare her life if they can prove that Frank escaped them and is alive, and she returns to the house to find him. Her father Larry, who strangely has bloody ears, says that he has killed the monster Frank, but as he acts strangely Kirsty realises that the monster has in fact killed her father and taken his skin. In her pursuit Frank unintentionally stabs Julia with a knife, and he smiles at the fact that he killed the real Frank and has caused her emotional suffering, and this is when the Cenobites come in. They chain Frank up, piercing his body with chains, and they pull him apart, and then Pinhead and the Cenobites plan to take Kirsty with them to their hellish world, but she reverses the puzzle box and makes them all disappear. The end sees Kirsty and her boyfriend Steve (Robert Hines) throw the puzzle box onto a fire, but the strange Tramp (Frank Baker) comes in, walks into the fire, and turns into a winged demon and flies away carrying the puzzle box, and it seen back in Morocco being sold to someone else. Also starring Kenneth Nelson as Bill and Gay Baynes as Evelyn. It is an intriguing story about a dark affair reignited by violence, the disfigured dark angels from Hell are the most watchable characters, especially leader Pinhead of course, there are the great lines ""We'll tear your soul apart"" and the improvised ""Jesus wept!"", and the make up and special effects to create the monsters and extreme bloody torture and body dismembering, that the villains enjoy, are terrific, it is an engaging masochistic horror. It was number 19 on The 100 Greatest Scary Moments. Very good!",Hellraiser
7,Tweekums,They'll tear your soul apart,8,14 May 2012,"When Frank buys a small box that promises to provide the opener with unimaginable sensations he can't have imagined just how agonising they would be. As he opens it, in his mother's old house, hooks suddenly pierce his skin and he is torn apart! Some time afterwards his brother Larry and his wife Julia move it; as they do so two things happen; Julia remembers the time many years before when she slept with Frank and Larry badly cuts his hand on a protruding nail the blood hits the floor and Frank starts to come back together. Julia is shocked when she finds him; he looks hideous; he said he needs more blood if he is to fully recover and he must get it before the Cenobites realise he is missing; they are the creatures that tore him apart when he opened the box. Julia once promised she'd do anything for Frank and it turns out that includes killing for him! One day Frank's niece finds him and takes the box; will she be any safer than he was?This 1980s British horror shows its low budget fairly often but that doesn't matter as it is still pretty shocking; the effects may not be perfect but they look more real than CGI would have been if the film was made now. I had thought that the Cenobites would be the evil monsters here but the real evil is Frank; in fact the Cenobites get surprisingly little screen time compared to Frank. The only well known actor in this is the always reliable Andrew Robinson who does a good job as Larry, Ashley Laurence who plays his daughter is perhaps the more important character and the more interesting as she is the one who will ultimately confront the Cenobites and Frank. Over all I'd say this is a decent film and probably a must see for horror aficionados; just be warned it is pretty gruesome at times.",Hellraiser
8,BA_Harrison,A hellishly good horror.,9,23 October 2008,"It's been over twenty years since I first viewed Hellraiser, when a friend of mine insisted that I watch it, claiming it to be one of the goriest films he had seen (and this being the UK in the 80s, with hysterical newspapers heavily promoting film censorship, it probably was!). I duly took myself to the local flea-pit, but remember leaving feeling rather unimpressed.Two decades on, and I thought I'd give the film another chance (it only seemed fair, since I had met star Ashley Laurence at a convention in the interim, and was VERY impressed with her!).And the good news is that, over the years, my tastes have obviously matured (just a fraction): this time around, I enjoyed the majority of Clive Barker's twisted directorial debut much more, although a rather weak ending does spoil what I would now consider to be an otherwise pretty remarkable film.The gorgeous Ms. Laurence plays Kirsty, daughter of mild mannered Larry (Andrew Robinson), step-daughter to the icy Julia (Claire Higgins), and niece of untrustworthy scoundrel Frank (Sean Chapman). Poor Kirsty's life becomes a living hell when she discovers that Julia is murdering men in order to help regenerate the body of her Uncle Frank, who has recently escaped from a hellish limbo where he was tortured by a group of demons (known as Cenobites, led by the freaky Pinhead)..After playing with the supernatural puzzle known as the 'lament configuration', the cause of Frank's predicament, Kirsty is forced to strike a deal with the Cenobitesdeliver Frank back to them or face an eternity of suffering herself.With Frank and Julia being equally as monstrous as the film's demons, there is no shortage of unsettling nastiness in Hellraiser, and Barker delights in showing viewers every gory detail. Frank's gradual resurrection, through the absorption of blood, is pretty horrific, but it is the cold manner in which Julia dispatches of the men she lures back to her house that really got to me: a couple of blows from a claw hammer on the back of the headouch!.Pinhead and his sado-masochistic pals are also extremely chilling. Although they definitely lost some of their ability to scare in subsequent sequels (much as Freddy Krueger did in the Elm Street series), they are at their most menacing in this first outing: their unwelcome appearance after Kirsty unwittingly solves their puzzle is one of the film's most effective moments, being genuinely disturbing and extremely frightening.In fact, with so much of Barker's film being so flawlessly enjoyable, it's a real shame that the finale is so lame: after Frank steals Larry's skin (why he is unable to regenerate that particular body part, I don't know), he is finally sent back to hell, and the Cenobites turn their attention to Kirsty, hoping to show her the dubious delights of their realm. Somehow, however, Kirsty realises that the answer to her salvation is to once again play with the lament configuration. As she fiddles with the malevolent puzzle box, the Cenobites do practically nothing to stop her, and eventually disappear in a glut of bad visual effects. To make matters worse, a dreadfully rubbery monster also shows up to unsuccessfully try and stop her from completing the puzzle.Finally, with the evil vanquished, Kirsty throws the troublesome object into a fire, only to have it retrieved by a tramp who turns into a laughable, skeletal, winged creature and flies away!!! This ridiculously OTT ending seems completely incongruous with all that has gone before, and stops the film from being a total success. Maybe, just maybe, the upcoming remake will address this problem, and we will finally get a wholly satisfying Hellraiser movie. But I doubt it.8.5 out of 10, rounded up to 9 for IMDb.",Hellraiser
9,paul_haakonsen,What's your pleasure?...,7,21 December 2015,"You can't be a horror fan and not be familiar with Clive Barker's ""Hellraiser"" movies. And as a horror fan chances are that you will enjoy them - the first few movies at the very least.The core of the story of the ""Hellraiser"" franchise revolves around a mysterious artifact - an intricate puzzle box - which is said to be able to grant people what they desire the most. But it comes with a price, a terrible, terrible price. And it is guarded by the vile Cenobites.The warped mind of Clive Barker really came up with something wonderfully morbid and disturbing when ""Hellraiser"" was first unleashed upon the world. Especially the Cenobites, they are grotesque but interesting at the same time.In the first movie Larry and his wife Julia moves into Larry's old family house. The very same house where his brother Frank tried to unlock the puzzle box and was sent to Hell. An accident causes Larry's blood to be spilled on the floor, bringing back Frank from the dead. But in his flayed and fleshless state of being, Frank needs the blood and flesh of the living in order to regenerate his own body. But no one escapes Hell that easily.For a 1987 movie, I will say that the effects still hold their own today, having withstood the test of time. Especially the rebirth of Frank and his transformation back to fully human. And the Cenobites, lets not forget the Cenobites; they were just amazing.With this now classic horror movie the World saw the likes of Doug Bradley like never before and he instantly became a horror legend, just as Pinhead became a horror icon.I grew up with these horror movies along with other horror franchises, and I love them even today and make frequent visits back to them. If you are not familiar with ""Hellraiser"", shame on you. Then I would strongly recommend that you sit down and watch it, perhaps even do a movie marathon of the series.",Hellraiser
10,Quinoa1984,"certainly not bad, not any kind of horror classic, not by a long shot.",6,15 April 2016,"This is one of those genre movies which I somehow passed by or missed as a younger person, which is strange since I watched almost every horror-slasher-whatever series back when I was ready for all the blood and guts and killings and dumb teens and memorable monster-movie killers from the 80's. Maybe I'd heard that it was not very memorable compared to the others, or that the ""Pin-Head"" man on the video cover was kind of lame and not effective. Turns out the words I heard were kind of correct, even as this has its moments and is both two things at once: extremely dated in its 80's settings while providing some gruesome practical effects and certainly 'unique' designs.If anything it's less to do with the typical slashers of the period and more akin to EC horror comic books (I thought of this as being like a feature-length episode from Creepshow - this is a movie that involves a torrid love affair from the past that comes back to haunt Julia (Clare Higgins) who moves in to the house where her husband Larry's (Andrew Robinson) brother Frank used to squat in... oh, and she had an affair with him years before. But as it turns out Frank is, uh, a puddle of goo due to a magic box that has made him die via beings from another dimension or hell or other (I wasn't clear from where, point is they're gnarly demons that Tim Burton thought were probably too garish), and Frank needs blood in order to regenerate his flesh.The movie could have even been a comedy; the premise reminded me of a much more garish, black-death take on like Little Shop of Horrors. The whole scenario is rather nightmarish, but it's not your typical slasher; it's more about when the next big murder will take place by this mulletted would-be femme fatale for this regenerating bloody-man-thing, and how soon the husband or his daughter. There's imagery related to Jesus Christ (he's literally hiding in the trunk, his statue I mean), and Barker, as director, is all about style. This is a pure style over substance movie - what substance is there, the actual story and characters, is fairly weak/standard, though it's livened somewhat by Andrew Robinson (you remember him as Scorpio in Dirty Harry, right?) There are many shots early on of gruesome bugs and roaches and filth, and then from there you also have the demons themselves, with them all being done with practical effects.But what starts early on as seeming impressive - the highlight of seeing the first time that Frank starts to regenerate from a tiny drop of blood into organs and lungs and skeleton into something resembling an anatomy figure on a textbook cover - gets to be into a laughable horror show spectacle in the final act. It's here that Barker just lets rip with the grotesque house of horrors (literally, it's in a house and there are a lot of horror-creature images), and while the creativity is there, it's also not very compelling or scary or frightening. The young actress Ashley Laurence does her best, but by a certain point just seems at the mercy of the oddness of what the script has her doing, specifically with the 'MacGuffin' that is also pictured on the cover.The original Hellraiser must have some kind of reputation among modern horror fans and enthusiasts, but whether it's people who like it legitimately or based on the many sequels it looks better in retrospect I'm not sure I know at this point. It's entertaining as being a slightly more serious version of what one might see in an Evil Dead movie. Barker certainly packs on the nightmarish s***, but it's at the cost of a lot of story logic and decisions by characters that make little sense, and in the last ten minutes it's all over-the-top madness (still bumped up thanks to Robinson, I must add). At times it's shot and acted like a Lifetime movie, and other times it recalls the Romero/King style of a wild horror fantasy extravaganza. So it is what it is - and, again, very 80's.",Hellraiser
11,BandSAboutMovies,Perfect.,10,20 July 2018,"One of my interns at work asked me the other day, ""You watch all of these horror movies. Don't they scare you?"" No, they really don't. Not anymore. Some of them disturb me, like the cannibal films. But only one still kind of scares me. And that would be Hellraiser.There was a time, before the eight sequels to the film and BDSM became well-known fodder on shows like Law and Order that Hellraiser seemed like it came from some alien land more than its true origins. The monsters of the piece, the Cenobites, looked like nothing we'd never seen before, all leather, blood and open festering wounds. The idea that sex and pain could be united wasn't trite back in 1987, so it's difficult to convey the power and fear this film had. It feels wrong. It feels dirty. It feels evil.How this movie was made for $900,000 blows my mind. It looks lush and gauzy at times and at others, like when we see Frank's heart and veins being formed, positively nightmarish. It shouldn't be this good - it was Clive Barker's directorial debut after seeing two of his stories, Underworld and Rawhead Rex, get made into films he didn't agree with. What kind of deal with the devil did this guy make to turn out something so perfect on his first try?The misconception that many people have of this film is that the Cenobites are the villains or the horrific part of the film. If we go to the poster for proof, it says ""Demon to some. Angel to others."" Pinhead and his gang are there to move the story forward and certainly look frightening, but they are bound by the rules of Hell and the Lament Configuration, the puzzle box that sets the events of the film in motion. Matter of factly, these rules aren't truly defined yet - is Pinhead a tortured soul stuck in the wheels of some hellish bureaucracy? Who created these boxes? None of this matters - ""You solved the box. We came."" Yes, it can be that simple. You don't need to know all of those answers right now. When Frank buys the box and Morocco and solves it, he gets the answer to limitless pleasure and the drug of all drugs - as Frank says, ""I thought I'd gone to the limits. I hadn't. The Cenobites gave me an experience beyond limits. Pain and pleasure, indivisible.""That's one of the real horrors of this film: people will do anything to chase a high. That high may be drugs. It may be pain. It may be a sexual experience that makes the mundane life you're stuck in - like Julia, bored with a suburban life with a husband she never really wanted in the first place. The chance to be with Frank again, no matter if she has to seduce and kill for him, is everything. Notice that as he gains more muscle and skin with each drop of blood, she becomes more and more attractive, her skin gaining new color.The main horrors of this film are family and other people. The Cotton family had issues before the Cenobites took one step out of Hell. The most horrific part of the film comes when Frank wearing Larry's skin, stares at his niece in a moment of sexual longing and says, ""Come to daddy."" Sure, there are horror film trappings, but this type of morally bankrupt behavior isn't something confined to the cinema. So much of the betrayal and madness of Frank and Julia could happen. It happens every day.Hellraiser exists on the border of reality. It's fantastic, but it feels like it could happen. It's the dangerous fiction that could overwhelm your truth if you go too far. In that it's quite similar to Barker's Candyman, which posits that saying the name of its titular character three times in a mirror is all it takes for him to come for you. That seems too unrealistic, but do you want to take the chance? And much like the black leather garbed creatures in this film, Candyman must adhere to a dream logic that only comes into our reality when you allow the genie from the bottle.",Hellraiser
12,Coventry,Evil in its purest form,10,20 June 2003,"HELLRAISER is the definition of horror ! I don't think there are much films who represent the genre better than this one. The story is original and horrifying, the make-up effects are flawless and very brutal, the characters get under your skin and the villains ( if I may call the Cenobites that ) will haunt your thoughts long after you finished watching this movie. Clive Barker is one of the most talented authors in the field of horror. He did a great job here in filming his own writings. He knows exactly where to put the stress, how to create the right atmosphere and when to attack the viewer with some great twists. Larry Cotton and his 2nd wife Julia move in to his parental house. It seems that Larry's brother, who was always a rather morbid person, has been there too but there's no sign of him. When Larry accidentally spills blood to the floor, something real strange happens. Because of the blood Frank, who was caught in the wooden floor, comes back to life. He escaped from hell and the torments of the Cenobites. Julia discovers Frank, who is still very weak. Because she always loved him and had an affair with him once, she promises to cure him completely. She brings home men for him, but it has to happen fast, cause it's only a matter of time before the Cenobites find him. It's Kirsty, Larry's daughter, who discovers this horrible secret. She steals the box and gets in contact with the Cenobites. As a sort of deal to escape hell, she gives her word that she'll take them to Frank...Like I said, this is pure horror. This is one of the rare films that makes you shiver and sweat. The character of PINHEAD, the lead Cenobite, grew out to one of the biggest icons in horror. In fact, he's the only who really deserves this status. He's pure evil, but ...fair. As strange as that may sound, he's bound to rules and he doesn't break them. You have to be in his world before he's a threat to you, but when you are there's no escape from his evil. When you may fire off quotes like:""no tears, please. That's a waste of good suffering"" or ""we'll tear your soul apart"" you are EVIL, no discussion about that. HELLRAISER is praised everywhere. Even other big names in the genre declared this a masterpiece. Stephen King himself was very impressed as well. Clive Barker has done some other great works like NIGHTBREED and LORD OF ILLUSIONS. The also famous tale of CANDYMAN is from his hand as well. All recommendations if you liked this film, and it's hard to imagine that you didn't. Hellraiser was followed by many sequels. Hellraiser 2 is great as well and a logical continue of the story. All the rest are inferior, but still very entertaining if you're a big fan of Pinhead...like I am.",Hellraiser

14,Theo Robertson,The Greatest Horror Film Ever Made,10,21 May 2004,"A lot of people on this site are moaning that HELLRAISER isn't all that scary . Well define "" Scary "" ? opening an electricity bill and finding that it exceeds your life savings causes my heart to miss a few beats but will anyone be making a horror film about someone getting a massive electricity bill ? I don't think so either and very few films have terrified me and the notable few that have scared me witless like THREADS , QUATERMASS AND THE PIT aren't strictly speaking horror movies . In fact the one thing that used to terrify was DOCTOR WHO and what's that ? A childrens TV show shown at tea time so let's not kid ourselves horror movies are scary!!!! SPOILERS !!!!What I absolutely love about HELLRAISER is that it's not really a horror film as such - It's a macabre love story with loads of subtext about how love and sex can destroy us and in many ways it can be viewed as an AIDS allegory ( 1 ) . Larry doesn't satisfy his wife in a sexual matter and it's this sexual inadequacy that leads to his death , Julia lusts after Frank which leads to her death , men who've just met Julia go back to her flat for some casual sex only to be murdered , while Frank lusts after Kirsty ( Who can blame him ? ) and it's this obsession that leads to his death at the hands of the Cenobites ah yes the Cenobites . A lot of people seem upset that the Cenobites aren't to the fore in this movie but it should be pointed out that they're the catalyst of the story not the focus . The story revolves around Frank and Julia's relationship and Julia's dissatisfaction with her marriage . In fact you could easily rewrite the story with Frank being on the run from a criminal gang instead of demons from another dimension and you'd still have the same story I will admit there are some flaws to the movie such as the bizarre dubbing but I should point out that this was done post production in order to make the characters more identifiable ( 2 ) to an American audience hence English characters speaking with Bronx accents which does make some of the performances laughable . Ironically the only performance which can be described as bad is genuine American Ashley Laurence as Kirsty , but hey she's gorgeous so let's not complain too much lads . Writer/director Clive Barker's strengths do outweigh any weakness , take for example the scene in the hospital where a nurse watches TV and it's not a TV show she's watching but a rose in bloom , and for me the greatest image isn't the murder and gore but the scene at the end where a photograph of Frank burns to a haunting soundtrack . Barker does get good performances out of most of the cast namely Andrew Robinson who isn't as good as he was in DIRTY HARRY but he'll never be able to top that and he is good as uber wimp Larry , Claire Higgins as femme fatale Julia and Sean Chapman as the human version of Frank. I thought Chapman might have gone on to become a big name after this movie but strangely not . Even stranger I thought Barker would have gone onto bigger and better things but for some reason I found myself disliking his other stuff and seems to have disappeared from film making all together and I can't say I'm all that upset HELLRAISER is a classic story on the themes of love and death . Such a pity someone wanted to turn the movie into a franchise ( 1 ) The same week HELLRAISER was released FATAL ATTRACTION topped the US box office charts . One can't help thinking HELLRAISER would have been better regarded if it came out a few weeks earlier since the subtext is very similar to the Michael Douglas blockbuster ( 2 ) HELLRAISER spent several weeks in the US box office reaching a peak of number three on the charts and taking millions of dollars ( Not bad for a movie costing one million bucks ) so the dubbing is probably justified",Hellraiser
15,Hey_Sweden,We have such sights to show you.,8,4 January 2019,"Famed genre author Clive Barker had been dissatisfied with previous adaptations of his work: ""Underworld"", ""Rawhead Rex"". He then adopted the adage that ""if you want something done right, do it yourself."" So he adapted his own novel ""The Hellbound Heart"" for the big screen with this very memorable horror film, a triumph of overwhelming, doom & gloom atmosphere, wonderfully over the top gore, and iconic characters & dialogue. At the time, it must have seemed like a breath of fresh air to genre fans tired of slasher formulas (although, to be fair, this film does build up its own reasonable body count).Veteran screen villain Andrew Robinson (""Dirty Harry"") and Clare Higgins (""The Golden Compass"") star as Larry Cotton and Julia, a couple who move into the old Cotton family homestead. To say it's a fixer-upper would be an understatement. But the kicker is that Larry's brother Frank (played as a human by Sean Chapman, and as a monster by Oliver Smith) is hiding in an upstairs room, in a badly deformed condition. Soon, Julia (who had once had a fling with Frank) has been convinced to lure assorted victims back to the house so Frank can replenish himself with their blood.The twisty, circular plot also involves those incredible Cenobite characters - demons to some, angels to others - who are eager to reclaim Frank, who had escaped them before.""Hellraiser"" is capably acted by all - including the debuting Ashley Laurence, who plays Larry's feisty daughter Kirsty. Of course, it's the Cenobites - Doug Bradley as Pinhead (before the character had been given this name by fans), Nicholas Vince as the Chatterer, Simon Bamford as Butterball, Grace Kirby as the female - who steal the show. They're a delicious bunch of well-conceived antagonists, and it's Pinhead who has all the truly choice lines that people (including yours truly) just love to quote.Barker does a fine job with the direction, and although he's seldom worked as a filmmaker during his impressive career, he showed with this debut that he has what it takes. The story moves forward steadily towards a series of bloody confrontations. Other creepy touches, like the ""derelict"" (Frank Baker), help a lot.Naturally, a review of ""Hellraiser"" can hardly be typed without mentioning that fantastic, grandiose, operatic score by Christopher Young, which will stick in your head well after the film has finished.The makeup effects team led by Bob Keen do some very nice work. While the Leonard Maltin review may give it a left-handed compliment by calling the film ""ugly fun"", us horror fans wouldn't have it any other way.Followed by a whole slew of sequels.Eight out of 10.",Hellraiser
16,poolandrews,A great original horror film.,9,27 October 2004,"The gruesome directorial debut from author Clive Barker. Frank Cotton (Sean Chapman) in some unspecified location buys a Chinese puzzle box from a mysterious man, who is always shown in shadow. The film then jumps to the attic in Franks house, somewhere in London. Sitting on the bare wooden floorboards surrounded by candles, he solves the puzzle of the box. Demons from hell known as Cenobites appear Pinhead (Doug Bradley), Chatterer (Nicholas Vince), Butterball (Simon Bamford), and a female Cenobite (Grace Kirby). Using hooks on chains they tear Frank to pieces, in pretty graphic detail. Franks brother Larry (Andrew Robinson) and his wife Julia (Clare Higgins) decide to move into the house. While moving in Larry slices his hand on an old nail sticking out of the stair case. He set off to find Julia who is in the attic reminiscing about the affair she had with Frank. Larry stumbles into the attic and drips blood all over the floor. This blood rejuvenates Frank, another impressively gruesome scene showing his body recreating itself, fingers forming, ribs attaching themselves, his brain being made and attached, you get the idea. He however is not fully formed and needs fresh human blood to make himself whole again. Julia discovers him in the attic and after some persuasion by Frank she agrees to help him, to bring him victims. things get even more complicated when Kirsty (Ashley Laurence) Larrys daughter gets involved, and the Cenobites return to take Frank back to hell.Written, based on his novel The Hellbound Heart, and directed by Clive Barker I think this is a very gruesome, gory, blood splattered film, but the characters and story are not sacrificed and together combine to create a truly original, startling and extremely effective low budget horror film that spawned various sequels. The effects handled by Bob Keen and his crew are extremely impressive for such a low budget film, sections of someones face laid out on the floor like a jig-saw puzzle, hooks ripping skin to shreds, skinless corpses, Franks various states of decay and re-animation, and the Cenobites themselves are well conceived and realized. One effect I found poor however was the monster who chases Kirsty when she opens a door to hell in her hospital room. Still, a very good job all round. The acting was fine. The script, written by Barker based upon one of his novels was good, it kept things moving along nicely and it stays away from any wise cracking one liner bad guys, popular in horror films at the time. He obviously wanted to make a very serious horror film, and succeeds admirably. Technically everything else is fine, photography, music, production design and editing. On the down side I thought the ending looked a bit rushed, 90% of the film is set in the same house which gets a bit dull after a while, a few things aren't really explained satisfactorily, like the creepy tramp who follows Kirsty around, but these are minor quibbles. A very impressive film, for those with the stomach, I really liked it and recommend it.",Hellraiser
17,CinemaSerf,Still sordid and sexy...,7,17 September 2021,"OK, so time has not been at all kind to the visual effects - the leaps and bounds in that aspect of film making have reduced many great horror stories to little more than glorified comedies where the plasticine and tomato ketchup create risibility where before they would have created a sense of fear. The element that enables this film to fair a bit better is the story. It's good. An on form Clare Higgins (""Julia"") has a fling with ""Frank"" (Sean Chapman) - who happens to be the brother of her husband ""Larry"" (Andrew Robinson). Many years later the couple return to the same house in England where she soon discovers that her randy brother-in-law has found himself a box - a key to another dimension, and got a little out of his depth with some pretty evil looking characters (the ""Cenobites"") who appears to have read, if not devised, every S&M book going. In order to help him recover from his seriously emaciated state, she must procure dinner for him - preferably male and alive and.... Matters take a turn for the worse when his niece stumbles upon the same key to their nether/leather-world and it looks like her goose is about to be cooked too. It's interesting to watch a film that draws very clear lines between sex and death - just how powerful a libido can be at motivating people to do things, and suffer things! Don't be put off by the dated look of the film, or at least remember latex was real in 1987 rather than computer generated - and you ought still to get some pleasure from this. It isn't especially scary, but it is still quite gripping.",Hellraiser
18,Bunuel1976,"HELLRAISER (Clive Barker, 1987) **1/2",6,23 August 2006,"Since I had been too young to watch it when originally released, I had to wait till now to catch up with this cult horror item! While definitely gory (as it's renowned to be), the film is well handled and also quite stylish.The plot, in itself, is rather silly but still manages to be fairly engrossing (particularly during the last half-hour). Besides, unlike many a horror film from the 80s, the lead characters are nicely developed: it was great to see Andy Robinson again in a film (best known for playing Scorpio, the unforgettable psycho who unwisely pits himself against Clint Eastwood's ""Dirty"" Harry Callahan, in Don Siegel's classic 1971 original) though, for most of the time, here he plays the good-guy type; Clare Higgins is convincing as his wife, who becomes a reluctant accomplice in his dead brother Frank's 're-animation'; Ashley Laurence, as Robinson's teenage daughter from an earlier marriage, emerges after a while as the film's true main character (who even went to reprise her role in 3 of the film's myriad sequels!). The special effects are, for lack of a better word, efficiently repulsive - especially in the creation of the hellish Cenobites (an interestingly varied bunch of monsters if ever there was one!) and their excruciating endeavors.Still, despite being one of the more popular horror releases from its era, I'm baffled that it should have spawned so many follow-ups and, to be honest, it hasn't made me all that eager to seek them out (even though my local DVD rental outlet seems to carry the majority of them!)...",Hellraiser
19,grantss,One of the more original horror movies,6,8 August 2015,"One of the more original horror movies. Not that this says much, as most horror movies are incredibly formulaic and predictable.A couple, with the husband's daughter, moves into an old house.

The wife discovers him and agrees to find victims for him, for blood. Then the daughter starts nosing around...Fairly original story and solid direction by writer-director Clive Barker.

20,Boba_Fett1138,One of the more original horror movies around.,8,9 January 2010,"This surely is a very refreshing and original horror movie to watch. It doesn't has the usual formulaic ingredients in it, such as monsters or a murderous psychopathic serial killer on the loose. No screaming teenagers and no dark haunted places. All we have this time is a cube, that opens doors to hell and unleashes the bringers of pain; Pinhead and friends, who want to play with you forever.But even that story is being somewhat pushed to the background and it focuses more on a family, of which the wife falls madly for the the no good brother of her soon to be husband. The brother however messed with the cube and got stuck in Pinhead's hell of pain. He however managed to escape it but only in a skeleton form. He needs blood to slowly regain his body and asks the wife to kill for him. This is were most of the movie its 'horror' comes from. The movie doesn't get its horror aspects from its normal usual scare- or gross out moments. It's more a movie that works on its atmosphere and story development. Perhaps it's also due to the restrained budget, that simply forced the film-makers to be creative with the things they had at hand. The movie is no big Hollywood production and as a matter of fact it actually is an UK movie, that still got obviously aimed toward the American market as well though, in terms of its overall style.And even though the movie was low-budget, the movie certainly did not look that way. Also its effects such as its make-up and the effects used for the more gory parts of the movie are really great looking. The make-up of course helped to make Pinhead an horror icon-figure, though in this movie he isn't even called by the name Pinhead, which was only a name that got developed later for marketing purposes.The movie also features a great musical score by Christopher Young, that fits the movie really well. It's one of his more memorable works.A real original horror movie, that has grown into being a classic already.8/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",Hellraiser
21,TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews,"Please, no tears... it's a waste of good suffering",7,23 September 2009,"Clive Barker, the last man in the known universe you want telling your children bed-time stories, grants us a look into his mind and imagination. Is it disgusting, nasty, violent, gory and bloody(arguably excessively so)? Without a doubt. Is the writer/director, who also penned the novel(which I haven't read, so I can't make comparisons, though I understand that it follows it closely) and made up the concept, a sick, twisted human being? Probably, yes. If you don't think you can handle this movie, you're quite likely to be right. It's gruesome and graphic. But... and this is important... it is *not* phoned in, done by people who did not care whether or not it turned out good(and not just profitable), or one of the recent aptly-nicknamed ""torture porn"" flicks. This is rather well-done, and it's impressive that the dear Brit had such a handle on film-making, having only done two shorts before helming this. In addition to being disturbing and grotesque, this manages to provide a genuine, well-told story, an original idea, nicely developed characters, several of whom we can care about, and suspense that is expertly crafted. This is truly terrifying, and the last half-hour is to be experienced by anyone who considers themselves a fan of horror. Be it those based on atmosphere, or the more direct, visceral ones. With maybe one exception, there is not a single jump scare in this that does not pay off. The pacing is good. Acting is great, the performances are almost exclusively convincing. The tension of this is thick. There are immensely memorable lines of dialog in this. The special effects are mostly well-done, and tend to hold up well, even today. While I have not yet watched them all, the sequels, if not without attractive qualities and the occasional interesting take on the franchise, never reach this level after this one. I recommend this to fans of the genre and the medium. It will tear your soul apart. 7/10",Hellraiser
22,evanston_dad,"Jeesh, Lighten Up Demons of Hell",7,5 October 2016,"Writer/director Clive Barker pulls out all the grisly stops in this first installment of what would become one of the most enduring horror series to emerge from the 1980s.In ""Hellraiser,"" a bored wife makes a sort of pact with the devil when her husband's dangerous and sexy brother, with whom she had an affair, comes back from the dead and asks her to kill for him so that he can use human blood to become fully formed again. For him, it's a race against time, as the Cenobites, a bunch of super creepy beings from the depths of Hell, want to reclaim him. The film is gory and sexually charged, with lots of S&M imagery and a blurring of the boundaries between pleasure and pain. It has a sense of humour about itself, which is important in films like this, and which current horror films are seriously lacking. In fact in tone it reminded me a lot of the ultimate black comedy horror film ""The Evil Dead,"" and while it's not nearly as effective as that film at either the horror or the comedy, it does manage to be fairly scary while also being funny in a squirmy kind of way.The acting is pretty bad and the editing ragged, but Barker's commitment to his own material goes a long way to making up for those deficiencies.Grade: B+",Hellraiser
23,kannibalcorpsegrinder,A classic in every sense of the word,10,28 October 2014,"Upon moving into a new house with his family, a man learns that his wife's infidelity with his brother through their shared connection to a strange puzzle box that summons a race of demonic beings and tries to stop them.This is simply one of the greatest horror films of all time. The best example of this is the atmosphere which drips off here quite thickly, and it sucks you in as its present throughout the whole movie. From the simple like the lighting to the location of the sets to the general mood of the film, as well as the gradual realization of the horror to come in her adultery and the connection with the box itself, this one is incredibly suspenseful. That really sells the movie here with the film really offering plenty of solid moments to not only underscore the relationship but the mystery surrounding the box which really drives the film and the ever-widening part of it's legacy makes this quite a chilling tale when it's all put together with the brother's escape and his being chased. Even more comes from the regeneration scenes, as he comes back from a pool of blood in one part as basically bones with a little bit of skin and takes so long to come to form that it becomes even bloodier. From what the regeneration starts as and where it ends is a great highlight to a great scene. Even all the bloody corpses seen in here are pretty disgusting, being mangled and distorted beyond belief. That brings up the gore in here, and this film is incredibly gory so something like a simple cut on the hand is more like an opening to a geyser. The deaths are just as good and include some pretty brutal moments, specifically the ever-popular dismemberment by chained-hooks scene which is one of its more iconic images. Of course, one can't talk about this film without mentioning the Cenobites, which are introduced in here and are one of the best horror creations of all time. Demonic looking in nature, each one has a distinct look and personality that evokes particularly demonic and scary images yet are still portrayed as being cool and somewhat fashionable with Pinhead in particular getting the chance to spout off some legendary lines. The rest of the creatures are legendary and memorable for good reason, being the heart and soul of this movie. About the only thing really wrong here is the rather convoluted plot-line that takes a while to get all out of the plot, but it's still a little all over the place. It seems to tell three different stories and never really gives it much time to develop leaving this with some confusing moments, but otherwise there wasn't much wrong with this one.Rated R: Graphic Violence, Graphic Language, Brief Nudity and several sex scenes.",Hellraiser
24,Aaron1375,The Rubick's Cube from Hell.,4,2 February 2004,"I am not the biggest fan of the Hellraiser series...in fact I am not a fan at all.  Somewhat interesting, in the end I find them to be a bit over done in areas and under done in others.  Sometimes it is over the top, and at other times it is kind of boring.  The story has this guy solving a puzzle box and when you solve the puzzle box you get chains through your body, then you are ripped apart.  This seems to me to be like more of a disincentive to full around with the box, but that doesn't seem to stop anyone in the series.  The guy is later resurrected and has to kill and suck blood (not in the way a vampire does).  He is helped by his brother's wife as they are lovers.  Nothing to unpredictable about where all this leads.  Meanwhile, the daughter of the husband (I don't think the wife is her mother) accidentally solves the puzzle box and here comes Pinhead who is in the movie very little.  Considering he was on the poster and he is what everyone remembers his screen time amounts to maybe five or ten minutes.  All in all a bit of a twisted horror that might appeal to you, but I actually liked the sequels a bit more.  Though not by much.",Hellraiser
25,The_Void,"Trash to some, a horror masterpiece to all those who know what they're talking about!",10,27 October 2005,"I have seen Hellraiser many, many times; but my most recent viewing of the film was different to the rest. It was different because this was the first time that I've seen the film since reading Clive Barker's novel ""The Hellbound Heart"". The novel both enhanced my enjoyment for the film, and exposed some of its flaws. With the book, Barker really allows the reader to get inside the character's head, which ensures that the horror is more shocking. His descriptions are also a lot more macabre than what is shown in the film, and the way that certain things in the book are missed out/abridged shows some of the wasted opportunities of the story. This isn't really a criticism of the film, but rather of books being turned into movies on the whole. People often say that the book is better than the movie; and in this case it's true! Even so, Hellraiser is an absolute classic horror film, and easily one of the best of the eighties; not to mention all time. The plot simply follows Frank Cotton. Frank is a man in search of unknown pleasures, and in order to achieve that he buys a mysterious music box. This box does give out pleasure; but it's inflicted by a band of demons, known as 'Cenobytes' - and their idea of pleasure differs from Frank's! The story picks up when Frank's brother and his girlfriend, Julia, move into the house where Frank was taken...The main reason Hellraiser stands out among horror films is because of its themes. Barker weaves shades of love, eroticism and, of course, pain and pleasure into his tale of demons and scarred flesh - and this really makes the film. We can care for the characters and what happens to them because of what Barker puts between them, and it's always evident that this film is head and shoulders above the rest of the schlock-horror sub-genre. The special effects, particularly on the screen time surrounding Frank, are simply stunning and show how real effects beat all this CGI rubbish hands down, while also showing that a low budget can be overcome. The film is never gratuitous with its gore or effects either, and everything in this film is there because it has to be. This is what annoys me about non-horror fans - films like this are dismissed by them because they're ""too gory"" or ""stupid"" - but Hellraiser breaks the mould because it's a truly original story and the way that Barker implements a macabre love story amidst a plethora of shocking horror is extremely skilfully handled, and more than challenges many of the so-called 'A-class' films.A writer directing his own work tends to ensure that it will get proper treatment, and this is mostly true here. Some things have been changed from the book for no apparent reason (mostly with the characters of Larry and Kristy), but the only thing that really annoyed me was the ending. I suppose it's due to the time that it was made, but the ending feels tacked on to me. Barker's ending in the book was perfectly judged - just open enough to hint at more, while closing the story enough so that the reader is satisfied. Here, we have a schlock finale that is entertaining, but pulls away from the closed atmosphere that Barker has spent the film creating. This film differs from most other eighties horror films because of the fact that the actors are a talented bunch. You come to expect bad acting from this sort of film - but Hellraiser has none of it! The entire cast shine, with Clare Higgins making the biggest impression as the evil Julia. This was Clive Barker's directorial debut, and at times, it's clear that this is the case; but Barker makes the best of his locations, and while his camera sometimes feels enclosed; it fuses with the tragic music brilliantly, and all this helps the film to create that fabulous atmosphere so convincingly.Overall, I have pointed out a couple of flaws here; but I really can't bring myself to give this masterpiece any less than full marks. The originality on display throughout Hellraiser is astounding, as is the atmosphere and the performances pulled out of the actors, along with the fact that this film has entertained me many times and is still as good today as the first time I saw it. All of this ensures that Hellraiser will be an endearing favourite of mine for the rest of my life. If you consider yourself a fan of horror and haven't seen this; shame on you. Make sure you read the book, too!",Hellraiser
26,trashgang,Iconic,9,20 September 2016,"1985 saw the end of horror, We had to wait until Scream (1996) before horror was back in business. In between it was all crap and horror with cheap effects or laughable stories. A time also with a lot of sequels. But in 1987 a flick was released that set the tone for a new icon and a sequel still going on.Hellraiser was a new kind of breed that was not seen back then. Even as it isn't a perfect flick especially on editing it still isn't outdated nowadays. I mean, some editing you can easily spot that shots were done on different moments. The blood dripping on the floor from Larry's hand is shown in close-up but when they cut to show the room no blood is seen. It also has some laughable effects when the cenobites disappear through the use of the box, typical effects from that era but the effects used for the cenobites are stunning. And Frank being made out of blood and skeleton is also stunning and did have The Thing (1982) feeling.The sentences used by pinhead is what makes this flick iconic.

The late decision to insist (stupidly) on switching the film from England to US means some locations make little sense and that there are inevitable problems with accents and dubbing. Having said all that, this is Clive Barker's first film, he had very limited budget and yet produces the most original of horror films. The struggles with sex, religion and violent tendencies are omnipresent despite the various censors' connivance at keeping the lid on and the diabolic creations are sublime. From the very first indication that things might be very wrong indeed, when the drops of blood are drawn from the floor, this wondrous creation doesn't stop.

This is actually based on a book by Clive Barker called ""The Hellbound Heart"" so the author became the director of his own story (which in a way is kinda cool). The plot revolves around a guy named Frank who wants extreme pleasure in his live and comes across a person that claims a mystical box can provide that. When he messes with the box it sends him to some sort of freakish dimensional hell and gets tortured by these monsters called the cenobites. His unfaithful wife has a relationship with some other guy. However Frank manages to escape, but as a zombie form and in order to get to his human form back he needs to consume other humans. So when he manages to come across his wife, he convinces her to kill people so he can consume them. And the daughter of the guy she is having a relationship behind her husbands back tries to investigate what is going on and finds something way more than her suspicions were. This is actually a graphic and gratuitous movie that doesn't rely on CGI, but more on props seeing how this flick was made in the 80's. The special effects with the props and design isn't that bad and is actually comes off more creepy than some other horror movies that use a lot of CGI. Even for a horror movie that is from the 80's it has it's shock factor mainly because of the visuals from the mind of Clive Barker. A lot of people claim the first two ""Hellraiser"" movies are the ones that are worth seeing for people that like horror movies. And I guess I can see why, because the build up which has symbolism of indulging in pleasure (although the build up may come off as kinda slow at times) and mystery with the freakish and creepy visuals makes this one stand out when it comes to the horror genre. Even if the build up is a bit slow like I said, but for a movie from the 80's I can tell why it had the capability to scare the crap out of the viewers. I give this one a 6.6/10 because the visuals adds a lot to the concept and premise.6.6/10",Hellraiser
33,Red-Barracuda,One of the most imaginative horror flicks of the 80's,8,5 November 2012,"Clive Barker's debut feature is one of the most original horror films of the 80's. Unlike many genre offerings from that decade this one is not formulaic at all. It's chiefly for this reason that Hellraiser is respected. Barker proved himself to be something of a talent and one who would end up directing very little else unfortunately.Hellraiser is a story about the occult but like no other film of that sub-genre. Instead of the typical demonic creatures you would see in many other films of this type, this one introduces the Cenobites. These denizens of hell are a good deal more memorable, and have a somewhat S&M styling that gives them added deviancy. They look highly original. Throughout the film there are a series of visually spectacular set-pieces. The look and atmosphere of Hellraiser belies is very modest budget. Barker and his team consistently make the most of their meagre resources and it's never obvious that this is so low-budget.The celebrated fantasy moments are well off-set by a story of a dysfunctional family. The characters are all well rounded and believable which again is not a typical aspect of an 80's horror movie. The performances are universally strong, including an atypically good guy role for Andrew Robinson who was most famous for playing the psychopath Scorpio in Dirty Harry.All in all, a quality production. And one of the most iconic horror flicks of the 80's.",Hellraiser
34,thesar-2,Get Hooked on the 'Box,8,24 July 2010,"I love how (soon following) Doug Bradley was billed as ""The Lead Cenobite."" It makes sense from what I've been told about the background on Hellraiser, or the short story it's based on: The Hellbound Heart. This movie, unlike the other slashers surround it (A Nightmare on Elm Street, Friday the 13th, Halloween, The Texas Chainsaw Massacre, just to name a few) wasn't supposed to be the Artist Soon to be Known as Pinhead.My guess is Barker wanted to go beyond Freddy, Jason, Michael, and Leatherface and make an intelligent horror story without relying on a wise-cracking, machete-wielding or babysit watcher to slice/dice the idiot cardboard teens. Fans later apparently missed the message and Pinhead came out of the shadows. (I'm just as guilty; I love the character of Pinhead. But, at least I still liked this origin movie the best of the Hellraiser series.)I concur with true Barker fans, especially after watching Red Dragon. It's not about Hannibal Lecter at all, though they splashed Anthony Hopkins all over it. Why? Well, fans wanted him, they wanted to increase box office and it would be his last stint as Hannibal the Cannibal. But, to me it ruined the movie as that's not what the source material intended. Heck, Hannibal was in, like, 4 pages out of 464!Alas, sticking with the film at hand: Bravo. Aside from some cheesy lightening effects amongst some buck fifty door creatures – all probably due to the low budget, it was a highly effective up'd ante from the typical irony-laced/Twilight Zone fare with loads of plot twists, character development, background, suspense and a surprisingly large number of characters – all important – for such a small film.After Frank (Chapman) summons demons with a puzzle box (loved the box) and disappears, supposedly for good, his brother, Larry (Robinson) and sister-in-law, Julia (Higgins) move into his house. Immediately we're treated to Julia's extramarital affair with Frank in very spicy flashbacks.Meanwhile, Larry's trying to connect with his daughter, Kirsty (Laurence) who's (not very) oddly unfavorable of Julia. Meanwhile, after a deep cut, Larry splashes blood on the very floor of the very room his brother ""disappeared"" in and it gets sucked up and becomes an insect version of Frank. Meanwhile, Julia sees her chance of getting her ex-lover back and is willing to go the extra mile, for lack of a better term, to bring back Frank. Meanwhile, Kirsty investigates and inadvertently summons the very demons, or Cenobites, who are just as confused as she is on why they were called – generally they're called for pleasure through pain.There's more ""meanwhiles"" but I've probably spoiled enough. Suffice to say, it's a gory good time at psychological warfare between the innocent, the guilty and the deserving.And it's brutally gruesome. Not by today's standards, 23 years later, but I'm sure it was near the top of the list from 1987 backwards. One positive about the gore: they didn't just rely on that, as most slashers/torture porn does since. This had one, uh, hell of a story here.That said, it wasn't perfect; there were a lot of plot holes including a quick wrap up in the last third that made Kirsty the thrown in heroine who could unconvincingly solve the puzzle in a few heartbeats and bargain these big baddies, lead by Pinhead. This is when all others, who actually know about them, actually call upon them, can't outmaneuver a flying hook. Also, they did a good job of introducing the Cenobites, but spent so little on them, it begged for a sequel, or more, to explore their storyline.Furthermore, it almost seemed like the creator, Barker, was anti-Christ as there were plenty to mock Jesus, even going as far as reference him in a quote from the Bible at the most inopportune time. But, in their defense, I think they did a good job of showing true evil, whether be it from the walking sadomasochistic demons or worse, man. It's hard to watch, but so was The Passion of the Christ. Both films show the true evil of men; they didn't sugar-coat/Sunday School what lies beneath our skins.It's definitely 1980s. It's a good start on the Pinhead legend. It's for gore fans or for people reminiscing about the 1980s horror franchises. And it's a recommended for a more thoughtful look at pure evil.",Hellraiser
35,StrictlyConfidential,As Scary As The Three Stooges,3,11 November 2018,"Cenobites here.... Cenobites there.... Cenobites, Cenobites everywhere!Yeah. OK. I know full-well that the 3 vicious Cenobites featured in this hell-bound horrorshow were supposed to be unfathomably ""s-c-a-r-y"". But, for the most part - I found this terrorizing trio to be about as frightening as are the Three Stooges. I ain't kidding here.And (IMO) - Perhaps if these 3 hellboys had actually resorted to the likes of some genuine face slaps, eye-pokes, and, yes, an occasional custard pie in the kisser - It would've certainly been a helluva lot more entertaining to watch than was all of the silly/nasty ""We're so evil"" nonsense that director/writer, Clive Barker had foisted into my face. Yes. Indeed.",Hellraiser
36,bensonmum2,"Good, just not great",7,21 February 2005,"(From IMDb) Clive Barker's feature directing debut graphically depicts the tale of a man and wife who move into an old house and discover a hideous creature - the man's half-brother, who is also the woman's former lover - hiding upstairs. Having lost his earthly body to a trio of S&M demons, the Cenobites, he is brought back into existence by a drop of blood on the floor. He soon forces his former mistress to bring him his necessary human sacrifices to complete his body... but the Cenobites won't be happy about this.I've always thought that Hellraiser is a good movie, but I am not as ""in love"" with it as a lot of horror fans. The special effects seem to be one of the major draws and, while I agree that they are very well done, I'm just not into a lot of gore effects. I will give the special effects people credit for some jaw dropping moments. If this movie were made today, CGI would replace (and ruin) a lot of what's seen. Hellraiser is one of the better examples of what can be done with ""real"" effects.Pinhead and, to a lesser extent, the other Cenobites have become cultural icons. But, in Hellraiser, they are given so little screen time that they are really nothing more than minor supporting players. Watching the movie, you learn very little about the Cenobites and how they came to be (it's not until the sequels that we learn anything about their origin). Had there never been all of the sequels, I contend that Pinhead and his buddys wouldn't be nearly as ""famous"" as they are.I suppose my biggest problem with the movie is the characters. For me to completely enjoy a horror movie, there has to be someone I care about. None of these characters are worth empathy. I suppose the daughter could be a character I could care about, but she has so little screen time until she's under attack that I never felt as if I knew her.",Hellraiser

38,Robert_duder,Horror Royalty. A brilliant and breathtaking Horror classic,9,12 July 2011,"I have been a lover of horror series' for a very long time. I love them, no matter how bad or good, the B-Movie the better. I guess I just love the whole returning 'evil' being, and the good guys that stop especially if its a re-occurring good guy (Donald Pleasance in Halloween for instance.) So I decided it was time to check out the Hellraiser series and I intend on watching all of them (currently there are nine.) I know I had seen the original two or three before but it has been a long time. What I forgot was that Clive Barker created a stone cold classic with the original Hellraiser. Incredibly gory, creepy, brilliant special effects without the guise of modern CGI. Brilliant beasts, and truly stunning cinematography. Its easy to see why this was a stepping stone for milking this series to straight to video. The killers are kept truly mysterious in this instalment and are definitely memorable in every way. A story about lust, infidelity and pain and pleasure is the core to Hellraiser and the squeamish should stay away because Hellraiser holds no punches! Newcomer Ashley Laurence is the young scream queen of Hellraiser. For a first time in a big screen production she is absolutely perfect. She embodies everything that a main female scream queen should and is easily right up there with Jamie Lee Curtis from Halloween and Nightmare on Elm Street's Heather Langenkamp. Long time character actor Andrew Robinson plays Laurence's father and new homeowner and husband Larry. He is straight laced, and almost dull (but this is the way his character is played.) He is essentially perfect in the role. Clare Higgins role is downright memorable as the unfaithful, and twisted wife and stepmother Julia. Higgins' performance can best be described as a truly terrific soap opera villain. She over plays it, and she adds the true B-Movie quality to the film but at the same time is the perfect nemesis to innocent Kirsty. Also basically new to the big screen is Doug Bradley who becomes and embodies the lead cennobite (the name of the beings from Hell). Of course we all know him as Pinhead although never referred by that name in the film. Bradley plays a dark mysterious, somehow seemingly regal leader. He commands respect on screen in his character which is a completely new element to the 'slasher' genre. Oliver Smith is the creature that escapes from the cennobites to come back to life. He does a great job under all that make up playing the disturbed and tortured Frank.This was a first for a lot of things and that includes Horror legend Clive Barker's first time writing and directing. No one knows Barker's twisted mind better than Barker. He obviously translates what his stories tell flawlessly to the big screen and its unfortunate he doesn't do more directing because this is brilliant. The world he creates is what Hellraiser is all about. It isn't even about the characters or the story but this dark and terrifying world that emerges from this mysterious box. Hellraiser is a horror staple and when you stop to look at the incredible work done on make up and special effects you'll see this was true brilliance in special effects and horror. An absolute must see for Horror fans!! 9/10",Hellraiser
39,Pjtaylor-96-138044,That ain't no Rubik's cube.,7,10 July 2021,"Though Pinhead (here credited only as 'Lead Cenobite') is as iconic an 80s horror creation as any of his counterparts and has become the face of the overall franchise, he and his similarly sadomasochistic cronies actually have very little screen time in 'Hellraiser (1987)'. This arguably makes their appearances all the more impactful, though; there's a sense of dread underlying the entire affair, with the looming threat of otherworldly pain experts putting a strain on both the characters who are aware of them and, subconsciously, those who are blissfully ignorant to their existence. The meat-and-potatoes of the piece focuses on a mean and manipulative nymphomaniac who wills himself back to life (with the help of a bit of his brother's blood) after getting more than he bargained for when he opened a mysterious puzzle box that promises the furthest reaches of pleasure and pain. The actual protagonist is the man's sister-in-law, who is roped into killing for him so that he can regain his lost humanity. The pair had previously been involved in an extra-marital affair, and it's her insatiable lust that drives her to do things that never should be done. There's an interesting dynamic between the slimy, skinless monster in the attic and the cold, aloof homeowner turned killer; it's evocative of an abusive relationship, with the former coercing the latter into doing horrific things in, essentially, the name of a false promise. The reformed man is really the picture's antagonist, which is interesting considering that Pinhead is the villain that people remember (for good reason, though). They're pretty much polar opposites, too, as the former essentially represents negative human emotion (such as anger and greed) and the latter is a proponent of dispassionate yet devastating suffering. Both of these evils can be equally scary, but it's undeniable that the cenobites are what sear themselves into your mind. They're creepy in both design and concept, with their few appearances being genuinely disquieting and especially well put together. The picture's latter half shifts its focus to the reformed man's niece, whose innocence is the only real reason to root for her to succeed (her character is generally quite weak). Still, a more straightforward hero makes for a more straightforwardly compelling set of sequences. The ending gets a little too over-the-top for its own good and, though they're generally still convincing, the special effects occasionally leave something to be desired. Ultimately, though, this is a really strong and, even, subversive horror experience. It has a dark, moody, borderline gothic atmosphere, an almost relentlessly bleak core concept and some inventively unsettling aesthetics. As odd as it may sound, it's really entertaining. 7/10.",Hellraiser
40,bowmanblue,Hella' sick fun,9,5 September 2017,"Okay, even if you haven't seen 'Hellraiser' then you're probably aware of its existence simply by browsing video boxes in the rental store. It was the one that made you stop, stare and ultimately either run away and have nightmares for the rest of your life, or rent it out as quickly as possible just to see what it was all about. Although, based on today's movie-watching trends, the average film-buff has probably never taken a wander up and down the aisles of a Blockbuster store and therefore has never seen 'Pinhead's' screaming face in all its glory.The basic premise of 'Hellraiser' revolves around a supernatural puzzle box that, when opened, unleashes a quartet of mutilated demons, known as 'Cenobites,' who want to tear your flesh from your body – simply for their enjoyment! And, when your typically wicked stepmother's evil lover returns from hell to stir up trouble among her (vaguely) happy family, she agrees to help him in his quest to escape the pursuing Cenobites by generally murdering unsuspecting men in order to give him the required amount of blood. Unfortunately, this doesn't bode well for her legal husband or his daughter.I mentioned that if you've seen the front cover of 'Hellraiser' then it would stick in your head (like a load of pins to be precise). That's because most marketing was centred around the 'lead Cenobite' or 'Pinhead' as he was duly christened. If ever practical make-up was used to good (and horrific!) effect it was here. The Cenobites do really have to be seen to believed. 'Hellraiser' isn't for the faint-hearted – there's tonnes of blood and gore, mainly involving skinless corpses running around murdering people. Now, that in itself may be enough to put people off watching it, however, as I said, it's the Cenobites who are the real stars.For some they may not be in the film for as long as audiences may have liked (a fact that was somewhat rectified in the sequel), but, when they're there, they do steal every scene (and possibly your soul). I haven't read the book that 'Hellraiser' was based on, so I can't really comment on how well it adheres to the source material, but, for once, the writer (Clive Barker) was actually allowed to adapt his own work for the big screen. I don't know how faithful it is, but I do know that it's a memorable experience that die-hard horror fans need to see. Just don't eat anything before you sit down. If you're afraid of the 'red stuff' in general, this one really isn't for you.",Hellraiser
41,gbill-74877,Creepy and disturbing,6,11 May 2020,"I liked the setup, with the backstory of the adulterous relationship feeding in to this woman going out and bringing fresh victims back to resurrect her dead lover. It gets a little weird when her stepdaughter (Ashley Laurence) starts snooping around and gets her hands on the puzzle box, and it probably would have been better had the story made a little more sense. My, she sure figured out how to use that thing quickly. The darkness of the visuals has a strong undercurrent of sadomasochism in it, but the pleasure/sexual side of it seems to be submerged in favor of pain and the grotesque. The Cenobites are pretty interesting, and I would have preferred to see more of them. Certainly creepy and disturbing, if that's what you're going for.",Hellraiser
42,ericstevenson,Probably the best in its series,7,10 September 2016,"While I myself am not a fan of slasher movies, I knew I had to check this out if only because it, once again, had a never ending series of sequels, like all films in this genre has. While I'm certainly not a fan, I actually found this to be pretty good. It's probably because of how good the makeup effects are. There really is a fair amount of creativity put into the details with all of these creatures. It was actually interesting with how the main villain, Pinhead, barely appeared in this. Of course, a horror movie franchises revolves around the villain.This actually did manage to be unique as it set the villain up as having these henchmen who again, were pretty creatively designed. There's parts where the acting is pretty bad. It still manages to be an effective movie that creates its own atmosphere well. The ending is very nicely done too, with everything coming together full circle rather nicely. It's interesting to hear about how Pinhead was a slasher villain who was meant to speak intelligently. Freddy Krueger was the first one who talked, but he became a wisecracker. It does start pretty slow. So yeah, definitely not something for kids (duh), but if you're a horror movie fan, you should pop this one in. I didn't like it enough to intend to see all the sequels, though. ***",Hellraiser
43,CuriosityKilledShawn,La Belle Enfer,8,1 November 2007,"Of the many horror franchises that endured through the 80s and 90s Hellraiser, surely, has the most sequels (I think we're up to part 10 now). The mythology, and point, may have been lost on the long line of successive filmmakers who took up the reigns after Clive Barker's departure, but the original film remains a true, hardcore, nose-to-the-grindstone horror that is completely unafraid to do whatever it wants.The story has Larry Cotton and his wife Julia move into the old family home (in what seems to be England, but no one is speaking with an English accent) where his wayward brother Frank appeared to have been staying before mysteriously taking off. Little do they know that Frank's soul is imprinted on the walls of the attic and brought back to life, in a skeletal, barely human capacity, when Larry spills his blood on the floor. Frank and Julia rekindle a fling they once had as he begs her to help him restore his human body, by luring naive wannabe lovers, for him to feed on before the Cenobites discover he's escaped their dimension of eternal pain/pleasure.What impresses me most with Hellraiser is that everything is done before the camera. All the blood and make-up effects are cheap but utterly convincing. If it were made today it would be nothing more than a CGI-crapfest that would horrify no one, but the raw, ugly visuals and unfiltered cinematography elevate Hellraiser far, far above the trash that passes itself for horror these days.Chris Young also provides a glorious score, which may well be the best horror film score of all time. It's absolutely amazing stuff and I highly recommend that you check out the Hellraiser score CD. It gives the film an extra edge and a touch of timeless class. Despite being made in the 80s, Hellraiser has barely dated and looks much better than modern horror films with 50 times the budget.",Hellraiser

45,callanvass,Clive is a true student of the macabre. Hellraiser is a genuine Horror classic that has withstood the test of time.,9,18 December 2010,"(Credit IMDb) Clive Barker's feature directing debut graphically depicts the tale of a man and wife who move into an old house and discover a hideous creature - the man's half-brother, who is also the woman's former lover - hiding upstairs.

He soon forces his former mistress to bring him his necessary human sacrifices to complete his body... but the Cenobites won't be happy about this.(Some major spoilers, just a warning)What's to say about Hellraiser that hasn't already been said? It's a magnificent piece of Horror cinema, and rarely will you see anything so wonderfully artsy. Unlike quite a few horror films, Hellraiser doesn't just throw in gore for the sake of gore, there's a point to it. It has some of the most gruesome scenes I've ever laid my eyes on; they still pack a punch today. What many people fail to realize is that Hellraiser is also a Gothic sort of love story between Julia and Frank. While it may not be very sympathetic, it's certainly tragic, and memorable. The lengths Julia goes to please him, and get him blood for his body clearly shows the adoration she has for him. And the tragic turn at the end it takes where Frank deceives her, is saddening to watch. Aside from Kirsty's idiotic boyfriend, the characters are all memorable. The flashback scenes involving Frank open the box are frightening and unforgettable. In the later sequels, the filmmakers made the mistake of making Pin Head into a pop-culture phenomenon like Freddy, only Pinhead isn't meant to be that way. Here he is in all his sadistic, creepy glory, and that's the way it should be.One of the things that really make Hellraiser is its incredible score. It's so profound, so powerful. I would really rank it as one of the most defining horror scores in history. They really don't make them like this anymore, nor would they take the chance on doing so. The rumored remake that is supposed to come about is a shame, but it will not tarnish Hellraiser's greatness. Hellraiser will forever remain a classic in my books, and it's almost a perfect Horror movie in my eyes. Beautiful, scary, and saddening all in one. It combines all of the perfect Horror elements, even adding in a love story. Performances. Andrew Robinson plays a nice guy for once, and he pulls it off. He's likable and ordinary, kudos to him for pulling it off. Claire Higgins gives a classic performance as Julia. She's intimidating, but also vulnerable. She isn't exactly the most sympathetic of characters, but her saddening eyes couldn't help but be endearing to me. Ashley Laurence, quite possibly the greatest horror heroine since Nancy of Nightmare on Elm Street, and Laurie of Halloween. She is the perfect protagonist for Pinhead, and they clashed beautifully with one another. She's strong willed, and very easy to like. Her legendary performance ranks up there with one of Horror's finest. Sean Chapman is creepily effective as Frank. His unforgettable voice also helps. Bottom line. Need I say more? Classic, classic, classic! You're a fool to call yourself a Horror movie fanatic if you've yet to see this movie.9 ½ /10",Hellraiser

Although in my opinion The Hellbound Heart is not even close to the best story he has written, adaptation of this book is move that made him famous and forever carved him in legend. In this movie story isn't questionable because Barker personally adapted his own novel into movie scenario and directed it. In technical terms, the film is pretty bad, but considering that it's Barker's movie debut done with really small budget result is surprisingly good.

48,The-Sarkologist,A Gem of a Horror Film,8,1 September 2020,"It's been ages since I have actually seen this film, and I never realised that it was as good as it was. I guess it had something to do with when I was younger I simply considered it to be another Haunted House movie, and not like the sequel where they actually go to hell. However, coming back to it and watching it again it really does grab me as to how well the character's are fleshed out, and the story that goes on behind the film.The idea is that there is this cult of demons who lure people into their domain with the promise of eternal pleasure. They have this box, a puzzle box, which if you solve the puzzle then you summon the demons, but not surprisingly it is a trap because once you have solved the puzzle you are under their control. This is what happened to Frank, as we discover at the beginning of the film.An undisclosed amount of time later Frank's brother Larry, and his wife Julia, return to the family home. It turns out that the house has been left in a bit of a mess, but they managed to clean it up. It also turns out that Julia isn't actually the most faithful of people out there. Also, when Larry cuts his hand on a nail, and spills his blood on the floor where Frank was taken, it sets in motion a chain of events that culminate in Frank returning from the dead.As I mentioned, this film actually turned out to be pretty good. The main thing is that it simply isn't one of those slasher flicks that seemed to just be pouring out of the studios at the time. Well, okay, this film has happened to spawn nine other sequels, as well as a slew of other merchandise, though some have suggested that a lot of it has to do with the popularity of Pin-Head. Then again, I have to admit that I also thought that Pin-Head was pretty cool, but the other Cenobites not so much.The thing is that it isn't a slasher flick, but rather one that deals with the darkside of humanity (though the later films seem to involve the confusion between reality and death). It also shows how Julia is certainly not a nice person, especially since she will do anything to bring Frank back, despite the fact that she happens to be married to Larry. Oh, and the fact that the Cenobites aren't the main monsters is also pretty cool - they seem to exist in the background and play more of a supporting role with Frank and Julia being the main antagonists.Yeah, this film is pretty cool, and if you want a horror film that doesn't involve slashers, or the concept of the last person standing, then this one certainly does work pretty well.",Hellraiser

51,tomgillespie2002,Stands out as one of the finest horrors of its era,8,5 December 2015,"Upon its release in 1987, Stephen King was quoted as saying, about Hellraiser, ""I have seen the future of horror, and his name is Clive Barker."" The backing of such an icon of horror is high praise indeed, and the fact that Hellraiser still holds up today, 28 years after its release, is a testament to the quality of Clive Barker's hellish vision, based on his own novella, The Hellbound Heart. In an era full of horror movies fronted by broad, almost comic villains, and audiences preferences leaning towards bland American slashers, Hellraiser took a stance as a serious piece of work - rich in atmosphere, disturbing in tone and visually arresting - the foundations on which horror classics are built.Contrary to popular belief (and his over-exposure in the - currently - 8 sequels), Pinhead (Doug Bradley) and his entourage of grotesque Cenobites remain in the background for the majority of the first instalment. The plot instead focuses the grisly fate and gradual re- birth of thrill-seeking scumbag Frank (Sean Chapman), who, in seeking the ultimate sexual enlightenment, purchases a mysterious puzzle box from a Chinese man which opens the gates of Hell when solved. Frank manages to do so, and is impaled by hooks and dragged into a world of torture, mutilation and degradation. Some time later, Frank's brother Larry (Andrew Robinson) and his second wife Julia (Clare Higgins) move into the home previously inhabited by Frank. While moving furniture, Larry cuts his hand on a protruding nail, inadvertently bringing Frank back from Hell and igniting his gruesome re-birth.The plot treads carefully between being mysterious and plain confusing. There are no attempts made to explain just why Larry's blood brings Frank back into the real world and what exactly Frank was hoping to achieve by experiencing Hell, but these small details become insignificant in the wake of such visual splendour and immersing atmosphere. It can also be forgiven for some soap-opera dramatics as Julia's previous infidelity with Frank is exposed, and her manipulation into bringing Frank bodies to feed on while her suspicious step-daughter Kirsty (Ashley Laurence) keep her a watchful eye. Hellraiser employs a slow, careful build-up, so when the true horror springs into life near the end and the Cenobites rear their ugly heads, it is all the more effective for it.Now a fully-fledge horror icon, Pinhead and his cronies are a strange manifestation of deformed monsters and bondage fetishism. They arrive with skin pinned back in various abominable positions, parts of their face and torso pierced with all manners of tools and devices, and all twisted beyond the point of no return by their experiences searching for the ultimate pleasures of the flesh. Part BDSM nightmare and part body horror, Hellraiser's climax is still one of the most disturbing things ever filmed without being particularly scary. Despite its narrative flaws and wobbly plot explanations, Clive Barker's film stands out as one of the finest of its era, spinning a complex and dark mythology around a low-key plot, with the uncanny ability to creep under your skin and stay there for a significant amount of time afterwards.",Hellraiser

But with this choice everything will change not only in her life but also in the life of others.I liked this horror movie because it had a nice and interesting plot, much of suspense and it was as creepy as it had a horror movie to be in order to be scary. The direction which was made by Clive Barker who is also the writer, was good and he presented very well the story of the main characters so, the audience did not have an difficulty of following the story of the movie.

53,TheMovieDiorama,"Hellraiser is obscure, imaginative and completely horrific.",6,27 February 2018,"I've seen some weird films, particularly of the horror genre, but this is definitely up there. A couple move into rundown house but unbeknown to them there is an evil presence beneath the floor boards that seeks human flesh. But why? How? That's where the lovingly kind (don't forget fashionable) Pinhead comes on screen with his fellow Cenobites. Ohhh what a sight they are, can only imagine its what I look like after a night out and crawling through a bush. The plot is pretty much Sweeney Todd but with chains, leather and plenty of blood. Much like a sex dungeon right? (...just mine then). The inclusion of the puzzle cube and the Cenobites are what makes the story interesting and ominous. I'm sure there is thick lore behind this puzzle cube which I can only presume is explored further in the sequels. I admired the ambiguity and imagination that the plot conveys. The pace was inconsistent, I found the second act to be too slow and the constant flashbacks of the first act did confuse me at times. Typically there's an indication that we're watching a flashback, but in this it kept switching back and forth instantly with no transitions. Slightly jarring. The main star is the make up. Absolutely authentic and the real use of prosthetics and effects just heightens the originality. Clive Barker doesn't dream, he just conceives nightmarish visions and graciously puts his ideas on screen. Skin being pulled by chains or a pool of blood suddenly growing into a raw fleshy human thing (totally trademark that), it's strangely beautiful to watch and the technical aspects are admirable. The acting is as you would expect, nothing fantastic but gets the job done. The final scene with the homeless man was somewhat unexpectedly weird, wasn't too sure what to think about it. Also, I wanted more Cenobite action! Not nearly enough screen time! However, as 80's horror films go this is a strong addition to the genre and completely memorable. Particularly Pinhead...who will tear your soul aparrrrrrt!",Hellraiser
54,Tweetienator,Still Rocks,7,3 May 2021,"The first two Hellraiser movies belong (in my humble opinion) on the watch list of every adept of the arts of horrors. The stories told were original back then and more, the gore and other special effects are still solid, some even excellent. On top, we get the directorial debut (full length movie) of a fine horror writer - Clive Barker. Essential to every 80s horror collection like the first A Nightmare on Elm Street and Friday the 13th movies.",Hellraiser
55,BaronBl00d,Thinking Inside the Box,6,28 December 2005,"There is absolutely no question about it: Clive Barker has one fertile, twisted imagination. Hellraiser is a gentle little tale about a mysterious box that brings the pleasures and pains of Heaven and Hell to the person manipulating the box. Now, I didn't see anything dealing with Heaven in this movie but did see those creatures which obviously were guardians of some type to the entrance to hell(hence the title I believe). The story is really about one Frank Cotton who buys the box in the Middle East(possibly Northern Africa) at the film's beginning. He opens the gates and is really ""hooked"" into what the box has to offer. Death by Cenobites(weird creatures that will show you what the world cannot). Frank's brother and his wife move into the house. Brother cuts his hand and bleeds profusely on floorboards under which Frank's emaciated carcass resides, and, Voila, blood begins to bring Frank back to life - some kind of fleshy bare existence. Fortunately for Frank, he had had an affair with his brother's wife and she will help him resume his former self by luring unsuspecting guys to his room where they can really help flesh out his character. Well, that is the basic premise. Of course there is a lot more to it including more Cenobites and lots and lots of blood and gore. Barker certainly uses a hyperbolic bloody style in his films. The gore is plentiful, yet the acting, even the story to some degree, and the creative direction of Barker make this film entertaining and the springboard of many, many sequels and a sort of mythos that goes with the whole series. The story is bizarre and a bit hard to understand fully, but I imagine that was what Barker was striving for. The direction is straightforward despite the level of incredulity in the script, and the actors are all pretty decent. Newcomer Ashley Laurence plays the heroine and is adequate, but sultry English actress Clare Higgins brings the film some credibility. And let's not forget Doug Bradley as Pinhead. He is indeed interesting and outer-worldly. Overall, I enjoyed Hellraiser as a open-to-interpretation kind of horror film. It is a lot bloodier than my tastes generally like, but the style and atmosphere used throughout did not turn it off for me. I will gladly see the sequels with anticipation. Barker; however; will be an acquired taste at best. A definite bonus is the lush, hauntimg score that really brings this feature up in so many ways.",Hellraiser
56,damianphelps,The Ratings Are WAY TO LOW!,10,11 January 2021,"This movie fits easily into masterpiece.I am going to review this as when I first watched it in 1987 and then I will make an adjustment for a contemporary audience.It 1987 there was NOTHING that compared or came close to what Clive Barker brought to the screen with Hellraiser. A mythology (that deepens for a cpl of sequels and then being honest gets destroyed with later crappy sequels) that is rich, a villain who arguably is the best horror villain of all time and some disturbing visual effects, gore and sleaze that were unparalleled.A tale of the consequences of sin carried out by the Cenobites and their leader.It is hard to put into words this movie in 1987.2021.
The elements are all still there, the mythology, the sin, the story and of course Pinhead.
The gore has gone, the visual effects are pretty awful (having aged badly).So it will no longer knock your socks off like it did mine so many years ago, but still remains a tale of crazy genius that all horror fans should celebrate :)",Hellraiser

Revisited it recently on a DVD. Hav seen all the sequels too. But felt like writing the review of this original. The special effects are chillingly good considering the rather low budget n the time it was made. It has breath-taking gore and elaborate costume designs. Mind you, its not particularly scary, there's not exactly a high body count, there is no tension n suspense. The plot is very original though. The acting and Julia's make up was atrocious. No doubt Clive Barkers film is bloody n bizarre. No doubt he introduced the world to one of the most memorable horror villains, Pinhead.

59,Anonymous_Maxine,"While not necessarily a great horror movie by the usual criteria, Hellraiser is a truly exceptional addition to the horror genre.",8,8 November 2000,"Yes, Hellraiser is gory, perhaps even overly so. Yes, it's full of blood as well as a fair amount of sex. Yes, the story is questionable at best. And yes, the acting was awful from a lot of the cast, but Hellraiser is nonetheless one of the most distinctive horror films ever made. Despite all of its numerous flaws, Hellraiser succeeds because it is so different from the typical slasher horror film, a subgenre that was created almost single-handedly by John Carpenter's 1978 classic, Halloween.
Clive Barker comes up with some of the most original and fascinating (as well as probably the most recognizable) characters in horror history with the Cenobites, particularly Pinhead. Everything about this character (as well as the other cenobites, but to a lesser extent) just radiates pure evil. The grey/white skin color, the hellish leather costume, the voice, the nails driven into his head, his EYES, all of these characteristics combine perfectly to make-up the most original and sinister horror characters in decades. Not only all that, but there is not a single other character out there who even vaguely resembles him, and this is extremely rare. This is one of the things that makes him so overpowering, no one has ever seen anyone like this before, nor has anyone come up with anything like him since. However, despite the breathtakingly fascinating and frightening cenobites, there is little to be said for Hellraiser. The gory make-up of Frank, as he slowly comes back to life, was amazingly convincing and sickening (with the exception of the primitive reverse motion photography), but the story and the acting were both mediocre. The story concerns a man who spends a ridiculous amount of money on some sort of evil puzzle box in search of the ultimate sensual experience, and instead he is dealt hell by the Cenobites, who respond whenever the box is solved (why this is true is not revealed until part III). His previous lover, now married to his brother, tries to bring him back to life when her new husband accidentally bleeds on the wrong wooden floor, beginning the process of bringing Frank back to life. Now Julia, Frank's former lover, is faced with the challenge of feeding Frank numerous victims in order to complete the process. This sickening love story is rather difficult to believe, seeing how I feel that no human being on Earth would fall in love with something that looked the way that Frank did early in his resurrection, regardless of how much they loved him when he was alive. Neither Andrew Robinson as Larry or Claire Higgins as Julia were very convincing, although they both delivered much better performances than did Ashley Laurence, who comes forth with probably (HOPEfully) the worst performance of her forgettable career. This was obviously her movie acting debut, she made that clear in every forced and annoying sob that escaped her mouth. There is not much to be said about the story, acting, or even the direction (an area in which I expected more from Clive Barker, having read many of his books, despite the fact that this was his directorial debut), but Hellraiser is a horror film that is not soon to be forgotten. It deals with the very human issues of greed, indulgence, and even loyalty. However, this is not the type of film you watch if you want to learn a lesson in any of those areas. Because of that, Hellraiser works best as an all-out gory horror film, the kind of movie that you would watch with your buddies late at night just to have a good time. It is not a film for all tastes (despite its morbidly appealing cover), many people will surely dislike it. But anyone who is even remotely into scary movies should not miss it under any circumstance.",Hellraiser
60,jzappa,More Urbane and Interesting Than Other 1980s Horror Movies,8,28 October 2007,"Hellraiser may not be an incredible work of horror genius, but it certainly is one of the more inventive and engagingly dark and twisted horror films of the 1980s, when horror films were almost all dull, poorly made, recycled, and absurd. Hellraiser's themes include sadomasochism, in an intriguing concept of the slasher figure in the story, which is a Gothic- looking antique puzzle box that summons ruthless demons to victimize the person in possession of it by subjecting them to a world of debilitating eternal pain. It also involves a femme fatale on the level of a chiller that does not involve fantasy, played brilliantly in an extremely acute performance by beautiful Clare Higgins. There is the layer of plot surrounding her that inhabits late-thirties, early-forties married and adulterous life with her almost frustratingly naive and unsuspecting husband, which is invaded by the devilish embodied soul of her ex-lover, brutalized by the demons of the puzzle box. Finally, at the core of the story is the pivotal character, as her fill of screen time patiently awaits to the point where she is revealed to be so, and she is the teenage stepdaughter, played by Ashley Laurence, one of the sexiest actresses I have ever seen. Everything from her voluptuous body to her scream-bloody-murder portrayal of the stepdaughter makes me wonder why her career never went any higher than this.So yes, the movie is more urbane than the vast majority of other horror films in that decade. It's even set in England. It's interesting that no one has an English accent in England, according to this movie, but nevertheless the locale serves the film with a dark atmosphere of sophistication and antiquity, which suits a story that surrounds an age-old puzzle box. This feel of the movie that I speak of is interrupted, quite inexplicably by beer-drinking, dirty-T-shirt-wearing American furniture movers, which I didn't know they had in England.Hellraiser is quite an enormous entertainment despite its 1980s-style inconsistencies that I suppose it just couldn't help but have. It's especially enjoyable during autumn, mainly during Halloween time.",Hellraiser

It makes itself heard within the human confines of the psyche not only on the graphic level, but on the level of primordial man.This endeavor was awe-inspiring on the big screen, and still holds that quality on the small screen. I find that it tests the limits of fear.It takes you to the gross-out without triggering the gag reflex. It horrifies you, terrorizes you, if only you can believe.The portrayals are not Oscar-worthy, but neither is the subject matter.I can't imagine Hollywood, even at its most open minded state, ever considering a true horror as a contestant for one of their most prized awards. If they snubbed Tombstone, then Hellraiser never had a chance.*LOL* That having been said, the portrayals are realistic and reactionary, and seem to be genuine. That's about all you could hope for in a movie as low budget as this was.The story, on the other hand, is another...story. It is about the highest creative show we horror fans have seen in at least a generation. Hellraiser has new monsters, a new darkness, a new face, but more than that, it has a new feel. This is not Nightmare on Elm Street. The monsters are more creative. This is not Halloween. The dread is more tangible. This is not Friday the 13th. The story is more solid. This is not the Exorcist.

I mean, I've seen several of his movies including this one and Candyman(1992) which he co-wrote with director Bernard Rose.  Hellraiser has to also be one of the goriest horror movies to come out of the 80's.  The special effects here are horrific.  The scene where Frank comes out from underneath the floor is very gross and hard to watch.  The Cenobites, in my opinion, are the best part of the movie.  My favorites are Pinhead and The Chatterer.  The acting here isn't really all that good, especially from Andrew Robinson, whom I haven't seen in a really good movie since Dirty Harry(1971).  Hellraiser is definitely one of those movies where you either love it or you hate it.

71,drownnnsoda,"Twisted and Unique Horror Film, Unlike Anything I've Ever Seen.",9,3 March 2007,"""Hellraiser"" is a unique horror/thriller that has been hailed as a classic of the genre, and I think it deserves that title. The plot concerns an unfaithful wife, Julie (Clare Higgins), who is visited by the zombie of her husband, Larry's (Andrew Robinson) brother, Frank - a lustful man whom she had a love affair with before his death. Unfortunately, Frank has a connection with the Cenobites, a group of demons from hell that he escaped from and has been chased by ever since. Frank also holds a lamented puzzle box that can release them onto earth. Frank sends Julia to kill random men so he can gain more life , and she willfully does so. But when Kirsty (Ashley Laurence), Larry's daughter (and Frank's niece) realizes what is happening, she finds herself caught up in a bloody battle between the forces of good and evil, to try and save herself from the demons.One of the strangest horror films of the 1980s, ""Hellraiser"" is unlike any movie you've ever seen or likely will see. Written and directed by Clive Barker, who helmed the story that the 1992 classic ""Candyman"" was based on, brings a refreshing and genuinely frightening story to the screen. I can confidently say that the plot to this film is so much unlike any other I've yet to see, which makes it a very unique and pleasant surprise. The storyline takes a while to get going and builds up during the first 45 minutes or so, and then after that all hell breaks loose (literally) and things start to get really insane. Sex is a main theme in the plot, and has a strange connection with death, which is a consistent element in the story. It's a little strange but it works. To go along with the splendidly original story are some very memorable (and very spooky) scenes, and some unforgettable lines. The performances were good, everyone involved was above average I'd say. Nowhere near perfect but far from horrible. Ashley Laurence is the main heroine and she plays her debut role surprisingly well. Clare Higgins and Andrew Robinson are the estranged husband and wife, and are also very good. Doug Bradley plays his now-legendary role as the leader of the Cenobite demons, and was later crowned the name ""Pinhead"", which has become a notorious horror icon (along with the puzzle cube). His role is terrifying and he plays it with a cold, calm demeanor which adds to the villain's scariness. The makeup effects in this film were quite amazing, all of the demons are unique and very creepy looking. Another notable thing is the gore in the film. Most of the gore isn't a result of killings, but of transformations from rotting corpses, and the grisly monster/creatures from hell (oh, and let's not forget those hooks on chains!). The CGI effects are a little dated, but this wasn't a major problem. The movie ends in a satisfying way, leaving it open-ended for the many sequels that followed.Overall, ""Hellraiser"" is a weird and wonderful thriller that is perhaps one of the most original horror movies of the decade. Not only did it bring a breath of fresh air in the genre, but it spawned one of the most infamous horror villains of all time. Clive Barker is really an imaginary genius, seeing his works can easily verify that. I definitely recommended this movie to horror fans, it's one of those classic 'must-sees'. Granted, it's not a movie for everybody (some people may not enjoy it, and I suppose that's understandable), but it's a film that you've got to see it at least once. 9/10.",Hellraiser

Hellraiser is a visual feast of grotesque images, a haunting score, sadomasochism under the backdrop of a broken marriage, dysfunctional family and pure evil and debauchery via brother Frank in his search for ultimate pain and pleasure discovers a box that is a portal to Hell and the Cenobites. Andy Robinson gives his best onscreen performance since Dirty Harry and respected horror author Clive Barker made a brilliant and horrific trip to the darkest regions of experience. Pinhead and the rest of the Cenobites are instant horror icons and as such is a very influential and classic horror film that blew away a lot of really generic, by the numbers slasher films released in the mid/late 80's. Plus the film is absolutely crucial viewing for death metal fans as bands such as Suffocation, Baphomet and others have used Hellraiser as a source material for lyrics. Even Slayer has been influenced by these films, check out the lyrics to ""Spill The Blood"". Awesome film, perfect.",Hellraiser
76,Witchfinder-General-666,Hellish as Hell!,10,17 February 2009,"Some films epitomize the term 'Horror', and ""Hellraiser"" of 1987 is definitely one of these films. Clive Barker's most famous and most brilliant film is doubtlessly one of the most spine-chilling cinematic experiences one can have. Even if he had made nothing but this movie, ""Hellraiser"" would be sufficient to earn Clive Barker the title of an absolute master of Horror, as this terrifying cult film has everything one could possibly desire in Horror. The film is extremely creepy and genuinely scary and maintains a terrifying atmosphere from the beginning to the end, the plot is ingenious, the makeup and gore-effects are as gruesome as it gets, and the Cenobites, above all the iconic Pinhead, are some of the most frightening creatures in the history of Horror cinema.The film already begins ingeniously, when Frank (Sean Chapman) purchases a cube which serves as the key to the doorway to Hell. Years later, Frank's brother Larry (Andrew Robinson) and his wife Julia (Clare Higgins), who had an affair with the sardonic Frank, move into Frank's old house. When blood is spilled on the floor of the room in which Frank has performed the rite to enter hell, the gates of hell are re-opened, releasing Frank from the inferno. The horribly deformed Frank, who consists so far of flesh and bones only, needs blood in order to regain his old body, and he needs it fast, before the Cenobites, horrible demons, take notice of his escape from the torments of their bizarre, sadomasochistic hell...There is no doubt that ""Hellraiser"" is one of the most terrifying Horror films ever made. The torments and gore effects are gruesome as hell, and the great setting and superb cinematography only improve on the film's creepiness. The probably scariest aspect of the film however, are the characters (brilliantly brought to life with incredible makeup), as well as the ultra-demented storyline. The character of Frank, the hell-escapee, is sardonic enough, but it is the bizarre and genuinely frightening Cenobites who stand out as some of the chosen few scariest Horror-villains in the history of the genre. Especially their leader (Doug Bradley), who is commonly known as Pinhead (even though only credited as Lead Cenobite) epitomizes the term Horror - even if the 'Chattering Cenobite' arguably looks even more terrifying. Beautiful Ashley Laurence makes the most lovable character as Kirsty, Larry's daughter from a previous marriage. Even though the gore is not the most important aspect of Hellraiser, some of it has yet to find an equal. The torments of the Cenobites, which include hooks attached to chains that tear people apart, are just plain horrifying. ""Hellraiser"" is a masterpiece in all regards, one of the most frightening films ever made, and an absolute must-see for all Horror fans. 10/10",Hellraiser
77,TOMNEL,"Interesting premise, and neat creatures, and alright acting, but this thing never takes off.",5,28 October 2009,"If director/writer Clive Barker is known for anything, it's for making visually interesting films. His ideas for plots are unique and his out of the ordinary characters are way, way out of the ordinary. Visually this has some great looking elements, and the special effects are neat, and the actors all do a fine job, but this movie just doesn't have enough of anything to really take off. By the end, it feels a lot like a mediocre Nightmare on Elm Street sequel.Larry (Andrew Robinson) and Julia (Clare Higgins) are a married couple who have just moved into a new house, and Julia discovers something very strange about this place. After accidentally spilling blood on the floor of the attic, Frank, Julia's former lover, and half brother of Larry comes back to life (Sounding a bit soap opera-ish), but with no skin. He explains that a puzzle box he solved was actually a summoner of demon like creatures known as the Cenubites, and they tore his body apart and stole his soul. He needs Julia to provide blood so he can come back in full with skin. Meanwhile, Larry's daughter Kirsty (Ashley Laurence) has been snooping on her step-mother and eventually comes face to face with the demons that previously had control of her Uncle Frank. Chaos ensues.This movie has some great looking scenes. The fantasy characters, like the Cenubites, are all very imaginative and scary looking, minus a creature that moves awkwardly with the track visible. The original scene of Frank coming back from the dead is one of the most interesting transformations on screen, and the lighting is often perfect in this movie. Unfortunately, this movie's positives mostly end at the aesthetic pleasures, as most other elements of the film just aren't very good.The acting is the one positive that isn't completely visual. The acting is just fine, and the lead actors give professional and good performances. But the movie itself just still isn't very good. Throughout, the film just moves along mediocrely, and never really breaks any boundaries that make this a truly outstanding film, and even the make-up, which is good, is better in Barker's next film ""Nightbreed"". Throughout this movie feels like one of the Nightmare on Elm Street sequels. You never really know what's what and who's who, and what game's this universe goes by and it leads to a level of uncomfortability, which is probably what Barker was going for. It's not a fun watch. The movie keeps leading up to a lame climax, and then the downright bizarre ending comes off as dumb and hokey instead of really a neat way to end the film.This isn't a bad horror flick, but it's one that doesn't ever stand out. Throughout it's only slightly better than your average B-movie horror film, and it never picks up and takes off like it seems like it should. So despite fine performances, and interesting creatures, and maybe even some scares, this movie is just never good enough to earn the cult that follows the series.My rating: ** out of ****. 93 mins. R for sexuality, strong violence and gore and language.",Hellraiser
78,Jonny_Numb,Still one of the most innovative horror films around,7,16 March 2008,"What Clive Barker's directorial debut lacks in budget, it makes up for with sheer, unbridled imagination. ""Hellraiser"" celebrated its 20th anniversary last year, and it plays just as effectively now as it did in 1987. Not since George Romero used rural America as a playground for a flesh-eating zombie epidemic (in 1968's ""Night of the Living Dead"") has the familiar facades of our suburban landscape been ripped apart with such invasive ferocity. The crux of ""Hellraiser"" is the American Dream gone wrong: Larry Cotton (Andrew Robinson--""Dirty Harry"") and second wife Julia (Clare Higgins) move into an inherited house, where Larry's brother Frank (Sean Chapman) tinkered with a mysterious puzzle-box that unleashed a sadomasochistic group of beings called the Cenobites (led by Doug Bradley's iconic ""Pinhead""); Julia had an illicit affair with Frank, and when Larry spills his blood on the attic floor, it resurrects the grotesque, skinless brother. ""Hellraiser"" adheres to an internal logic (think David Lynch with less pretension) all its own, and is quite inviting in its own awkward displacement--the performances are a little off-center (especially in reaction scenes), which only adds to the unconventional tone of the plot. And Barker's own affinity for torturous imagery (including some spectacularly gruesome scenes of hooks piercing flesh) acts as an extreme contrast to the facade of ""normality"" that quickly disappears from the Cotton household (the attic room becomes a abattoir for Frank's bloody sustenance); and the Cenobites become the confirmation of the family's transgressions, waking proof of a reckoning, and shatter the illusion of a soul's safety in an afterlife (in the film's most chilling line, Pinhead proclaims his ability to tear a person's ""soul apart""). While some of the electronic special effects (and fashions) are pretty gnarly by today's standards, ""Hellraiser"" is fearless in what it does accomplish--a perversion of normalcy that does, indeed, ""raise hell."" A must-see for all horror fans.",Hellraiser
79,aidanratesmovies,"Very unique, but I can't help but feel somewhat dissapointed",6,13 October 2020,"Very unique, with a truly different point of view and stance on how to tell a horror tale, Hellraiser ultimately falls short due to its often tedious nature, and lack of a significant point. The performances aren't anything special for the most part, although Clare Higgins does try her best. Oliver Smith could also be quite good from time to time, but his character can just seem like an annoyance after a while, after doing nothing but the same thing the whole time. I enjoyed Doug Bradley as Hellraiser, or Lead Cenobite as he is also referred to in this film, as well as the performances and looks of the other monstourly creatures throughout- but none of them earn their fair share of screen time, thus begging the question, what was the point? Besides its tedious nature, the film can also feel a bit dull and emotionless at times. Its special effects are cool for the time, and can be quite thrilling to watch, besides maybe the final few scenes of course, but that was mainly due to a lack of any budget left, which I have to give them credit for. Its central story can be interesting enough, but it isn't enough to carry the film along for its whole runtime, and I just wish we were able to delve deeper into the central themes that made this film so interesting- that being Frank and Julia's relationship, and of course, the puzzle box. In the end, Hellraiser isn't a horrible film, it certainly has its moments, but it could have been a lot more.

80,robertemerald,Original idea done well,9,6 December 2019,"Hellraiser is brimming with clever ideas. It's not just the original story itself, but also many of the details that go into the movie. This makes for a truly interesting and engaging horror movie, even after all these years, and is a great credit to the team of that time. They took a huge risk and it paid off. The special effects are amazing, and very creepy, although toward the end some look a bit cheap these days. That wouldn't have been the case in 1987. Hellraiser is also a classic 1980's movie in terms of what people were wearing. It's worth a gander for that aspect. It's tense throughout, with some genuinely horrific characters, particularly the wife and brother. Hellraiser is genuinely a horror movie classic. At this point I've seen only two other Hellraiser movies (there are about nine of them), both of which were good, but each markedly different in approach to the original. Of course, good old Pinhead is there. With Hellraiser movies I've found it is best not to ascribe an opinion about the franchise just on the basis of having seen one. Certainly see this original version. It is well worth the ride, if only for the effects.",Hellraiser
81,Backlash007,"""Come to daddy.""",10,2 October 2001,"This truly is groundbreaking horror from the highly imaginative mind of one Clive Barker. Hellraiser is one the best horror films ever made, let alone to come out of the eighties. It proves that slasher flicks don't rule the horror screen. There are other, better movies in the genre. The Cenobites are outstanding. They completely steal the show. Pinhead (played by Doug Bradley, a name that would become synonymous with Hellraiser), Female, Chatterer, and Butterball are awesome in all their gory S&M glory. Someone once said that if you assembled all of the horror icons at a dinner table, Pinhead would be the only one using silverware. After watching this movie again, that seems to be a very true statement. Aside from the Cenobites, Frank is an extraordinary sight to behold. Bob Keen's effects team has outdone themselves. The entire world that Barker has created astounds me. He's really pushing the envelope here. The dark imagery and the concept of the Lament Configuration are incredible. Why aren't more original movies made? Today they all seem to rip off the same concepts. Hellraiser is a completely original eerie experience. It's one of the few films I can think of that was unique and has stayed unique after all these years. There are a lot of opinions about the sequels. Mine is stop after Hellraiser II as II is the end of the truly dark nature that these films have (although III is certainly a guilty pleasure). If you haven't yet, see this highly exceptional horror classic immediately. It is undoubtedly one of my all time favorites.",Hellraiser

Frank and Julie had a secret love affair, which still lingers in the back of her mind. But she is about to take a much bigger trip down memory lane when Frank comes back from the dead wanting to be with her again.

I am not a big horror fan, but this is one of the best horror films I have ever seen. It is rare that a horror movie is legitimately good or scary. This is not legitimately good, but it does a good job in putting scares into half of the people that watch it. The other half will think of it as a ""so bad, it's good"" movie. It is really cheesy with over-the-top gore and death scenes and over-acting. Luckily, it does not cross the line between fun and stupidity. Some of the monsters and special effects are funny. After a while of letting them soak in, you start to take them more seriously. The story of a magic box that unleashes demons sent to torture people is a good concept, as people believe real ouija boards really do unleash evil spirits. A playboy manages to escape the clutches after blood from his lover's husband drops on his remains, letting him slowly come back to life. The whole concept is very interesting, but as an 80s horror movie, you can't expect greatness.Like Friday the 13th and A Nightmare on Elm Street, the main killer kicks ass. Pinhead (played by Doug Bradley) does not make any kills (he lets his goons and death instruments do the work), but he is as scary as Jason and Freddy. Also like the two other movies mentioned, the style is 100% 80s. All that was missing was headbands, Michael Jackson, and Miami Vice. Other than that, you get the feel of the decade with the hair styles, general looks of people and general 80s film look. The general 80s film look is good, which is probably what sets it apart from the other movies.3/4",Hellraiser
86,p-stepien,Hell awoken,6,11 November 2009,"Clive Barker had a couple atrocious movies made in his name (Rawhead Rex, Underworld) and decides to end the carnage and try to bring one of his stories to life personally. This gave rise to the iconic Pinhead and made Clive Barker very much a household name (if he wasn't by then). Based on ""The Hellbound Heart"" the story had great potential, albeit putting any Clive Barker movie on the big screen is of high risk, as the poetry and literary flare of this writer is way ahead of any else in the genre.Clive Barker is to horror what Iain M. Banks is to sci-fi... an unhinged reservoir of invention, make-believe and limitless imagination with an astounding use of the language to boot. It always seem slightly awkward that such a talented writer delved in the horror genre, but he did...Personally I hold ""Hellraiser"" as Clive Barker's second biggest on-screen success closely following ""Candyman"", but the movie 20 years onwards still packs an immense punch and should be required watching.Frank Cotton (Sean Chapman) is in constant search of thrills and adventure. During one escapade he purchases a small cube from a dealer somewhere in the Moslem world. Unswayed by the consequences he opens the cube thus opening the gateway to pain inhabited by the Cenobites - by some held as devils, by other as angels...Some time later his brother Larry (Andrew Robinson) and his new wife Julia (Claire Higgins) move into the derelict house, where Frank was last alive. Larry's daughter Kirsty (Ashley Laurence) decides against living with her father and stepmother renting a room in town with her boyfriend. A chance accident at the house awakes the past and frees what remains of Frank from his prison...The greatest success of this movie is being gruesome while being tasteful at the same time. The gore is present and will make you cringe and despite the retro feel to the movie it is light years ahead of most modern horror films. Holds well despite the time passing by, albeit some special effects are in need of an emergency update (hence maybe the remake planned for 2011?). That said all the monsters themselves look just as good and impressive as ever and Pinhead really will make you want to run.The acting is nothing of note, but at the same time does not detract from the guilty watching pleasure. The movies main flaw (as with most screen adaptation of Barker's) is its lacking script, which goes awry somewhere in the last 30 minutes. The motivation of the Cenobites takes a hit by the lack of build-up and Barker really should have focused more effort on presenting the 'otherworlders' and what makes them tick. Some of the lines sold by Pinhead and his posse is just weak scriptwriting. More sinister and complex actions of the evil they represented would really benefit the movie. This movie really is more like a 'introduction' to the Cenobites, hence can't really be surprised several sequels were panned out in the subsequent years. Molding several of them together would really make one hell of a movie...",Hellraiser
87,breakdownthatfilm-blogspot-com,One of a kind horror film by Clive Barker,9,15 January 2013,"Horror novelist Clive Barker is known for making some outrageously gross stories. And after two unsuccessful short films, Barker decided to direct his first theatrical film. Little did he know that it would not only be his most memorable film to date, but it would also become very popular. However, what amazes me is just how effective each component of the whole movie is. It is truly one of the great masterpieces in the horror genre of its time.Hellraiser (1987) is a film adaptation of Clive Barker's self-written novel, The Hellbound Heart. The story is about a remarried man, Larry (Andrew Robinson) and his daughter, Kirsty (Ashley Laurence) being caught in a web of terror. Larry's new woman, Julia (Clare Higgins), happens to be a secret lover of her husband's brother, Frank (Sean Chapman). Frank is a sexually deprived man who bought a mystical puzzle box called the ""Lament Configuration"". When this puzzle is solved, it opens a dimensional portal to hell, where a group of terrifying individuals called the Cenobites, literally tear Frank's soul apart, limb from limb, layer by layer.To start off, all the actors do a great job portraying their characters. Robinson makes himself seem like the most humble farther a child could ask for. Higgins and Chapman show good chemistry on screen as well. Slowly over the running time, viewers will see the transition that takes over Higgins' character, as she goes from lonely, to shocked, to lustful. On the other hand, Sean Chapman as Frank gives a very good performance as the battered soul that he is. He too carries great lust for Julia and shows how desperate he is to have her again. It is amazing that Julia would even want to join him again!By far though, the character with the most guts in this whole film is Kirsty Cotton played by Ashley Laurence. For all the horror films that have been released, it is rare that audiences come across a strong female protagonist. For Laurence's first starring role, there's a lot of credit to be given to her for conveying her character so well. Not to mention the fact that Laurence is very attractive in this picture. And she's not a ""scream queen"" all the time either. Her brazenness by far surpasses many other female characters in other horror franchises. I did find her boyfriend to be rather unnecessary though. He didn't do anything the whole time during the film. He was always a step behind everyone else, so why bother even have him in the movie?What was definitely effective here were the atmosphere; credited to the music and the special effects used throughout the film which created hair-raising, skin crawling imagery. The musical score provided by composer Christopher Young did an outstanding job. Not only was his score creepy and engrossing but it also created a sense of tragedy. The tragedy was cued by the constant waltz time each tune had. Adding to that is Young's constant theme that the audience is reminded of when the camera is focused on the Frank and Julia. A memorable tune indeed.Lastly, the special effects is one the components prominently noted in Clive Barker's Hellraiser franchise. There is some stop motion animation but the real movie magic lies in the make-up department headed by Geoffrey Portass. Everything from the gore, to the Frank's resurrection, to the Cenobite make-up themselves is executed terrifically. The Lead Cenobite played by Doug Bradley is done so well, many people would say he was born for that role, which I agree. I also liked the look of the other cenobites; The Female, The Chatterer and Butterball. I would've preferred though if The Lead Cenobite introduced them in the film. Some newcomers may be confused to what their names are.Along with these characters are some of the most disturbing imagery used throughout any film. Some of it really is just bloodcurdling. Tearing skin off a human body may not be some people's cup of tea. There was also another scene that I found quite eerie but it was never explained to what it meant. This scene involves Kirsty with a background noise of a baby crying. It definitely made me feel uncomfortable, which was good, but I wanted to understand the significance of it and it never was explained. Along with that flaw was Kirsty's useless boyfriend which leaves me liking the rest of this movie a lot.Clive Barker's first film is a classic that should not be passed up. The actors, special effects and music work together to create a tragic cohesive story that is a fresh look at the horror genre.",Hellraiser

Pinhead is a great horror character and pretty scary. The heroine of this movie, played by Ashley Laurence, is a Reagan-era version of the girl next door.

89,PredragReviews,"""Come to daddy!!!""",9,22 July 2016,"""Hellraiser"" is an extremely well made, mature movie that isn't for everyone, not even for every horror fan. There is no campy humor to it, no relief from the drama. It digs deep, and really brings to light just how ugly the world can be, and how cruel and senseless people can be, often under the spell of love.. Barker had never directed a film before, and went to the library to get a book about film-directing. The library had two books on the subject and both were checked out; he nearly had a heart-attack. Surprisingly he made an incredibly original film. The film explores several sadomasochistic themes and has become very popular among sadomasochists and body piercing artists. The most well-known character from the film was Pinhead (who was credited simply as 'Lead Cenobite'). Barker's original plan was for the focus of the film to be on the Lament Configuration and Frank. However, whenever audiences went to see the film, they would always come out saying, ""Hey, check out the guy with the pins in his head."" Most people who haven't seen the film mistakenly identify Pinhead as a typical horror franchise boogeyman like Freddy Krueger (Nightmare On Elm Street franchise) or Jason Voorhees (Friday The 13th franchise). Pinhead is actually on screen for no more than 5 minutes throughout the entire film. He is not truly evil either; he kills not indiscriminately, nor for vengeance. He kills because he was conjured from Hell by the opener of the puzzle box.Although many scenes occur elsewhere this feels much like a chamber thriller, claustrophobic-ally taking place mostly in the confines of the house. We, like Frank trapped in the attic-like spare room, feel isolated; trapped under a roof with a damned skinless man. The only impediment to Frank's freedom is Larry's daughter Kirsty (Warlock III), who learns the infernal power of the Puzzle Box and bargains with some demons to return Frank to Hell. These leather-clad, macabre demons are called Cenobites and they look like members of a devil-worshiping 80s metal band. They include Chatterbox, Butterball, Female and their leader Pinhead (Nightbreed). Their monster make-up work is off-putting and their silent demeanor only adds to their malevolence. Their words are few but direly chilling. The Puzzle Box leads us to the only special effects in the film that don't hold up well. While watching the Puzzle Box being solved is actually very simple (no significant FX involved really) and cool, the Box brings about some effects that resemble Atari-Tron video game lasers. However, the Box remains powerfully mysterious and it draws our ominous attention whenever it's on screen. Written and directed by Clive Barker, this film offers no shortage of gore to compliment the fantastic, effective story. Frank's victims are drained husks of pus and maggots, Frank himself is a horror to behold in his various phases of development, and then we still have other cruel visions, the twisted make-up of Pinhead and his fellow Cenobites, the Puzzle Box opening creepy gates to a somewhat ambiguous Hell, and Frank ultimately being torn apart by hooked chains in another iconic horror scene of the decade.Overall rating: 9 out of 10.",Hellraiser

Some surprising twists, good looking lighting and colour pallet reminded me of some old giallo films, like something Mario Bava, or Michele Soavi ( one of my favourites ) might have done.

92,Screen_Blitz,"Scary, spine-chilling forefeet, not for the squeamish",8,12 May 2016,"Director Clive Barker brings a clever feast with horror, fantasy, and sci-fi elements together in this surprisingly underrated 80s horror flick sparking pure originality. Hellraiser is a wild nightmarish ride that aims to send chills down your spine with intensifying scares and enough gore to turn those of the weak stomach away in a heart beat. Devoiding from the overbaked slasher genre clichés, this film introduces a serial killer born only by boundary- pushing imagination from the mind of Barker who also wrote the novel of the same name. The film follows Larry (played by Andrew Robinson) who moves from his stressful life in Brooklyn to a new house with his wife Julia (played by Clare Higgins) who Larry is unaware of her affair with his sex-thirsty brother Frank (played by Sean Chapman). When Frank acquires a mysterious cube, it transports into another dimension where he is killed by demons known as Cenobites lead by a diabolical monster named Pinhead. Upon moving furniture, Larry injured his hand which results in blood drips into the floorboards. The blood resurrects Frank from the dead in a deformed skeletal form. Upon discovering him, Julia is asked by Frank to perform a series of human sacrifices in attempt to rebuild his body to full human form. Matters only get worse however, when Larry's daughter Kristy (played by Ashley Laurence) gets a hold of the cube, unleashing the Cenobites into the human world.This film cruises out of the range of horror clichés slasher fans have come to expect. The main antagonist is no man disguised in a mask, wielding a bladed weapon, stalking drunk teenagers; but a flock of demons who pray on human blood when one tries to resurrect them from the pits of hell. And with wide scope of nightmarish imagery, creepy (though outdated) visual effects, and absurd amount of blood and gore; this horror fest grants viewers with a dark, spine-chilling roller coaster that rarely lets viewers rest. Whether it is the grotesque special effects, the eerie CGI monsters, or the images of the Cenobites, the film delivers on smart, jaw-dropping thrills many can ask for. Though not all the scares are effective as some scenes aim to shock and terrify while others are just loud, noisy, and cluttered with blood-curdling screams or absurd amount of blood and gore to make the sensitive ones sick to their stomach (though not quite on the level of Evil Dead); the film proves to have a true sense of eeriness and scare. Even if the film doesn't manage send tingles down your spines, the plot works surprisingly well for at least most of the time. The performances given by the cast are fine but don't always land in certain scenes. Clare Higgins certainly isn't someone who makes the most memorable horror heroine, or anti-hero in this case. Hellraiser is a scary, jaw dropping horror flick that sadly doesn't get all the attention it deserves. This film proves to be a smart and clever directorial effort by Clive Barker who makes a brilliant translation of his novel of the same name. This is a good recommendation for those looking for a scary good time but probably not for those who put up a good fight with blood and gore, because there is plenty of it here.",Hellraiser
93,btreakle,Hellraiser,7,2 December 2019,If you like Clive Barker then you must watch this film. He doesn't fail to disappoint and deliver a pretty good horror flick. Lots of blood and gore and sexual innuendo. I recommended,Hellraiser
94,gianmarcoronconi,Pinhead,8,13 August 2021,"A cult of its kind, this film introduces one of the scariest characters in cinema, but beyond that it doesn't scare much. In the end it is a good level splatter with a very particular texture.",Hellraiser
95,lambiepie-2,"Yes, I have a puzzle box! (Spoilers included!)",10,28 June 2003,"I am smitten.When this movie first came out I did not go to the movies to see it. The United States promotion of it really was awful. That was a big mistake. I fell in love with this film, and to me this is the best Clive Barker film to date.It is for mature adults. It has adult themes and adult situations, it it very suggestive (about S&M) and with that has a raw adult edge. This film is sharp, well written, engaging and yes, can be titilating for some.
""Hellraiser"" takes one of the oldest stories in the world and really gives it a more twisted kick in the ""keester"". No kiddie stuff here although subsequent Hellraiser films went 'commercial'. (Or as I call it now, the ""Pinhead"" franchise.)Horror fans will like this film. Mature Adults may like this film. It is full of gore, sex and indecision. Clive at his best, I say.
Make no mistake, this film is about family. Yes, family. A father who loves his daughter. He wants to marry a woman his daughter doesn't warm up to but fakes it for this woman makes her daddy happy. A man who loves another woman who was unfaithful on their wedding day with...his brother. A brother who has lived his life on the edge of perversion and found a way to experience of that as harsh as it would come to him...through hell and its feeders. He pays dearly for his cross into pain and pleasure but by accident is brought back by the blood of...his brother. And what does he do once he's ""back""...the same old things that sent him where he should have stayed in the first place! To come back, he re-seduces the wife of his brother by asking her to kill for him and with each kill..SHE glows for she is lusting for this man, her husband's brother, not knowing he's NOT the same! Brilliant story.This film is NOT for everyone, not for every horror fan either. But it is a well done, well paced, well written, a very adult horror film.
And yes, I have a puzzle box replica. Why? Because...curiosity kills the cat. And sometimes it can be one heck of a way to go.",Hellraiser
96,DunnDeeDaGreat,Horror classic,10,22 October 2002,Hellraiser is a film that I recall seeing when I was seven years old. Clive Barker was a rising talent in Hollywood and made a great first film. Ashley Laurencw( who early in her career looked like a low budget Heather Landekamp) gives a good performance as the films' heroine and Andrew Robinson is always good. The villains played by Sean Chapman and Claire Higgins give a shocking performance as the brother and wife of Robinson's charcter who had a tryst back in the day . But ther eal star of the film is Doug Bradley as Pinhead who used to haunt my dreams as a child and if I ever see the box I'll run.,Hellraiser
97,Stephen_A_Abell,It Will Tear Your Soul Apart...,7,7 March 2018,"Before Fifty Shades of Grey, there was One Shade of Cenobite... and it was blood red... and it spilt out beautifully.I have to say that besides Hitchcock's movies this is one decent story adaptation. This could be that the writer and the director are one in the same - the great Clive Barker. However, I think where this supercedes all the other writer cum director flicks out there is that each was a separate project. He wrote the story to be a story, not as a concept to behind making a movie. And, I think that is where most writer/directors fail... oh, I had a good idea for a film, quick write the script...So if you don't know the story yet, it's about the Cotton family. After being willed a house, Larry (Robinson) and Julia (Higgins) decide to check it out, with the possibility of moving in. Kirsty (Laurence), their daughter, plays the independence card and rents out a room in the town, instead of moving in. However, something isn't quite right in their new abode. Julia is having daydreams about her affair with Larry's brother Frank (Chapman), who is the black sheep of the family - and a sexual sadomasochist to boot. While moving in Larry cuts his hand. He rushes to Julia for help as he's hemophobic. His spilt blood soaks into the floor of the attic and starts Frank's rebirth... and hell will follow after...Another bonus for the film and the audience is that Barker is an all-round artist. He not only writes but paints and draws, and directs both movies and plays, which allows him to put his art and imagination into his work. This being his first film you begin to get an inkling of what this guy is capable of. In Hellraiser he plays with camera shots and angles, manipulates light to create atmosphere, he even gives us some realistic nightmare visions.The special effects, especially the ""wet-work"" and Franks rebirth in particular, still look good today and will send a shiver down your spine and make your stomach twitch. Though truthfully, the computer visuals are dated and now detract the viewer's attention from the film... I literally shook my head and cringed inwardly at how bad these now look. The thing is, I didn't like them originally, I thought they were nasty and cheap. They also appear to have been added after the fact as none of the actors even acknowledge the floating stars or the electric blue light (except for when it shocks them). It would be nice if somebody could remaster this like Star Trek (the original series) and Star Wars, just to update these tired looking CGI.The acting is okay, though at times the voices seem wrong. It feels and looks like Franks American voice was overdubbed a millisecond or two out of time and at a different pitch and volume than the others. There are a few scenes where this also happens with Kirsty and her boyfriend Steve (Hines). Though, if you've watched plenty of dubbed martial arts movies, like myself, it's not too much of a distraction.If you've not watched this film yet and you claim to be a horror or a dark fantasy fan then get yourselves a copy and enjoy... If you have a copy and not watched it for a while, dust it off and enjoy. There's a reason this became an instant horror classic on its release, it was different, innovative, and walked the tightrope of wickedness. Well worth a watch... again... and again... and again... until you hear the scratching in the walls and creak of timbers and the clunking of chains...",Hellraiser
98,gedikreverdi,He will tear your soul apart,7,18 August 2021,"The cenobites took Frank into the box to their torture and desire dungeon (it sounds too sexual but I think they couldn't be too explicit). When his brother Larry bled in the attic, he was reborn with that blood. His brother's wife Julia was in love with him and she was cheating her husband with his brother. She helped him form completely by killing people and feeding him. She started luring men into the house and was killing them with a hammer in the attic for her lover. Kirsty the stepdaughter saw her with a man in front of the house and stole the box from her uncle and got away. She summoned the cenobites and made a deal with them. She was going to give her uncle back to them and in return she wanted to be freed. Her uncle was wearing her father's skin. Larry's body was in the attic. Frank was caught and his new body was torn between chains and hooks. Kirsty and her boyfriend got out of the collapsing house. She threw the box on fire and a dragon came flying and took it. It started off really good with a cheating stepmother, a monster lover in the attic, a woman killing for love. Then it got more and more bizarre which was still fun but I'd like some explanations about those cenobites, about that Muslim country where the man bought the box and its origin. I'm sure the book contains more than what's in the film. It was very different than how I thought it'd be in a good way.",Hellraiser
99,suite92,Written and directed by Clive Barker; the best of the Hellraiser series.,8,28 February 2014,"Frank Cotton buys a puzzle cube in the Middle East from an East Asian man. This was nice and ominous. Later, in a private place of his choosing, Cotton manipulates the cube, opening it up, and gets a visitation that he may or may not have expected.We jump forward in time. A couple unlocks an 'old homestead' which has been empty for some interval, and has the associated musty smell. We're in the UK, and the people entering are Larry and Julia, a middle class white couple. It's been empty for close to a decade. Larry is Frank's brother; the house belonged to their mother. Larry supposed that Frank needed a place to hang out, or lie low, perhaps. There is a lot of twisted religious art left behind, which Larry intends to sell off.Larry and Julia have moved from Brooklyn (Larry is American) back to England, where Larry has landed a good job and Julia should be more at home. Larry suggests Kirsty have a look at the place. Julia seems to have reservations, and she finds pictures of her being intimate with Frank. Larry and Kirsty (Larry's daughter) talk on the phone. He's not happy about her getting a job; she's not happy about living with Dad and Julia.So, in 13 minutes, we've got all sorts of things that could go wrong. Demonic influences, marital infidelity, teen-aged rebelliousness, and a cuckolded husband who has been doing a slow-boil for who knows how long. Let's not forget rising damp, insect infestation, and other vermin leftover from Frank's stay in the house. Then there are the movers who are trying to hit on both Julia and Kirsty. Great moving day all around. Just to add some straight up pain, Larry cuts his hand badly while helping the movers. His fallen blood awakens something, to the notice of the viewers, but not the characters, who scoot off to hospital.Just to add to the mix, Frank shows up. Well, something that claims to be Frank, anyway. The hideous half-formed creature asks Julia to provide sacrifices so that his return can be complete. Larry's blood brought him just so far, but he needs more to make a full recovery to being the old Frank. Julia decides to provide 'Frank' what he wants.The rest of the film is about the rather harsh consequences of that decision.Does anyone survive? -----Scores------Cinematography: 7/10 Netflix showed this in 4:3 aspect, even though the film was recorded in 1.85; this always means visual content has been deleted. I hope to see this film again in its full aspect.Sound: 10/10 The music by Christopher Young was effective for engendering various atmospheric moods. The actors were miked well enough.Acting: 8/10 Quite liked the performances of Clare Higgins, Andrew Robinson, and Sean Chapman.Screenplay: 10/10 Great story telling. Manages to convey suspense and consequence as many modern films do not.SFX: 7/10 SFX from 1987 look a bit dated in 2014. However, the SFX still work well to convey the threat of the 'other' (the Cenobites) and hideous damage to the body.",Hellraiser
100,mentalcritic,Still tearing souls apart twenty years later...,8,26 August 2006,"The first time I saw Hellraiser was on a crummy VHS tape, I was about twelve years old, and I had more of an appreciation for violence or gruesome special effects than I did storytelling. If you had asked me then, I would have said that Hellraiser was a bore, a collection of great gore surrounded by seemingly interminable exposition. As a man, however, I am able to appreciate its subtlety. This does not mean Hellraiser is a great, brilliant film, but it does mean that it has a lot more merit than what Ebert gives it credit for. That said, just as I have said with countless other films, if you have only seen Hellraiser on VHS, you have not really seen it at all. This is one film where seeing the points at which steel enters flesh, or ink marks skin, is really appreciated. Anchor Bay have outdone themselves on the DVD, which is especially mesmerising to behold on a Plasma TV of a hundred and six centimetres. Stephen King was right. Clive Barker is the future of horror, with all the usual clichés and stupid devices nowhere to be seen.Based upon Barker's novella The Hellbound Heart, Hellraiser is a story of how far we will go in order to achieve satisfaction, and what it will cost us if we go too far. Unfortunately, the first error Clive makes is in the lack of detail he goes into regarding Frank's first encounter with the cenobites. Granted, he was limited to a very small budget, but The Hellbound Heart's description of the moment when Frank realises his grevious mistake is far more satsifying in the end. Not that the first images we see of the cenobites aren't satisfying in themselves. Barker's decision to join the opening sequences to the rest of the film with the classic image of Doug Bradley in full makeup resetting the box was one of the smartest made during the 1980s. As Frank is driving his sister-in-law to murder men so that he might rebuild himself, one perfectly understands his motivations for this truly despicable behaviour. And therein lies the true key to building a compelling antagonist. We are repelled by Frank because we know we might do the same in his position.Fortunately, Ashley Laurence gives us a protagonist we can like. During the opening scenes, we cannot see her as anything but an ordinary twenty-something girl. Towards the end of the film, we see an ordinary twenty-something girl who suddenly finds herself in a very messed-up situation. Her attempts to bargain with the cenobites are almost painful to watch, and for a good reason. She never breaks character, even in the most uncomfortable situations, which makes it all the more a shame that she only seemed to resurface for a sequel. Sean Chapman and Andrew Robinson round out the circle as the brothers around whom the novella revolved. While the good brother as Andrew portrays him is never quite developed enough to make one care about his fate, Sean develops Frank so well that one almost wishes he could escape the fate that he has brought upon himself. When Andrew suddenly takes the walk on his character's brother's wild side, such is the nuances of the acting on display that one immediately realises what has happened, and is even shocked by it in spite of how telegraphed it is.Which brings me to the real star of the film. Doug Bradley, a friend of Barker's from high school plays and the like if you listen to the audio commentary, was offered his choice of roles on the production. Had he not been offered the cenobite with the most lines, he has more or less said, he would have chosen the part played instead by Andrew Robinson. And that would have been a waste of such great talent. Where other film killers were either mute or too prone to mistaking themselves for comedians, Bradley gives us a monster who is so matter-of-fact. When he indulges in humour, it becomes refreshing due to how dry it is. You have to really be listening to him to get it, thus the film rewards the audience for paying attention. Bradley has since gone on to perform in a seemingly inordinate amount of sequels, including the masterful second episode, but he is never in finer form than is the case here. When he tells Ashley Laurence's character that he will tear her soul apart if she is trying to pull a fast one, the words ring in the memory like being told one has cancer.Special mention must be made of the various effects. Whilst the special visual effects, particularly at the end of the film, are strictly low-fi, the makeup effects throughout the rest of the film are so brilliant they make the film almost as much as the performances of Laurence, Chapman, Robinson, and Bradley. Sure, the pillar of wood with the chains and bodyparts nailed to it was a bit silly, but you will never notice it amidst all the suffering the rest of the film displays to us. When Andrew Robison improvised the line ""Jesus wept"", I just had to laugh. Take it from someone who has regularly suffered the psychological equivalent of what goes on in Hellraiser: Clive Barker really knows how to put his characters through pain. And that is the great advantage that the first two Hellraiser films have over those that have followed. The audience cares enough about the characters that what becomes of them is truly satisfying to watch. It could even be argued that everyone in the film, from Frank to Julia to the myriad of strangers, gets exactly what they deserve.For these reasons, I gave Hellraiser an eight out of ten. If nothing else, it is a great example of what can be done on the cheap.",Hellraiser
101,mattymatt4ever,Solid horror flick,7,21 April 2003,"For a long time I've been dying to get my hands on the original ""Hellraiser,"" and now that I finally did I was quite satisfied.  Though it's by no means a ""great"" film, it makes its mark in the beloved genre.  I can't say I was scared during any moment of the film, but I did find it disturbing.  The violence and gore is amazingly graphic, not just for its time.  Clive Barker definitely created some great visuals.  One of my minor criticisms deals with the story, which is good enough to hold my interest, but could've been a little richer.  And the characters are for the most part underdeveloped.  I understand horror films are more about entertainment than aesthetics, but I like to be able to connect with the characters in the story, so I can better feel their terror.  The acting ranges from good to awful.  Doug Bradley is outstanding as Pinhead, but he doesn't have much screen time, despite the fact that his face is plastered across the video cover.  But the performance that really stood out was by Claire Higgins, who is delightfully fiendish.  I always appreciate it when an actor treats a role in a horror movie in the same respect as that of a Shakesperean drama, and that was definitely the case with Bradley and Higgins--both brilliant English character actors.  The performances by Andrew Robinson and Ashley Laurence are uneven.  Laurence expresses sufficient terror with her facial expressions, and also happens to be very attractive, but some of her verbal outbursts are a little cheesy.  The actor who plays Ashley's boyfriend is extremely wooden and nearly lifeless, but luckily he only has a small role. Not surprisingly, Clive said in the commentary that he wasn't happy with his part.  And just as a side note, the commentary on the DVD is great and very enlightening, despite the fact that Clive's mumbling is sometimes hard to understand.  My score:  7 (out of 10)",Hellraiser
102,hnt_dnl,Nifty and unique 80s horror,8,30 October 2021,"HELLRAISER (1987) is probably one of the more original 80s horror pieces having aspects of the occult and supernatural rather than just being a cliche teen/young adult slasher flick. The story is very unique and involving as a man named Frank (Sean Chapman) pays a bunch of money for a mysterious magical box in the opening scene from some old Asian man in the Far East. Frank returns to the U. S. to his family's old home and unlocks the box which causes a gateway to Hell to open and rip him to shreds. He ends up inadvertently getting revived by the blood of his brother Larry (Andrew Robinson, who played the sniper Scorpio in the iconic first Dirty Harry film from 1971), who has just moved into the family's home with his British wife Julia (the alluring Clare Higgins), who had a secret affair with Frank prior to his disappearance. Larry also has a daughter Kirsty (Ashley Laurence) from his first marriage and Kirsty is very mistrusting of Julia.Hellraiser is a lewd, creepy, Gothic tale filled with sexual situations, atmosphere and dread. The music is operatic and sound design is fantastic. The dialogue is oddly hypnotic and scary as there are a lot of closeups on the characters and their voices are distinctly vocal. In particular Frank, the human and demon version, is actually played by 2 different actors and the actor who plays Demon Frank (Oliver Smith) does both voices. The plot involves the Demon Frank enlisting Julia to lure unsuspecting suitors to the attic so he can kill them and consume their blood to eventually revive himself to full human form. But Kirsty proves to be a monkey wrench in their plans as she herself catches onto it and inadvertently summons the infamous Satanic minion Pinhead and a couple of his cohorts from Hell.I would say my only complaint with the movie is that I find Kirsty rather annoying and the least interesting character, but I get why she was the focus as the 80s horror tended to reel in younger viewers, so Kirsty is low-key just another stock 80s ""final girl"" to woo in the young, hip crowd. I think the movie would have been more interesting without her character just focusing on the complex triangle of the older Larry-Julie-Frank, but it basically ends up a star vehicle for the rather bland Kirsty. But what are you going to do? Young sold at the time. Overall, Hellraiser is definitely one of the more intriguing and re-watchable 80s horror flicks.",Hellraiser
103,classicalsteve,The Horror Movie That Re-Made Horror,9,2 November 2006,"Clive Barker took horror to another level with his early novels and the movie ""Hellraiser"". Philosophically similar in some sense to the work of Anne Rice, Barker's rhetoric puts the horror inside of us, inside very human characters. Their flaws which in turn lead to their horrific outcomes are very human. This is a very different notion than most of the work of Stephen King who often portrays the common man going up against the dark forces like in The Stand, Salem's Lot, and IT. However, the closest works of King's to Barker's are probably Carrie and The Shining where the evil lurks not without but within.What lurks inside Frank Cotton is almost as terrifying as the cenobites he encounters. I only wish Barker had explored this aspect of Frank's character a bit further in the film, showing the lengths at which the character goes to obtain ""the pleasure box"".The original story, the short novel ""The Hellbound Heart"", speaks of Cotton's addiction to pleasure at all costs, going from town-to-town, country-to-country, continent-to-continent to satisfy his constant appetite. Whenever he finds pleasure, mostly through sex, he says ""It's never enough"". The theme of addiction is ever-present in the story. Frank hears rumors of a box that will open up another dimension in which inhabit a race of beings that know all about ultimate pleasure. When Frank finally acquires and opens the puzzle box after having gone over many lands and seas to find the box and relinquishing a small fortune to obtain it, he is terribly disappointed. The creatures an altogether different definition of pleasure, one which is summoned by opening Les Marchand's Box, the so-called cenobites, have inextricably linked to pain and suffering. The excruciating pain then followed by an end to the pain is what makes ""the pleasure so sweet."" The cenobites cobble up Frank from his bedroom and take him to a horror-filled alternate dimension.The wife of Frank's brother, Claire, wants to re-experience the wonderful sex she had with Frank.They had a brief affair before she married his brother, Larry (Rory in the novel), who is opposite in almost every way to Frank. Larry has repressed sexuality and a revulsion to blood.Through a freak accident in which Larry's blood spills onto the floor of the bedroom, the same place that Frank had opened the puzzle-box, part of Frank begins to reemerge, the bedroom giving birth, and the blood being a doorway for Frank. Claire discovers him and agrees to give him more blood to bring him back. Claire becomes the other monster of the story as she brings victims to the half-made Frank who uses their blood to become ""whole"" again after the cenobites un-sewed him the first time around. Frank's addiction led him to his original ripping and Claire's addiction to Frank leads to her horrific actions.A much more disturbing and darker look at human nature. Some have called Clive Barker the writer of cerebral horror.",Hellraiser

Ashley Laurence is the teenager who discovers the viscous secrets that the house and puzzle have to offer. I must admit that I read the novel after watching this (Years later), only because I don't read as much as I should. I know i've read more books than most my age, however I just never got around to reading Clive Barker's original work until way after I had seen the movie. I however really enjoyed the movie, it's gory and very surreal. That isn't even describing how demented and mean spirited it is. I remember seeing this in a crowded theater when I was 16, it was always interesting to watch gory stuff in a suburbanized theater because people often times walked out and many people walked out with pale faces. It's an experience I remember due to the fact that my usual experiences with city theaters had people walking out as if nothing happened, I saw Ten To Midnight in my local Chicago theater and nobody was phased. At the time Hellraiser was the new standard in gore and it took just one year to be outdone. (It's equally enjoyable sequel) and so forth, I don't think you'll ever see a more skin crawling film. This is not for those who find hooks getting ripped into flesh hard to stomach. For me and to this day I find this great macabre entertainment.

There is one complain though that I have, except those stupid commercials on TV f..king up the film and the feel. It seems the movie is cut, or how does the stepmother end up lying in bed with the cube?????????? Explanations please.

107,ivo-cobra8,"Clive Barker's classic best Hellraiser slasher horror flick of the 80's, a True Masterpiece!",10,19 March 2016,"Hellraiser (1987) is Clive Barker's cult classic best horror slasher flick in the series from the 80's. My favorite film will be definitely this one. It is my number 1 favorite film in the Hellraiser franchise. A Nightmare on Elm Street (1984) is my favorite horror slasher flick, but Hellraiser is not behind him, is definitely my second favorite horror film in the horror slasher genre. This film is very scary and I seriously love the main heroine Kirsty Cotton (Ashley Laurence). I love her character for been such a decent human being, who found out about her father been in great danger and what her step mother is doing with her uncle behind her back. This flick was released the same year that A Nightmare on Elm Street 3: Dream Warriors come out (another horror film that I love). This horror awesome film is based on Clive Barker's novel The Hellbound Heart, which he also wrote a script for the film. I am not the biggest horror film fan like are other people, I definitely hate Halloween (1978) and the series franchise because I always have nightmares. But Hellraiser is different and it is similar too a Wes Craven's A Nightmare on Elm Street (1984), which both of the genre are decent. I read somewhere that Clive Barker and Ashley Laurence don't want to talk about Hellraiser anymore and that is very sad. Doug Bradley's character Pinhead is a decent true horror icon that I love. I love Hellraiser to death and in the series franchise the first Hellraiser is my number 1 horror film.""You set me up, bitch!"" The plot about the film is simple, it is entertaining, fast paced not boring and goes really fast. It is well edited, the special effects are beautiful and acting is very decent. Andrew Robinson did an excellent job portraying his character Larry Cotton. I really love him in this movie. Andrew Robinson also portrayed Scorpio in Dirty Harry (1971) and he also played Detective Monte in Stallone's Cobra (1986) a year earlier, before he went to star in Hellraiser. Ashley Laurence is very beautiful, gorgeous and touching, smart intelligent horror heroine. Clare Higgins as Julia Cotton was awesome as the main villain, Sean Chapman as Frank the other villain was also great, but the most that I love in this film is Doug Bradley as Pinhead.In the opening scene we found a man who opens a puzzle box with portal of heaven and earth and the Cenobites pulls him and his soul in the hell and hooked chains emerge and tear him apart. Man and wife move into an old house and discover a hideous creature - the man's half-brother, who is also the woman's former lover - hiding upstairs. Having lost his earthly body to a trio of S&M demons, the Cenobites, an accident causes some of Larry's blood to spill on the attic floor, which somehow triggers Frank's resurrection. To complete his resurrection, he requires more blood which Julia provides while Kirsty discovers Frank's puzzle box which leads her to meet with the Cenobites. On the end of the film I turn's out in to a battle of fits, when Kirsty finds out that the Cenobites will not hold up to their deal, but they are double crossing her and they will tear her sole anyway apart. With the help of the puzzle box she fights for her life and her survival, while she defeats the Cenobites.I got yesterday this film on Blu-ray and I seriously wish, I would have watch this movie as a teen. Like I said this film is a cult classic is far way better than John Carpenter's Halloween and far way better than a dozen Texas Chain Saw Massacre films and way much better than any Friday the 13th movies. I will rather watch this films than those horror film I mentioned. I haven't saw all Hellraiser movies, I only got six movies on Blu-ray and this is the second time I have watch this movie.Hellraiser is a horror slasher classic, that is based on Clive Barker's book The Hellbound Heart. This movie is a cult classic and definitely one of the best movies ever made in a horror slasher genre from the 80's. I really wish there would be movies like this today, but sadly they aren't. Hellraiser get's a perfect 10 by me. I have enjoyed this film and I love it to death.",Hellraiser
108,eminkl,"Unless it's delivered with a smile, body horror isn't much my forte",3,14 December 2019,"When tongues aren't firmly in cheek a la ""The Evil Dead"" or ""Re-Animator,"" I couldn't care less about pounds of gore and goop being splattered about with unsightly griminess. Because the viewing of a film that gets its jollies from toying with its characters' bodily functions is already psychologically heavy enough as it is, important is a sense of humor that assures us that its maker is a cinephile with a dark vision and not a disturbed self-proclaimed artiste provided with a decent enough budget by a surprisingly willing studio. Not that I'm primed to call Clive Barker, the mastermind behind the ins-and-outs of the unpleasant ""Hellraiser,"" disturbed per se - that'd be insulting to his quote unquote array of talents. What I'd prefer to call him is a faux horror maestro with a bad habit of believing that horror and gore are synonymous. He presents his images of bodily destruction and moral incineration not with a side dish of dread nor with a sprinkling of tension but with flat detachment. Like the more grotesque works to come out of David Cronenberg's oeuvre, with images of ""Videodrome"" and ""Dead Ringers"" coming to mind, we leave ""Hellraiser"" feeling uncomfortable, dirty. This is an ugly film, devoid of emotion and human decency. Its special effects are magnificent, all convincing gobbledegook that make the right impressions. But aside from the proficiency of the art department, the film makes for a brutal experience, able to inspire depressed winces and blatant misery but not much else. How could it rouse anything else, anyway, if the movie follows an unhappily married woman's (Clare Higgins) sinful quest to complete the reincarnation of her undead lover (Sean Chapman) by killing innocents? There is more to the story, I suppose. That said undead lover got himself killed in the first place by purchasing an exotic puzzle box able to transport him into the underworld (which eventually becomes a major plot device), and that said unhappily married woman is currently married to her deceased boyfriend's brother (Andrew Robinson). But I'd rather not get into the details of ""Hellraiser"" because it'd do nothing besides force me to relive the torment I experienced during viewing. Unlike the thrill-seeking zeitgeist of most horror movies, the film flops around in a puddle of dejection and carnage, never to do anything besides arouse disgust. ""Hellraiser"" has ample opportunity to be something more than a dour mood piece - it could have fun with the introduction of its side antagonists, the Cenobites (a legendary bunch led by the instantaneously recognizable Pinhead), and it could use its gore as an exaggerative measure to complement the eccentric nightmarishness of its central conflict. But Barker seems to prefer static suffering to persuasive emotional manipulation, which might be fine for him and for the not-so faint of heart but not so much for anyone who craves pulse pounding fear in their horror movies. Because this is a behemoth of evil targeting the gag reflex more than the mind and the heart, I'm more inclined to recommend staying clear of its callous ways. Its protagonists are thinly sketched, its antagonists one-note in their maleficence. But if flesh ripping and blood spewing and concepts of never-ending trauma is up your alley, ""Hellraiser"" is more than likely a movie worth seeing. That just doesn't mean I have to like it for everything it somehow manages to do right.",Hellraiser
109,fernandoschiavi,"Hellraiser shows its qualities not through the narrative, but through the production it occupies, by showing the viewer a completely dark, macabre and terrifying atmosphere",7,14 August 2021,"First of all, Hellraiser has one of the best practical effects ever seen for the genre. Even better than 1982's The Otherworldly Enigma, a classic in this regard. Creative, the production of Barker himself used extreme sobriety in bringing his creatures and all the drawings of the human body. For those who don't know, Hellraiser brings to the spectator the Cenobites, races that for some are angels, for others demons. Explorers of the senses of pleasure and pain. Based on designs and wearing sadomasochistic clothes, these creatures snatch the souls of all those who unlock the secrets of the Configuration of Lamentations, an enigmatic box. And this rapture is done with many currents and a considerable dose of blood and viscera. The film like this doesn't make a point of diminishing the use of shocking elements, making it its kind of trademark.As much as it presents a creative script that seeks to innovate within the genre, it is essential to recognize that ""Hellraiser"" does not seek at any time to distance itself from its origins, actually making great use of the gore and forcibly violent roots. Thus, passages are built that honor the trash DNA of the horror of the 1980s, making this an equally pleasant experience for those who are used to the ""eschatology"" of the copies of the time and for those who are looking for something more authorial within this format. The creatures that present themselves have an extremely organic configuration, and even with little screen time, they are present in a completely dark atmosphere. Pinhead and his armies of cenobites, starring Doug Bradley, has such a grandiose grandeur that it is without doubt the high point and one of the best things Hellraiser could bring to the horror genre. Beside him, Frank Cotton's transfiguration after his apparent disappearance is both grotesque and fascinating. Without skin, makeup and plastic effects stand out over most of today's special effects. Thus, it's easy to say that Hellraiser imposes an atmosphere that both fascinates and unnerves, being unique. Get ready for a lot of profane moments, linked to sex, violence and all these issues, which were taken from the original novel itself.In addition to all the visual part of its effects and, of course, the presence of its villains it is also possible to highlight the Hellraiser soundtrack. While not terribly inspiring, she does like her peers. When the most haunting sounds begin, the viewer immediately finds himself in a danger zone. Of course, some of the special effects seen these days may seem dated, especially the laceration of the skin, but still, for the time and by the standards of yore, the feature marks the genre with an extremely cruel and bloodthirsty tongue. What is by no means dated is its ambiance and the plasticity of its creatures, with excellent use of light and shadows.The great success of Hellraiser is to win the audience over quickly by the climate of apprehension that has been created, especially when we understand the context that makes Julia willing to do heinous acts. Deftly, through flashbacks, the director shows the sexual involvement of his brothers-in-law, it seems, moments before her wedding ceremony. Frank is scrutinized as a wicked man, metaphorically nourished by the desire of others, an incurable hedonist who brings his ""victims"", in this case Julia, into an atmosphere as sensual as it is sinful. In fact, voluptuousness is openly treated as a power, whether for better or for worse, see the mischievous looks of employees at the young Julia Cotton (Clare Higgins) or even the later mention of the girl, in the midst of a banal flirtation situation, to the supposed frigidity of another character. The emblematic cenobites, in turn, have practices aligned with sadomasochism. Even their own clothing alludes to the trend.Still about sex, Julia uses her capacity for seduction in order to take male prey to her house, soon transformed into the body's lair, which regains human form as it feeds on the blood of the unwary. The residency in which everything takes place is an exemplary setting shaped by the art direction to heighten tension. Religious images, such as statues of Jesus Christ, for example, abound in the dark corridors of this environment filled with supposedly sanctified eyes, where lust develops brutally, in many ways. Hellraiser is constantly remembered for the singular figure of the Pinhead (Doug Bradley), the most striking cenobite, perhaps their leader, pale and with a skull encrusted with nails. Although they are different from each other, these monsters have characteristics in common, such as scars, piercings and mutilations. They bargain with the anguish of others, rejoicing in the borderline sensation. Despite the technical limitations of the time, everything becomes minimal given the intensity and care with the script and the creativity of Barker's insane mind.The production builds outstanding characters, whether they are highlighted by their evil or decency traits. Producing some of the best moments of the work, the main duo determines great changes in the typical killing, offering a fun balance between caricature and female protagonism. If Frank conquers through a grotesque and exaggerated behavior, leveraged mainly by the makeup work present around his figure, Julia ends up growing as an interesting antagonist, torn between the fear of continuing violence and the love she feels for the cursed man. Not enough, Barker complements this elevation of women in slashers - which, although not unprecedented, is here added with more layers - through the gratifying presence of Kirsty, a character who, through Ashley Laurence's captivating performance, transitions from the helpless girl to the only capable one to resolve the situation. Balanced in an enveloping dispute, two strong women on opposite sides of morality are thus presented.However, if it is interesting to observe this duality between the characters, proving that even in tranquility a remnant of malice can reign, as is the case with Julia, the story does not progress properly. The then newcomer Clive Barker to film situations was responsible for practically everything in the film. However, even though he is the person behind the identity, the story of Hellraiser still has an extremely truncated second act and a third that challenges some points of the viewer's disbelief. Certain points of duality, especially Julia's, are compelling, but her actors don't do it in a big way. In fact, most of them are presented in a stereotyped way, and the viewer already notices the expected ending for each one of them. Creating unnecessary secondary characters also only augments and floods a story if the need arises.Several decades after the premiere, it is impressive how this first Hellraiser retains its qualities as a genre work. The practical special effects and makeup are able to show the threats in their fullness. It's truly disgusting the scene of Frank 'reborn', his bones, muscles and viscera being rebuilt from the blood of others, with a significant amount of goo. This type of expedient brings personality to the film, in addition to making the sequences more graphically impactful. The cube that accesses the deformed beings is like the mythological Pandora's Box, as it contains the evils dumped on those who dare to open it. Frank finds damnation by going into experiences of purely carnal satisfaction. Within this logic of the cenobites, barbarism is a natural consequence of the insolence of fully achieving jouissance, a response to ""sin"". No wonder Pinhead and company became icons of horror cinema in the now distant 80's.In the end, Hellraiser shows its qualities not through the narrative, but through the production it occupies, by showing the viewer a completely dark, macabre and terrifying atmosphere of Hell and the Cenobites. Merging the profane with the saint, Clive Barker brings Pinhead as an icon of the horror genre, who unlike Jason and Freddy don't need to chase their victims, they are the ones who evoke him after discovering the secrets of the Lament Setting. The play of lights and shadows, the plastic quality of flesh and skin and the soundtrack are milestones and have become a reference of what would become a franchise. Bringing a creative story about the pain that troubled relationships can bring, ""Hellraiser"" innovates the genre it is part of and moves away from some of its clichés. With an eighties atmosphere and a great use of practical effects, however, the film does not show any shame in assuming itself as a slasher, thus bringing the efficient balance between novelty and trashy fun for which Clive Barker was so known.",Hellraiser
110,Vivekmaru45,Opening The Box Is A Gateway To Another Dimesion: HELL.,10,3 September 2010,"I am a die-hard horror fan. And Clive Barker to me represents the height of horror along with Stephen King and the undisputed master of the horror tale H.P.Lovecraft. Clive Barkers films have a freshness to them and are unlike anything I've seen before.I have also seen Candyman, Nightbreed, Lord of Illusions, Book Of Blood and the Midnight Meat Train, all of which are outstanding.But his true masterpiece is undoubtedly Hellraiser which spawned a long number of sequel films to it. The film is adapted from a story of his the Hellbound Heart.It is a story about Frank (played by Sean Chapman), a nihilist and selfish moral degenerate who has participated in every hedonistic pleasure, extreme experience and sexual perversion known to man, each time seeking a greater pleasure higher than the last. Jaded, Frank hears rumor of a mysterious puzzle box (Lemarchand's Configuration) which opens the gateway to a realm of unfathomable carnal pleasures. Frank tracks down the current owner of the box in Dusseldorf and obtains it through performing ""small favors"". Frank manages to solve the puzzle while squatting in the attic of his grandparents' house, where he has set up an elaborate display of flowers and a jug of his own urine. A gateway opens and appearing from it are the Cenobites, a race of distorted creatures who practice an extreme form of sadomasochism centered around agonizing torture and mutilation. They see little difference between extreme pleasure and extreme pain and drag Frank, willingly at first, into their extra-dimensional realm, where Frank begins what he realizes too late will be an eternity of torture.Frank's brother, Larry (played by Andrew Robinson), moves his family into the house inherited by him and Frank after their grandparents' death. Larry is married to Julia (played by Clare Higgins), who had a secret affair with Frank a week before her wedding and has ever since lusted for him while staying married to Larry for the financial support he provides. Due to an accident, several drops of Larry's blood land on the spot where Frank had ejaculated prior to being snatched into the Cenobites' realm. This allows Frank to contact the physical world, at first only as a whisper, then as an emaciated corpse. Julia, hoping to rekindle their affair, promises to help him.While Larry is at work, Julia begins picking up men whom she lures into the attic and sacrifices them to Frank, whose body becomes more substantial and whose consciousness more stable with every sacrifice. Kirsty (played by Ashley Laurence), Larry's niece, suspects that Julia is having a series of affairs and begins to trail her. After sneaking into the house, Kirsty has an altercation with Frank and ends up stealing his puzzle box, knowing only that Frank has some form of extreme attachment to it. After the fight, she collapses on the street. Upon awakening in hospital, she solves the puzzle box and the Cenobites come. She makes a deal with them, offering to deliver Frank back into their control to spare her. The Cenobites reluctantly accept. Their leader, a creature called Pinhead warning her that if she tricked them, they would ""tear her soul apart"".Kirsty leads the Cenobites to Frank, now wearing recently slain Larry's skin. Another altercation ensues, in which Julia is killed by Frank. The Cenobites wait until Frank reveals his true identity, then re-capture him and return with him to their own realm.The box is now open and Kirsty must find a way to close it before it is too late.Outstanding direction and script by Clive Barker. Thrilling music by legendary Christopher Young. Superb Cinematography Robin Vidgeon and creature effects by veteran special effects man Bob Keen. There are 3 more films to see after watching Hellraiser. They are in order: Hellbound: Hellraiser 2, Hellraiser 3, and Hellraiser 4: Bloodlines in which Pinhead is destroyed once and for all.There are 4 more sequels after the fourth installment but they are not as good as the original first four films,but are worth watching and owning if you want a complete collection. They are in order: Hellraiser: Inferno, Hellraiser: Hellseeker, Hellraiser: Deader, Hellraiser: Hellworld. Overall I give Hellraiser 10/10 for ORIGINALITY.",Hellraiser
111,BroadswordCallinDannyBoy,Campy fun,7,12 April 2006,"A man and his wife move into a London house in an idyllic neighborhood. Much to the woman's shock, up stairs in the attic, she finds a deformed demon who is looking for human sacrifices to complete his body. The kicker is that he is her husband's brother AND her former lover. Added to that, the man has some more powerful demons pursuing him after he cheated them out of a deal.This is one of those campy 1980s horror films that has become a cult classic. Others like Re-Animator and The Evil Dead are other examples. What makes this one interesting is that the original author, Clive Barker, is not only at the helm of this film version, but he also wrote the screenplay. It doesn't happen often and it is nice to see what can only be called ""the author's true vision on screen."" Well maybe, not fully true since the production was packed with limitation, many of which are apparent, but fans of gruesome horror should find this a very entertaining movie.There are some truly sickening scenes of unholy forms of torture to go along with the supernatural story line.

115,acidburn-10,It will tear your soul apart,8,30 May 2007,"Hellraiser is without a doubt something original, one part of the story we have human drama going on with a new family moving into a new house to start a new life, Julia the wicked stepmother would rather her husband's brother Frank than him and even killing for him, Kirsty the young daughter trying accept her new mother, Frank being selfish and selling his soul and Larry the father/husband being basically a good father and good husband and wanting everybody to get along not knowing what his wife is up to. The second part of the story we have bondage styled demons, a puzzle box which opens another dimension.Adultery, lust, murder, curiosity, pain and pleasure are the main dishes and even though the supernatural elements are presented very strongly, they never drown the core of what's going on. That's quite a feat, I still don't know how Barker pulled it off.Without a doubt, the strength of the film relies on Julia and Frank's relationship. It's when the film focuses on them and their actions that it is at its strongest. The subplot with the bug-eating vagrant also worked. He complements the film's weird aura and brings everything full circle. I also liked the role the Cenobites play in this flick. Their background players who are there to serve the story, not drive it. This story is about humans, not the history/past of blue demons. It works better this way.This film is definitely on top form the makers did a bang up job mixing elements of family life and demons from another world folded into one, and the gore is well and truly disgusting like skinless bodies, hammer hits to the head and heads ripped apart by hooks definitely not for ones with weak stomachs.The rest of the film is almost devoid of tension and the finale which is supposed to have you on the edge of your seat, betrays the first hour by going the light show way with some bad visuals (the vanquishing of the Cenobites, the hall demon).There are parts of this film that don't really make sense and Barker loses himself a bit in his over ambition and unfortunately the budget is not up for it.The acting in this movie ranges, (Andrew Robinson) Larry does fine as the husband/father really likable but not very interesting, Clare Higgins (Julia) plays the murderous bitch perfectly. Ashley Laurence is also really strong a perfect lead heroine and glad they bought her back for the sequel. Sean Chapman (Frank) was simply average and Kirsty's boyfriend not very interesting at all and rather pointless and wooden.The film is slick and a strong narrative and doesn't shy away from anything.All in all Hellraiser may not be tasteful, a lot of people will find this film simply unsettling, but if you're in a mood for something different then i'd recommend this.",Hellraiser
116,Darkside-Reviewer,Pleasure in the pain and pain in the pleasure,8,28 November 2019,Hellraiser is a unique horror movie from the twisted mind of Clive Barker first released in 1987 this controversial movie shocked audiences with it's gore and body horror effects and it's unique representation of an almost perverse hell summoned with an artifact puzzlebox by those seeking pleasure beyond limits but what they summon can be hell for some and heaven for others and the bringers of this pleasure can be angels in devils skins or simply torturers who delight in suffering it all depends on the persons unique point of view of pain pleasure heaven and hell this creative and smart concept shocked a lot of viewers showing disturbing scenes and ideas such as men without skin demons who derive pleasure from the torture of others and themselves which involves hooks and chains ripping and tearing flesh apart along with there very soul.I recommend this movie if you enjoy horror movies that are filled with blood gore body horror terrifying demons and a unique story that makes you think and is disturbing at the same time.I wouldn't recommend watching this movie if you are easily scared or have a weak stomach as it is one of the more graphic and disturbing horror movies.,Hellraiser

118,innocuous,What more can be said?,8,22 January 2005,"There has been much debate over this movie. As I've said elsewhere, the movies I find to be worthwhile viewing experiences are those that receive reviews at both extreme ends of the spectrum. Movies like ""Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind"" receive nearly 100% positive reviews and I find them to be sorely lacking in imagination and execution. Movies with uniformly poor reviews are generally very genuinely bad. ""Hellraiser"", on the other hand, is a phenomenal accomplishment for a low-budget B-movie.Personally, I do not find this movie to be particularly gory. There are a few strong scenes, but the more unsettling parts of the movie involve no bloodshed at all. This includes Julia's betrayal of her soon-to-be husband.The trend in horror movies at the time that this was released was towards more ""realistic"" villains, usually the guy next door who was a little whacked. ""Hellraiser"" was prepared to introduce evil in a completely different form. Several reviewers have commented on how they have been confused about what exactly is happening in this movie. I find that puzzling, since the circumstances (and most of the ""Hellraiser"" mythos) is spelled out quite plainly in this first movie of the series.In general, the special effects are pretty cheesy, but the Cenobites are depicted very well. The images really stick in your mind. I have a replica of the LeMarchand puzzle box on my desk and I don't believe anyone has ever picked it up and asked me what it is.

Part 3, 4, and 8 are 3 star movies. Part 4 is a 4 star. Part 6 is pure garbage, and 1 star. I've seen part 2 many times and will watch again before leaving a feedback.I've seen the first many years ago, and rewatched it again last night. After watching subpar supposed sequels, now we are in the realm of a true B movie masterpiece. It is not perfect but it has got a lot going for it. I haven't read the original Clive Barker novel. But the story is solid. It starts with the purchase of the box and the opening, and the demons show up to tear apart Frank, the evil brother. Great start. We are then introduced to Franks brother, Larry, the good brother, and his new wife, Julia, moving into their parents old and disregarded home. Julia had a lustful affair with Frank, and she is bored with Larry. We are then introduced to Kirsty, Larry's daughter. Great characters so far, the family and the demons. Where it goes downhill with the characters is Kirsty's boyfriend, boring, unnecessary waste of time. We also get some scenes with a bum, who eats bugs and walks into fire, grabs the box, transforms into a winged demon and flies off. This did not work for me. The boyfriend and the bum scenes sucked. It would have been better to show a little more of Kirsty and some scenes of her dead mother and how that related to all the evil we're seeing here. All the actors did fine work. Julia was the best.The music was great, not overbearing, but fit perfectly with the film. The sequels failed in part because their music was competent, but not great. The cinematography was also very good. The editing built tension. The fx and makeup were great. When we see the demons for the first time, we see the female demon walk in profile, the we see Pinhead casually playing with the torn face of Frank, no dialogue here and it's a brief scene. But it's in the beginning and we are left wanting more. We get it. The dialogue at the hospital with Kirsty and with Pinhead and the female demon is great.The ending was good. But not great. I didn't like the boyfriend character or acting. This guy was a complete distraction. Then we get this deformed puppet ""Engineer"" monster thing. This thing was a joke. And the bug eating bum that walks into the fire to grab the box, transforms into a flying demon and takes off. Not good.So, this to me is a great B, B horror movie. It is not perfect. My preference, if they removed the above mentioned garbage and added Kristy's mom's death or some more back story on that, and some more demon's torturing Frank, maybe a little more back story on the box and the demons, this would have been a great A, B movie. Another positive with this is there is virtually no stupid comedy joke one liners like we find in most commercial releases.This is a great effort. But after discovering Lucia Fulci, it looks like this would have been a great candidate for Clive Barker to hire Fulci as director. Hellraiser is a great movie, and it has some atmosphere. I believe Fulci would have had atmosphere all over this movie.Rating is a B, for a great B movie. 7 stars. IMDb users have it right on this one.",Hellraiser

When some of the Hellraiser movies literally started as something else and were rewritten as Hellraiser movies you know you're asking for trouble. But we don't find that here. We have a good horror movie from the mind of Clive Barker. The story is pretty generic or at least it starts that way. A woman and her husband move into the house that was owned by his brother. The same brother that she had been having an affair with. But he disappeared under mysterious circumstances and this is her husband's attempt to repair his crumbling marriage. This is not really looking up for him.A drop of spilled blood in the attic resurrects the brother who shows up as a skinless and bloody corpse. The wife, who still loves the brother, finds him and agrees to harvest some blood so that he can come back completely to life. She does, he's restored and we're introduced to the Lament Configuration. It's a puzzle box. One that when you open it summons the Cenobites who will introduce you to a new world of carnal pleasures. Pleasures like getting ripped up by hooks and chains and having your body modified in unpleasant ways. Their reasoning is they no longer feel the difference between pleasure and pain and are simply seeking new experiences and want to share them.It's an interesting idea in which the Cenobites are not so much evil as just beyond our understanding. There's plenty of blood, quite a bit of gore and just enough menace from Pinhead, the lead Cenobite, to instill actual fear.It's a good example of what a horror movie can be without getting too caught up in just throwing blood and guts at the audience for an hour and a half and the occasional jump scare. The makers of horror movies should take note.",Hellraiser
125,drewnes,"""We have such sights to show you!""",9,30 May 2021,"What a fantastic horror film. I watched this as a kid and was mortified yet curious about things it showed me. I guess it is what got me into horror movies. I rewatch it every once in a while and this time, it was no different: I still love it. Practical effects will always win my heart over, especially when they are gruesome. I only deduct half a star because some acting is cringy, but hey, it was the 80's!",Hellraiser
126,baileycrawly,"""I Have Such Sights to Show You""",8,3 March 2020,"Hellraiser was a pretty fantastic horror movie for its time. Not only was it sourced from a truly unique novella (written by Clive Barker, who was also the writer and director on this project), but it featured some practical effects that, while nothing more than simple, campy fun today, were groundbreaking in its time. Even now, watching the film back in a modern lens, some of the things Clive and his team show you in this film are truly fascinating.
Hellraiser tells the story of Frank, who gets his hands on the Lament Configuration, opening a portal to hell where he must join the cenobites for an eternity of torture and pleasure.
Although he was never intended to be a main character in the series, Doug Bradley's Lead Cenobite (at this point NOT officially named Pinhead) is a captivating performance from a man who undoubtedly has a commanding stage presence, appearing only for a few minutes on-screen but leaving a memorable enough impact to not only upstage all of his co-stars, but to earn real estate on every Hellraiser film's covers and posters, as well as cementing himself in the hearts and minds of not just Hellraiser and Clive Barker fans, but the horror community in general. Even if an individual has never seen or heard of the Hellraiser franchise, they know who Pinhead is.
Despite its campy, low-budget feel, Hellraiser is a standout contender in the horror universe. It's an idea that required someone with the fearlessness of Clive Barker to explore, and something that worked surprisingly well on screen. It's also a relatively faithful adaptation of the novella, which is also a rarity. This film is a prime example of making the most out of a small budget, finding budgetary means to achieve the effects needed to tell the story the director wanted to tell. And, in that regard, Clive Barker succeeded just as much with this film as he did with his original novella.",Hellraiser
127,dfle3,"High marks for being genuinely scary, if horrifically gory at times",9,19 June 2008,"To be facetious, this is the story of the proto-Rubik's Cube which was never mass-produced due to safety concerns and legal issues. It was designed to add weight to pleas by the owner for others not to play with their Rubik's Cube when they were out of the room. The Rubik's Cube which was actually manufactured had no such dire consequences for unauthorised people playing with your toy.Similary, one could also see this movie as a cautionary tale for children who insist on playing with their gran's knitting set despite her expressly forbidding them to do so. Just see what happens when gran catches you!When I saw this in the cinema years ago it was a genuinely frightening movie-a Hellish voyage into fear and dread. Hence the high rating.There are strong horror images in this movie-it's like a human abattoir at times, and the scenes of what happens when someone plays with the Rubik's Cube (when they've bloody well been told not to!) are quite confronting at times too.The strength of this movie is the scenario it evokes and the creatures/barely human things which populate this Hell.If you've had nightmares in which monsters chase you, well, this could be more of the same, but better.If you haven't had nightmares in which monsters chase you...sweet dreams...while you can! There have been a slew of sequels to this movie. I've seen the second one, and if not the one after, then the one which was supposed to wrap up this franchise. Within the last year I could have sworn I saw a poster in a video shop for yet another sequel. Can't really be stuffed watching any more of them.The first in this series is highly recommended by me but none of the others, really-the ones I've seen that is.Based on a story by Clive Barker, who has a solid reputation for the horror genre and who has expanded into video games recently (Jericho).Some other horror movies I recommend or have reviewed here: Halloween (original version) The Exorcist Evil Dead II In the mouth of madness The Shining",Hellraiser

I can think of ten other films that are scarier than this one and I really didn't think *they* were scary to begin with. Well, they are [scary] compared to this film. Clive Barker has written a very original horror film script, but it does come too close to the ridiculous most of the time. I wasn't scared for a second even though I did laugh a lot. However, two of the cenobites -- Pinhead and the female one -- were rather unpleasant because they were so solemn. Otherwise nah, nothing that I can recommend. This film can't possibly scare horror film fans *or* people who don't watch many horror films, so I really don't know who ""Hellraiser"" was made for.

It's the type of horror that relies heavily on showing you blood and disgusting things, hoping it will scare you. Well, it doesn't... I can't say it's all bad, and I can notice some of the uncomfortable feeling and tension in a few scenes.... But, mehhh... Movie is OK at best... It cannot stand shoulder to shoulder with ""Nightmare on Elm Street"", ""Halloween"", ""Friday the 13th"" etc. And don't even start with cenobites. These guys are such cringe.

The surround is occasionally excellent but mostly unnoticeable. Sound is solid but not outstanding. This is the most creative amazing Hell-related horror ever. Not as scary as The Exorcist (1973) but it is more fun. The concept is fantastic and the execution is brilliant. The follow-up takes the concept further but subsequent sequels basically go to hell. I love this film! It is a brilliant ride that is perfectly paced with lots of hellish moments. The bit in the hospital still haunts me today. Something far more terrible than life could imagine. I love the progression, the anticipation and the hell demons. This has to be the best movie from hell. It is creepy, scary and one hellish ride!",Hellraiser
132,domino1003,The Original is Still The Best,9,6 June 2005,"Ah, the 80's were a magical period for me. Fresh out of high school and over 18, I can see any film I wanted without parental guidance. The horror genre was at it's peak. Filmmakers were finding new ways to gross out the audience. Novelist Clive Barker directed one of the most disturbing horror films around, ""Hellraiser."" Disturbing not for its gross out scenes, but for it's subject matter.Larry and Julia Cotton (Andrew Robinson and Clare Higgins)move into an old house once occupied by Larry's deadbeat brother, Frank. They appear the happy couple, but are far from it. Julia is an ice queen, and only one man thawed her out:Frank. Her and Frank had an affair many years back and she still wishes to be with him. She gets her wish in spades when Frank returns, although not looking too good.Seems that Frank likes to dabble into REALLY dark things. His hobby led him to a mysterious puzzle box. As they say, curiosity killed the cat. In this case, Frank's curiosity literally gets him hooked and skinned, sending him to the depths of hell, where the creatures called the Cenobites (The leader who will be forever known as Pinhead for obvious reasons)delight in bringing pain and pleasure to those who call them. Frank manages to escape, brought back by the blood of his brother (Due to an accident while moving). Unfortunately, not all of him is back. Frank appears to Julia and tells her that they can be together if she helps him. This would require bringing Frank human sacrifices that he can drain.2 things put a dent in their plans: Larry's daughter, Kirsty (Ashley Laurence), who grows suspicious of Julia's behavior, and the Cenobites, who are none too pleased at Frank's escape.There is A LOT of blood and gore in the film, but the underlying theme of necrophilia is even MORE disturbing than the gore. After all, Julia is doing all of this to be with her dead lover (And notice what she does when she's with skinned Frank. CREEPY!).But it's the Cenobites that steal the show, especially Pinhead (Doug Bradley, in a role that has gained a huge cult following). They REALLY enjoy their job!There has been many sequels to this film (All of them featuring Pinhead), but the first is still the best of the bunch.",Hellraiser
133,Rautus,Clive Barker's classic,10,25 February 2007,"Clive Barker is a horror mastermind with Salome, the Forbidden, Nightbreed.Hellraiser is one of Clive's masterpieces, the plot is original with a Box called the Lament Configuartion and once it's opened it will take you beyond the limits with pleasure and pain. The Cenobites are creatures that live in the Inferno (The labyrinth inside the box) and love pain.They rip people's flesh with hooks attached to chains, the plot sees a man named Frank who has opened the box and is torn apart by the Cenobites. His soul is trapped within the walls of the Box until when his brother Larry and his Wife Julia move in to the house.Juila has had an affair with Frank and is still obsessed with him, so when they move the bed up the stairs Larry cuts his hand on a nail. His daughter Kirsty tries to talk with her step-mother Juila but she's too busy remembering Frank.So Larry enters the attic where Juila is and spills his blood on the floorboards and as they go out to get stitches for his hand the blood seeps into the floor resurrecting Frank since he was killed there.Frank then needs Juila to bring men to the attic and kill them so he can drain their blood putting more flesh in his bones making him look human again before the Cenobites discover that he has escaped from their world.It's not long before Kirsty runs into Frank but escapes with the Box and solves it causing the Cenobites to find her, but she makes a deal with them. If she brings Frank to them then they can't have her flesh.Meanwhile at the house Frank kills Larry and wears his face to look like him. After Kirsty discovers this she runs into the attic and Frank gives out who he is causing the Cenobites to come and tear him apart.But the Cenobites want her too so she gets the Box and closes it causing them to return to the Inferno.Hellraiser is a great horror classic that introduced one of the greatest horror icons.

134,blackmamba99971,The best of Clive Barker,10,26 April 2010,"Quite possibly, the most classic film from Clive Barker. A movie about lust, desire, deceit, pleasures, and pain. All rolled into a puzzle box, which opens a doorway to your most inner desire or frightening nightmares. On one end, is Julie, a bored housewife who had a premarital interlude with her grooms brother frank. And frank, who is not satisfied with a simple sin, instead solves the puzzle box which transports him to the Cenobites dimension. But through this, Kirsty the daughter of Julie's husband begins to see mounting signs that something is wrong, out of place and intends to find the answer. And in doing so, makes a deal with the Cenobites to let her go if she leads them to frank who escaped from their grasp. But as all deals go, not everyone keeps their end of the bargain. As with Pinhead and his little entourage of minions, they try to take Kirsti with them but her quick fingers and fast movements help close the doorway using the box. This was a fascinating film using all manners of emotions, evil or not. But to see the most famous Cenobite who used to be a British officer turn Pinhead, is always glorious. His tone of soothsaying his guests run chills down anyone's spine. A favourite of evil beings in the world of horror. Making this section of genre the most successful movies to date including sequels.",Hellraiser
135,SkullScreamerReturns,Gruesome but also classy hair-riser,8,30 August 2020,"The endless Hellraiser sequels made me almost forget how good the original is. If you're someone who has only seen some of those latter installments, do yourself a favor and see this original.When making a movie based on a novel, it's always a good starting point if the author is involved in the process. But then there is the risk that not all writers are natural born directors. With Hellraiser, Clive Barker proves that he is capable of delivering his vision to the screen. Well, I haven't read the book, but I see a well made film, with good looking directing.There's something special about the overall style of this film. Right from the beginning the music (by Christopher Young) gives an impression of quality. The stylish orchestral music tells you that you're not watching any trash cinema - this is something more grandiose. Also the lighting in many scenes - silver earrings glimmering in hazy candlelight - gives an elegant atmosphere. Now, let's remember I'm talking about a gory monster movie...but I'd also call it a more stylish one in its genre.The real power of the story is the motives of the characters, and their reactions to what's happening. I especially like the two lead actresses' acting. Clare Higgins plays the wife who becomes a murderer but for an understandable reason. That's an interesting character and great acting. Ashley Laurence plays the step daughter who stumbles in the middle of the horror scenario. I like especially the scene when she walks in the street in shock because of what she's seen. Not often in horror movies do the characters react realistically like that.I get the feeling that there is potential for a great masterpiece of cinema but towards the end it isn't entirely reached, and what we get is ""just a horror film"". But still it's an above average horror film that deserves to be called an 80's classic. Very gory and distugsting, that is, but also emotional and maybe even an inch philosophical.Hellraiser is a strong film that feels like a hammer to the head. If that's what you like, then look no further!",Hellraiser

The Centibites are all major cool, Clive Barker has got to be the master of atmosphere without over doing the atmosphere. It has the right amount of creepy atmosphere and story substance, I do wish we got to see more of the Centibites in this one, but there are many sequels to see more of them in. But this is the one that started it all. The other Centibites, BUTTERBALL and CHATTERER are both major league cool. The cast does a great job and the dialog is creepy. The effects were major league impressive and all the creature effects are impressive, even the GATEKEEPER. I give HELLRAISER...8 STARS",Hellraiser
137,emperor_bender,Not just another boring slasher,8,25 January 2008,"When I first heard about this movie, I thought ""Oh great, another rival for Jason Voorhees, Freddy Krueger, Michael Myers, Candyman and Leatherface"". I could not have been more wrong. This movie was something new, something fresh. There was an actual storyline to the characters instead of the one-dimensional ones of most 80's and 90's slasher flicks. I actually got to know about Larry, Julia, Kirsty, and Frank Cotton. They were more like PEOPLE rather than fodder. Also, the villains were not all one-sided and all conspiring to kill the protagonists together, there were 2 different parties hunting the protagonists down. The whole deal with the Lament Configuration was original and fresh also, not many other movies have the same kind of background. The only bad thing was that the story seemed to run dry at times and things got a little tiresome, but don't let that stop you from watching this movie. I highly recommend it to 80's and 90's horror fans. 8/10",Hellraiser
138,Gafke,Unique and twisted,10,14 March 2004,"This is one of the sickest and most depraved horror films of its time, and I love every minute of it. Where other films had only touched on the barest suggestion of the link between sex and death, Hellraiser shoves that fact right in your face.Frank Cotton (who starts out the film as the main character) is a soulless man who lives only for life's pleasures. He will go to great lengths to satisfy his lusts, and thinks nothing of who he may be stepping on to get there. He is offered a small, strange puzzle box called The Lament Configuration by a strange man in what looks and sounds to be a Mid Eastern market. The box, he is promised, will open the gates to a world of pleasures that no mortal can possibly imagine. Frank takes the box, but he doesn't understand that the pleasures the box offers are to the demons who live within it. The Cenobites, sadomasochistic creatures who live eternally beyond the gates that the box can open and close, take great pleasure in ensnaring new human victims to toy with, imprisoning them forever in a labyrinth of pain and suffering. Frank disappears, and many months later, his brother and sister-in-law come to live in the abandoned home.The film then switches gears and gives us a new main character: Julia. Julia, the wife of Frank Cottons brother Larry, is a cold woman. Beautiful and immaculate, she is icy and distant and seems to derive no pleasure from anything, least of all her husband and his daughter from a previous marriage, Kirsty. Julia's only private joy are the memories she has of Frank, with whom she once had an affair. Frank seems to be the only man who was never intimidated by Julia, treating her roughly and breaking down her defenses. Little does Julia know that Frank never left the house; he is upstairs, in the attic, having escaped from the Cenobites and now biding his time until he can return to a world of flesh and blood. When Larry accidentally injures himself and bleeds on the floor of the attic, Frank is brought back, feeding on the fluid and slowly regenerating, growing back bones, muscle and skin. Julia soon discovers the terrible secret in the attic. After her initial shock and disgust, she agrees to help Frank, for whom she still lusts, and begins bringing him men she picks up in bars. She bludgeons them to death and Frank feeds on them, each one helping him in his regeneration.The film then switches points of view once more and Kirsty becomes the main character. Kirsty, who has never liked the pretentious, frigid Julia, becomes suspicious. Her suspicions are soon confirmed when she comes face to face with ""Uncle Frank"" and barely escapes his bloody clutches, the Lament Configuration in her hand. She accidentally opens it, and when the demons within, led by the now-famous Pinhead, threaten to take her back with them to their dimension, she makes a deal: she will lead them to Frank, and they can have him instead of her. From there on out, it is a countdown; will Kirsty find Frank in time? Can her father be saved from the adulterous couple plotting against him in his own house? Or will it be too late for all of them?This is another sex-equals-death film, but with a slightly updated feel. Julia is Bad; she cheats on her husband and likes her sex rough. Kirsty is Good, but she is no virgin, living with her boyfriend and eagerly engaging in premarital sex. Larry, a dull-as-paste husband who seems to genuinely love his wife but doesn't quite understand how to treat a woman, falls victim to his own blandness. He never sees what's coming because he possesses no imagination, no foresight; he is just the everyday, mundane man mowed under by his own unspectacular existence. Frank is the ultimate Bad; he is a user. He likes sadism, but not when it is turned on him. The Cenobites are the real reason this film was so successful; expressionless zombies in black leather and fetish wear. Led by the majestic Pinhead, they come into our world equipped with chains and hooks and all manner of painful devices, literally ripping their victims apart without batting an eye. They are what Frank wants to be, but Frank is not strong enough. He collapses beneath the weight of his own ego; he wants to think he is a god, but he is only an insect after all.This film received an X rating when it was first released, but seems pretty tame now. The gore effects are only a tad dated, but they're still quite shocking. I think the X rating might have been due more to the films unrelenting sadism than anything else. It's sick and remorseless, but that's not to say it's bad. It's innovative. Nothing like it had been seen up to that time, and it still remains an original. It never imitates; it's all fresh and frighteningly new and should be appreciated for that if nothing else. Followed by one pretty good sequel and a handful of really bad ones, this first installment remains the best. Should be seen at least once.",Hellraiser
139,skybrick736,Hellraiser (6/10),6,1 July 2016,"Hellraiser has an original, cool story with undoubtedly a massive fan base as far as individual horror films go, but it's a style that isn't of my acquired taste. Firstly, between the mom, dad and other members of the supporting cast, there are too many unlikeable characters. Only Kristy, played by Ashley Laurence, is someone who had redeeming qualities on screen. Along with character development they all have vague backstories and moments of disjointed dialogue. With a positive rating by audiences, the pros definitely outweigh the cons. We are introduced to one of the most brutal horror icons in Pinhead, who has a brilliantly designed look and ruthlessness about him. The use of special effects in the gore department are also superior to many films during this era. Hellraiser is one of the few horror film classics deemed by fans that I never really got enthusiastic about, however it's still a fine movie and one of a kind nonetheless.",Hellraiser

141,mwilson1976,An S&M inspired movie that proved to be one of the best horrors of the 80's,7,21 January 2020,"A Chinese puzzle box opens the gate to hell and unleashes extra-dimensional beings known as Cenobites upon the earth. They see themselves as explorers in the further regions of experience and grant sadomasochistic pleasures to those who call upon them, in this cinematic adaptation of Clive Barker's novella The Hellbound Heart which he directed himself after becoming dismayed at prior cinematic adaptations of his work. Arriving in a decade in which most movie monsters were monotonous slashers, the Cenobites were truly exciting, original, and unsettling characters (even though they are afforded very little screen time). Barker based them on his own experiences in S&M clubs particularly New York's Cellblock 28 where he watched people getting pierced for fun. Doug Bradley plays Pinhead, leader of the Cenobites and posterboy for the movie, but it is Clare Higgins as Julia who steals the show. She's a femme fatale and wicked stepmother, who picks up lonely guys in bars with the promise of sex, before murdering them to make her lover Frank who has escaped Hell whole again. Andrew Robinson from Dirty Harry plays her unlucky husband. The movie was funded by New World Pictures for $900,000 and went on to make $33m worldwide, spawning nine sequels, seven of which saw Bradley reprising his role. Barker originally wanted the electronic music group Coil to perform the music for the film, but on insistence from producers the film was re-scored by Christopher Young. Despite the American accents, the film was actually filmed in England and was beset with censorship problems meaning that a lot of the violence and S&M had to be shortened.",Hellraiser
142,bh_tafe3,A horror classic,8,6 December 2008,"There were a lot of horror films in the 1980s, some of them brilliant, some of them not, but there's none quite as good as this effort from Clive Barker.In Hellraiser we have the definitive horror movie for the time. All the staples are here: good special effects, nudity and sex scenes, evil being punished, haunted houses, scary montsers and a larger than life villain to terrorise people through VHS covers.But Hellraiser is also surprisingly well made, the scenes that are supposed to be disturbing are. The effect is not ruined by over done dialogue, inappropriate score or bad acting. As a matter of fact there is barely a scene in the film lacking the desired atmosphere of surreal dread.The story is simple enough. An unfaithful wife encounters the zombie of her dead lover, sans skin, who's being chased by demons after he escaped from Hell. He seeks to kill people in order to return to his full human form and escape hell's lackey's, the cenobites, led by the terrifying Pinhead.Doug Bradley, playing Pinhead as he would through countless sequels, brings a calm menace to the character in the very few scenes he is in. The fact that we rarely see Pinhead, and never for long periods, makes him all the more terrifying.The kills in this one are not creative or fun, they're simple and disturbing, but not so over the top as to make the film enjoyable.There is nudity, there are sex scenes and graphic violence, but this is the best example of 80s horror you will find.",Hellraiser
143,tankace,"Good for its time, classic , in my point of view just OK.",7,3 June 2016,"Hellraiser is a good body horror flick and I can understand why some people love it, but to be honest I though it had parts that were good and some that I either did not like much or dislike all together. I have my full conscience that some will dislike my review for that ,so just give me a minute to explain my why. To sum it up Hellraiser is a slasher horror of the eighties and nineties like A Nightmare on Elm Street, Friday the thirteenth , Child's Play , Halloween ( OK the first came out on 1978 but close enough for me) and Scream. This movies were a product of the violence in the streets back then between the gangs that sell drugs that ravaged USA and the fear of a home invasion became more real. This is my take on why these movies had their influence on one part. On the other had the technological evolution after the late seventies make the creation of creatures like Freddy and the Chenobites possible and lets be honest early adults love horror since ..,forever.So lets get started: LIKE:(1) The creatures designs every good (8,5/10) (2) The Chenobites are quit interesting both in appearance and ideals (9 /10)(3) The voice of Pinhead, epic!! (10/10)Now lets see the less excellent: DISLIKE: (1) Location of the movie takes place in a house ,which is far from the city, to cliché (6/10)(2) In some scenes it looked more like torture porn and it more disgusted me than scared me (4,4/10)(3) There is a homeless man in the movie ,who I can not understand what is his role ,for real someone explain me (6,5/10)(4) The character of Lary is an idiot (5,5/10)Total score of 7,15 out of 10 is a good movie if you are in to that and it is generally scary flick but was made in order to be relevant to its time and not in general. If you like good I just did not get it as you and do not be ashamed because of your interest ,trust me better say that you like a body horror movie than a political party I know from experience.",Hellraiser
144,jcbutthead86,"One Of The Greatest Horror Films Ever Made. An Excellent,Scary,Terrifying And Unforgettable Horror Classic From Clive Barker.",10,29 July 2015,"Hellraiser is one of the greatest Horror films ever made,an excellent,scary and unforgettable Horror classic that combines terrific direction,a fine cast,great special effects and an amazing score. All of those elements make Hellraiser Clive Barker and Horror movies at their best.Based on the novella The Hellbound Heart by Clive Barker,Hellraiser tells the story about Husband and wife Larry(Andrew Robinson)and Julia Cotton(Clarie Higgins)who have moved into Larry's childhood home. While there Julia discovers the skinless but alive body of Frank Cotton(Sean Chapman,Oilver Smith)Larry's brother and Julia's former lover who has escaped the clutches of monsters called Cenobites who exist in a puzzle box that when opened unleashes pain and Horror. Frank decides to use Julie to help him get some blood and skin which leads to terror and chaos.Released in 1987,Hellraiser is a brilliant and unforgettable Horror film that was the directorial debut of novelist CLive Barker and was the movie that introduced Barker and one of the all-time iconic characters in Pinhead to the world of Horror. During the time when Slasher movies were all the rage,Hellraiser was released and gave audiences something different and also gave audiences one of the most original,imaginative,twisted and bizarre Horror movies of all-time and one of the finest genre films of the 1980s. Hellraiser is a truly depraved but incredible work of Horror that is like a nightmare coming to life that is ugly,bleak and is a movie that offers no salvation for viewers and puts viewers who are watching the movie through hell and back. Hellraiser is unique because it was the film where S&M was combined with Horror and Fantasy showing viewers a frightening world where somethings are turned on it's head:torture is fun,pain is good mixing together with themes such as murder,death,sex and lust. The scares and terror in Hellraiser are nonstop and they don't happen with jump scares but with the horrific things that the characters go through. The movie is also scary because of the atmosphere which is surrounded by darkness and dread that hangs over the movie like a tightrope and never stops until the very end and when you watch the movie you will feel like no one is safe in any way shape or form. The blood and gore in Hellraiser is effective,brutal and will make you sick to your stomach with it's harshness and will give viewers nightmares for years because it's not just blood and gore for the sake of blood and gore it's there for a reason and makes an impact. Despite Pinhead being on the poster and being the face of the Hellraiser franchise the movie is really about the human characters and the things they go through as well as their interactions with one another and how they deal with the chaos going on in the film. Most Horror movies are never without memorable monsters and in Hellraiser the memorable monsters come in the form of Pinhead(in this film he listed as Lead Cenobite)and the Cenobites. While the Cenobites are only in the movie for a short time(5 to 10 minutes)they add to the movies nightmarish tone because what sets Pinhead and the Cenobites from other Horror villains in the first Hellraiser is that while they are not really good they are not always evil they are Demons to some,Angels to others. The Cenobites come from this puzzle box that is dangerous for the owner because if you open it the Cenobites appear and use chains and hooks to inflict pain or pleasure to the person who owns it which is terrifying and creepy. The Cenobites also have a look that is unique with black leather and different looks with their faces:there's Pinhead,one with no eyes and big teeth,one with a hole in their throat and a butterball with sunglasses. Pinhead and the Cenobites are classic characters you will never forget as long as you live. The ending of Hellraiser is fantastic and is filled with thrills,terror and lots of surprises that will leave viewers on the edge of their seats. A terrific ending.The cast is great. Ashley Laurence is outstanding and beautiful as Kristy,the heroine of the film. Andrew Robinson is wonderful as Larry Cotton,Kristy's Father. Claire Higgins is terrific as Julia,Larry's cheating Wife. Sean Chapman is great as Frank Cotton,Larry's Brother. Oliver Smith is superb as Skinless Frank/Frank The Monster,the villain in the film. Doug Bradley is brilliant and frightening as Pinhead,Lead Cenobite,one Horror films all-time great characters. Nicolas Vincent(Chattering Cenobite),Simon Bamford('Butterball' Cenobite)and Grace Kirby(Female Cenobite)are terrific as the other Cenobites. Robert Hines is decent as Steve,Kristy's boyfriend.The direction by Clive Barker is amazing and stylish,with Barker giving the movie a solid atmosphere and stunning look that is frightening and eerie. Great direction,Barker.The score by Christopher Young is outstanding,epic and iconic and matches the tone of the movie perfectly. Sensational score,Young.The Special and Practical Make-Up Effects are terrific,realistic and well-done. Amazing Special and Practical effects.In final word,if you Horror,Fantasy or Clive Barker,I highly suggest you see Hellraiser,an excellent,terrifying and unforgettable Horror Classic that you will never forget. Highly Recommended. 10/10.",Hellraiser
145,PeterRoeder,We have such sights to show you!,8,27 October 2003,"This is a truly remarkable horror movie. Although difficult to watch, especially twice, when you´ve realized how mean and groundbreaking it is. The story is like Ingmar Bergman combined with the most sublime horror. Very surprising. A truly astonishing vision. Clive Barker is a most remarkable and visionary person. Although a movie like ""The Ring"" (Japanese version) is more convincing, this movie really astonishes on its own term. It is the STORY behind which is so truly amazing, and you bring this out of the experience - that is, you remember the vision long after having seen this movie. The sequal is not bad either, although the story is a bit worse. Many further sequels are completely useless though.",Hellraiser
146,Coffee_in_the_Clink,"Excellent horror and special effects, brutally hindered by a mediocre script",6,19 May 2020,"I was never a truly big fan of this. I hadn't seen it in about ten years until my second viewing the other night, and my opinion of it hasn't really changed. I don't consider it to be one of the best, or even a classic with the likes of ""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre"", ""Night of the Living Dead"", ""Halloween"". It's an above-average B-horror movie with some excellent special effects, in my opinion, essentially hindered by poor acting, a dull storyline and poor pacing. The editing also leaves a lot to be desired, and when you pair that with a mediocre script that the actors struggle to make work, then you are left with something that isn't much better than the standard direct-to-VHS horror fares that were doing the rounds at this time. The gang of Cenobites led by Pinhead are superb looking. Clive Barker made his directorial debut here and wrote the screenplay based on his novella ""The Hellbound Heart"". I have never read it, so can't say much about it, but I can certainly say that Barker writes his cast into many a tight corridor with awkward melodrama, all which comes from the fall-out of an affair that the wife has had with her husband's brother, who is now living up in the attic having escaped from some realm of Hell which the Cenobites lord over. As well as the excellent gore and special effects, and some strong atmosphere and horrific imagery, ""Hellraiser"" certainly pushed the boundaries a little and was original and brave in its sadomasochism overtones. It is a decent horror film, and has plenty to note, but it is inhibited greatly by the aforementioned flaws which ultimately prevent it from being something great, or even worthy of the classic status that I don't feel it deserves.",Hellraiser
147,Rendanlovell,Yes please,7,31 August 2020,"In terms of horror movies that came out around this time, Hellraiser is one of few that is genuinely compelling. Just in 1987 alone you got the 3rd Nightmare on Elm Street movie, House 2, and Friday the 13th 7. That's not to say those movies are bad or anything, but they are sequels in a time where sequels and slashers reigned. Instead of going this route the film veers far in another direction. A sexual, allegorical direction. Which I found quite intriguing.
It's not the most unique horror flick out there but it does a lot right. There's a ton of great ideas that do wonders for this. Pinhead is an awesome horror ""villain"", even if the story isn't about him. The hyper sexual nature of this is at the forefront. Which seems to be a reflection on abuse or being promiscuous. I'll have to see it again in order to get a good grasp on it.
But the fact that I want to see this again at all is saying something. These 80s horror movies are usually unwatchable outside of 1 viewing. However, there is plenty tying this down. Outside of a strong leading performance, the other actors are kinda bad. The young girl is particularly brutal. There's also a vibe of cheapness. The sets are a little bland and there's incredibly obvious ADR.
Speaking if issues, I think the main character needed work. The film does a pretty bad job of making me care about her. She's cheating on her good husband, she murders people, and is just generally unlikable. That would be fine if there was more to anyone else. Yet, there isn't. The young girl sucks, her love interest sucks, and the good guy husband sucks.
That said, the effects work does wonders for the production value. It's fantastic. Almost every effect in this effects heavy movie is perfect. Goopy and nasty looking, it still holds up. Couple that with a compelling story and neat ideas and this works pretty well. It's like The Thing meets From Beyond.",Hellraiser

Because the Plot is Kind of Hard to Get Used to and Understand. But once you do, You'll Love It!!!First off, I Don't think it Would right for Someone to Not be Informed on How Gory this Film Really is. It is Brutal. This is not the Kind of Stuff that will make you Want to Puke, but Rather the Stuff that Could make you loose your Hunger. For Some People that's Bad, to others it's Good. To Me, Some of the Gore Could have went. I own the Rated Version, and It would not be Something to Watch with Grandma, so I Can Imagine what the Unrated Version must be Like!But The Gore Still Does not Ruin how Much of a Masterpiece this Film Really is. The Originality, Setting, and Plot already make it a Film that Most People will Enjoy. The Sequels are Superb too! Just as Good, if not better, Than the First! Anyway, This Film is Really Spectacular. Many of the Scenes Made me Just not want to Talk. I was Frozen.Clive Barker, as You May Already Know, has Given us Classics such as ""Candy Man"". He Delivers the Same type of Stuff Found in Hell Raiser and Candy Man in All of His Films. Very Scary.

Both these books are must-reads for horror fans and if you like Hellraiser I highly recommend you not only read them , but also the excellent Hellraiser comics that are out there.To be completely honest I enjoy the things that inspired and was inspired by Hellraiser the movie more than the movie itself! This is not to say it isn't a good film, as it very much is.
The cenobites are very memorable horror villains that earned their spot in the horror hall of fame and Barker's direction is not bad for a first-timer.
The lore surrounding the world of the cenobites and the mystical lament configuration is all very intriguing stuff.Highly recommended for horror fans! Don't forget to read the books and comics too.",Hellraiser
151,geminiredblue,Don't Get Your Soul Torn Apart!,8,20 October 2011,"Years ago, when I first saw HELLRAISER, I was turned off by it. I found it to be a very disgusting, ugly, eye-poppingly awesome but still grisly tale. But more recently, something told me to give the film another glance. And this was after I read the novel it was based on called HELLBOUND HEART. Upon seeing it again, I've gained a better perspective on the film. I believe part of what turned me off years ago were the extremely adult themes going on. Clive Barker, both the writer of the novel and the director of this one, knows his stuff and is not afraid to show it. So the gruesome story is: A reprehensible man named Frank has spent his life living for pleasure and manages to track down a legendary puzzle box, like Pandora's. By solving the puzzle, he opens a netherworld and unleashes a group of demons called the Cenobites. Who introduce him to a world beyond pleasure and pain. Some time later, Frank's brother Larry (played by the wonderfully loopy Andrew Robinson) moves into the old family house along with his frigid second wife Julia. As it turns out, Frank and Julia had an affair years ago. After Larry suffers a minor accident, his spilled blood manages to revive Frank in one of the most impressive special effects scenes. Frank, at first a weak gelatinous skeleton, convinces Julia to get him more blood. So her solution is to lure men back to the house with the promise of sex, only to butcher them mercilessly with a hammer. Of particular note, I still find the murder of the first victim very chilling. And maybe that is what's so disgusting and unsettling about it. Unlike most horror films, the death scenes have very little, if any, music accompanying them. And the gore is not there for titillation, but rather to show how brutal and ugly death can be. As you might imagine not all goes as planned for Frank and Julia (who seems to be emerging as Lady Macbeth.) Larry's daughter Kirsty witnesses one of the murders and manages to steal the box. And yes, she opens it which causes the Cenobites to arrive! From that point forward, I'll leave the rest up to you, gentle blood-thirsty viewer! From start to finish, Clive Barker shows that he is a capable director and story teller. Granted, his work isn't for everyone and most are VERY adult-themed. But for those who feel brave enough to tackle his work, here is a good jumping-off point. For anyone who wants the fear of Hell put into them, make this required viewing at once!",Hellraiser
152,Chaves7777,"A tale of pleasure, pain, angels and demons",10,17 March 2007,"I have always had a certain sympathy for horror genre. Since little, i get some scary fun with that horrible fictitious characters. Of course, i heard about ""Hellraiser"". When i watch that man with needles (Or something like that) in his face, i was scared. In this time i have never seen the original movie, in T.V always give to me the sequels... not more. At least, after 5 or 6 years i found Clive Barker's ""Hellraiser"" (Believe me, found a title like that in DVD that have subtitles is not so easy as it seems). Since little i think that was just other ridiculous movie that only that wants is just show ugly scenes to win some good cash. I was so wrong. Clive Barjer's ""Hellraiser"" is not only one of the best horror movies that i have ever seen (Other movies that i love of this genre are too Brian De Palma's ""Carrie"" based on Stephen King first book and Murnau's first Bram Stocker classic ""Dracula"" adaptation ""Nosferatu""), ""Hellraiser"" is at the same time, one of the best movies that i have ever seen.This amazing tale told us the key to the most infamous human desires through a rare box. This box is a kind of puzzle, that, when it is resolved, open a gate to a labyrinth of confusions, where is the horrible and recognizable Cenobites (Oundstaning scary characters). This creatures are that ""angels to some, demons for others"" that give to any human been that open the box the most horrible and deeper sensorial experience, in all the meanings: pleasure and pain. One of the Cotton's family solves the mystery of the box, as you know, he disappear for that special facts. His brother,Larry, and his wife (Who is the lover of the missing guy) goes to the same old house. Larry's daughter, Kirsty goes sometimes to visit her dad. But in the house something is happening, in the attic appears strange sounds. Julia, Larry's wife, discover something horrible and macabre but she will unite with it. Kirsty suspect something... suddenly, she discover ""not capable for your eyes"". Clive Barker's ""Hellraiser"" is not a regular horror movie. Is an excellent movie. The story, based in a short story by Clive, is so captable that takes you to that hell and makes you feel the real horror in your own flesh, like if the Cenobites take you to a ""sensorial experience"". The characters are good defined and the performances are great (Ashley Laurence is outstanding as Kirsty). I really believe the effects and the music is so catching... i just have to say this ""This movie is awesome"".Clive Barker's ""Hellraiser"" is a marvelous horror fantasy that makes you think (Few horror movies do that.. just think that this one and ""The Exorcist""). The human been have desires, not of spirit or soul, desires of flesh, of feel that carnal desire. And the human been can even sold his soul for feel that ""pleasure"". Clive Barker's ""Hellraiser"" is a tale of angels and demons, pleasure and pain, sadomasochism, monsters, death and desire. Is good horror movie with an awesome message. I must repeat it... what horror movie do that? *Sorry for the mistakes. Well, if there any.",Hellraiser
153,Alex-372,But If You Try To Trick Us...,8,24 September 2003,"We Will Tear Your Soul Apart. (I love that line.) Why do so many great and important movies and series hail from 1986-1987? Wall Street, Salvador, Manhunter, Edge Of Darkness, Crime Story. Maybe the stars were in alignment, maybe it was the bull market of the eighties with it's abundance of money, but this is another of these gems.Hellraiser is one of British horror writer Clive Barker's most successfully adapted novels. Spawning many sequels, the first is still the best. The story is simple enough. Larry and Julia, and Larry's daughter Kirsty (Ashley Lauren) move to a new home in London's Docklands, once frequented by Larry's estranged brother Frank. Frank, an intrepid searcher of forbidden pleasures, has mysteriously ""disappeared"", but left behind a puzzle box with strange powers, that can move on their own. The box summons a strange breed of creatures, the Cenobites, who are ""demons to some, angels to others"" (yes, you heard it here first), that once had the same desires as Frank had. Which is as far as I'll go.The Cenobites are a big part of what makes this movie. Pinhead, the freak in charge, has some great lines. There is a bloated guy, a woman who had her throat slit and goes around talking with gargling noises... Watch out for Mac Fleetwood as old Satan himself.
Even if the movie can get slowed down in places, it's worth it. The biggest disappointments are the sequels, none of which explore the really interesting creatures, the Cenobites themselves, which is a shame. As Clive Barker is a literate person, the theme of this movie is of course not only the creatures, but the horror that springs from the mind of man him (and her-) self. If you haven't seen this classic horror movie before, it is highly recommended.",Hellraiser
154,Mr_Censored,The Hell of Human Nature.,9,1 April 2010,"Much has been said about Clive Barker's 1987 magnum-opus, ""Hellraiser,"" and much of it has been true. The film is as beautiful as it is ugly, as hideous as it is intriguing, and without a doubt, will crawl under the skin of even the most desensitized genre fan. It's a film that is as much about the ugliness of death as it is about human nature and the evil that lurks within each and every one of us.In the film, Larry (Andrew Robinson) moves into a new house with his new wife, Julia (Clare Higgins), and daughter from a previous marriage, Kirsty (Ashley Laurence), without knowing that the soul of his seedy brother, Frank (Sean Chapman), is trapped within the house after solving a mysterious puzzle box. Once he gets a taste of the red stuff, Frank starts to take shape again, resuming his affair with his brother's wife and unwittingly opening the doors to Hell in the meantime while simultaneously introducing a gaggle of bizarre creatures known only as the Cenobites. The Cenobites are led by Doug Bradley as Pinhead, who, despite not being given a name until the sequel, cemented himself as a horror icon along with the Freddys and Jasons of the time and gets perhaps the best lines of the entire film. Clive Barker is truly a Master of Horror in his own right, and ""Hellraiser"" is a brilliant testament to that fact. Not only are the special effects grisly and, well, gross, but still manage to hold up even today, 23 years later. The film is grounded in solid performances by its cast, and especially in the case of Clare Higgins, are more than one-dimensional horror flick fodder. All of this is achieved, of course, with stunning visuals (gore aside) and a foreboding and cruel tone that just can't be beat. Even after all these years and seven sequels ranging from entertaining to mediocre, its impact has yet to be lessened. ""Hellraiser"" is easily one of the best horror movies of the 1980's, but also of all-time.",Hellraiser
155,RockPortReview,Classic 80s Horror Introduces Pinhead to the World,9,16 June 2013,"Clive Barker's ""Hellraiser"" is a 80s horror classic with gore effects that still hold up today. It also introduces us to a new horror icons Pinhead and the Cenobites (sound like a band I use to know). I actually saw this movie when I was about 10 years old and can't believe how well the film has held up after all these years. Some of the movie hasn't aged as well though as in the ending.Julia is business woman who had a torrid affair with her husband Larry's brother Frank, a dark and mysterious world traveler. When Frank dies under suspicious and supernatural circumstances Julia and Larry move into his house (naturally). Larry also has a daughter, Kirsty, from his first marriage who now lives on her own. While helping the movers Larry accidentally cuts open is hand on a nail and goes looking for Julia. He finds her in the attic where Frank died. Larry's wound bleeds on the floor, which intern starts in motion the resurrection of Frank.A while back Frank had bough a puzzle box from a street vendor. Its like a Rubik's Cube, but if you solve it opens up a doorway to hell. The box summons the sadomasochistic demons known as the Cenobites, whose only pleasure is your pain. With Larry's blood Frank is able to escape the Cenobites and tries to reclaim human form. The effects used in Frank's slow regeneration are pretty awesome. He is completely skinless and looks like he'd make a good Body Worlds Exhibit. He needs human victims to able to continue the regeneration process and with Julia wanting her dead lover back helps him. She lures a handful of unsuspecting business men to their death. So where is Larry in all this? Completely oblivious and unaware that anything is wrong, so basically a typical 80s movie husband. Kirsty does get suspicious when she sees her step mom with another man. While at the house looking for her dad, she discovers the new frank and is able to steal the puzzle box. Frank ups his search for some skin and sort of reunites with his brother Larry. That's right Franks is now wearing Larry's skin and is out to kill Kirsty and reclaim the puzzle box.While investigating the box Kirsty accidentally summons the Cenobites and to save her own life she offers to give them Frank. The Cenobites ""Will tear your soul apart"" says Pinhead the leader of the group along with a female with her throat opened up. There is also ""Butterball"" and the ""Teeth Chatterer"". As I said in the beginning the ending is pretty dated and done on the cheap, but the movie as a whole is a true horror classic. To date there are eight sequels out there all starring Pinhead. Anything after number three and you watch at your risk.",Hellraiser
156,cgearheart,Decent and memorable horror yarn; a bit overrated,6,12 September 2018,"Hellraiser is a nasty and campy piece of juicy horror. The plot is very bizarre yet unique and effective, the effects are disgusting and nasty but very well done. The thing that kinda watered it down for me was all the hype I had heard about it beforehand. I had finally watched it and I didn't see it as the horror masterpiece everyone else had. I thought it was cheesy and campy, I found the characters mostly forgettable (except for the infamous cenobites), and some of it was kinda laughable. However, the movie was memorable for it's gruesome gore effects, grisly mythology, and it's terrifying (but not entirely evil) monsters.Hellraiser is relatively unspectacular and dated, but is an overall memorable viewing experience due to said effects and terrifying imagery. 
A good movie to watch on Halloween.",Hellraiser
157,kingofdanerds,"Hated this film when I first watched, liked it after the second viewing",8,28 April 2021,"Hellraiser is certainly an interesting horror series. It shows that a horror series can go from the top and crash very hard at the bottom. But with that being said, the first Hellraiser film is a good first film. The film was based off of the novella The Hellbound Heart which was written by Clive Barker. It would be a few years later that Clive Barker would go on and direct an adaptation in 1987 called Hellraiser. This would be Clive Barker's only notable directing feature. The film had a low budget with only about a million dollars but made that back easily. Critical reception was mostly positive and even today it has a pretty big following. The film stars Andrew Robinson, Clare Higgins, and Ashley Laurence.A man named Frank opens a mysterious puzzle box that unleashes the Cenobites (sado masochist beings) that are only able to come to our world via the Lament Configuration (the puzzle box). Frank is ultimately killed and his brother and his (meaning the brother's wife) move in to the house that Frank was killed in. Events happen and Frank becomes resurrected and can only be made complete if human sacrfices are made. But he must all do this without anyone, including the Cenobites, finding out.Let me set the stage here about what I thought about Hellraiser before and after the first time I watched it. Before watching the film, I had known Pinhead as this horror slasher icon. So when it came to watching this first Hellraiser film, I was really stoked and had high expectations. Well, I was disappointed at the time. Now, I am not so. I think the reason why Pinhead is the way he is is that the people decided to make him this icon despite the movies not really doing so (until they did kind of). But with that being said, I love the focus not being on Pinhead and rather the human characters. I was never really familiar with Clive Barker before watching Hellraiser but after watching it, I have a good idea of what his style of horror is and I absolutely love it. The whole dark and at times gothic tone is just plain creepy and disturbing. The practical effects are perhaps some of the best that I have seen in an 80's horror movie and I am glad that Bob Keen had a credit for this film. I am a sucker for gory practical effects and I was not dissappointed. There are numerous scenes that showcase these effects and it is just something that one has to see for their own eyes. The whole premise of Hellraiser (that is, the first entry and arguably the second entry as well) is really unique and interesting to watch. For a horror film, Hellraiser delivers the scares in it's tone and how disturbing it is. Sure, I may be understating all of this because I have become pretty much wholly desensitized by the horror genre but there is no doubt that Hellraiser is creepy in tone and atmosphere. The characters are fine enough but without giving a review with spoilers, I cannot go on about a specific character but one who has seen the film and reading this review will have a good idea what I am talking about. But I can go and talk about the Cenobites which are amazing to look at despite them being very disturbing. Pinhead is the most famous of the bunch and the one that the series has decided to have a somewhat focus on. Funny enough, Pinhead was not even called Pinhead as seen in the credits and this time he is called Lead Cenobite. The Cenobites are creative in design with each one being unique. While Hellraiser does fully deliver in most areas, I have some problems with it. Nothing really huge but things that should be noted as always. The acting is not great with some pretty hammy line deliveries and it is very apparent throughout the film. Another problem which is really really minor is some inconsistencies that revolve around the Cenobites and the box when it is opened. Sometimes it opens with chains coming out, and sometimes just Cenobites come out. So, this is really just a nitpick more than anything.Hellraiser just has to be a film one has to be in the mood for. If you are in the mood for a film like this, then you will have no problem.",Hellraiser

Their role is to introduce any who summon them to all forms of physical and mental extremity, pain, pleasure, torment, joy, in equal measure. Thing is, one of their victims appears to have escaped their clutches, and when he turns up in an old English house after having been resurrected by the blood of his brother, they are eager to get him back.Some outstanding moments really lift this above the norm - Frank's resurrection, the first glimpses of his skinned persona, the Cenobites' appearances - and Barker imbues the whole thing with a real sense of menace.Flawless and stylish, this is horror at its best.",Hellraiser

Anyone who watches a lot of horror films knows that the 80's horror scene was dominated by the slasher genre and while some of those turned out to be quite good, after a while they just became the same old thing. Luckily, there were a few breaks in between the slasher madness, be it good vampire/ werewolf flicks (like ""Lost Boys""/""The Howling"") or tales of such high strangeness, that they became automatic classics in their own right. ""Hellraiser"" was one of those. Released by New World Pictures in 1987, it was directed by a young writer by the name of Clive Barker who, although having little in the way of filmmaking experience, managed to make one of the most bizarre, unique, and imaginative films of any kind ever! It all begins when Frank, a degenerate looking for the next immoral thrill, buys a strange cube shaped puzzle box from a mysterious man somewhere in the Middle East. From there, it's all down hill as Frank solves the box and gets sucked into the strange sadomasochistic hell of the cenobites, beings who, in the famous words of their leader Pinhead, are ""explorers in the further regions of experience. Demons to some, Angels to others"". But it doesn't end there, as Frank's brother, Larry, and his wife, Julia, soon move into the old family home where Frank is brought back through Larry's blood being spilt from an accident as some sort of horrific zombie/skeleton hybrid. Julia, in a bid to help her former lover (yes, she and Frank had an affair) agrees to help make Frank whole again by bringing him hapless men to suck dry and as a result, makes Julia more and more cold blooded. But they have to hurry because the cenobites don't like being duped! The plot alone should be praised for its originality and boldness, weaving together a story that incorporates the idea of pain as pleasure, horror, eroticism, extreme gore, and strangeness, all in the same movie! Clive Barker proved his worthiness to be included in the hall of horror masters by adapting his novella, ""The Hellbound Heart"" to the big screen through the use of well done cinematography, lighting and camera direction (it's all even more remarkable when one remembers that other than directing a few short films, Barker had almost no experience in the director's chair).Credit also must go to the makeup and special effects guys for bringing to life some of the most bizarre creatures ever, be it Frank the monster or the dreaded cenobites themselves, with their tight leather clothes, skin-crawling self mutilations/deformations and bad ass leader, Pinhead himself or lead cenobite as he's known here. In another actor's hands, Pinhead might have just been a cool looking monster and not much else. But in the hands of Doug Bradley, he's given a personality and charisma, thus making him one of the most memorable monsters ever. All the actors do a fine job here, be it Andrew Robinson as Larry; Clare Higgins as Julia, the wife from hell; and Ashley Laurence in her introductory role of Kirsty, Larry's daughter who desperately tries to save her father after realizing the horrible truth. And of course, what good horror movie is without an effective music score and we sure get here in the form of Christopher Young's beautiful and foreboding score. To sum it up, if you're tired of seeing the same old thing in horror movies and are in the mood for something different, take a look at this and while you're at it, be very leery of any shady characters who try to sell you a puzzle box because you just never know what you're going to find inside!",Hellraiser

This is another one I hadn't seen in years, and what surprised me here was just how much of this I didn't grasp back in 2006 when I first saw it. Hellraiser's cryptic, frigid exterior might seem tough to crack at first, but by the half hour mark, it will have immersed you in a wave of grungy, dismal horror unlike most anything you've seen before.

169,tequila101,Suspense in Hell,7,21 November 2011,"This is certainly Clive Barker's Masterpiece. His 1987 film, ""Hellraiser"" is a really good example of how a late 80's horror film can work.Nearing the 90's, horror films started to go down hill. In 1991 and 1996, we got two really good thriller horrors, being ""SCREAM"" and ""Silence of the Lambs"". This film however, was the last of it's kind to give us some good late 80's slasher craze which was still born and still very fresh with horror freaks.I won't go into the plot because I believe everyone should have seen Hellraiser by now, if not, well GO SEE IT! All I can say is that the concepts of the box is terrific. A new way to kill a slashing demon is always a terrific and creative concept and it works really well in this one. I also love the soundtrack suite which is haunting beautiful and dramatic in parts. The actors are superb and their characters are believable.Doug Bradley as Pinhead is the best and he knows how to give us a creepy killer which cannot be stopped. I dunno why in ""Revelations"" they got a different actor to play him. Doug is Pinhead, end of story.I also like the way the death scenes and plot are shown. The director takes it a little step at a time while as most directors just go full on with the violence and exploit everything. Clive actually took his time to tell the story and that's what made most of the ending sequences and starting deaths so intense. It all left us to the core suspense.Also, the 1987 film is the only Hellraiser film I have really liked. I've also seen part 3, 4 and 6. 3 was OK, 4 was dodgy and 6 sucked. The thing about the first film was that it had a dramatic fantasy to it, while being realistic, people were dying for real. The other Hellraiser films I have seen since then haven't really had the same impact but instead really try to rehash and be as shocking, doesn't work at all!?My verdict on this 87 classic is a 7.5/10.P.S: I just hope they can get this right in the remake next year.",Hellraiser
170,atzimo,Clive Barker's Absolute Masterpiece,10,7 December 2003,"To me 'Hellraiser' is the exception of a movie being clearly better on film than on paper. Having read the book, the movie is definitely superior, mostly because it was directed by the original writer Clive Barker. He had the chance to improve his own work with this movie, making it the only horror film since 'Carrie' that is worthy of the characterization cinematic literature.The images, nightmarish. And they're still strong after all these years. You see, at an age where computer effects were still at their birth, everything had to be photographed. The blood, the skins, the chains, the hooks, it all looks real.This is one of the best of its genre, among 'Rosemary's baby', 'The Shinning' and 'Invasion of the Body Snatchers (1978)'.10/10",Hellraiser
171,extravaluejotter,Barking Mad Horror,8,20 August 2006,"""Hellraiser"" is a great movie. Made on a shoestring budget, the fine cast, imaginative production design and superb script rise above its failings. Set in America, the film is clearly shot in the UK - Cricklewood in NW London, to be precise. There is some truly ropey animation in the closing scenes too, but these are small criticisms.Clive Barker now has a good reputation as a horror maestro. Almost unknown in the mid-1980s, he adapted his novella ""The Hellbound Heart"" into a film script and that was where his career took off.""Hellraiser"" does what any effective horror movie should do, lining people up for gruesome deaths and making the audience wince with guilty pleasure as they watch. What it also does is provide its characters with motivation and emotional depth. ""Hellraiser"" actually has a plot, an increasingly rare device in the horror genre.Ignore the fact that this movie is almost 2 decades old and watch it. It's a classic.",Hellraiser
172,marc5477,True to its Category,8,9 August 2020,"Of all the horror I watched over the years, this is the only series that every scared me when I was a kid. Freddie was a laugh, Jason bored me to sleep, the Halloween guy (Myers?) was not even horror to me, and poltergeist was funny like Ghostbusters. But pinhead? He actually scared me back when I was 12 or so and unlike the other horror franchises, at least this one tries to do some different stuff.The story is simple, hell is basically a place where people are tortured endlessly by sadistic people who turn into monsters and are empowered by some sort of being in hell. This movie is about a perverse woman who fell in love and cheated with a sadistic guy that accidentally got resurrected and thus escaped hells wrath. He slowly regenerates with the help of his former lover but hell does not like it when people escape their torture and that is the premise of the horror series.Overall its a good horror movie. The second feels even more bleak and involves a power struggle in hell, while the 3rd was more silly and made me laugh. Of course by the 3rd movie I was older so the horror effects started to subside.This is a good horror flick however it is definitely dated. The newer movies are modernized so if you have to have modern visuals try those but if you want story then the older movies are fine. Give it a shot if you are a horror fan.",Hellraiser
173,shaun98,Horror semiclassic,7,26 April 2002,"A wise man once said, ""If you want something done right, do it yourself."" After being displeased with previous film adaptations of his works, horror novelist Clive Barker did just that. ""Hellraiser"" is not a masterpiece as some claim, but it is an intelligent, well-crafted horror drama. One remarkable aspect of the film is the strength of its domestic conflict: infidelity, loveless marriage, and the conflict within stepfamilies. As I recall, another reviewer boldly stated that these plot elements are strong enough to sustain their own film, without the supernatural aspects. He may be right.It is amazing how effortlessly the everyday drama of the Cotton household blends with the fantastic situations that soon crop up. Much of the credit for this belongs to Clare Higgins, whose honest reaction to the situation makes the devilish goings-on more credible. How would people truly react when confronted with the otherworldly? ""Hellraiser"" may provide the answer.
Kudos, too, to the technical work, aptly done despite budget constraints. Frank's resurrection scene makes astonishing use of old-fashioned special-effects technology. It would not have been nearly as effective with CGI. The Cenobite designs are excellent, as is the makeup work done for skinless Frank. Notice that the violence, as graphic as it is, never seems exploitive. It's just *there,* unlike other 1980's horror films where the object is just to show as much gore as possible within time and budget.""Hellraiser"" has held up very well over the last fifteen years. True, the pacing is somewhat uneven, and some of the ending seems pretty throwaway. Nonetheless, the film has offered us some of the most truly horrifying, bizarre images in fright cinema.*** (out of ****)Released by New World Pictures",Hellraiser
174,MovieProductions,...And this is a classic because?,5,3 January 2011,"** out of (****)After reading the infamous Roger Ebert review for the iconic 80's urban-horror film ""Hellraiser"", I scoffed at it. I thought, this old coot doesn't know the word classic if it hit him in the face. Then I saw the movie. While I think half a star is over-exaggerating, I pretty much respect Ebert's review. The fact that so many horror-fans praise this film, as well as critics, just boggles my mind. Tell me what is so great about it? I have seen a plethora of horror classics and I love them all except this one, but come on. Wooden performances, cringe-worthy dialogue, cheesy special effects, an uninteresting plot. This movie is just not great. It's not even good. I think had Clive Barker's name not been attached or had Hellraiser not been a staple in horror, this movie would have been trashed. First up, the plot is so uninteresting that I almost turned off this movie mid-way. Okay so this wife has been unfaithful to her husband in the past. There's a shock! But wait... the guy she committed infidelity with died and now is coming back alive! Sound interesting? Guess how he comes back alive? After the teen girl's dad in this movie gets his hand screwed up and he bleeds. That has got to be the stupidest thing I've ever heard. Not only that but this movie is called ""Hellraiser"" yet you don't see the damn thing until the final five minutes. No lie. The movie should have been called ""Emo General Hospital but the last five minutes are actually cool"". And, if you think him resurrecting with blood is cool, it's not. It's just about some slutty woman and her boring relationship. That would make a decent subplot but not when it takes up most of the running time. You'd think with such an uninteresting plot that the performances would at least be tolerable? Oh have you came to the wrong place. Everyone in this movie just gets on my last nerve and I seriously don't care about anybody. Not to mention the dialogue is just abysmal. Let's not forget the uninspired direction.Now, the reason why all you horror buffs are here. For Hellraiser torturing the crap out of people. Well guess what. Too bad. You see Hellraiser torture one person. That's it. And, it's at the last five minutes! Not only that but there's hardly any gore in this movie. Talk about false advertising. Oh and dead animals don't count Barker. All in all, ""Hellraiser"" is by far the most overrated horror classic I've ever seen. A terrible script, an amateur direction, cringe-worthy dialogue. And just when you think it couldn't get worse, even the gore and trap scenes are unsatisfying. I'm sorry if I seem harsh on this movie but I was just severely disappointed. Had I known this was a soap opera, I wouldn't have rented this movie.",Hellraiser

It is excessively gory in every way possible, helping it to be considered one of the greatest horror movies ever made. It may not have amazing acting or incredible cinematography, but the bloody killings and amazing plot make up for every flaw.Although the movie has some cheesy looking monsters, a few look great! Pinhead is the coolest ""demon"" I have ever laid my eyes on. He speaks so boldly that it makes him seem so evil and scary. He is the perfect example of great makeup. He makes the move what it is and is now a legendary figure in classic horror, like Jason and Freddy before him. The plot is also unique and incredible. The idea that their is a passageway to Hell brings forth a new type of horror that we have yet to see on film, until now. Ghosts, killers, and aliens are all terrifying ideas but religion takes it a step further with ideas such as Heaven and Hell. The afterlife is one of my worst fears and Hellraiser takes it to new heights. Overall, you have to realize before you watch Hellraiser that it is going to be very flawed due to the time period and budget, but yet it is still highly enjoyable and very entertaining. Hellraiser will be remembered for years to come.I highly recommend this film.",Hellraiser
176,jamhorner,Raisin' Hell,7,20 March 2008,"This is one of those movies that I haven't seen in a while, but before I viewed it, I loved it and I thought the acting was top notch, it was really bloody and it was scary. Now, after I've seen it at this age, I can say that it doesn't have the same effect on me as it did before, but it still was a good movie. It's about a deranged man who was supposed to be trapped in a puzzle box, but somehow escaped and now he must feed on other humans to sustain his body. His previous girlfriend helps him out in leading men into his trap. The problem is, the being that inhabit that world want him back and will do anything to get him.What I want to mention, that should get some credibility, is the excellent set design and general décor the movie. It's a fantastic blend of fantasy scenes and Gothic decorations, with a bit of a S&M touch to it. Specific sets that should be noted are the attic of the house (A great example of Gothic style), the set with the turning blocks of wood and chains (a great example of S&M meets Gothic design) and the hospital sequence, which is a great example of horror fantasy. It's one of the things that really stood out in this movie that I don't think many people notice.Now to brass tax; the horror and the gore is so overdone in this movie that it's practically blinds the movie from anything else, but that's exactly why I love this movie. There are so many great scenes where there was an excessive amount of bloody violence including people getting pulled apart by chains, skinless people eaters and a strange room with skin and chunks of meat nailed to wooden boards. Aside from the gore, there were some scary moments in this film that include that ""thing"" between the walls of the hospital, that sequence creeped me out a bit. Even the Cenobites had a pretty freaky design, mostly Butterball and Chatter. Even with the unnecessary amount of blood and guts, it's still fun to watch.Overall, this was a weird and wild ride that is both strangely erratic and horrifically Gothic and gory. It's one of those movies that you expect to have a lot of production value and revolutionary set pieces and animation, and though it's not it still blows you away with some pretty good sets and a whole lot of blood and guts. With the acting aside and the complicated plot, this movie is not all that bad and is perhaps one of my favorite movies. I would recommend this movie to anybody who loves Clive Barker for one, and to those who love a good gore film. However, this is not a horror film that suits every horror fans fancy, but you have to like the genre. As for me, I still love this movie aside from the cheesy acting and excessive unnecessary gore.",Hellraiser

Now that I have seen the movie in its entirety, it still manages to entertain. The premise is like a convoluted love story with gore sprinkled on top. The relationship between Clare Higgin's character with that of her lover is intriguing. She seems to want to escape from her past but cannot resist helping him even in his hideous form. Higgin's performance makes the character complicated, and interesting. You can feel her troubles. Another standout performance is by Doug Bradley as the Pinhead. Every time he and his team come out, there is a feeling of tension because you know something bad will come. Even if he only stands there and talk, you know you don't want him around in the neighborhood. The story itself is not scary, but the theme is dark. The story and performances by Higgins and Bradley greatly lift the material. Ashley Laurence's role as the daughter caught between the events is perfect. The character is not a saint but we still root for her. I think the true horror of this story is knowing nothing is going to end well for anyone involved. While the character Frank is supposed to be the villain, you can still sympathize with him when you see the Cenobites coming. In short, the story works because we fear for all the characters despite their flaws. P.s. the special effects looked great. I still love those effects over CGI.",Hellraiser
178,thelastblogontheleft,"No tears, please.",10,17 December 2016,"Not to overstate things, but if you haven't seen this movie, you need to go do so now. It's on Netflix so you ain't got no excuse. This is the movie that got me into loving horror to begin with, way back when I was maybe 13 years old and my best friend's dad let us watch it (he was always the cool dad). Not to be dramatic or anything but if you don't understand Hellraiser, YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND ME.But really, this movie is great. It has all of the charm of an 80's horror movie — the teased hair, the costume jewelry, the questionable acting skills, the shoddy special effects. I mean, Roger Ebert hated it, but Stephen King once said of Barker ""I have seen the future of horror fiction, and his name is Clive Barker"", so who are you really going to trust here? (That was in response to his book series, The Books of Blood, BUT STILL.)""Every drop of blood you spill puts more flesh on my bones. And we both want that, don't we?""The basic plot is that Frank (played by Sean Chapman), a bad boy in every sense of the phrase, is seeking some intense thrills to liven up his numbed soul and buys a mysterious puzzle box, The Lament Configuration, from a dealer in Morocco. It's a Lemarchand's box — one that, when solved, creates a bridge that can be used to go back and forth between our realm and others. He goes back home and opens the box and all hell breaks loose (literally). Months later, his brother, Larry (played by Andrew Robinson), moves into the abandoned house with his second wife, Julia (played by Clare Higgins), who had previously had an affair with Frank. When Larry accidentally cuts himself and spills blood on the floor of the house, Frank's resurrection begins, but he needs Julia to bring him some human sacrifices (which she is hesitant about at first but ultimately obliges because apparently Frank is reeeeally good in bed).When the Cenobites find out from Larry's daughter Kirsty (played by Ashley Laurence in her debut on-screen role) that Frank has escaped them, they are super mad and come back for him. They succeed, but not before Frank kills both Larry AND Julia because dude has absolutely no moral fiber. The Cenobites had agreed to bypass Kirsty in exchange for her bringing them to Frank, but they change their mind and want her, too, but she sends 'em right back to hell and the cycle is able to be started all over again (namely with part two of the series).""No tears, please. It's a waste of good suffering.""I may be biased but I think the storyline is an awesome one. The Cenobites, with Pinhead as their leader (technically he was never actually named ""Pinhead"", it was just a nickname that stuck and was eventually used in one of the later sequels — I prefer Barker's original idea for his name, Priest), are just so damn cool. Pinhead and the Female Cenobite are the only ones who speak (due to the other two's makeup and prosthetics making it impossible for them to speak coherently) and their lines are just chilling. I've wanted to be Pinhead for Halloween for so many years now but I don't think I could pull off such an intense character.But really, so many great scenes. When you're watching it, it's not so much fear that you feel, per se, as a sense of dread. It becomes obvious from the first encounter with the Cenobites that they are soulless, ruthless beings. It's almost amazing how laughable some of the other effects are — Kirsty being chased at the end, for example — when the makeup and styling for the Cenobites is just flawless. Every time I watch this movie I notice something new about one of their costumes or their physical features. The combination of music (done by Christopher Young), lighting, and sound effects makes every scene with them a memorable one — the clinking of chains, ominous synthesizers, and dusty sunlight shining through wooden slats.I could probably go on forever, but really.

Overall it felt like a waking dream, not something that could actually happen (that's where horror really works for me).The special effects were not convincing, with skin that stretched like Silly Putty when the ubiquitous hooks snagged it. There seemed to be a general fascination with depicting torn, stretched flesh & blood. The ravaged physical appearance of the Cenobites needed more explanation.Also, Frank's motives and history should have been covered in more depth, but time-constraints probably prevented that. I found the female lead a bit wooden; not the passionate type who'd be compelled to do what she did.The actor typecast as the Dirty Harry psycho filled his inevitable role here, but seemed miscast nonetheless.

183,The-Last-Prydonian,A noble but flawed attempt to bring Cliver Barker's novel to the big screen,7,19 July 2017,"The big screen adaptation of Clive Barker's very own novel; The Hellbound Heart, Hellraiser tells of Frank. Being an unsavoury, lecherous man he wishes to experience the extremes of pleasure and pain. To achieve this he purchases a supernatural puzzle-box which when solved, he is torn apart by hooks on chains. After some time passes Franks brother Larry, his second wife Julia and his daughter Kirsty move in to the very house that Frank was killed in. After accidentally cutting himself Larry's brother seeps through the houses floorboards, and resurrects his deceased brother who is discovered by Julia. She previously had an affair with her brother-in-law and it's clear that their fling has still left an impression on her. Being skinless and incomplete as a trio of demonic being called Cenobites had rid him of his body, he persuades his former lover to lure unsuspecting male victims back to the house so that he may feed upon them them so as to regenerate his body. However, events take an unexpected turn when Kirsty stumbles across her evil uncle.Hellraiser is one of those movies which has so much good things going for it but at the same time it has much that is wrong with it. The directorial debut of Clive Barker this had the potential to be something great, and indeed with his innovative talents as a storyteller there is a cracking horror yarn here. Chalk full with eroticism there is most definitely themes of sadomasochism with the monstrous Cenobites decked in leather clad gear, and are something akin to fetishists. To Barker's credit he didn't do an altogether bad directing job in some areas given this was his first movie as director, however the altogether inconsistency in the quality of acting makes one wonder if this would have benefited from a more experienced filmmaker at the helm. In the main antagonist Frank who is played by two actors, the pre-deceased version and the resurrected zombified incarnation we have one of the most twisted, vile and perverse creations that have been brought to the screen to say the least. Unfortunately both actors, Sean Chapman and Oliver Smith speak with such gravelly, voiced intensity that it feels artificially hokey and takes away from the sheer menace of the character who is left under-developed and two-dimensional. Ashley Lawrence as the main heroine Kirsty is overall fairly decent while Andrew Robinson as her good natured, oblivious father Larry is solid enough for the most part. However the biggest standout is Clare Higgins as Julia, the ""wicked stepmother"" of the movie who manages to be a reluctant seductress and bored housewife while injecting real humanity and vulnerability, making her an interesting villain. More so I would wager than Frank.One interesting aspect to this, is the Cenobites or more notably Pinhead (who is listed in the end credits as ""Lead Cenobites"") are really only a secondary threat in this, only making their presence made in the final third of the movie. Actor Doug Bradley who incidentally attended the same Grammar School as Barker, brings a chilling ominous tone to the lead Cenobite and delivers a grandiose performance in the relatively brief time he appears on screen. The make up effects by eighties standard are indeed impressive as are the overall design, although the puppetry effects used in a couple of scenes haven't stood the test of time too well. Barker however does manage to create something of a otherworldly ambience and there is some striking visual flair. This can't entirely compensate though for some of the stilted acting from some of the supporting players, and moments where it strays in histrionic melodrama.

It just doesn't all come together quite as well as it should although there's still much to admire.",Hellraiser
184,Billy_Crash,"Great Story, Great Gross-out",9,18 January 2009,"Barker's ""Hellraiser"" holds no punches when it comes to the disgusting meter, but that's just an aside to a riveting story inhabited by intriguing characters.The always phenomenal Andrew Robinson, character actor extraordinaire, leads a cast of the damned, the innocent and the two-faced.Right from the beginning, when Frank is encircled with candles as he begins to open his new puzzle box, we instantly know the ride will tear us apart and rock our world.Though made on a small budget, the special effects are disgustingly amazing and add tremendously to a tale that put ""Pinhead"" on the map as a horror icon. In regard to said effects, the only reason this exceptional horror tale scores a 9 out of 10, is because of the cheesy ""electrical"" effects scratched into the film due to lack of cash.Enjoy the experience in its beautiful ugliness, ask yourself if you'd play with the puzzlebox, and get ready to quote Doug Bradley's ""Pinhead"" every chance you get.",Hellraiser
185,SimonD1900,Interesting...,7,12 July 2021,"I know there is a strong fan base to this cult movie. Many sequels were made also, which I probably won't see, this one is enough. I've heard of this movie many times for years and seen pictures of Mr. Pinhead so often I estimated him a some sort of cult icon, which I guess he is. I definitely thought he would be the lead character of this movie, he is not. This movie was actually made the year of my birth. Haven't gotten around to see in until now.What can I say about it? Did I like it? Not sure if I I did, I did not outright dislike it. It's a low budget horror from the 80s. So what can you expect? The story has some deeper mysteries to it but the narrative moves fast and does not dwell on explaining any lore. Maybe there is in the book? Written by the screenwriter and director Clive Barker. Perhaps I will get around to reading it some time. I don't really know if I could say that this is a spectacular good movie but it's definitely a unique one. The story is both simple and complex at the same time and there is elements to it that's not to be found in any other film, I think.The horrific supernatural things that happens in this movie, do not make much sense to why they are happening. So it will either spike the viewer's imagination or it will just seem dumb and messy. Depending on the viewer. It's a gory film, with weird ghastly looking creatures. I myself don't find imagery like the ones in this film that much frightening, beacuse it's so obviously not real, though it is entertaining and looks kind of cool. It's well made I think and art direction is very good. Especially with the Cenobites.Yes, the Cenobites. Reading about this movie online, I understand it's mostly them all the fuss is about. They look like they jumped right of the front cover of a heavy metal album. If you're familiar with the manga/anime Bersek, you can easily see where Kentaro Miura got insperation for the God Hand. They do not appear that much in the film and it's not really explained what they are all about. You understand they live in some sort of other dimension linked to ""ours"" and that they like to torture people who are unfortunate to summon them with a certain puzzle cube. They also speak of how they also like to give pleasure, I did not see much pleasure to be given though... They say they're both demons and angels but it's not clear if they come from hell, there are some allegory to christianity within the film though.Beside the horror, the film has some other themes. Mainly adultery, with forbidden and hidden lust. Maybe the Cenobites simply are the demons that punishes sinners of adultery? Or maybe it's about the shame and pain of lusting for something/someone you can't have? Maybe it's about something else. Maybe it's really not about anything. I don't know. As I said, nothing is really explained in the film. So, I guess it's up for artistic interpretation, if one like.First when I saw this film, I would have given it a 6 at best. But afterwards, when I spent some time from it, it still stayed in my mind. I usually forget bad films, so this has something more, it's definitely not garbage. It also grew on me I noticed, for now I'll give it a 7/10. But I might give it a higher score after watching it again. It's a strange movie and not with the greatest plot in the world by no means but it has something about it that makes it special also. I will watch it again to investigate further. I would only recommend this film to people who really like supernatural gory horror, like Evil Dead, or Return of the Living Dead, for example.",Hellraiser
186,alanmora,"""We have such sights to show you!""",10,21 January 2008,"Positively one of the very best horror films of all time is Clive Barker's ""Hellraiser"". The imagery on the screen is bone chilling and will make your skin crawl, the characters he creates are absolutely terrifying and his image of what ""Hell"" is like will change your point of view on the subject forever. Every actor/actress in this film puts on a brilliant performance. The film centers around a man named Frank Cotton who makes a 'deal with the devil' in the film's opening sequence purchasing a mysterious Japanese puzzle box which opens the gateways to Hell. Seeking new pleasures, he solves the puzzle and is torn to pieces by the now legendary character ""Pinhead"" (played brilliantly by Doug Bradley) and his legion of ""Cenobites"" (demonic creatures from the pits of Hell). A few months later his brother Larry and his wife Julia move into Frank's deserted home along with Larry's daughter Kirsty. It is soon revealed that Julia had a sexually charged affair with Frank on her wedding night and when Larry cuts his hand open during the course of the move, the blood that seeps into the floorboards brings forth life, from a strange looking ""cocoon"" from Hell underneath the house,in the form of Frank. Frank is only partially alive though as he is seen as merely bones, blood and rotting flesh tissue. Julia encounters him and agrees to procure 'victims' for him in order to help make him whole again so that they may escape before the Cenabites realize that Frank has escaped their clutches. Kirsty begins to become suspicious of her stepmother's bizarre behavior and begins to investigate the situation. Soon she discovers Frank hidden in the attic, now a bloody mess of tissue, muscles, nerves and flesh but nearly complete except for the skin. Kirsty barely escapes the clutches of Julia and Frank but manages to steal the puzzle box. She solves it and summons the Cenobites, striking a bargain with them by promising to deliver Frank to them in exchange for sparing her own life and helping her to save her father from Julia and Frank. She is too late however as she returns to the house, only to discover that Larry has been murdered and Frank has assumed his identity and wishes to murder Kirsty and have sex with her (in that order). A strange and unusual yet powerful ending results when the Cenobites come for Frank which winds up setting the scene for the inevitable sequel (it has been said that writers had already begun work on the sequel even before filming on this one had completed). The sequel ""Hellbound: Hellraiser 2"" is actually very well done, fans would be well advised however to skip all of the rest of the sequels. ""Hellraiser"" is a highly recommended for all fans of horror and the occult...it will change your life forever! Warning: This is an extremely gory film and is NOT for the weak of heart!",Hellraiser
187,toll-8,Not the horror legend I was expecting,2,29 March 2012,"I remember the first time I saw the poster for this film. It was in a friend's bedroom and it had the scariest looking person plastered across the middle of it. This person was the notorious Pinhead. Written underneath his white, bald, nail impaled head was the title Hellraiser. I decided then that this was a film I would never dare watch. Recently however I decided that I should give this a chance as it is classed as a horror classic. I have to say I wish I had stuck to my original instinct and never actually watched this film. Not because it's scary but because it is dreadful.The film follows four characters. To start with we see Frank (Chapman), a pleasure seeker who obtains a box. Once he solves the puzzle on the box he is transported to hell where he is put through ultimate pain by the Cybernites. After his pain he manages to escape and ends up being imbedded in the floor boards of his old family home.Next we see couple Larry and Julia. Larry is Frank's brother and Julia is his girlfriend who once had an affair with Frank, something she can't stop fantasising about. The couple decide to move into this now abandoned house and whilst there Larry cuts himself, spilling the blood on the floorboards in the attic. The blood brings Frank back to life, but not completely human, just enough to be seen. As Frank begins to be reformed Julia notices him and her arousal towards him comes rushing back despite the state he is in. Soon it becomes clear that the more blood Frank receives, the more he re-forms. Due to Julia's infatuation with him she brings men back to the house with the promise of sex, only to kill them and allow Frank to take the blood. The final character is Larry's daughter Kirsty, who dislikes her new mother-in-law Julia and stumbles across her Uncle Frank as he is regenerating. We get some feeling from his intimidation towards her that perhaps he raped her or fathered her, either way he forces her to run away with the box, and accidentally call the Cybernites. Pinhead then turns up trying to take her away to inflict some pain but she tries to strike a deal with them and deliver Frank back to them. Each part of the film seems to follow a different character and to be fair I didn't care about any of them what so ever. I think half of the problem with that was the considerably terrible acting that was on show. It really was bad. Each character also seems to be really miserable, with no joy in their lives at all, meaning they were so one dimensional it wasn't believable.The horror of it was also non-existent. Now I'm not saying horrors are particularly realistic but this one was beyond stupid. Fair enough Freddy Kruger and Michael Myers are not realistic, but I bought into their world and they were frightening. Here we got monsters that looked like puppets, and Cybernites that were nowhere near as scary as I was expecting them to be. The poster of them was far scarier. This film, considering the puppet like monsters and Ashley Laurence's striking resemblance to Winona Ryder, was like watching Beetlejuice, without the comedy of course.I'll move onto Pinhead, whose image alone was the sole reason I watched this film. Let me tell you now Pinhead is barely in it. The fact that he has become a horror icon because of this is ridiculous because he isn't scary, has no screen time, pops up at strange moments when the story felt it needed something scary, and has an actor playing him so poorly that his lines would have been delivered better by the talking clock. Pinhead does not deserve to be an icon due to this movie.Everything about this film is bad. It isn't a patch on Halloween, Friday the 13th, A Nightmare On Elm Street or, to an extent, Candyman. And they were all made before this and done everything horror films should do. Maybe they were trying to do something different here but it purely did not work. Horror fans love this movie, and for some reason put it on a pedestal but I can't understand why. This was certainly not the scary horror movie, with the scary horror icon that I was expecting.1 / 5For more reviews: www.tolli-movieworld.blogspot.uk",Hellraiser
188,legendaryunderdog,I was impressed but I was left with wanting more,7,12 October 2007,"Clive Barker knows how to make a gruesome horror movie but with an added psychological approach which many horror movies of that time (1987) lack entirely. I have more questions than answers for this movie because it left me very confused and I found it difficult to branch everything together while trying to figure out detailed aspects of the movie. Maybe upon more viewings will I have a better understanding of what is going on but I thought it was a pretty good flick for its time and it still sends waves to this day. Doug Bradley's portrayal of Pinhead was pretty good, albeit brief but good. I would recommend this to any fan of horror films (I personally ignored this movie for a long time but after a while I felt compelled to watch it) and I have no regrets none-what-so-ever.

189,ryanpersaud-59415,Tear Your Soul Apart,8,7 November 2021,"The Good: Like most of the great, iconic horror movies of the 1980s, Hellraiser isn't about what you'd think it was. The Cenobites have been depicted over 10 (mostly terrible) films, but the first film features them as side characters (at most). This was a good idea.At the core of this film is a gothic romance, a very uncomfortable and disturbing one at that. This movie's greatest strength is its willingness to push the boundaries and take itself seriously at a time when most horror films became shlock. Hellraiser's a style over substance film in a lot of ways and honestly, that's fine.The practical effects are MASTERFUL here, at times, with Frank being at the center of the most mesmerizing (and disgusting) scenes. The film's slow burn, excellent score and cold atmosphere work wonders.But I think at the end of the day, what makes this movie work are the very human characters and relationships. Kirsty and her father have a fantastic dynamic, and I have to praise Andrew Robinson for the final act. Just...wow. Everyone here is pretty good, even if it's clear some of the dialog was weirdly dubbed over, breaking the immersion.And yes, the Cenobites, when we do see them, are about as awesome as you'd imagine. Such an inventive, unique and compelling movie.The Bad: This movie does have some characteristic 80s weirdness. Actors don't seem to know exactly what emotions they're supposed to convey at times and you had odd shots that don't really clarify what information you're supposed to take from them (for example, when Kirsty sees her ""Dad"" at the end, did she...not notice how gross he looked? What?). Characters say and do bizarre things and weirdest of all, despite being set in the United Kingdom, 90% of the characters are American. There's even a line when Kirsty's barely there boyfriend, Steve, defends himself by saying, ""hey, we're not all like that,"" when Kirsty criticizes the VERY British Julia.The Ugly: This movie may have had a bit too many ""come to Daddy,"" lines...but what can I saw, it makes you uncomfortable, that's for sure.",Hellraiser

For those who never have seen or know anything about this film associate the movie around the lead cenobite only. Based on the image of him, you expect that it will be gruesome which it lives up to and beyond. I loved it that was graphic and gory. The plot provides decent quality yet moved a bit slowly at times. I was expecting the lead cenobite (Pinhead) to be more prominent throughout the movie which is not. Overall one of my ideal horror movies should be like!",Hellraiser
191,hung_fao_tweeze,We have such sights to show you,8,19 March 2015,"This is a fine example of a movie with virtually no budget (by Hollywood standards) that makes the best of whatever is on hand and ends up creating a superior and rather unique horror film. The first assault comes from the fine music score. From the very first opening credits, Christopher Young seems to be channeling Dominic Frontiere (original Outer Limits) as he imposes somewhat beautiful melodies that are entirely surrounded by a haunting and sad halo. When you hear this music the next time you watch this, that feeling of anticipatory dread and anxiety creeps up your spine. You know what you are in for if you watch this again, but you can't help yourself. This movie is smart. Watching it is like trying to open your own puzzle box (Lament Configuration). Each scene reveals more horror that messes with your head but doesn't reveal too much. You are shocked by what you just experienced, feel repulsed and yet compelled to see more. You find yourself wanting it to take it to the next level. Pain and pleasure. Much of this can be attributed to the very intelligent editing. You end up believing you see more than what is really there. This makes the movie work wonderfully and shores up the dismal budget by making the entire project larger than the sum of the parts. I have heard that this was rated X when it first came out to theaters. There is a sexual theme here but this is far from a sex movie unless you call 'f**king' with your head a form of sex. If this was ever rated X it would have to be because of the frequent graphic violence that by today's standards is not all that bad. The special effects could be made better with a more comprehensive budget, but it probably shouldn't. It has a charm all its own. And yet, the presentation is key. There is a reason for the violence. The individual is, after all, asking for it voluntarily by trying to open the puzzle box. Thus, you don't feel that the Cenobites are necessarily all-consuming monsters since they wreak their own brand of sadism on those who are essentially requesting it. This seems to play out up until the end of the movie when Kirsty at first appears to be allowed to leave the scene when she manages to return escapee Frank back to the Cenobites. ""This is not for your eyes"" But as she makes her way down the stairs she is obstructed by one of the Cenobites who tries to back her up the stairs and back into the room. Perhaps Kirsty made the mistake of hanging around too long as she watched Frank's final shredding?? Or perhaps this is the movie that keeps on giving... I have scene it numerous times and would advise not watching it from a television broadcast. They have a nasty tendency to cut the the more graphic scenes which I find entirely necessary to realize the point of the movie in the first place. Who is this movie for? You have to be kind of bent in the head to watch this and appreciate it. Obviously not for those with sensitive dispositions or are prone to innocence. This movie can corrupt and you may never think the same afterward, but you will be entertained nevertheless.",Hellraiser

It's not a movie that makes you twist and turn in bed. It doesn't make you think. It's just disgusting, like finding someone's hair in your food. You're not sure if you want to finish it.I'll admit that some scenes are creepy, but it doesn't help when the rest of the movie is sadistic and perverted garbage. ""But...but the cenobites are scary-looking!"" Not really, but so what? If I wanted that, I could just make scary faces in the mirror and shout ""boogah!!!"" (To be honest, I'm not even sure if I have to make any faces)The movie also has a lot of sexual content. Why? I don't know. ""Because people have sex in real life! It's natural"". You know what happens more often than sex? Toilet breaks. Yet we never see Bruce Wayne pull down his pants and place his butt on the rim in any of the Batman movies. There are no graphic pee scenes in the Wolf Man. Like the gory violence, it's just pointless. It doesn't add anything to the plot. It's probably there to show how disgusting uncle Frank is. ""Ewww, look at uncle Frank, he's so horny and skinless"".There's a hilarious scene where uncle Frank, after having killed and skinned his brother, puts on the skin and impersonates him to fool the main character. I'm sorry, but it's impossible to take it seriously. It's like something you would see in a very violent Bugs Bunny cartoon.The cenobites aren't much better. Even back when I was a kid and saw pictures of Pinhead, I couldn't understand why he was supposed to be scary. In fact, all of the cenobites look like members of a gay club who played with matches or toothpicks. Disgusting isn't the same thing as scary. There's a reason why we don't make horror movies about dog poop...yet.The Stephen King quote can't be real. ""I have seen the future of horror, and his name is Clive Barker"". If that's the case, Stephen King should consider eye surgery. And Clive Barker should get a face lift. It's probably something Stephen King mumbled in his sleep when he dozed off during the making of Maximum Overdrive.If you want real horror movies, just watch classics like Nosferatu, The Wolf Man, BBC's Dracula miniseries from the 70s, Dead of Night (1945) or the original The Thing.

197,sc8031,For real -- don't go in the attic!,7,8 September 2008,"I remember seeing previews for the Hellraiser movies when I was a kid and being scared by them then. Watching this movie by myself for the first time, I found it retains the frightening elements that stood out to me in the past. Hellraiser is equal parts spiritual/psychological/contemplative horror and gore. The highlights of the film are the Cenobites -- minions of hell and purveyors of sinister, dark pleasures beyond the threshold of mortal perception. The movie begins with Frank, a guy on a mad quest for said dark pleasures beyond the human realm of perception, who purchases a strange box and naively summons the Cenobites to appear. Frank disappears and his brother, Larry and Larry's wife, Julia, inherit the house. Of course, the box is still present, Frank isn't quite dead in the typical sense, and hideous hi-jinks are bound to ensue. Hellraiser set a benchmark when it came out, with a new standard of mainstream horror and gore. Several scenes had to be edited or cut out of the film to receive an appropriate ""R"" rating for theatrical release. But it is not merely a gore-fest, but features psychological and dark spiritual elements that are far more curious and horrifying than any of the violence. Indeed, merely these psychological elements would have been enough to scare the viewer, but combined with the excellent make-up and dusty atmosphere the movie becomes a very vivid, intoxicating experience. My main qualm with the whole movie was how the film paced so slowly in the middle and focused so much on the family members, yet never really exposed very much about them. We don't see much about the dynamics or quality of the love triangle between Julia and Frank or Larry. We do understand how they are linked in theory, but it's so impersonally displayed -- they might as well be silhouettes. The same goes for Larry's daughter, Kristy, and her relationship with her stepmother.This detracts from the movie because it is a fairly lengthy film (almost 2 hours) which takes place mostly in one dimly lit house. And though the demonic Cenobites (the lead one being the famous recurring 'Pinhead' character) are the notable centerpiece of the film, they appear sparingly -- though to great horrific effect when they do.This is notable of the first Hellraiser film, the only one completely written and directed by Clive Barker: the Cenobites are not typical character villains, but horrific spiritual entities that lay beyond our sensory perceptions. Their ghoulish power exceeds mere evil; they are deep, authentic arbiters of the desire realm. In this sense, Hellraiser distinguishes itself from its contemporary horror films -- typical slashers, ""torture porn"" and suspense-horror. The Cenobites are not really villains because they are beyond human and have no hunger for victims. They answer and ""assist"" those who summon them, whether or not the summoning is intentional. In fact, the most disturbing facet of these characters is how mesmerizing and intriguing they are, how potently ugly they are, and how easily the viewer is pulled in while they're on the screen. That infatuation is genuinely scary.The later films would fail to capitalize on this subtle-yet-sophisticated brand of horror and degenerate into average or above-average supernatural-slasher films. But the first one is fairly true to Clive Barker's literary vision and features amazing special effects. Even today the hideous, gory make-up and sinister creature designs are steps beyond anything else in film. This is a truly dark film, one which takes cues from H.P. Lovecraft and may have inspired the brilliant Japanese animation, ""Berserk"".",Hellraiser
198,evilmatt-3,This is what the genre should be,8,11 December 1999,"It's perfectly understandable that this might not be everyone's cup of tea... it's gory, uncomfortably sexual, and paints an unremittingly grim portrait of human nature.However, whether you like it or not, Barker captures the deepest longings of the human heart in this film.  It's Faust taken to our everyday reality: What would you do for love?  Power?  Pleasure?  Happiness?  The illusion of any of these?Barker takes this admittedly borrowed theme and around constructs a story of such magnitude and moral complexity that it demands repeat viewings.  For example, in this film it is very easy to hate Julia.  But when one considers her desperation, her feeling of entrapment in a marriage that she knew was a sham, she becomes another victim.  One could easily point the finger of blame at the Cenobites as well, yet they are just doing their job and have no evil intent.Indeed, at the heart of this film is an age old ethical question: should we strive to be happy or to do what's right?  Since this is a question of concern to rational beings in general, it's worth everybody's time to see it once.",Hellraiser
199,jiangliqings,"Wildly overrated ""classic.""",1,6 August 2001,"** out of ****In my time, I've seen hundreds of horror films and I think I have a pretty good firm grasp of what films in the genre are truly great, which is why I have to say that Clive Barker's Hellraiser is among the most overrated.  It suffers from too many drawbacks in the story, as well as Barker's own direction, and never quite lives up to its ability to deliver consistent good scares.  The story of Hellraiser is fairly in simple in technical terms.  A man, Frank Cotton, purchases a configuration shaped as a box and fiddles around with it, opening a dimension that lies between the depths of pleasure and pain.  Years later, Frank's brother, Larry (Andrew Robinson), and his wife Julia (Claire Higgins) move into the same house.  Larry gets a deep cut on his hand and the blood spills to the ground, which actually revives Frank (in a rather gruesome sequence).  He and Julia shared a past together and he convinces her to bring men back to kill so he can use their blood to bring his flesh back.When it comes to some shocks and jolting moments of suspense, Hellraiser has some well-done scenes.  There are some scares in the film, and the gore effects, which are in a gratuitous abundance, are quite impressive.  There are a few moments of startlingly effective imagery and some very suspenseful scenes, but Clive Barker does so many other things wrong I can hardly believe this movie is actually considered a classic by so many people.This movie is essentially about pleasure and pain, or so I think Barker would try to lead us to believe that's what this is all about.  Those ideas are given a ham-fisted presentation in flashback torture scenes.  Yeah, I see all the pain, but where's all the enticement of pleasure? In the novella, Frank was tempted with the possibility of sex (but in the most repellant manner). The torture scenes are all Barker really cares to show us when it comes to these ideas, basically featuring some people get ripped apart by chains. I suppose I can't forget the fact that people also talk about it, too.  The character Frank goes into these frank and quite dumb brief conversations about how he was bored and simply wanted to experience more and go to the limits, his words not mine.  I'm sorry, but this hardly sounds like a decent reason to do anything like this.  If he was close to death or something along those lines, I could almost believe it, but I could only scoff when he uttered those lines.When it comes to horror films, logical lapses can be accepted.  It's a lot easier to take such moments in fun-based horror films that are simply meant for escapism, but this movie's pretentiousness is overbearing.  Thus, it's a little hard to believe that nobody in the house could smell the rotting, maggot-infested corpses of three men.  It's also a little hard to accept the fact that Robinson's character never realizes just how repressed his wife is.  Sure, he notices she's got problems, but she's a murderous psycopathic bitch.  Barker gives the movie a dark and grim look, not necessarily a bad choice, but he likes to conjure up a lot of dark themes and taboos for the sake of just trying to make the movie look...well, different, dark, and offbeat. The movie focuses on extramarital affairs, serial killings, and even incest and does all this just by simply tossing these odd moments on-screen without any care or background for it in the first place.  These characters' motivations for such odd behavior is never explained and they're simply way too ""evil"" to be taken as real people.The cenobites are only sparingly used in the movie, probably a good idea on Barker's behalf.  They're a little scary at first, but I felt a little goofy after awhile when I realized I was getting scared by a creature that likes to look straight in the air and speak in a dull monotone.  Yeah, I'm talking about Pinhead, the famed horror villain of the series.  Played by Doug Bradley, he's a little enigmatic at first but after a few moments, you really don't care what he is.  In the film, the cenobites appear to have the ability to transport around as is seen when they suddenly appear at the Cotton residence.  (Spoiler)  Yet, when they try to take Kirsty with them, they move towards her at a slug's pace and she simply uses the box to transport them back (speaking of which, I'm clearly certain the fat cenobite only fell through the floor).  That doesn't sound like the all-powerful demons we were prior shown.  Oh, and by the way, this visual lightshow in the finale is pretty embarrassing.    Ashley Laurence is the main character of this film, as well its first sequel.  She's a little wooden here at times, but is relatively okay. Andrew Robinson is also not bad as the unwitting husband, but claire Higgins is absolutely horrendous.  Trying to act like a repressed woman turned murderous fiend, she just comes off with a terrible impression.  As for the rest of this franchise, I've only seen Hellbound, which is worse than this. I sure do sound like I'm bashing Hellraiser, but as I said before, it does have its scares and jolting moments.  The only reason I give it as much a harsh criticism as it seems like I am is because of its beloved acclaim from horror fans everywhere, which it really doesn't deserve.",Hellraiser

And my mum (who reads a lot of Clive Barker or Stephen King material.) said that she saw it in the cinema with my dad when it first came out. She said i can only watch it with my own descretion because it was supposedly really gory.I wasn't scared at all when watching hellraiser but it was an excellent film and the gore wasn't that bad normally i love films dripping with gore but this was pretty tame gore wise for me.The thing that made hellraiser was the story and the special effects despite the low budget. This film to this day is a horror masterpiece.

201,MWNiese,Cliver Barker is a Horror Master,10,6 May 2008,"· Larry Cotton and his second wife Julia decide to move into his creepy Victorian childhood home that's been seemingly deserted for years· Upon moving into the house, Julia starts to have erotic sexual visions of Larry's brother Frank, who was the last one to live in the house· Larry only knows that Frank disappeared some time ago, which is in line with Frank's bad boy reputation. Larry doesn't know that Frank met his end thru a mysterious puzzle box, and that Frank's desecrated remains still reside in the heart of the house· The puzzle box is an ancient treasure that holds the power to summon demon angels that hold the key to the ultimate experiences of pleasure and pain; indistinguishable levels of pleasure and pain· A moving accident that cuts Larry's hand causes his blood to seep into the floor of the house, which gives new life to Frank. Frank's reanimated physical being secretly convinces Julia to help him rejuvenate himself. Julia brings unwitting accomplices into the home in an effort to being Frank back to his earthly, sinfully sensual and sexual being· The Cenobites, the demon angels of the puzzle box, learn thru the grapevine that Frank has managed to regain flesh and blood· The Cenobites, who need to keep up appearances, set out to recapture the flesh and blood of one of their most revered victims, Frank · This isn't an easy movie to explain. In fact as I was writing this review I thought how ridiculous the plot really sounds. But on the big screen this movie works, and for the most part, it does make sense· This is one of the best horror movies ever made. Clive Barker doesn't hold back anything in this movie, as he unabashedly tells a tale of the search for the ultimate experience of pleasure and pain; usually my typical weekend· The demon angels, the Cenobites, are perhaps one of the horror genres most liked and well known horror characters; and certainly make this movie the popular shocker that it is· Hellraiser special effects are good and bad. Most of the effects are very well done. Apparently the production ran out of money and some of the effects suffered because of it. This is a major criticism of the film, touted by morons that couldn't begin to understand the agonizing film making process. The film is unfairly criticized by people that don't understand artistic ingenuity and that can't think outside of the corporate box",Hellraiser

A lot. I liked the articulateness of Pinhead, the over all story and the generally creepy menacing vibe. And of course, the look of the film is definitely iconic.What left me unsatisfied was that I felt it could really have delved into Frank's psychology, his constant search for new thrills, and how chasing after exotic pleasures can (but doesn't necessarily have to) lead you down a dark road. Another reviewer suggested that it's really a story about the relationship between Frank and Julia.

Like another reviewer mentioned I had way more questions than answers for this flick; I had no idea as to why anything major was occurring. Julia went thru all of this just for some penis?? Y were hooks the main weapon of choice? How was Frank able to escape? Y were the centobites designed the way they were? (Pinhead would be answered in the 2nd one, which was somehow an even Worse film). I just found myself not enjoying this bc I was asking myself too often ""Why is this happening?"" Also the graphics were jus bad (they made SHOCKER look like STAR WARS), I would've given them the benefit of the doubt if the movie had been better.

205,Cemetarygirl,This must be love,10,10 December 2007,"Clive Barker is an amazing writer. Who pens great horror books. Unlike another Horror writer that I wont name Clives ability to bring his work to life on the screen is much to his credit. I first saw this when it came out and it has stayed with me ever since. I was again lucky enough to buy a copy and watched it last night. This movie is still as scary and as mind-blowing as it was when it first came out. The story revolves around Frank, a hedonistic man who women are attracted to in droves. He works on the maxim ""Treat em mean...keep 'em keen"" Flashback of him arriving wet and sexy to his brothers wedding, he seduces the bride whilst she prepares, wedding dress draped on the bed. She is now obsessed yet continues with the service and marries the safe and boring brother. Well the choices we make. Frank in the meantime has purchased a puzzle box which possess much more than he anticipates as he plays with it in an attempt to get it open and to experience all that this box has inside. Well he gets what he wants and much much more, this includes getting torn to pieces, with hooks and chains argh! In the meantime Julia and Larry return to England and move into the house where the puzzle box was opened. Blood from Larrys hand spurts whilst Julia is having fantasies about Frank. Larry finds Julia in the loft and blood falls on the floor. The blood then raises the reconstituted Frank, who needs more blood to become fully himself again. Julia discovers him sans flesh and still manages to want him. She gets him more blood by seducing men and bringing them into her house and bashing them with a hammer. Meantime Larrys daughter sees Julia enter the house with a strange man. At this moment I have always wondered why, when they look around to see if anyone is watching, they don't notice the person that is watching. Kirsty becomes the heroine by giving up Frank to the Cenobites, after a period of time in which she is taken collapsed in to hospital where she opens the box and confronts the Cenobites herself. Later she returns to save her father but is she too late? Well watch it! Do you want me to tell you everything?

While this first film of the franchise doesn't give a lot of information and history on the cenobites or pinhead it gives you a good story that you can follow along with anticipation of what will happen next. And by the end of the film you want to see and know more.From the films target audience and what it aims to deliver, I think it hits the right mark.

213,silentcheesedude,A splatter S&M horror classic!,8,25 October 2007,"There is a certain type of flavor that Clive Barker has in his horror films that similar movies do not. Among the books and movies, you can feel something larger in the background. It is a darker world that is encountered, with an unmentioned nightmarish beginning. The protagonist is not really the center point.Hellraiser starts off with a man named Frank, who obtains a mysterious puzzle box in the orient. As soon as he uses at his home in England, chains come out of it and hook into Frank. The room is changed, and otherworld dimension beings called Cenobites appear. They change the box back to it's original shape, and Franks body, a shredded mess, disappears.Frank's brother Larry moves in with his wife, Julia to the now abandoned house. While moving a mattress, he cuts his hand. He goes upstairs where his brothers soul resides, and the blood falls on the floor. The blood then revives Frank, who slowly through out the rest of the film, starts to recover his flesh and guts. But he needs blood to do that, lots of it. That's where Julia comes in.Larry's daughter, Kirsty, who becomes an important part of the plot, finds out what Julia is doing to supply blood to the skin-and-bones Frank: unsuspecting men who are there for sex with her. She kills them one by one, and Frank uses their blood for nourishment. Larry, on the other hand, has no idea that this is going on.With a low budget, Hellraiser does a good job. The Cenobites, especially the main one Pinhead, are incredible looking baddies, with obvious sadomasochism tones. When they show up, you know there's no way out, and there is little one can do but feel the pain they are about to deliver. Andrew Robinson as Larry and Clare Higgins, Julia play the parts unusually well. But it is Oliver Smith, who plays the skeletal Frank (after death) that really is a horror house make up effect.There are some scenes that don't work, such as Kirsty running around the house with her boyfriend; his emotionless face shows no acting skill whatsoever. The story tells us nothing about the box, the origins of the Cenobites... so many questions left unanswered. Sure, these questions are briefly answered in the sequels, but none of them had the impact of this first entry.Still, Hellraiser remains a top choice for the horror selection, a classic that delivers the gore in a neat S&M suit with a good story to boot.",Hellraiser

215,paulnewman2001,Flaying tonight!,9,28 September 2004,"Ticked off at the lash-ups that ensued when his stories were adapted for the screen (the mediocre Underworld and Rawhead Rex), author Clive Barker decided he could do better himself.It was 1987, the year after Stephen King had humiliated himself by making the same decision only to cough up the supremely moronic Maximum Overdrive, but Barker didn't just do it better  in adapting his novella The Hellbound Heart as Hellraiser he crafted one of the most bizarre, ferocious and perversely erotic British horror films ever.It all starts with a puzzle box, the enigmatic Lament Configuration which opens a portal to Hell and calls forth the cenobites, mutilated S&M demons led by Doug Bradley's iconic Pinhead who give their jaded summoners the genuinely novel experience of an agonising slow death before dragging their souls downstairs.Frank Cotton (Sean Chapman) is taken by the self-styled 'explorers in the further regions of experience' until his big brother moves in with disgruntled wife Julia (the wonderful Clare Higgins) and a chance splash of blood offers Frank a grisly way back.As well as the heady, gore-spattered atmosphere of the film, Hellraiser works so well because Frank is such a human monster, grinning like a flayed death's head as he pulls on a cigarette and weasels around Julia for the help he needs.Unfortunately, Barker took a back seat after this and the sequels began the inevitable slide into parody.",Hellraiser

The atmosphere in the film is very dark, it is not exactly scary, but the viewer feels uneasy during the whole movie. The film has his low points,though. It is quite slow-moving and if you have read the book (like me), boring. Also the images in ""Hellraiser"" are too gruesome, I think.

222,Ore-Sama,A Needle in a Hay Stack,9,6 April 2007,"In a genre that is all about style over substance, a genre where you'll be lucky to find character development beyond a character losing their virginity, we have something that is rare in the genre:an intelligent horror film with a strong plot.Even classic horror films like Halloween(1978) and Texas Chainsaw Massacare(1974), as good as they are, won't receive any praise for their plot, and that's not a bad thing. Too much of a plot can hurt a hinder a horror film(Lost Souls, I am looking in your general direction) Fourtanately Hellraiser pulls it off. I won't take time to get into plot details as by now there are more then enough other places to find that out.As is another part of horror films, acting is generally ranged from mediocre to bad. Fourtanately we get mediocre from most of the cast with 2 exceptions:Frank, who is played convincingly enough by Sean Chapman, with all the malice and ambition required. Douge Bradley shines above all as the legendary Pinhead, who has minimal screen time. He portrays Pinhead perfectly, as the menacing yet fair and quite intelligent being who is only out to do his job.One thing that I love about the film is how the story plays out like a Shakespserian tragedy, with the fatal flaw of a main character setting him out to achieve a goal, which ultimately sends him and those around him spiraling into self destruction(sure Frank's not someone of high class like most Shakespearian tragedies but it's close enough) Frank's fatal flaw is his desire. His desire to experience new sensations caused him to be brought down to hell. His desire to come back caused him to enlist Julia in murdering people so he can absorb their blood, with the Cenobites ultimately coming back for him and taking him down as Frank gives the famous line ""Jesus Wept"" The effects seem dated compare to today but they still get the job done. Considering the budget for this film, they did one hell of a job, although the effects at the end are less them impressive(though no fault of Clive's, like I said low budget) This movie also uses a highly fitting musical score. Notice the music during Frank's resurrection scene. It's not a soundtrack that will go down in cinematic history like ""Psycho"" or ""Halloween"" but it is a cut above the majority of horror films. This film does have it's share of tense and scary moments. The film does a pretty good job of creating tension, and the presence of the Cenobites alone is pretty damn intimidating.So if you're in the mood for something that rises above most, hellraiser is a good pick.9/10",Hellraiser
223,videodrome1234,Best of the Best,10,23 August 2014,"There are some horrors that though they don't reform the genre they do have a lasting effect on it. HR is like that and there are many reasons for it. This film can't be and no one has even really dared try copying. No one had the guts to do it. The horror genre was in the midst of its slasher film era when Clive Barker decided to adapt to the screen his 1986 book The Hellbound Heart. The stories style didn't fit at all with the trend of the movies coming out at the time. Amongst Freddy's, Jason's and Michael Myers's antics Hellraiser hit the movies that knew no humor and no irony. With precise and merciless effectiveness it showed the viewers what a real horror, filled with monstrosity and terror is like. In an unknown country in North Africa Frank Cotton buys an antique puzzle box. Back at his house in England, he solves it, gets skewered by hooks and demons called Cenobites appear. Everyone's favorite Pinhead makes everything disappear so when Frank's brother Larry Cotton (Andrew Robinson) in with his second wife, Julia Cotton (Clare Higgins) won't know Frank died. Larry cuts his hand on a nail and Frank uses this blood as nourishment to partially regenerate his body. Later, Frank (Oliver Smith) convinces Julia to help restore him to his full physical form. Its Barker's first feature direction it could best be described as an S&M love story wrapped in a horror, with sexual frustration and family tragedy in its center. There is the constant dissonance of pleasure and pain. The Cenobites aren't the enemy here yet, they're just doing their thing – which is unstoppable and not over-emoted and in your face but damn scary with their creepy appearance and cause you barely know anything about them, so they represent the fear of the unknown. The real evil of course is man: desires, sex, murder. It's one of the most gut churning love triangles ever to be brought to screen and the participants are perfect at self-destructing. Special mention must be made of Christopher Young's music. Barker himself said that Young brought the most to the film out of all the crew and listening to his music you really can't disagree with that assessment. Just like the writer-director he went against the grain and unlike films of the time he didn't have synthesizers instead he got a huge ass orchestra and made dark, beautiful, Gothic music that was at once creepy and strangely uplifting. And you'd be hard pressed to find something similar. With all its afore mentioned virtues Hellraiser wouldn't be half as strong without the fantastic effects that is enjoyable by today's standards too. The legendary mask-maker and fx guy Bob Keen had a bunch of opportunities to excel in this film and it just elevates him to a whole other level that he had a laughable million dollar budget to pull it off. But the best horror of the 80s in opposition to a lot of its counterparts today and then wasn't born from money but from excitement, will and creativity. And that usually brings its return: Case in point: The movie made 15 times its budget. Doug Bradley's utterly creepy main Cenobite Pinhead became one of the most iconic characters of the genre and Hellraiser has cemented its place amongst the greats of horror. 10/10 https://www.youtube.com/user/Videodromeblog",Hellraiser

A Gem!",9,28 October 2007,"Contrary to what one might conceive in their minds BEFORE watching this classic horror movie, it should be said that Clive Barker has delivered us a real gem of a horror story, packed with intensity, both emotionally, as well as physically. ""Hellraiser"" is about love, lust, pain, and pleasure. It's been called an ""otherworldly tale of pain and torture"". It's been referred to as a grim, Gothic romance. Needless to say, it's gore following is much more in numbers than that of the ""Lord Of The Rings"" trilogy. Truly, this film is everything one see's it to be, from a romance, to a gore show, to a good ol' fashioned scare show. Either way, it's a fine film regardless. I might add, however, that it may come as a surprise upon first viewing. What is surprising, is the way it plays out very dramatic. Our characters are very down to earth, each with their own personal idiosyncrasies and inner demons, not to mention personal strengths. Each of them stands like a look at the different human desires, fears, joys, and sorrows. It plays out like a grim, Shakespeare play.

Larry is a charismatic optimistic gentleman, full of love and compassion for his wife, and his daughter, Kirsty. Julia is a human relic of baggage and fallen dreams, because she bears so many dark secrets, one of which is an affair with Frank, her husband's younger brother. Frank is alive, and replenishing himself after a rather nasty encounter with a Pandora's Box. Larry's blood, spilled over a hardwood floor, brings Frank back to life from an excruciating death, in one of the finest special effects sequences in cinematic history. Once Julia and Frank reunite, their love is more dangerous, and powerful than imagined. Together they conspire in the grand tradition of ""McBeth"" and ""Othello"", to reign in pleasure once again. Enter Kirsty, Larry's daughter, and Frank's niece. A warm hearted, but determined soul who crosses paths with Julia and Frank before they can finish their diabolical plan. Kirsty eventually encounters the dark secret beheld Frank upon his death, a puzzle box. It brings pain, pleasure, and death. Creatures of darkness; the Cenobites, angels to some, demons to others, come to Kirsty when she accidentally calls upon their ghoulish powers. Once unleashed, they must take someone back, and Kirsty knows now, how Frank is back, and she intends to return him to his deathly justice, and save her family...The writing is just remarkable. Clive Barker has given us people, humans, planted in their own desires, and determinations, and he tears them apart with fear, pain, death, destruction, and total degradation. The Cotton family are the perfect example of purity, torn to shreds by hate, lust, and anguish, and he takes great glee in showing us all the gory details.The production is a real high! This is what the best type of films are made of. Real, gory, bloody human remains, connecting to each other in divine sequence, to create a 100% greedy man. The colors are plenty and gorgeous. The look of the blood, and the shine of the lights, and the way the actors are lit... It's just beautiful. The music of the film is brilliant. Composer Christopher Young chills the film, and drenches it with his dramatic variation of the main title, and the rest of the music contains harsh strings, brass horns, music box cues, and rhythmic cues that speed the pace up with action.Clive Barker is such a great writer and director, and filmmaker altogether. He has given us a great thriller that crosses the line between reality and fiction, in great taste and color, literally. It's no wonder twenty years later, the film stands on it's own, aside from it's sequels, and remains an ultimate horror classic to end them all...well some of them anyway. It's not the only horror film to portray itself intellectually, and it certainly has it's gore effect to an all time high. Still, it's quite a dashing and artful film, and always a treat to watch every time.",Hellraiser
227,Vastarien202,Submit.,7,26 October 2006,"The first time I saw this, I was suffering a 104 fever on my mum's couch. Despite my intense misery,I couldn't help but get caught up in the story, and I was able to forget my pain for a while. I must admit that I have never really liked the ending,too silly for me. I was in awe of the Leader from the moment I saw him, predatory grace incarnate. He was beautiful. The lack of skin is a key point, illustrating the ultimate truth about each soul. Nothing can be hidden here, the only illusions are those of the ego. EXPOSURE is the greatest terror most people can fathom, but it is the function of Hell and its keepers to torment each soul with its own faults and wasted potential. This is done without malice, at least from the Cenobites. They go about their work with a lack of compassion that is truly the only mercy they can show. Theirs is not a task of punishment, it is one of refinement.The heart of this film is not fear of the Cenobites, it comes from the question it asks each of us... would you have the will to refuse Them when They came for you? To finally know, once and for all, what your true heart is, and to be only that perfect thing, forever, no matter what it cost you?

While its slime, gore, and monsters are visually rich, however, its soft focus and star filter heavy cinematography is cheesy and overdone, and its plot, dialogue, and characters fail to fully capitalize on the its intriguing premise.

At a time where the horror genre seemed no longer to be able to produce anything original we got a pretty inventive movie.It was original because it didn't focus on a maniacal killer or any zombies, not even the persons are the most essential thing in this film. More important are certain themes in the film like wishes and desire. The story evolves on a psychological level rather than on a physical. It's fundamentally different from almost every other horror film I've seen so far. The atmosphere that is present throughout the whole movie should be described as unsettling, it is not scary in the conventional sense.For anyone who is not interested in the story there are still several gore-effects that are excellently done. The five Cenobites are very interesting creatures but they hardly appear which makes Hellraiser even better and more mystical.My major complaint about this film are the characters. They were rather unpleasant to watch and I didn't find myself rooting for any of them.Overall one of the better horror films, refreshingly different from the rest.My rating: 7/10 (watch ""Candyman"" if you liked Hellraiser)",Hellraiser

I thought the movie would be a lot scarier. It ended up being really cheesy and almost funny. There were a few times when I couldn't help but laugh. Don't get me wrong there are a few scary and nasty parts such as a guy walking around without any skin. But I still thought it was a great horror movie I remember being in my early teens and thinking Clive Barker was the most morbid person in cinema but I guess I was wrong. He really isn't that messed up. The plot is decent, but the acting and dialogue are both bad. But I must say I was impressed by the make up and special effects.",Hellraiser
233,Horror_Metal,Clive Barker is a creative genius!,10,19 April 2014,"Larry Cotton (Andrew Robinson) and his wife Julia (Claire Higgins) have just moved into a new house in the city. Unfortunately for them, Larry's sadistic brother Frank (Sean Chapman) has just escaped from Hell and is hiding out in their attic. Julia previously had an adulterous affair with Frank, and eventually goes upstairs and finds him as a skinless and vulnerable zombie. Frank needs to feed on human flesh in order to regenerate and become whole again, so Julia agrees to lure unsuspecting men up into the attic to become Frank's lunch. After this goes on for a while, Larry's daughter Kirsty (Ashley Laurence) comes to visit and accidentally discovers what Julia and her undead uncle have been doing. She also discovers the puzzle box - a mystical device with the ability to open doors to other dimensions or planes of existence. She steals the box from Frank and flees, unaware of the power it contains. After collapsing and waking up in a hospital, Kirsty accidentally solves the puzzle box and summons the Cenobites - four demonic beings from another realm that are obsessed with sadism and torture. When the Cenobites are informed that Frank has escaped their clutches, they are less than pleased. Time to raise some hell! Where Clive Baker (who directed this movie and wrote the book it was based on) gets his ideas, I will never know, but the man is a creative genius and master of the horror genre. This is one of the most unique and original movies I have ever seen with some of the most interesting creature designs as well. Pinhead the Cenobite leader, brilliantly played by Doug Bradley, quickly became a popular horror icon and star of the series that followed. Bradley made the part his own and will always be the one and only true Pinhead to me. But as great a character as he is, I prefer him to play a background role like he does in this film. It's just better that way. All the other actors here do a great job as well, except for Robert Hines (who plays the pointless character of Kirsty's boyfriend Steve) who really has no business being in the movie at all as he brings nothing to the story whatsoever. Sean Chapman in particular owns as the S&M obsessed Frank. He plays a great antagonist whose actions set in motion the events of the movie. Aside from having a very compelling and intricate story, this movie has some of the best visuals I've ever seen as well. The numerous glimpses of Hell (which we see more of in the sequels) are simply superb as well as the monster makeup of the various creatures that inhabit it. I've never seen Lucifer's Pad depicted in such a vivid and imaginative way. I could go on and on about how this movie lives up to its reputation as one of the greatest horror films of all time but I'll end this review buy saying that anyone who enjoys fantasy films with great characters and special effects should check this one out.",Hellraiser
234,MacBalthus,"True, original and brilliant HORROR",8,7 July 2008,"Clive Barker gave the world a great flick when he realized HELLRAISER. The story is totally unique, original and interesting. It's more than enough to entertain throughout the running time. The effects are fantastic too (except maybe the sparkles from time to time, but hell, it was 1987...), especially the sequence of Frank's return. It's nearly perfect and done without the pansy CGI of today. This was done in good old fashioned handcraft and it's beautifully horrible. The actors don't have to do much (and they don't) to make their figures fascinating since all the leading characters are unsurpassed in their complexity, at least in the horror genre. They are all pretty crazy and somewhat insane but the way they interact is utterly believable and keeps the viewer on the edge. The cinematic look of HELLRAISER sent more chills down my spine than any other horror flick so far. The Cenobites and their ""hound"" are impressive designs and pieces of art themselves. Pinhead definitely deserves his place next to Freddy, Jason and Michael. His iconic look hasn't been surpassed by another creature in my knowledge and this is a rare thing in the age of the ""guy with a long knife and a messed-up family"". HELLRAISER is great. It's the HEAT of horror. A neat, slick and fine story, matching look and memorable creatures. Forget about crap like HOSTEL or HOUSE OF WAX and watch this jewel!",Hellraiser
235,ethansales,Clive is an absolute G/10,7,3 January 2021,"As a directorial debut in horror, I am willing to compare Clive Barker's brilliant way to begin a horror career to Ari Aster and Robert Eggers and Jennifer Kent. Although not perfect, for a film made in 1987 the technical control is very impressive especially when found within what can be such a tacky genre.The performances and the scripts reliance on human interactions and not alien worlds or body horror grounds the film in realism, our 3 leads all delivering grounded and realistic enough performances. Clive cleverly created a domestic thriller centred around an affair to also be a brilliant horror film exploring sexuality, pain and pleasure.Although the film does, like almost every horror film, spend the last 5 minutes taking a step slightly too far, the bizarre end doesn't rip any meaning out of the film it just dates the experience a bit. The fact the script hardly features any particularly overt exposition and yet it is an entirely comprehendible viewing although leaving some room for ambiguity is a marvel in a horror film.This films quality greatly surprised me and of the classic 6 horror icons of the screen, I think with the exception of Halloween (1977) you'll be hard pressed to find a film part of the Chucky, Freddy, Jason, Pinhead, Leather-face and Ghost face of greater quality than this.To include such body horror and unique, sadistic and sexualised designs for creatures in a horror film and for it to not feel wrong but instead be a crucial element to the themes of the film is another surprise.A Horror classic for a reason.",Hellraiser

Back when horror movies were straightforward without being stupid; gory without being senseless; and freaky without resorting to cheap tactics (like jump scares-- God, I hate those).What am I talking about? The 1980's had plenty of those. Luckily, Hellraiser isn't one of them. Having recently read the novella from which this is based on, I can say that this is an almost totally faithful adaptation--and any changes in the movie are improvements over the original source material. That's a rarity for book adaptations, for sure--but then again, maybe it's because Clive Barker, the writer of the original novella, decided to adapt it on his own.

A few disturbing images are enough to do the trick. Barker cleverly focuses on the sexual aspects of fear and violence and his cenobites are really a sight to see.

The three other main roles (Clare Higgins, Oliver Smith, and Doug Bradley) are strongly played due to Barker obviously caring about the roles.

239,Whizzer-2,A Mixed Experience,8,12 October 1999,"I have conflicting emotions about the 1987 horror film, ""Hellraiser"", based on British writer, Clive Barker's novella, ""The Hellbound Heart"".  While the basic concept is fascinating -  involving unfortunate people who open puzzle boxes akin to a Pandora's Box From Hell, thereby unleashing a motley crew of demonic denizens called Cenobites to plague them - and the makeup and special effects being highly effective, if not horrific; the film's incoherent storyline and relentlessly grim atmosphere made viewing a somewhat mixed experience. Perhaps it was the film's utter lack of humor (recall Freddy Kruger's wit), pervading cynicism and sense of despair thatsubliminally discomforted me the most. ""Hellraiser"" is not a particularly frightening film, but it is an effectively gut-wrenching, gruesome one.  With a better script and a few deft strokes of levity, it might have become a genuine horror classic; nevertheless, in spite of it's shortcomings, it has managed to attract a dedicated cult following. ""Hellraiser's"" cult status, arose mainly due to it's outstanding character, Pinhead, the Head Cenobite (played superbly by Doug Bradley).  Pinhead is unspeakably cruel and takes great sadistic pleasure in tormenting his victims.  I even think that he might have a dual sadomasochistic element within him, as he too was once human and suffered the same torments, and seems to empathize with his victims in a perverse sort of way, i.e., he enjoys the scenario precisely because he can re-experience his own previous suffering vicariously, and at the same time, still relish the hellish pain he currently inflicts upon them! Very twisted if true! The multiple pins or nails that protrude from his face and bald head are stark, grim reminders of the the agony he once endured. ""Hellraiser"" is not for the squeamish, or those who have depressive maladies - if any film conveys an unremitting picture of eternal gloom and doom, of suffering and damnation, it is this one. Paradoxically, ""Hellraiser"" is entertaining to the extent that it appeals to  perverse, sadomasochistic elements that lie deep within the bowels of human nature.  Gruesomely repulsive on one level, yet morbidly fascinating on another. Perhaps the redeeming value of ""Hellraiser"" is an educational one, that is, it presents atheists and other secularists who discount traditional notions of Hellfire and Brimstone, with the distinct, thought-provoking possibility that a different, far more bizarre kind of Transdimensional Hell might exist.",Hellraiser
240,klesker,Painfully Average,7,24 October 2003,"To the bulk of my friends this is one of the greatest horror movies ever made. My opinion differs at a huge tangent.That's not to say that this is a total failure. Clive Barker is true visonist and knows how to make a stylistic film. Nearly every shot in this film is beautifully done and, towards the end, helps to build up the tension that leads to the anti-climax of the century.This is a film that relys entirely on gore for its scare tactics and, in my opinion, that does not make a good horror film. The greatest horror films are the ones that use psychological effects to play with the viewer and, ultimately, scare the hell out of them.This is where the film falters as, with every psychological scare tatic that is use, the film makers thought it would be scary to finnish them off with the most outragous gore i've seen.This is Clive Barker's best film but this is out of a career of disturbingly awful films so that's not saying much. All in all there are a few good moments in this film but it is purely gore driven and, in the end, a man's entrails spilled across the floor does not make a scary horror movie.3/5",Hellraiser

243,rockproductions,A Most Misunderstood Horror Film,10,18 July 2005,"I love to read what others say about ""Hellraiser,"" but it never fails to amaze me, even in regards to people who love this film, how much many misunderstand it. People write on & on what great horror icons the ""Cenobites"" are, & yes this is true, they have made a huge impact to cinema horror, but the ""Cenobites"" are not what this truly intelligent horror film is about...no, not at all! This is a film about Frank & Julia. Frank will stop at nothing to find the next thrill, even if it means his physical & metaphysical destruction. Julia is the cool aloof wife of Larry, Frank's brother. Julia is seduced by Frank's dark & sadistic sexual aura, though that same aura lay dormant in Julia until Frank awakened it by seducing Julia before her wedding to Larry. ""I'll do anything,"" Julia desperately confesses to Frank to keep his affection. Little does Julia dream that in the future that will be exactly what she has to do to keep Frank, after he unleashes ""the Box,"" & its horror, the Cenobites. In what is truly an Oscar worthy performance, Julia (Claire Higgins) the aloof, but so far non-threatening wife transforms into the murderous, cold, calculating queen bitch, to resurrect & have Frank. To bad we've not seen more of her in other films.Yes, ""Hellraiser"" is about treachery in the family, the worse sort, deception & murder. ""Hellraiser"" is about blind love.(Spoilers) Larry's unswerving devotion to Julia, which makes him the last to know, & seals his doom. ""Hellraiser"" is about the tragic plight of Kristy trying to save her father. What could be worse than knowing a loved one is going to be murdered & you could not stop it? ""Hellraiser"" is about real life plausible situations that are better off left alone, the darkest part of the human psyche, to want something so bad you're will to sacrifice anything & anyone to achieve it, maybe even your self. ""Hellraiser"" aptly uses the theme of don't tempt fate (""the Box""), unless your prepared to be taken by it, as the ""Cenobites"" so profoundly demonstrates.So yes, the true monster of this story is ambition & want. The ""Cenobites"" are just a cataclysmic vehicle (a very disturbing one) to carry Julia & Frank to their just deserts in the end. ""Hellraiser"" made the ""Cenobites"" seem like ultimate bogeymen by giving them little screen time & keeping them mysteriously cryptic to the audience, something later films could've benefited from. Thus ""Pinhead"" & crew were much more menacing & potent in this first, & by far the best, most intelligent film of the series, & in horror cinema.... But again, it was Julia & Frank, & their ambition & want that were the true terrors here. Nothing is more disturbing & horrific than discovering someone(s) you love & trust will eventually murder you.Chilling!",Hellraiser
244,Ben_Horror,The Citizen Kane of gory horror movies,9,12 February 2010,"The 80s were a prolific time in terms of horror movies. Usually you had a memorable villain (think Leatherface or Freddy) slaughtering a bunch of nubile teens in tried and tested fashion. Genre defining though they were, these movies always followed the same well-worn modus operandi: at their most basic level they were simple body count films. But one stood out from the pack: Hellraiser.Based on the Clive Barker novella The Hellbound Heart, Hellraiser eschews the old stalk and slash routine in favor of something more cerebral. Even if it's just as gory and violent as the aforementioned films, Hellraiser has that very rare thing unseen in movies of this type: intelligence. This is as far from a Friday the 13th re-run as you can get. The movie is extremely well crafted with intricate characters that have complex arcs all set against an interesting story. Clive Barker directs with a lot of panache and evident technique, and the film has an almost surreal art house quality about it. Barker clearly knows what he's doing. Compare how this was shot with other horror movies made at the same time and you will see noticeable differences. The movie has a lot of style and substance thrown in with some genuinely distressing visuals.It also has a very imaginative story line. Frank, a man with a rather dubious past, solves a mysterious puzzle box and is rewarded with a trip to hell where he's mutilated for entertainment purposes by three demonic beings called 'Cenobites'. However, after being resuscitated by his brother's blood, he uses his love starved sister-in-law Julia – who he had a past affair with – as bait so that she can lure horny men back to their house so that he can feed on their blood and become a human again. The only problem is the hellish Cenobites come looking for him and all hell ensues. Clad in leather the Cenobites themselves resemble mutated entities from The Matrix (and remember this was twelve years before that movie was even made) and just like that movie, this one also has a similar fetishist quality about it.Andrew Robinson, who plays Frank's brother Larry, has certainly done his share of menacing characters in his time (The Scorpio Killer in Dirty Harry for example). But he does a complete about turn here and is the very epitome of decency – surely the hallmark of any great actor when they can alternate between roles. Likewise, Ashley Laurence, with her acting talent and stunning good looks playing the role of his daughter Kristy, creates a more sympathetic and interesting character than all the expendable bimbos from countless horror movies. Meanwhile Claire Higgins plays it cold and calculating and is really effective as Julia - Larry's wife – the woman who sets everything on its downward spin.This is also the movie that gave us a truly iconic character to rival Freddy Kruger in the form of 'Pinhead'. Even though he is never actually referred to this name, Pinhead cuts an imposing and strangely tragic figure when we first see him with all those nails driven into his face. Doug Bradley invests his limited role with a lot of depth - another rarity. This is no idiotic knife-wielding thug: we know instantly Pinhead actually possesses intelligence.The film has jaw-dropping effects: it's full of astonishing scenes that still hold up today. Most appealing of all is as this was made before the CGI era, all the effects are done with animatronics, optical effects and reverse footage. The disturbing metamorphosis scene where Frank comes back to life is similar to the one seen in An American Werewolf in London in that we get a no holds barred, shot by shot transmutation of a creature in all its gory (and gooey) glory. Unlike that scene, however, which was over lit, this one is photographed with more a more effective and moodier lighting scheme. Gut wrenching though it is, the scene also has a strange kind of beauty to it. It's quite nice (if icky) to look at. Beauty in blood and guts – there are not many horror movies that can boast a contradiction like that.Hellraiser was clearly ahead of its time. Its influence on movies that came later cannot be underestimated. After all, this is the film that gave us the whole 'Torture Porn' genre at least two decades before the term had even coined by the media. Movies like Saw and Hostel owe a lot to it and could not have existed without Hellraiser paving the way first. Even though these movies are a dime a dozen now, this was something new in its day, giving us an unflinching view of bodies being mutilated and torn apart in gratuitous fashion. But even at that, there was always something more going on than just simple gore: Hellraiser is about the desperate steps a woman will take to rekindle an unforgettable past affair.There is only one sticking point, though: in a movie that's supposed to be set in England, why is it that all extras/supporting players speak with badly put on/dubbed American accents? There is no logical reason for this. It's a bad call in a film that does almost everything else so well.For the remake there's no question they will replace a lot of the practical effects we see here with 'state of the art' CGI. But will it look as good in twenty years? Probably not, but the original will still have the raw power it has today. That's the hallmark of any great movie. This has more ideas in ten minutes than lesser horror movies have crammed into their entire 80 – 90 minute running times. And while it may not be to everyone's tastes – least of all those with easily upset stomachs - Hellraiser remains a masterpiece of imaginative film-making, as brilliant and significant now as it was on its original release.",Hellraiser

I can't think of a horror film that was this comfortable with sex, kink, and fetish elements and I can't think of one that came after this either. Hellraiser isn't afraid to wallow in sexual depravity while offering everything one could want in a horror film.

248,Was-it-All-a-Dream,Hellraiser (1987),7,4 May 2009,"The 1980's was the most interesting and funny decades in horror, with newer technology, improved special effects, and more reliance on shocking visuals than mood. Though a more serious and discriminating fan than myself would have found it silly, I found even the lesser movies amusing on one level or another. Toward the mid-80's, the slasher genre kind of died a slow, horrible death. The idea that sex would doom you to death from any one of an assortment of lame killers in masks of all sorts (a clown mask, a gas mask, a hockey mask, etc) was replaced by fears of aliens landing from outer space (Critters, The Borrower, The Blob remake, Killer Klowns from Outer Space, etc) and weird mutant monsters of all shapes and sizes (Child's Play, Pumpkinhead, Scarecrows, Leviathan, Neon Maniacs, etc). Then we got ""the devil"" scared back into us with religious horror films such as 1987's The Believers, 1984's Children of the Corn, 1988's The Seventh Sign. And this ""s&m"" horror film about the sexualized, purgatory-like dimension between heaven and hell where cursed people dare to travel to test their endurance for an eternity of pleasurable suffering.Hellraiser, from gay cult-author Clive Barker, was a low budget horror film with sophisticated performances by the seductive, vampy, goddess-like Clare Higgins playing the glamorously bitchy 'Wicked Stepmother'-from-hell, and Sean Champman, her bad-boy lover who transforms into the elegant and brooding Oliver Smith (covered in unbearably repulsive makeup and goop). The plot is interesting. Because it's a series of ideas arranged in a way that suggests the writer has no idea why he's writing this way. I haven't read any of his stories, but I'm told they're pretty loopy. And that he often writes without knowing the meaning behind what he's writing. The primary lead character is Julia, the stepmother. She has had an affair with her stuffy husband Larry's rebellious, black-sheep brother Frank, and as the movie begins, she and Larry and moving back into his old family home. Which is also the place Frank last inhabited before he mysteriously disappeared. Skipping ahead, Frank returns but isn't human, and as he hides in the disgusting, dirty attic, he guilts the sexually frustrated Julia into cruising bars for lonely men to bring back to the house for Frank to feed on, using their blood to grow him new human body parts.I wish I knew what was interesting about that. If anything, I applaud the film's ability to make any of that seem sophisticated. But it does. The dialogue is decadent and often deceivingly poetic. Which kind of presents a problem, whenever a character has to curse or say something crude- it doesn't feel authentic. Until those moments, the movie is using the gruesome special effects and monster designs to do the job of being crude so that the movie doesn't have to make the characters stupid. Not that it matters much. When the score's strings start to swell and row, you're just waiting to see what happens next. It's very arresting. One of my absolute favorites is the very long and breath-taking scene where we meet the secondary lead character Kirsty - Ashley Laurence - and follow her as she walks all the way from an industrial harbor port to the upstairs in her father's house, on a gloriously breezy and overcast day. This movie wants to be quite ugly and gritty, but there are a lot of moments that defy that ambition and look damn good! Another favorite of mine is the gorgeous outdoor bar where Julia meets her first victim. Yet another is a brief sequence with Kirsty and her father in an oriental restaurant. For a low budget movie, the quality of the lighting, cinematography, location shooting, etc, truly look impeccable.Inevitably, a film like this would have a few flaws. This is Barker's best film but the flaws are first-time-director mistakes. Like, a completely out-of-place closeup of Kirsty looking very intensely upset being edited into the sequence of her walking up to her father's house. That's out of place because she is smiling in every other shot of her in this sequence. That is unquestionably the biggest error in the movie. The others are simple awkward slip-ups that could have been smoothed out with alternate takes. The film slides around all throughout in terms of how professional it feels. It's more plot-driven than just a gorefest, so professionalism is definitely an important consideration. The ending feels a little long in the tooth. Did anyone else think it was silly for Kirsty to have to open and shut the puzzle box every time she had to send one of the Cenobites away? That got on my nerves like repetitive actions can for some viewers. Also, there are some images that just aren't all fans might crack them up to be. Especially, that ugly big orange worm. God that damn thing was ugly. Why was it there at all? This isn't Labyrinth. Also, the design of the twist-face corpse was too much like those from John Carpenter's The Thing. And... why does it look like those rats are eating pureed bone fragments?Overall though, the film's a winner. It makes you think. Gives you many images and situations you've never seen before in the genre. And manages to have a real grace to the way it combines the more classy elements - like Barker's amazing monologues for Frank and Pinhead, the famous ""lead Cenobite"" character (and would go on to become a legend in the horror hall of fame) - with the grotesque (for the most part). There's a lot of talent and flair for photography and mood (in spite of the pretty amateur special effects). The music mainly works, though it's a bit overly orchestral and formal for my tastes. Could have experimented a bit more. Much like writer Clive, I imagine, with this storyline. But, I'll let him take care of his own inner demons.",Hellraiser
249,nutolm,Gory and creepy,7,4 August 2012,"The first thing that struck me was that the actors' performances was nothing to brag about, but I guess that wasn't the filmmaker's intention. Here the plot is in the centre, and this movie wouldn't be much without the magnificent special effects. The effects, the creatures and the make up, isn't only great, but they create the whole movie which now has the status as a cult movie. And they have made over half a dozen of them over the years.Accordingly, a classic horror movie with a pretty sick plot and a even more sick production design. This movie is very bloody and disgusting, and it all looks terrific with the superb effects, without any CGI involved. This is a type of movie that is suitable for Halloween, a movie you would want to see together with friends - not alone in the dark.Hellraiser is a bit strange and abstract, mostly because the female main character seduce the victims with sex. There is generally a strong sexual atmosphere in the story. That is perhaps not the most traditional theme for a horror movie, but surprisingly it works.A frightening movie - happy Halloween!",Hellraiser
250,saxon-7,A Barker Masterpiece,8,25 February 2006,"This is truly one of the classics in Horror and one of the bloodiest ones at that, considering the production year ('87). Clive Barker does a very good job at directing this as he should considering that it's based on a book of his (which I unfortunately haven't read at this time, so I can't comment on how good an adaption it is.) The whole idea of a puzzle box acting as a gateway to a Hellish dimension is very good and at the time original if not a bit H.P. Lovecraftian.The story also holds up nicely if somewhat surreal and the acting is splendid:Andrew Robinson does a formidable job as Larry Cotton; the thrilled owner of an inherited house. Clare Higgins is probably the one that does the worst of the main characters with a bit stiff performance as Julia Cotton; the wife with a semi-dark secret. Ashley Laurence does a very good job as Kristy Cotton; the daughter that gets caught up in the nightmare. Sean Chapman and Oliver Smith do a good job of bringing Frank Cotton/Frank the Monster; the somewhat adventurous brother, to life so to speak. And finally we have the best performance and the one that really bring this series to the fore, Doug Bradley as Lead Cenobite (Pinhead, big applause); the chain wielding Master of Pain and leader of this delegation from hell. If you haven't already seen this then I can only recommend it, it's the best one in the series (at least of the ones I have seen, which is 1-4, but I don't expect the last 4 to be better). If you're a Horror fan then SEE THIS, it's an absolute must in any horror fans collection. I give this 8 out of 10.",Hellraiser
251,bmoviep,A glimpse into the soul of humanity,9,24 April 2017,"""Hellraiser"" is a film that manages to disturb viewers in all the right ways. It blurs the already nebulous line between pleasure and pain, mixing love with cruelty in a way that provokes curiosity into the raw vulgarity hidden within our subconscious. It's a violent and visceral experience, but takes meticulous efforts not to waste a single drop of blood. Despite the plethora of carnage there is no excess. Every disgusting detail serves to further explore a reality in which sin and vice are unfiltered by societal norms and where people wander endlessly in the pursuit of materialistic satisfaction. Within the tumult of lust and greed exist an order of demons referred to as the Cenobites. The Cenobites act as the gatekeepers of chaos. They shield us from the harsh realities of human nature and maintain order between the savage beast and rational being that make up the contradiction that is mankind. Through the Cenobites, we are given a glimpse into the darkest corners of the human soul, where fear and desire intersect and become indistinguishable from each other. A place we try to deny and turn away from, but is permanently engraved into our very being.",Hellraiser

She brings him men to kill which restores his body, piece by piece.As much a domestic drama as it is a special effects feast, Hellraiser isn't like many other 80's horror films. Clive Barker embraces the sexuality of everything in hopes of making the audience as uncomfortable as humanly possible and he succeeds. It's definitely not one for the whole family.

253,BrianCTyler,The great beginning to a great horror series,9,1 February 2006,"HELLRAISER (1987) directed by: Clive Barker starring: Andrew Robinson, Clare Higgins, Ashley Laurence, and Sean Chapman plot: Frank Cotton (Sean Chapman) is a man who seeks the greatest pleasures of life. He comes across the Lament Configuration, believed to open the doors of heaven or hell, he opens hell and is taken there and tortured by the Cenobites, Hell's minions. Later on, Frank's brother Larry (Andrew Robinson) and his wife Julia (Clare Higgins) move into the house. Julia had a secret affair with Frank and misses the night of passion she shared with him. One day, Larry is injured and his blood seeps through the cracks in the attic floors, and the blood brings Frank back to life as a skinless zombie. Julia helps Frank gain his figure back by bringing men from bars into the house to feed on. Soon, the Cenobites discover that Frank has escaped their grasp and Larry's daughter Kirsty (Ashley Laurence) is caught in the mix.my thoughts: This is one of the most original and shocking horror films out there. It is a family saga and a gory horror movie in one.I loved the characters and the actors portraying them. Especially Clare Higgins as the cold and conniving Julia, Ashley Laurence as the cute innocent Kirsty, and Doug Bradley as the Lead Cenobite Pinhead, who is one of the most popular horror movie monsters ever created.I loved how in this film, the Cenobites were left lurking in the shadows while the movie mainly focused on the Cotton family. Loss, love affairs and hints of past incest are what makes this a very provocative drama/horror film. I also loved some of the directing techniques - mainly going back and forth to Kirsty solving the puzzle and a rose blooming on the television. Christopher Young also provided one of my favorite horror scores, which is tied with Pino Donnagio's work on CARRIE.This film isn't without flaws though - the subplot with Kirsty's boyfriend brought nothing good to the film, especially since he can't act surprised. I mean, he comes to his girlfriend's father's house to find her battling demons with a puzzle box - and still there is no expression on his face. The special effects also show that the film is on a low budget.Still, this is one of the greatest horror films of all time and they do not make them like this anymore!",Hellraiser
254,ashturner-79373,"A carnal horror movie driven by great imagery, score and effects.",8,22 March 2019,"Some of the acting here just sucks - the sole exception is Ashley Laurence, whom this film introduces, giving a very promising first feature performance. It's not that the rest of the acting is all bad, but sometimes it really can be quite awkward, particularly during the scenes where Julia is seducing either Larry or other men. The situation isn't helped by some of the awkward dialogue (""nothing personal, babe"", etc.).The star of this film is the hellish plot, set-pieces and special effects, which have stuck in my head since I first saw the film. The Cenobites are awesome movie villains, and they're accompanied by a menagerie of other creatures like the Engineer, that homeless guy that turns into some kind of dragon at the end, and Frank. The love affair at the centre of it all, while not the most convincingly acted, is a good place from which to launch this story about resurrection and BDSM demons. There are some boring lulls, though, and it seems silly that Frank would betray Julia near the end.Christopher Young's score really makes all the romantic, sexy melodrama kind of epic in its own way. There's also some wonderful imagery in the more surreal sequences, as well as intensely-coloured blood and gore that's kind of beautiful to look at in its own way. Of all the great special and makeup effects, my favourite is Frank's horrifying resurrection early in the film. I also love the editing in the scene leading up to that, cutting between a flashback of Julia and Frank's first sexual encounter and Larry cutting his hand open and spilling blood everywhere.The theatrical and gothic tone is complemented well by heavy doses of horror and sexuality, making this a carnal viewing experience with an edgy, sacrilegious streak that manages to avoid feeling juvenile or angsty.8/10.",Hellraiser
255,joshstep41,one of the genre's finest,10,23 June 2002,"This is acclaimed horror/fantasy novelist Clive Barker's directoral debut. His first (and quite successful) attempt in the film medium resulted in a horror frenzy and the establishment of a new horror icon: a character that viewers affectionately dubbed ""Pinhead.""This film is far from flawless, but it is one of the genre's finest.  It was released in 1987, when the horror genre was dominated by mindless and degrading FRIDAY THE 13TH and NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET sequels.  This film firmly reestablished what a real horror movie should be.  Nauseously graphic and at times sensually compelling.  Barker taps into our souls and presents an eroticism through his portrayal of violence.  Death has never seemed so sexy.A cast of unknowns all perform well and a beautifully eerie score by Christopher Young builds an incredible atmosphere.  Writer/director Clive Barker's specialty of unique (and sometimes outright bizarre) characters along with a unifying mixture of sex and violence are all showcased in this film.A stylistic and sensual horror movie to mark the film debut of a horror master.  The ""Titan of Terror"" rules.  Welcome to his domain.",Hellraiser

Clive Barker's dark imagination shined through in this extremely gory cinematic experience that was clearly a well executed portrayal of his artistic vision. Not to mention, Pinhead, and all of the Cenobites really, might be some of my favorite designed characters in horror history. The whole cinematic ensemble was beyond talented in crafting the costumes and practical effects. In this instance, it looks even better than CGI. It's borderline disturbing and at times pretty creepy as it holds no punches back in the depiction of torture and mutilation. The storyline was also a strong point, while the acting was suffice able for what you come to expect out of horror movies in the 80's. I really enjoy it every time I watch it, so it's easy to give this movie a great rating.",Hellraiser
258,Koma-Mo,Iconic looking character with a hugely disappointing and mediocre result.,5,22 August 2019,"Ever since I was a child, the image of Pinhead really stuck in my mind. I've always thought that he was up there with Freddy and Jason when I was little, especially looking at mangas like ""Berserk"" which had character designs that were inspired from this movie. So I finally watched this film getting the answer that I've had toward why this film was never as popular as the other horror franchise and...I get it. This film really missed the ballpark for me and actually kind of disappointed me. The story is actually quite boring, none of the characters were engaging enough for me to root or hate them and the overall film was just bland. I understand that the film is not about these hell-spawns, but he is on the poster and him and his minions only appear briefly at the beginning and at the climax, for at least a total of 10 minutes. The rest involves a story revolving around these extremely unlikable characters.As I mentioned, none of the characters had any sort of depth to them and the performances were just as bland as well. Andre Robinson plays an oblivious and dull husband who had nothing to do but whine. Clare Higgins is the ""attractive"" wife whose motives were unclear on what she wanted to do and didn't understand how every male character was licking their lips toward her because her character was bland. Ashley Laurence as the daughter character does nothing special until the climax and Sean Chapman as Frank is your typical villain. There was no one whom I was interested in and none of them were engaging enough to make this horror flick even the slightest interesting to watch. Even when things were hitting the fan, I was just blankly watching the film wondering when it will end.This may sound sadistic in my part, but I thought the gore and the overall violence presented here was great and it does hold up well. When you see some of the torture scenes, especially with the make up on some of the characters, it looks disgusting and just creepy. Even the look of Pinhead and his minions was pretty cool, for the short time they were on screen. As a horror flick, this is the only satisfying part of the movie. Everything else revolves around this bland story with nothing scary happening until the climax. The plot really lacked common sense as there were things that were not fully explained or briefly described in a quick exposition. The main focus of the film was to leave that scarring image in the back of your mind and when you see it, I think it does succeed on what it does. But regarding the presentation, this film just really didn't do it for me.I really cannot recommend this, unless you are interested to see some gore and just to see Pinhead give some lines here and there.",Hellraiser
259,Django-21,Still a classic!,8,10 March 2001,"I just watched this again for the first time in years and half expected to be disappointed.  But no, Hellraiser remains a true classic of the horror genre and is just as I remembered it. I can't agree with those who describe the acting as ""mediocre"".  I found Andrew Robinson, Clare Higgins and Ashley Laurence to be quite natural in their portrayals (Robinson does ham it up a bit towards the end but even that's perfectly in character for who he's playing and at that point in the story). Some would complain about the characters being unpleasant but I think adults deserve some entertainment of their own without ""Leave it to Beaver"" representations of life.  The unpleasantness of Frank and Julia is in keeping with the EC Comics traditional horror feel to the story. The special effects sequences (particularly the resurrection of Frank) were still just as impressive.  If you have any passion for horror films I think there's something here for you, whether you're into the arthouse, gore or traditional horror storytelling approach or if you're looking for something unique or different. This is a dark and sombre film and there is a lot of gory effects and some surreal moments.  Clive Barker's direction and the hammer murders owes some debt to Pete Walker's 70s horror movies but much of the film is truly his alone.  The cenobites and the way corpses are resurrected are unique and innovative.  Christopher Young's musical score is an integral part of the film's grim baroque mood.  I would still recommend this to fans of strong horror.  A justifiable classic.",Hellraiser

They move into a house owned by Larry's brother, Frank, who's mysteriously disappeared and, all of a sudden, things start getting super weird. We learn that Julia had an affair with Frank years ago and that he was probably the best sex of her life. Larry gets injured and a few drops of his blood, somehow, reanimate Frank. Julia, seeing this as an opportunity to get some of that good sex again, agrees to bring a series of men to her home and kill them so that Frank can replenish himself. Things get even more complicated when Larry's daughter, Kirsty, starts thinking something fishy is going on. Did I also mention that this all revolves around a strange puzzle box that unleashes a group of demons in S&M gear?Hellraiser has A LOT going on for a 90 minute film and it's amazing that it accomplishes everything it sets out to do. It does help that it has a fairly small amount of characters and takes place in mainly one location. The performances, especially by Clare Higgins as Julia, are far better than average for a film of this sort and the special effects are pretty terrific and gruesome.

262,stencilman,Brilliant Lovecraftian Horror,8,7 March 2014,"Clive Barker's Hellraiser takes everything you find icky, disgusting, disturbing and puts it into a nicely wrapped package complete with a bow on top of it. However, it has some crucial ingredients that other violent movies mostly do not-intelligence and a respect for the audience. It's a deceptively smart movie which doesn't spoon-feed information to it's audience. Barker was involved in another such horror movie-Candyman which is equally superb.The film also has a very good final girl who actually does stuff to get herself out of trouble. Regardless of whether it works or not, at least this girl did something rather than stand like a prop being completely useless. This film even had the first appearance of an iconic horror villain-Pinhead who has a pretty short role and doesn't get to do much here but is no less menacing.The Cenobites could easily belong to whatever dimension Cthulhu crawled out of. The inspirations from Lovecraft and Poe are evident and Barker makes sure that the movie sticks to it's vision to the bitter end. The special effects for the most part are excellent, especially the gore effects although some effects towards the end are a bit tacky courtesy an ultra low budget.Regardless, Hellraiser is a true horror classic - scary, strange, horrifying. It also retains it's power to shock 20+ years later. Highly Recommended!",Hellraiser

264,Banshee57,Beautiful fantasy/ horror is still affective today.,10,25 April 2005,"Certainly, one would figure pinhead the central character for the film ""Hellraiser"", but he who thinks this because of what he sees will be enchanted by what the film really is. Pinhead is merely a creature, only viewed in vital moments of a twisted love story involving otherworldly torture. He is not even called pinhead, he is the lead cenobite, and he will tear your soul apart!The story has a strong narrative hold on a family, and the unresolved matters they have never approached. Such matters include drugs, theft, scandal, love, lust, and demonic dealings. Larry Cotton and his 2nd wife, Julia are happy, cozy, and ready to break new ground as they move into the new home. Unbeknownst to them, an unwelcomed family member is waiting, and so is the awesome force that sealed his fate in life, and in death. This film has more than demons and angels. This film has a plot. Julia helps frank after he narrowly escapes death. Slow, and sure, she feeds him blood, and the lust for life, love, and control takes over the both of them. Soon, Larry's daughter, Kirsty is involved, and the real nightmare begins. This film is more of a fantasy than anything else, as it plays on mystical elements like dreams, love, life, and death. Barker crafts his original novel, titles ""The Hellbound Heart"" into a fantastic mold of a supernatural plunge into a very messed up family. More so, this film is a tale of otherworldly pain and torture. Torture is not just the killing, it is the emotional state that Julia is trapped in, as she loves Larry...at first. Soon she is torn between real love, and the lust for pleasure, both physical and emotional. The cenobites take all the emotions, and play with them as though they were throwing a ball back and forth. Barker introduces hell as both emotional, and physical states of mind. No matter where the characters are, hell is what they get. Brilliant performances also highlight this one, with special effects that challenge even todays standards. Good Job Barker!",Hellraiser
265,GaryKurt101,Sex Makes Women Crazy,9,7 October 2018,"That'd be a good alternate title for this film. Although the franchise's most enduring and popular character, Pinhead, probably has 5 minutes of screen time in this original film (he even made the poster!), Hellraiser's major star is Julia Cotten (a brilliant icy-cold Claire Higgins) who sets the story in motion by basically being a bored, unsatisfied housewife. Yes, folks, this movie isn't what you'd think it is. In fact, it has more in common with a kitchen sink drama than it does most horror films. For some, this would be a huge turn off, but for me, I adore it. I've always felt the best horror films are ABOUT something - not just mindless blood and guts. Clive Barker grounds his story (adapted from his own novella) in realism so that the most fantastical elements don't make us roll our eyes. The thing is - Julia and her boring husband, Larry (the great Andrew Robinson, who gets to go from lifeless dweeb to predatory psycho throughout the course of 90 minutes), have just moved into a house previous owned by Larry's hedonistic brother, Frank. Frank's gone missing, but after Larry's cuts his hand on moving day, the drops of blood, somehow, end up reanimating his corpse (y'see, we already know Frank met a nasty end from the prologue) and he needs Julia to kill men for him so that he can drain them of their blood and become whole again. So, why is Julia willing to do this? Well, she and Frank had a passionate, lusty affair before she married Larry and she's always pined for him (how good WAS that sex?). Julia seems pretty eager to give Frank whatever he wants. That is , if Larry's nosy daughter, Kirsty (a spunky Ashley Laurence) doesn't get in the way. Yes, there are always some strange hellish creatures that are summoned by a demonic puzzle box, some great special effects, and inventive set pieces one won't soon forget, but writer/director Barker keeps his story beautifully grounded in the real world and doesn't forget to make his characters human. Said characters are indeed a compelling, memorable bunch with Higgins' Julia taking center stage and becoming quite a memorable anti-heroine. This film's reputation as a horror classic is well deserved and, if you haven't seen it, check it out immediately. The film spawned a franchise with a spotty track record, but at least a few of the sequels do have some imagination and interesting ideas.",Hellraiser

270,ashboomstick-50540,'Hellraiser' 1987 Review: A Whole Bunch Of Evil People Living In A Harsh World Full of Demons,9,1 October 2018,"""We will tear your soul apart.""""What I care about is a new skin.""These are just a few lines muttered from some of the sick, depraved souls who make up the main storyline of this perverse, disturbed film known as 'Hellraiser'. This film actually contains only one good person in comparison to the other six characters who are just pure works of the devil, and the one character who is slightly disturbed, but means well. Before the average viewer decides to give this movie a go, they should understand a couple of things first. 'Hellraiser' is a highly disconcerting and troubling film, including many controversial themes such as violent treatment towards women, sexual violence, extremely vile and unspeakable pleasures (demon to some, angels to others) and most importantly, rivulets of blood and gore. Therefore, some reviews are mediocre because of the many vexed topics, shown in several detailed and gory visuals throughout the film. Many will be turned down by the film because of it, but if you do decide to watch it, with the exception of some mediocre acting, the film is masterful, considering the expectations that arise while watching a horror movie. In it's best moments, 'Hellraiser' is a horror film about the slow, ever so palpable feeling that that there is an abundance of evil in this world. Ninety percent of the characters in this film are trying to accomplish evil tasks. One could argue that these characters decide that its a decent idea to commit sins of the highest level because of the one object that propels the film forward, and the souls stuck inside it. A big golden box, called The Lament Configuration. If the box is opened, it opens up a portal to another world, (essentially hell) where four demons, known as the Cenobites rule this land of what is considered pleasure (angel) to some, or torture (demon) to others. So, in the first scene of the film, someone unleashes hell and opens the box. What follows is some of the most unsettling, torturous and yet deliciously pleasurable scenes in the history of horror and possibly the entire film industry.The reason why the film is so pleasurable and brutal is because of these Cenobites, and the extreme blood and gore. If it wasn't for these scenes full of carnage then the movie would just be full of miserable performances, and distasteful plot holes. So every time you enter this insane world, you can thank me for luring you into the deranged world of 'Hellraiser'.'Hellraiser'=90%

271,TheCharles,S&M On another level,8,6 March 2016,"Kirsty Cotton:"" Who are you?"" Lead Cenobite: ""Explorers in the further regions of experience. Demons to some, angels to others.""It puzzles me that a movie like Hellraiser is so underrated. Everyone has heard of the franchise and Pinhead, but for some reason this movie has been left out on many Classic Horror movies lists. Despite not having that much psychological suspense, it still remains a solid movie in my eyes. Sure, the acting is a bit wooden and the very few special effects are plain bad but it's nothing that'll ruin your experience. It seems that the make-up artists've enjoyed themselves with Hellraiser as the results are absolutely astonishing. The Cenobites, with their alien- like appearances, look like they came straight out of your nightmares, only to cause you even more nightmares. Clive Barker's grim and raw Body Horror, Hellraiser, remains an unsung movie that every Horror fanatic should see. You could say it's S&M on another level.",Hellraiser
272,resetzero,"""A concept with no story"".",1,2 June 2017,"This is a movie that I don't have much to say about. Its bland, the acting is terrible, the special effects make up, and CGI are sub-par, there is no story whatsoever, the film style is ugly, and the characters are annoying. I have heard people say ""give it a break, it was 1987"", to which I say Star Wars was made in 1977, Alien was made in 1979, The Fly was made in 1986, all of which are miles ahead of Hellraiser in every aspect. This is just an example of a visual artist basing an entire movie around something that would've simply worked as a painting, and in my opinion, that is all this film is. One long painting. A concept with no story. The people who idolise this movie do not idolise it as a movie. They idolise the imagery, which is why they collect models, and posters of Pinhead and the Chatterer, because they enjoy the imagery. No one ever said ""I love the story in Hellraiser"", and no one ever will.",Hellraiser
273,johnhomicidal,Great Adaptation,8,8 November 2005,"One of the most disturbing films of the 80s, Hellraiser managed to transcend the mindless teen slasher flicks of the day to become one of the most hailed horror films ever.Adapted from the 1985 novella, The Hellbound Heart, Hellraiser tells the story of a family menaced by otherworldly demons who consider your pain their gain. Fully decked out in the whole S&M regalia, the demons (which include Pinhead and Chatterer, among others), are truly terrifying. There are minor differences that were lost when the novel was adapted to the screen, such as the moving of the Kirsty character from close family friend to daughter. Also, in the novel the demons weren't quite as colorful or descriptive as in the film.If you really liked this one you should definitely move onto Hellbound: Hellraiser II, which many consider to be superior.",Hellraiser

275,kscaduncan,We will tear your soul apart!,8,16 April 2001,"This is considered by many to be Clive Barker's best film and it is not hard to see why. Frank Cotton has acquired a chinese puzzle box which offers the gateway to either Heaven or Hell. Unfortunately, Frank chooses Hell and he is torn apart by hooks. After a mysterious figure picks up Frank's remains and re-sets the puzzle box, we see Frank's brother, Larry, move in with his wife, Julia, and his daughter, Kirsty. When Larry injures himself and spills blood on the floor, Frank comes back to life in skeletal form. He confronts Julia ,who he once had an affair with, and asks her to supply him with bodies to feed from so he can be whole again. Julia agrees and brings home several victims and kills them with a quick blow to the head with a hammer.Kirsty meets Frank and runs off with the puzzle box. She then opens it and it unleashes 4 evil demons called the Cenobites. They are about to take her to hell when Kirsty says that she knows where Frank is and is willing to lead them to him if they leave her alone in return. They agree to this and Kirsty goes back home to warn her father. But Larry isn't the man he used to be. I'm not going to reveal anything else so if you want to know what happens, go see this film. The cast do well with their roles but in particular, Andrew Robinson as Larry and Doug Bradley as the lead Cenobite who is also known as Pinhead. The Cenobites themselves are perhaps the most sadistic and evil characters in the history of film as they thrive on pain and discomfort. The film is also quite gory especially when people are torn apart by hooks. Some of the special effects do look a little dated nowadays but the film is still good. Overall, this is a film worth checking out as is the sequel which I have also reviewed on the site.",Hellraiser
276,Aphostile,"A Brilliant Eighties Horror Classic, Despite Some Flaws.",9,5 July 2002,"(WARNING: These comments contain some spoilers considering the movie is fifteen years old.)Like the novella, ""The Hellbound Heart"", that inspired it this film was wonderfully creative and captivating while at the same time morbidly dark, horrific and repulsive.  What was accomplished with such a modest budget is simply amazing, especially considering the limited experience Clive Barker had as a filmmaker.However the movie lacked the eloquence of the novella which probably explains why some were disappointed at the relative lack of sophistication. If you had read the book first you may have well expected Mr. Barker to work his poetic style of writing into the screenplay more than he did.Still, compared to its' eighties slasher flick peers, Hellraiser is high brow with an intelligent story and a surreal presentation reminiscient of Phantasm.I think the worst mistake was dubbing the actor who played Frank Cotton. Even if his accent is a little hard to understand, I can't imagine it being less effective than the obnoxiously wooden Godzilla-esque dub over that replaced Sean Chapman's natural voice.  I would love to see the British version someday as this unfortunately added an element of cheap cheese to the film that wouldn't otherwise be present.Frankendubbed aside, I found the performances to be adequate while mostly falling short of great.  Some of the dialogue definitely left something to be desired.  It's also somewhat silly that the toughest and smartest person of anyone in the story is a 17 year old girl.  Not that I have a problem with an intelligent 17 year old girl being the heroine, but she was the only one with any common sense.  She all but slapped the Cenobites around while crafty evil Frank was at their mercy.My only other complaint is how poorly the death of Julia was handled.  Not only did she die way too fast, but she looked long dead right afterwards. Perhaps it could be viewed as an artistic device considering the surreal nature of the film, but it definitely stands out.As much as I elaborated on the flaws, there was far more that I loved about Hellraiser.  Without the Cenobites this story would have been extremely creepy but they added to it an extra entertaining dimension of terror.  What was explained more clearly in the book was that Frank was convinced he was opening Pandora's box rather than Pinhead's.  It was well enough left out as even someone as foolish as Frank wouldn't have sought what he ended up getting.The Cenobites brilliantly represented the unknown as horrific sadomasochistic demons from beyond.  It's a shame that sequels were made, but it's a bigger shame that those who made them failed to realize that the less we know about these demons the more we fear them.There was just so much to be afraid of in this movie- numerous hideous Cenobites, Frank, Julia, and even a creepy evil eyed insect ingesting bum that Larry's daughter frequently encountered.  They all should have known better than to mess with Kristy!I loved the special effects!  Be sure your stomach is sitting well with you before you watch as Hellraiser is relentlessly gory.  At the same time, it manages to effectively convey the theme of the book- mankind's obsessions with pleasure.  I highly recommend both the film and the book for any fans of horror.",Hellraiser

Other scenes such as where the cenobites come into Kirsty's hospital just the introduction is scary enough to tell you trouble is coming other scenes I love include Kirsty's nightmare of seeing her dead father its one of the most bizzar scenes but then again there's nothing normal about this film to start with for a directing and screenplay first timer Clive Barker did one hell of a job with this movie,Hellraiser

This quote summarizes the film as a tale of sexually hungry individuals go to extremes to cap off their urges. Clive Barker is nothing short of genius. His sexually driven imagination and thirst for gore and blood turns this film into the perfect concoction. Barker's imagination also paved the way for some of the most well-known characters in horror such as Pinhead, who was portrayed by Doug Bradley.

280,morgan1976,Bloody disturbing fun!,7,19 August 2004,"I've been watching horror films ever since I can remember. The first one I really remember seeing was Halloween 2. I was 11 when I saw this film and it was the first horror film that really creeped me out after being desensitized by modern horror films (pre-1987). I remember lots of controversy about ""Hellraiser"" and it's sequel ""Hellbound: Hellraiser II"" about the amount of gore, sex, and violence and the MPAA wanting to rate them X (before NC-17). I can't believe my parents took me to see it! The acting is decent, but a little wooden. Some of the special effects are pretty silly, like the yellow and blue bolts of electricity (they were borderline-bad back in 1987), but they remain effective and aren't too distracting as some effects in the third ""Hellraiser"" installment. I remember, even at eleven, that the scariest parts of the film weren't with the cenobytes, but the scenes with Clare Higgins who plays Kirsty's wicked stepmother, Julia. She's cold, distant, calculating, sly, and evil. Uncle Frank is also menacing, but I wouldn't say he is as evil as Julia, but the incestuous feelings toward Kirsty are enough to creep anyone out. I also liked the fact that the films is not quite all-American or British. It makes the movie more accessible to both countries, while keeping that 'this-might-be-anywhere' feeling (like Willy Wonka--where the hell did that take place?). As an adult, this movie is still pretty shocking in it's gore and violence, but not as scary.",Hellraiser

The gore is some of the best I've ever seen. What I like about it is the camera does not flash away the second there is some gore, nor does it move and shake like Cloverfield. It just stays there, straight and steady, showing you every bloody, grisly detail. The make-up was very well done as blood and exposed flesh glistened in the light and looked very realistic. The scenes where hooks were tearing flesh were enough to make you cringe. The pools of blood and melted bodily fluids were great! It was amazing! Such a dark, Gothic mood to the film. I look forward to exploring the rest of this series as I am a fan of Clive Barker.See my profile for my rating philosophy.",Hellraiser

It is one of the best modern horror films ... very creative and original. Awesome storyline, but I do have to admit that the characters are dry and the acting isn't exceptional. Pinhead was more frightening in the original because his appearances were limited. In the sequels, Pinhead is the main character and there it is possible to have too much of a good thing. See the original, skip the sequels.",Hellraiser
283,antc,Looking for art in all the wrong places...,10,3 December 1999,"Horror movies are designed to be awful. These films rarely have any award goals in mind -- they're churned out by studios and carried by distributors because there's money to be made in scaring the pants off people. To critique such a movie on plot or acting does about as much good as complaining to McDonald's that there are no bananas on your hamburger. In other words, the product was never designed to support that feature.Some horror movies are less awful than others, and Hellraiser fits into this category. By virtue of being written and directed by the prolific horror/fantasy novelist Clive Barker, this is as close to a thinking man's horror flick as the genre will probably ever venture. This means there's a plot -- there's a reason that things go ""bump"" in the night of Hellraiser, and unless you're paying attention to more than the blood and gore, it won't make any sense at all.You'll have to see the movie yourself to figure it out. It's not rocket science.

288,jmcd7910,"Pretentious, overrated crap.",3,28 January 2018,"When Clive Barker first burst on the literary scene, I was enthralled. I went out and spent hundreds of dollars on first editions of the six ""Books of Blood"", which were individual volumes of Barker's short stories. ""The Hellbound Heart"" was in one of them. That's the story the movie is based on. I bought all his output, in first editions, as it came out. The man is a spectacularly talented writer, though probably insane.
But the films- oh, the films. I just rewatched this thing, and it definitely hasn't aged well. Reading the reviews, it's obvious most of the praise heaped upon this is because of the subject matter (which doesn't say a lot about the reviewers), not the film itself. The acting, such as it is, is atrocious. The dialog is juvenile, the characters unbelievable. Andrew Robinson is as sleazy and cringe-inducing as ever, and the special; effects are laughable. 
It's amazing to me that this piece of trash spawned more than a half dozen sequels.

289,maxnrisa,Horror movie makers could learn a lot from Hellraiser. Great film.,9,13 November 2001,"Good Points: This lovely little stroll down Horror Lane sports something that incredibly few movies seem to possess...an original story line.  Sit back and let this one burst into your brain 'cause you're not in Kansas anymore, kiddies.  Hellraiser is so amazingly horrific it defies comparison. And of course, having come from the mind of the Master of Horror himself, Clive Barker, it's no wonder that, in spite of its none-too-extensive budget, the original Hellraiser is one of the best horror movies I've ever seen.  It's strength lies in its compelling story and juicy makeup effects. The Angel of Death has nothing on the Cenobites.  One look at these twisted demons will send sane people scampering under their beds.Bad Points: After each bad point of Hellraiser, there's an understood ""...but that's because they didn't have the money to do better."" Masterpiece of Horror that it is, admittedly the acting and directing are nothing special, which is a shame because, in the hands of a truly talented director, Hellraiser could have been magnificent.  I believe the only cracks in the movie are budget-related with one exception: Who was the idiot who came up with the idea of dubbing over the voice of Sean Chapman (Frank Cotton) with some other dude in an attempt to give him a darker presence? Some people may not notice, but watch closely when he talks.  His mouth doesn't quite match up with the words in a few places.  And if that doesn't convince you, rent something else with Chapman in it and you'll see that Cotton's voice is not Chapman's.  How utterly cheesy.Bottom Line: Regardless of a few smudges, Hellraiser is one of the few genuinely fantastic horror movies we poor mortals can hope to rent. Barker is a master storyteller and the filmmakers did a decent job of bringing his hellish vision to the big screen.",Hellraiser
290,superzachary94,A Gothic horror classic!!,9,6 October 2014,"Hellraiser is a film that strays from the usual horror slasher craze of that time and delves deep into Gothic horror, Sadomastic torture and a truly terrifying look into hell.The film tells the story of a man named frank cotton who opens a mysterious puzzle box and is immediately torn apart by Pinhead and the cenobites, His brother Larry and his wife Julia move into his old house and it is revealed that she had an affair with frank and when Larry ends up cutting his hand, Blood start dripping down and brings frank back as a rotting corpse, Julia helps Larry rebuild himself before the cenobites find out he escaped, Larry's daughter kirsty finds out what is going on and now must stop frank and the cenobites who are now after kirsty.The acting isn't the best but is good overall, Andrew Robinson is good as Larry and Claire Higgins is great as Julia, The performance of Ashely Laurence as kirsty is really great and a very likable character, Doug Bradley as pinhead the lead cenobite is very intense and creepy and perhaps his best performance in the franchise next to bloodline.The special effects are top notch and show how powerful practical effects can be, Overall hellraiser is a classic horror film and my second favorite in the series behind hellbound, Highly recommended!!",Hellraiser

As a director though, he's only done 3 films including 'Hellraiser', Nightbreed and Lord of Illusions, both movies made in the 90's. As a horror writer though, some may declare him a little sick in the head, or just a little looney, but he's actually a very gifted man. Sure some of the stuff he writes is twisted, but it's brutally artistic and beautiful, the man is a legend in the business of horror. This movie though is actually very twisted, it's one of the craziest and creepiest horror movies I've had the time to check out lately.

The positives are that it's a unique concept, it has great practical effects that were definitely worth the effort, the acting is okay for a horror film and that's about it. Despite having a unique concept, the film does feel very basic and mainly relies on you being scared by blood and gore. With the villains of the film being the givers of pain and pleasure, they could have done a lot more with it, maybe even show the characters being put through some torture, but I don't mean have them castrated or branded, I mean psychological torture, because that's what sticks in people's mind. I'm not sure if I'm explaining what I mean very good, but the point is, if you're not afraid of gore (And this is 80's gore, the gore that looks fake) then you're probably going to hate this movie. If you are afraid of gore, I'd suggest you give it a try, just don't have high hopes",Hellraiser

The degrading quality of the franchise is something of a trick though as the original Hellraiser is not only spectacular, but it still retains significant impact. Clive Barker's directing debut is a whopper of a film (it helps he wrote it too) and there a plenty of things to admire about this low budget masterpiece of atmospheric weight and horrific and meaningful gore. At its foundation, Hellraiser is a film about domestic fracturing. And honestly, on its bare bones this story has been done before, but it's the details that make this story worth it. Character relationships, like the unusual connections between the step-mother and uncle and how the daughter is treated, make this film a little more human then what a normal story about opening the gate way to hell could have been if the focus was on the Cenobites and their arrival. It's these details with the characters, along with some stellar performances, are what make this tale so impactful and still very personal proportions.Oddly enough, for a film crafted in 1987, Hellraiser has aged like a fine wine that allows its little nuances to only get better with time. Many films date far too quickly, yet Hellraiser to this day still packs as much punch as it was the first time I saw it. Clive Barker and company do a lot of great things on this film, including character development, flow, set designs, and of course the horrific special effects, but what makes Hellraiser such a great experience is the little things. Like the quick and precise editing, the bombastic classical and creepy score, or even just some of the sound effects like the chiming bells in the back ground of the coming Cenobites. intense horror story with stunning special effects and atmosphere out the yahzoo.I must say that Hellraiser is still one of the best horror films ever made in my book. It's lasted the test of time and even though some of the special effects and clothing may seem dated (although I would argue the return of Frank is one of the coolest ideas and creepiest scenes I have ever witnessed) this film is one that will last on the books for its universality and its unabated boundaries.",Hellraiser
295,EtherealMind,Extremely disappointed.,4,20 June 2011,"I watched this movie last night for the first time expecting to see a film that was intelligent, suspenseful and genuinely interesting. My expectations were shattered the moment I realized how poor the acting was. The characters were lifeless, bland and just uninteresting. I just couldn't believe it - a film with such a promising reputation as a ""horror classic"" turned out to be a massive disappointment.The gore, while good for the most part, felt as if it was trying too much to save the film. The Cebonies were an interesting concept, I just wish they had more screen time and were developed more. If this movie was centered specifically around the Cebonies I might have enjoyed this film a LOT more. Instead, we have some guy with no skin needing his ex- lover to kill people for him so he can become fully human again. For me, this just doesn't work. The actress who played Julia was very poor I think and perhaps one of the biggest problems I had with the movie overall. I just didn't feel captivated by her acting at all - It was just wooden, contrived and artificial. If you're looking for an ""easy on the brain"" horror movie with plenty of gore then watch this. If you're looking for an intelligent, well directed horror movie that will get you thinking watch The Exorcist. I wouldn't say Hellrasier is a terrible movie, I just find it horribly overrated/over hyped. It most certainly does not deserve the title ""horror classic"" by any means.",Hellraiser

It's like you know the movie's being made by someone who, if they were at a party telling you about their recently written fictional story, would speak half of what he wants to say in his mind and the other half out loud. Since HE understands it all so well, he doesn't bother with trying to explain it all to us, because he unconsciously thinks we can all read his mind. Why a puzzle box? Why does it do what it does? How does Frank know about it if no one else has opened it (it was ""meant"" for him, after all, and no one else, according to the mysterious seller)? Where's the ""pleasure"" part of ""pain and pleasure"" come in? How are those disgusting creatures ""angels to some"" (if they're demons to someone like Frank who seems to have been on a quest for ultimate pain)? Does the box reveal different things if opened or closed a different way (seems to, but why and how, and where)?Was the house they were moving into and/or buying a house the husband had once lived in? Sounds like it was. After all, they didn't seem at all surprised to find that Frank had been living there (and why did they never ask each other about Frank, and where he might be now, why he was living like a bum, and when he'll be coming back?). And the most niggling question of all, why does the main family, and all their friends, keep referring to that mangy, dirty, dingy, moldy, stinky, dark, gooey, yucky house as ""A Great House!"" and ""A Terrific House!"" and ""You've got to see it to believe it!""

This is not a very fast paced horror movie, but also not too slow at the same time. I really think that the pacing is perfect in this movie. There is always something happening, but also not too much at the same time, so it doesn't confuse you. The acting in the movie is good. It's definitely not perfect, but i think the acting is still good and no one annoys me in any way. I also like almost all of the characters. There some characters in the movie that you're not supposed to like, so i don't like them. But the good thing is that they're not annoying, they're just.... kind of evil. But let's talk about one the best things about this amazing movie - the effects. Hellraiser has amazing gore effects. It looks really real and it looks better than most CGI in modern horror movies. And also this movie has one of the most memorable and iconic villains in horror - pinhead. Doug Bradley's performance is really good. Yeah i know i said that the acting is just good, but i think that Bradley is the only one who's really good. Overall, i can't describe how much i love this movie and i cannot believe that i didn't like it at first. It is one of my favorite horror movies of all time and i'll have to give it a 10 out of 10. check it out it you haven't already.",Hellraiser

High praise indeed from the grand master Stephen King.With the Cenobites — and Doug Bradley's Pinhead in particular — Clive Barker created a unique horror movie presence.""They're like sado-masochists from beyond the grave,"" Barker once said of the Cenobites. (In fact, Barker has joked that at one point he wanted to call the film ""Sado-Masochists From Beyond The Grave"" adding that ""Hellraiser turned out to be far weirder that I expected."") Pinhead was revealed (in Hellhound: Hellraiser II) to be Captain Eliot Spenser, a World War II veteran who had discovered a devilish box known as the Lament Configuration and found in it his own portal into Hell.

308,kroko007,Put the slashers away?,10,6 January 2006,"At its best, horror is one of the most subversive and confronting of film genres, able to tap into our deepest reservoirs of fear and anxiety and bring them oozing to the surface. Yet in the deeply conservative period of the mid to late eighties, horror's well ran bone-dry, as Hollywood proved unwilling, or unable, to break free of its own tired formulae, bombarding viewers with an endless succession of sequels and diminishing returns. In a little under ten years there were four inferior follow-ups to 'A Nightmare on Elm Street', a staggering seven sequels to 'Friday the 13th' - and every other horror director seemed to be just going through the motions, slavishly mimicking these long-expired franchises for all that they were (or, more to the point, were not) worth.Yet just when the world of horror had become oversaturated with moronically buff teen victims, unstoppable heavy-breathing slashers and undead paedophiles delivering sub-Schwarzenegger wisecracks, a young English director named Clive Barker came right out of left field to remind filmgoers what a scary place hell can be when presented with imagination and originality. 'Hellraiser', based on Barker's own novel 'The Hellbound Heart', was so many things at once - a haunted house movie, a sadomasochistic fairytale, a family tragedy, a gory piece of Gothic - and yet it was like no other film of its decade, and touched a raw nerve with its all-new horror mythology, its elegant narrative construction, and its unabashedly dark unpleasantness. In short, it was - and remains - a classic, able to get under the skin not least because for over half the film one of the main characters has none of his own.Larry (Andrew Robinson) moves back into the old family house with his frosty wife Julia (Clare Higgins) after his wayward brother Frank (Sean Chapman) has once again disappeared from the scene - but far from merely skipping town, this time Frank has opened the gates of hell with a mysterious box, and his soul has been taken to the outer limits of pleasure and pain. After Larry's hand is injured while moving furniture, a splash of his blood revives what remains of Frank's body, buried under the floorboards. Desperate to reform himself bodily (if not morally) with more blood, the skeletal Frank enlists the help of Julia, with whom he had once had a passionate affair, and she is soon enticing strangers into the house for him to suck dry. Yet when Frank's attention is attracted by Larry's pretty daughter Kirsty (Ashley Laurence), she is forced to cut a dangerous deal with the infernal Cenobites, once-human guardians who want their escaped ward back and will raise hell to get him.Full of images that instantly entered the nightmares of the collective unconscious - the puzzle box that opens a path to eternally exquisite torment, Frank's body rebuilding itself sinew by bloody sinew, and the Cenobites themselves with their radically pierced and surgically altered bodies (including their iconic and eloquent leader, who would be dubbed 'Pinhead' in the film's many sequels) - 'Hellraiser' is a horror film not to be missed, even if some may find the exotic pleasures which it offers to be cruel torture.Pluspoints:Everything Negative points:Ehm? to short?",Hellraiser

310,gellie618,The Kaballah of Hellraiser,10,12 August 2009,"(Words have been compromised to pass the spelling censor.)     The three designs evenly distributed on Pinhead's (Doug Bradley's) Hellraiser puzzle box represent The three forbidden secrets of the ""sacred mysteries"", which is always a tour through the Underworld, Hades, Sheol, the Bardo and also known as Hell. You will notice that first a central button is pushed. This face represents the ""witchcraft secret"" revealed especially on pages 170 and 171 of ""The Adventure of Self Discovery"" by Dr. Stanislav Grof and available from www.heliotrope.com .""Pain and pleasure indivisible"", it replaced LSD. ""You cannot enter the Underworld without the golden bough ( Vogel stimulation with the Vegas nerve)"", but, ""The road to Averness is easy"", Virgil, in his ""Aenied"". William Morgan was killed for revealing this secret. Second, two things spread and a finger is stuck in the gap. This represents the ""alchemy secret"" revealed in the earliest posts of Dr. Lahunkun in groups.yahoo.com/group/alchemy61/ . There you will learn how to make an opposite polarity cancellation reactor, which the ancients called a ""shekina"". Dr. Wilhelm Reich was killed for revealing this secret. And, third, the circle was traced all the way around by a finger. This represents the ""sorcery secret"", that there are other probability time lines that can be contacted, visited and used by taking advantage of the fact that the polarity cancellation equals the natural logarithm of the probability relationship. Did you ever notice that TV and movies about time travel always propagated that if you, messed with the past it could be disastrous for the world. First of all, you can't go back on your exact time line, like to meet your actual past self, for, the quantum probability wave crests prevent this by clashing. This is solid quantum mechanics. The propaganda that time was only one line for everybody was a lie, and it's denial a secret. But, we complained enough that Scientific American, in it's May 2003 article ""The Multiverse"" confessed that there are multiple time lines; and, the ""mutiverse"" is so infinite, for example, there has to be a real Pinhead somewhere, sometime, on some probability time line, in a ""multiverse' that has everything. And, each probability is repeated infinitely. Sorcery is probability manipulation. For example, rituals by manipulating probability distributions change time lines. Rituals are not ""witchcraft"". There is no real witchcraft without Vogel stimulation. ""If with but the faith of a mustard seed you say to this mountain move it shall be moved."" I knew a girl who bragged about the incredible bad luck she had. The more people who believed her the worse her luck became. It pays to control our speech. Rituals are sorcery. Dr. Franz Ludwig Boltzman was killed for revealing this secret, and THEY put S = k Lyn W on his gravestone. In ""Hellraiser II"", ""Hellbound"", we saw that Hell is structured in stone. Who builds in stone? What is a builder in stone called? THEY consider these secrets to be THEIR exclusive privileged property. THEY dare claim a monopoly on Hell! Recreational and entertaining place to visit, but you wouldn't want to live here. In Yahoo's Alchemy 61 you will learn how to explore the Underworld like us, ""explorers in the further regions of experience; demons to some, angels to others"".

311,Per_Klingberg,"Overrated and rather dull: influential though, I guess.",4,26 April 2003,"Well, this movie was a disappointment for me. I've always felt the horror genre have been mistreated in Hollywood industry and seldom is given a chance to reach it's full potential. That's why I expected something more from Hellraiser, I suppose. That other 80's slasherflicks such as Friday The 13th, low on both budget and intelligence, fail to scare me doesn't exactly surprise me. However, after seeing a few sequels to this movie I was favourably surprised. It sure isn't Dostoyevsky, but at least there was some substance to the script, and once in a while the director managed to create a chilling scene or two. So, after hearing people praise the original for it's originality and atmosphere, I figured this could be a truly frightening movie. It isn't, really. Unpleasant perhaps, being somewhat gorier than other Hollywood-produced horrormovies. But that doesn't make for an interesting watch. I found the plot badly executed, predictable and well...as I said, it didn't scare me. This is quite an influential film though, since several other movies lend the film's S&M-inspired style. But if you truly want to be scared out of your mind, I'd rather recommend In The Mouth Of Madness, a book by H.P. Lovecraft or perhaps one of David Lynch's darker moments.4/10",Hellraiser

314,Aurdreyen,A Good old fashioned horror,7,31 December 2011,"Hellraiser may not be the most brilliant movie out there, but for the horror genre, it's definitely one of the best. I rate my movies in 4 categories; Cintemography, Film-making, Acting and the overall experience. Cintemography: The visual presentation in this movie is average to positive. The house that the movie takes place in isn't the best suited for this movie, except for ""the room"", but it isn't bad either. When we meet the cenobites, then the cinematography gets superb. Seeing Pinhead and all his allies in their ""torture"" room is pure genius. 18/25Film-making: The film making is great in this movie, the dramatic camera angles make the most of the terror that the movie is trying to produce. 20/25Acting: The acting in Hellraiser is only great in some parts. Only the cenobites, and Frank, show true talent for acting. The father,step-mother and daughter are trying to hard and don't show anything decent. Of course where they fail, Pinhead, his gang and the zombie Frank make up for it. 18/25Overall experience: I quite enjoyed this movie, it was a change from the usual modern garbage they call a horror that most people are accustomed to.

315,trryancy,Intelligent film works on all levels,8,9 April 2005,"I don't get scared by movies, but if I could, this one would do the trick. As far as fright flicks go, this is the cream of the crop. A must-see for all self-respecting horror fans; I can't imagine anyone being disappointed.The best horror films, whether they rate high or low on the gore factor (and this one is about as high as it gets without pushing into NC-17 territory), work by engaging the viewer's most powerful, negative emotions. This one works overtime to evoke feelings of disgust, right from the get-go,focusing on the the mysterious peddler's filthy fingernails as he passes over that all-important puzzle box.Images like rats, flies, roaches, maggots,rusty nails, musty attics,and clear, slimy-gooey mucus/protoplasm stuff abound throughout the film. Whatever really makes makes you unbearably, squeamishly uncomfortable, it's probably in here somewhere, and not just in the visuals. The film touches on a host of disturbing, emotionally distressing themes, some fleeting, others more thoroughly. What's your personal sore spot? The death of a parent? Infidelity? Depraved sex? Creepy old houses? Hospitals? Incest? Being stalked? Personal betrayal? Necrophilia? Your family being threatened from someone outside? The fear of your own buried potential for violence, of going insane, of going to hell? Whatever it is, there's something here to gnaw at virtually anyone's rawest nerve- but better yet, it also provides eventual relief from all.The most fascinating element to me was the contrast between human and demonic evil. While the latter is the most horrifying, the former is by far th most evil. There's even a certain purity to the cenobites- they'll do horrible things to you, yes, but they won't lie; they have no reason to. I had the feeling that while the cenobites could not exist without human depravity, human depravity could very well exist without the cenobites, so who's the real monster here. There aren't too many innocent victims here, and most of the characters basically get what they deserve.I have only one gripe about this film- the blood. It's very, very, unconvincing- it looks like Smucker's strawberry flavored pancake syrup. With all the effort that went into making awesomely awful monsters, you'd think they'd gotten some halfway decent blood. Oh, well.",Hellraiser

Those are the three words I would use to describe this masterpiece of dark horror by Clive Barker, the man who Stephen King calls `the future of horror'.Those of a faint heart should keep away but those of us who can stand intense and horrific gore and gut-churning effects will be rewarded by a film that explores the very depths of human depravity. This isn't a movie about monsters, about a puzzle box or even about a guy with nails in his head; its about debauchery, incest and sex. The story, at its core, is a family saga and the puzzle box, named the Lament Configuration, is only a tool.When Frank Cotton escapes the clutches of the Cenobites, explorers in pleasure and pain, he seeks the help of his brothers wife (and his ex-lover) to bring him the blood he needs to be brought back to life. She uses sex to entice men to the house where she feeds them to Frank so that she can be with him again, towards the end of the film she sleeps with him whilst he wears his brothers skin! It is the relationships that drive this film.Still, the hero is around in the form of Kirsty Cotton, son of Larry and niece to Frank. She doesn't trust Julia, her step-mother which leads her to uncover Frank and meet the Cenobites. She gives the audience someone to root for and is well portrayed by Ashley Lawrence; her chemistry with Andrew Robinson as her father is readily apparent.The Cenobites, when they do appear, have a strong and terrifying image and the Lead Cenobite (later named Pinhead) is the ultimate in father figures; stern and to the point. The Cenobites aren't evil, they simply do there job and this is where the fear comes from; they are completely indifferent to you or your pleas.At the end of the day this is a well directed, excellently acted and all round intelligent horror film. 10 / 10.",Hellraiser

Finally, I've seen scarier torture scenes in other movies made both before and after this one.There was no suspense or build up of tension because I found myself laughing too often, and it wasn't even silly enough to be campy. All in all, except for the make-up (Pinhead is a scary-looking icon for a reason), this was total garbage. You want tension, rent Halloween. You want suspense with gore, rent Alien.

324,factualnatural,"Chilling,Scary, and Disgusting?",8,1 July 2006,"Hellraiser seemed to redefine where horror films could go, and where we draw the line on how writers translate their most detailed thoughts onto the screen. Not very often does the writer of the book direct the movie, and even just for that reason this may be an interesting film to watch because you feel like it's a first generation experience. Now onto the details. The movie is extremely gory, so don't have a full stomach. Also if you get nightmares easily I'd suggest watching it in the middle of the day as opposed to late at night for the first time because you might have trouble getting that out of your head. I will say young Ashley Laurence completely makes Hellraiser, 3 times more watchable then with a lack of her. She's by far the best actress/actor on the film with the rest ranging from average to a little cheesy. Don't let that turn you off because the film has other good things, mainly the special effects are quite effective (for an 80's movie you probably won't notice the technology setback). For example the sequence when the body comes up out of the floorboards and starts getting muscle and bone slowly; this movie has it's memorable horror moments for sure. I.e. the Cenobites and the director's portrayal of them as enjoying the suffering of others in a place without rules or 'limits' to what pain you can endure at their expense. People get ripped apart by chains wieled from these creatures minds, body parts and organs hang from wooden racks that spin and through giblets on the walls. Also this movie has some added disgust showing complete adultery and hinting at maybe worse things - something this movie continually does throughout. Another memorable moment is when Ashely's character opens the box that opens these gates to Hell (the cenobites) -the walls heat up, light filters through cracks in the woodwork of the walls, and a hallway opens from a fissure in the wall. As she walks into this new hallway (WHY?) it looks like something out of an underground prison, and baby screams can be heard. About 30 ft. into the hall something is just there when the camera goes there, it's a ugly 'hallway creature' that holds itself up with rear arms that is totally unnatural. Cheesy moments include flowers blooming on television sets to try to give some kind of mood/symbolism that doesn't work. Also Ashelys (basically the main character)father/mothers dull attempts to hide the truth from Ashley lead to a almost unbelievable distance between her and her parents....can't she tell that somethings up?? Good grief. and that happens a few times. Most emphasis is on her affair with her husbands brother Frank, and how he is resurrected from Hell by her killing men she meets in town. He basically uses their body to regenerate his...sound pretty? It ain't. and neither is this movie. Basically its designed to push what you're used to seeing in a horror movie.

Clive Barker's Hellraiser is still an incredibly potent horror picture: an intimate study of a nightmarish scenario, with much to say about family and sexuality.

'The box. You opened it. We came', Pinhead tells Kirsty upon their first meeting in the hotel room. 'It's just a puzzle box!', Kirsty protests. 'Oh, no', Pinhead tells her, 'It is a means to summon us'. 'Who are you?', Kirsty asks. 'Explorers in the further regions of experience', Pinhead answers, 'Demons tot some; angels to others.

329,searching-07080,Clive Barker's directorial debut Hellraiser,10,26 January 2016,"Clive Barker's directorial debut Hellraiser. Based on Mr. Barker's novella, A Hellbound Heart, Hellraiser first opened our eyes September 18th, 1987, in theaters both throughout the United States and the UK.Clive Barker's his debut film, he directs a horror befitting of his own truly twisted tale. The practical effects, despite the budget, are fantastic. The gruesome creations, including the now iconic Pinhead, are masterpieces of horror. Pinhead and the Hellraiser franchise would go on to stretch to nine films, a comic series and make a cult star of lead actor Doug Bradley. Whilst the Hellraiser franchise never matched the financial and mainstream popularity of bigger horror juggernauts like Halloween, A Nightmare on Elm Street or Friday the 13th the increasingly-iconic image of Pinhead has bled into the public consciousness and the pinned-being remains a titan of the genre to horror fans. Despite the immediate recognizability of main antagonist Pinhead to casual film fans - many of them have not seen Hellraiser film - let alone could not connect Pinhead to the Hellraiser series.Upon rewatching the later Hellraiser films, something bizarre struck me - and that was actually how little Pinhead and his fellow cenobites feature in the series. Whilst audiences thrive on seeing the chaos caused by Pinhead's genre counterparts like Michael Myers, The Tall Man and Freddy Krueger, Pinhead remains a little-used device in the Hellraiser world.These gruesome beings are villains you've never seen before. Barker has not regurgitated the hockey-mask baddie or the knife-wielding psycho. He has created sado-masochistic enemies that are creepy beyond hell. They chatter their teeth as if a constant breeze is blowing. One, nicknamed Pinhead, looks like an acupuncture session gone horribly wrong. Another one looks like a pile of gooey skin.How the Cenobites fit into the movie is left a mystery. This is frustrating, but probably the right move on Barker's part. Knowing the chapter headings, rather than all of the details, keeps them scary and mysterious. Plus, there needs to be room for a sequel.The performances are all fairly well conceived, with Higgins being the best of the bunch. Ashley Laurence's Kirsty, Larry's daughter from a previous marriage, is probably the worst of them, but then again her lines of dialogue are the cheesiest.The special effects for a low-budget horror film from 1987 are impressive. They're not quite on par with John Carpenter's The Thing, but they rank as some of the best in the genre. Frank's reemergence from the zombie state is believable and gruesome.Hellraiser, almost 29 years after its original release, hasn't aged much. It may not scare the socks off genre fans, but it will impress with its originality and dark, dark twists and turns.",Hellraiser
330,nukthepoor,Just not a good movie,3,10 January 2007,"I know this means nothing, but I am very much into film and especially horror, but it is so rare to find a good horror film. I finally saw this movie after wanting to for many years and was completely unimpressed. It was poorly acted, directed, photographed, and the effects were awful most of the time. The Story was hilarious and at best qualified for a bad late night short. It was like a bad version of tales from the crypt (which i usually like) but unnecessarily long. I do not get why this movie is a cult hit. The gore is decent, but overrated and seemed to be held back at times. The ""monsters"" (cenobites) were barely in the movie and utterly useless. They were not bad characters and had a little charm in an odd way, but then ended up being just impotent. ****SPOILER- the ending was awful. The pointless cenobites just failed to provide a scare or pose any horror to Kirsty and then they were defeated in a very simple, boring and unexplained way. The last scene was just plain moronic, but I did like the character of the drifter before the ending, he was the creepiest part of the movie. The entire family acted illogically and so many things were overlooked. just poor film making altogether. Sorry about ripping on your movie Hellraiser fans.",Hellraiser

333,murali00017,Low Budget Glory!,10,24 May 2014,There are movies which fails to impact us even with the most brilliant cast. And there are those that doesn't fail without any of the fancy budget.This is one of those films.Hellraiser is a masterpiece of horror films in the 80's. You have to see it to believe it. It is an art. This will show you that for making a masterpiece you don't always need big bucks. remember reservoir dogs? original Texas chainsaw massacre? or even pulp fiction?This could have made a better impact but it did not because of its genre. If you like horror then this should be on your list of must see films. It has a plot which is executed beautifully for its budget.,Hellraiser
334,vangiesonj,What a movie !,8,18 March 2015,"I just watched this movie for the first time (I know, I'm delayed) and I absolutely LOVED it! Classic horror right here ! Right amount of gore, right amount of scary. The characters are well developed and explained and it is not just another random, plot-less, slasher movie.The cenobites are terrifying in their own ways, and for a movie from the late 80's, it is done extremely well. It is a more effective movie then most horror movies nowadays, even with their improved effects. It would be interesting to see a remake of the original.. Belongs right up there with Halloween and Nightmare on elm street. Part sci-fi and part horror-you can't go wrong with that. So far I watched the 2nd and 3rd ones too, and they were done well, too. (Although not as amazing as this.)",Hellraiser
335,natwebber,Criminally overlooked -This is horror Film making at its finest,10,30 January 2016,"Hellraiser has a relatively simple premise. Frank, presumably unsatisfied and unsated by earthly pursuits, desires the ultimate in pleasure/pain and ventures into a sadistic realm via a small, golden Rubik's-like cube. He is torn to pieces within five minutes in an empty room and his still-living remains are re- assembled by a demon that came to be known as 'Pinhead'. His name is a giveaway. Cut to Frank's brother, Larry, and his reclamation of the family's old house. We know that Frank's wife, Julia, had an affair with Frank and it's that physical experience of utter abandonment that has consumed her to the point of (some may argue) unreasonableness via a number of murderous hammer blows. Blood is spilled and Frank's soul physically sprouts from the floorboards in a make up effects extravaganza that, in its time, was an eye watering special effect. I mean, this guy rebuilds himself, vein by vein, muscle by muscle, in front of our eyes. It's a startling creation. Julia has to lure men to murder them in order to get Frank to feed and to become physically human again.Claire Higgins as Julia does a superb job in convincing me that the love and ownership of a man - now only in her memory as he starts to regenerate from the bones up – is so powerful that she would pretend to seduce strangers and then reign down on them with a hammer. It takes some skill to make this stuff work. Ably abetting her in his enforced ordinariness is her husband played at first with a straight nice-guy goody dad 'can't stand the sight of blood' vibe by Outsider favourite Andrew Robinson. The fact he gets a chance to do what he does best in the last act of the movie is a delayed treat. Robinson, of course, was the sniper in Dirty Harry and the venal but secretive Garak in Star Trek Deep Space Nine. He does creepy in his sleep and is especially good at illustrating with very little, the joy his characters get from being utterly sociopathic. Doing an admirable job whilst swathed in eerily convincing skinless body stages is Oliver Smith playing Frank resurrected. Rounding up the acting talent is a nod to the 80s ideal of young and sexy (big hair!) is Ashley Laurence as Kirsty, the daughter (importantly the step-daughter to Julia). In some ways she has the hardest part playing 'us'. She does what we'd do if confronted by the horrors she runs into – scream and run away. Well, that's what I'd do. Her grounded and honest performance. The plot is engaging, the acting is excellent, and the camera work is astounding considering the budget, but it is in imagery that this film excels. The cenobites, lead by Pin Head, are makeup marvels. Pin Head has rightly become an horror icon and Doug Bradley's portrayal, particularly his voice, is perfect for the powerful, amoral demon. When he says ""We have such sights to show you,"" I find myself wondering how extraordinary those sights would be, and how horrifying. The dangling chains, hooks, and blood add to the atmosphere. On top of all that is Christopher Young's majestic score.",Hellraiser
336,Cattnip,When's the scary part?,4,26 March 1999,"I don't understand why Hellraiser is so often lauded as one of the most terrifying films of all-time.  The plot itself had promise, but the glaring absence of suspense and stiff, bland characters killed it dead.  Also, Hellraiser lacked that brand of dark, tongue-in-cheek humor that is present in so many films of the genre.",Hellraiser
337,murphy-38,A true horror classic on many levels,10,17 July 2001,"Hellraiser captures the viewer in a macabre world of torture, eroticism, and thrills.  Clive Barker skillfully directs this masterpiece with a razor blade.  Giving us characters beyond the scope of our imaginations.  If one could offer a different viewpoint of hell..this would be the one to fear. The story begins with `the box', an interknit cube told to offer heaven or hell but instead delivers pain.  Larry and Julia (actors Andrew Robinson & Clare Higgins) are beginning a new life in a home where Larry's brother Frank once occupied.  In turn of certain odd events, Frank (whom escape from the hellish world and returns as a skeleton like corpse) in forms Julia of his strange tale and they soon re-kindle their past love together.  Julia must kill others and feed them too Frank so that he may continue.  All along Frank fearing the return of his hellish captures the `Cenobites'.  In the meantime Larry's daughter Kristy (Ashley Laurence) stubbles across `the box' and releases the Cenobites.  And soon enough the plot thickens to one hellish catastrophe. Overall, this film contains stylish costumes, beautiful sfx, and interesting characters.  Barker has given us an awesome tale which one should be afraid of.  I grant this film a `10' do to the fact it's proven itself to be a masterpiece of horror.",Hellraiser

Then a few years later i loved it and i started loving all of the films of its genre. Well not all of them but most of them. Hellraiser is a great film because it bares this secret within the cube which can open the gate, the gate to Pandora's world of everlasting suffering. Very nicely done with the psychological interweaving of adolescent and puperting teenager thoughts and experiences. Then the gore is just awesome if you like gore. Of course if you don't, you don't, and that's fine. But for all horror lovers there is brilliance in the goring because it is personally custom made for the individual. So each victim gets its one personalised death...",Hellraiser
339,judesmith-19067,This film is great for the wrong reasons.,10,1 February 2020,"This film is so bad it's good.The rules of the world at times make no sense; for example, at the end of the film, a homeless man literally turns into dragon after stepping into some fire. This is never explained.The special effects are so bad. In the final confrontation, the entire group of Cynobytes are defeated in a fashion that resembles the effects of Microsoft animation presets.The only good thing I'll say about the film is the make up is amazing. The chatterer, the cenobyte that looks like Morphias and Uncle Joey all look amazing and so realistic. But that's about all I can say.Overall, I have no idea why this is regarded as being an excellent horror film, I think it was good for the time, but I think the film was laughably bad; the world building was stupid, the special effects were awful and the acting for the most part was awful. Aside from the makeup, every aspect of this film is bad.Also how come half of the characters are English and half of them are American. Are they in England or America?",Hellraiser
340,mr-jaykay,Why can't they make movies like this anymore?,10,25 October 2006,"This is one of those rare gems! Not to everyone's liking indeed. Made especially for the real horror fan who is always on the lookout for an original story, interesting characters (and fine acting) , creative and cool special effects. This flick is now a classic along with parts 2 & 3 and I sincerely hope they are neither remade nor updated - I guess they can't get any better than this - the mythos is rich and a myriad of very creative films could be made out of it - at least 1000 wonderful stories, exploring the cenobite universe and human frailty. I do agree that the sequels from part 4 on (although all interesting and intriguing) need to be improved/ remade for the real Hellraiser fan.Doug Bradley needs to be brought back to display his acting prowess and must be cast as Pinhead again, as he is the most human Cenobite of all, the richest and finest of all too. One of the icons of horror films.Unfortunately studios tend now to make faster, cheaper and (and I don't know why - fear maybe - to do something daring or shocking)clichéd movies. Studios all work on a tight budget, very little time available,and so on. Curiously, the best horror movies were made this way - Halloween, Re-animator... So it seems to be that what lack studios today are creative gutsy people (say to the producer(s): let's not film it this way - but that way - at least try) I am also against fan club crossovers : Hellraiser X Prophecy, Hellraiser Vs Michael Myers,... as they will only be byproducts of great stories and characters - they can't be blended 100% as these great stories are totally different and deal with different subjects. Hellraiser hell definitely isn't typical catholic/ religion hell,and can't be. Michael Myers is the personification of human evil - not supernatural evil and Prophecy is based on catholicism and similar religions. Hellraiser, like many low budget films, is not perfect(because money always make a difference), but it is original, fresh, intriguing,daring and 100% creative, which alone deserves to be praised and to be seen. Recommended to horror movie lovers and people who enjoy different imaginative stories.",Hellraiser

342,rageweaver,A must see for any true horror fan,8,29 January 2007,"Hellraiser is one of the best horror films that you will ever see, but fair warned be ye who enter here...Hellraiser is a superb piece of what I would call true horror; this is not a tale of angst ridden teens chasing each other for some asinine reason or other, nor is it the kind of schlocky horror which was prevalent at the time it was made (e.g. Elm Street series, Friday the 13th series etc). This is much rather a film that will make you think as well as cringe, and leave you asking just who the real monsters of the film are. And trust me, you won't be able to answer that one easily.Hellraiser delves into the realms of sadomasochistic horror, set against the backdrop of a suburban household, inter-weaved with a subplot of adultery and revenge from beyond the grave! (excuse the cliché...) Hellraiser's tone is exceedingly dark, with virtually no relief from an overwhelming sense of oppression present throughout the entirety of the film. If anything the poor quality of film used enhances the dark and brooding atmosphere, with the majority of the budget obviously spent on the costumes and effects of the protagonists of the film. There is one instance of exceedingly poor special effects, with one of the monsters seeming more comical than scary, but one has to forgive this as Hellraiser was made almost 20 years ago and what may have seemed cutting edge at that time is sadly less than impressive in the modern day.Hellraiser provides a truly chilling experience, with the viewer left feeling uncomfortable throughout. Whilst it may not appeal to some viewers of more ""slasher"" style films, this is what a true horror film is supposed to be: disturbing, unsettling, and taking the attitude of less is more when it comes to violence and death.",Hellraiser
343,D-J-Phillips,What an amazing film!!!!,8,12 January 2005,"I will try not to give too much away for those who have not yet seen this classic of the genre, although the real question being raised by the reviews already here is exactly what genre this film belongs to?? Sold the world over as a horror film, this for me falls more into the not generally recognized genre of macabre fantasy for that is really what this is.So genre taken care of, lets deal with the movie itself. Can anyone who reads this say that they have seen an '80's horror film' that was more original than Hellraiser?? If they can, can they tell me what it is because if it exists, I ain't never found it. What you have in Hellraiser is an excellent storyline, peppered with the most brilliantly chilling lines such as ""No tears, please. It's a waste of good suffering"" from Pinhead (credited quite low down as Lead Cenobite) and ""I thought I'd gone to the limits. I hadn't. The Cenobites gave me an experience beyond limits... pain and pleasure, indivisible"" from Frank.I think one of the things that mark this above any of the contemporary horrors of the time is that it was adapted from Clive Barker's novella, by Clive Barker (note that the best of the Steven King adaptations were adapted by King himself) and also by directing it himself, Barker made sure to retain as much control over the script and final product as possible thus ensuring some other writer or director didn't end up producing their take on Clive's story, instead what we get is Clive's own, slightly disturbing, vision.The sequels were on the whole (with the exception of Hellbound: Hellraiser 2 and Hellraiser 3: Hell On Earth), an uninspired, unimaginative and unbelievable pile of unmitigated tat (ok, I know what you're thinking, but I enjoyed no.3) but the first still stands as a true classic of it's time and type that is still to be bettered. Whilst I have yet to find the horror film that scares me, this is certainly one of the most visually stunning (despite the obviously low low budget) and imaginative horror films this reviewer has had the pleasure of seeing. And not just in the Horror (or Macabre Fantasy) field, Hellraiser still stands as one of the best films I have ever seen.",Hellraiser

I recommend this movie to lovers of terrific horror movies like the Exorcist 1973 version, The Omen, and Dawn of the Dead. Clive Barker's original story, and characters are classics, such as pinhead, chatter-mouth, and a horrific looking female demon from the depths of hell.

I guess it was the first exposure I had to that level of violence. I loved it. Pinhead and the voice he has is so radiating with evil. Not as easy task to pull off. Clive is amazing. I met him at a convention in Jersey a few years ago. The music in the film is more like ambient freaky drones. I dug that. Just the fact that you never knew if any of this was real of not give it that uneasy feeling. He never should have messed with the box man. Dimensions to hell are meant to remain closed. Especially if Clive Barker is directing because he will literally put you through hell. In a good way. Watch this film if you are new to horror and want to get a face melt.,Hellraiser
346,chrisgcomputers,Classic 80's Horror,8,27 January 2014,"This movie, and the short story it was based on, is a condemnation of the soul less 80's yuppie sub culture. Here we have Frank, who has sought out all forms of pleasure, so much so that he is willing to venture into the world of the Cennobites. The Cennobites come from a reality where pleasure and pain are one and the same, and offer to show mortals who open their puzzle box the experience of ultimate pain through torture. Frank of course is human, and realizes too late that he cannot enjoy pain in the same way as the demons can, and is set on a path to try to escape from the Hell he has created. Clive Baker has always been one to condemn the consumer driven culture, and here we have the ultimate example of a hedonistic life style turned morality play. Frank gives in to the pleasure the box offers, his lover betrays her husband and gives into Frank, murdering men have a chance at another love affair. Pinhead gave up his humanity when he bored of torturing Jews and turned to the box, and each Cennobite is a reflection of their ""sin"" in mortal life. All in all this film is well shot, and the special effects bring found memories to an era where film makers had to put some creativity and work into their craft instead of the CGI craze we have now. The same way vinyl records have a warm charm to them, is the same way I look fondly on the splatter movies of the 80's, and the artists who contributed to the gore that fueled the nightmares of a generation. I see on Clives wiki that there may be a Hellraiser remake, hopefully there is not as every horror remake of the 80's classics have been very far departures from their forefathers. If Clive put's the same love and care he did into this so be it, hopefully he can bring the franchise back from the Direct to Video debacle that has become of this franchise as of late!",Hellraiser

I believe that this movie and subject is at the apex of creativity instead of the boring slashers that have dominated horror movies in the 80's and 90's.

351,enfield-38978,What can be said about Hellraiser that hasn't already been said? It's a classic film,10,27 January 2016,"Clive Barker's quite the peculiar guy. The man has a thing for writing, for one, but the ideas he comes up with, in writing and elsewhere, are certainly 'out there'. I didn't know what to think when I first saw HELLRAISER (other than the fact that I will never go near an S&M bar), but it was certainly a departure from the norm. It was quite a trip.What can be said about Hellraiser that hasn't already been said? It's a classic film.The first Hellraiser film has always reminded me of a sort of European soap opera, with skinless bodies and cenobites from hell. The whole thing plays out like a terrifying nightmare that seems all too real. It really frames the 80s quite well and serves as a definite example of cultural zeitgeist. An example of a man who has grown weary of the pleasures of earth and toys with the things that simple shouldn't be touched.Clare Higgins is amazing as Julia, and the character of Frank is well played as well. With that being said, I thought Ashley Laurence's' Kirsty to be very annoying. She really gets on my nerves, but she was better in the sequel perhaps because she was young and the character represents the sweet virginal innocence.

Though he and his cadre have only a few minutes of screen time here, his pincushion face and dark eyes were enough to make him the literal poster Hellraiser boy for this film and its mascot in all future installments. With that in mind, newcomers may be surprised at the darkly romantic tone of this first film, which plays with tropes like the evil stepmother and doomed lovers.Apart from Bradley, the most valuable performers here are definitely Laurence, a very likable heroine at a time when good final girls were in short supply, and Higgins and Robinson, who have fun with their roles for reasons that can't be expounded upon here without spoiling the finale. (Robinson's final line was improvised on the spot and remains one of the greatest moments in late '80s horror.) It's also a visually striking film with lots of bold lighting, inventive makeup designs, and nifty production design, all supported by a memorably barnstorming music score by the great Christopher Young (a New World favorite stepping in when the studio rejected an early submission by British group Coil). Unfortunately New World's involvement led to a few unfortunate issues, namely the imposition of atrocious, disturbingly flat American dubbed voices on Chapman (and his skinless incarnation played by Oliver Smith) and Hines, which sound absolutely awful and flat. Few viewers noticed the tinkering, however, and the film became a big hit despite a lot of critical grousing at the time like Roger Ebert's half-star review that posed the question, ""Who goes to see movies like this? What do they get out of them?""Hellraiser Not surprisingly, Hellraiser has remained a popular title on DVD and stayed in circulation readily since its original VHS release from New World.A Pure Clive Barker Vision A Classic.",Hellraiser

It explores the aspects of sadomasochism, and the mystery of a puzzle box that when opened release demons that torture mortal souls for all eternity. As well as exploring the turmoil of a family whose lives soon go from average and mundane to a nightmare of murder betrayal, revenge, and punishment.The story is centered around a golden puzzle box said to be the doorway to an unfathomable world of erotic pleasure that would last all of eternity. To be delivered to it's opener by the cenobites considered to be angels who will deliver you your wildest dreams.The story describes the downfall of a man named Frank Cotton. Who upon finding the legendary puzzle box discovers the pleasures spoke of were to be of horrible sadomasochistic torture by creatures called cenobites. A group of horribly mutilated humanoid figures bound in leather with distinguishing deformations, such as those of Pinhead whose mutilation consists of pins that have been hammered through his flesh into his skull in a grid pattern and six open wounds on his lower torso seen through his leather outfit.The story continues some time after Frank's disappearance, during which, his brother Larry and family move into the old desolate house. Then a few drops of blood from a small accident causes Frank's body to begin regenerating from the residue left of him under the floor boards. His heart reforms and begins pulsing and the bone and organs of his body return, but he lacks skin and flesh. Julia, who was his lover while engaged to Frank's brother Larry, succumbs to Frank's pleas, and agrees to help him. A broad portion of the story centers on the sexual tensions between Frank and Julia and Frank's ability to use his previous relationship with Julia to persuade her to murder for his rejuvenation with promises he'll be with her. She begins seducing men at singles bars, then luring them up back to the house up to the desolate attic room where Frank waits to drain them, so it provide the blood needed for his body to regenerate, thus allowing his soul to escape the cenobites.In this review I won't give away the ending. I'm not so cruel as to deny you the pleasure of seeing the film for yourself. As a person who loves the magic behind film I can honestly give my approval on this movie which stands above all other horror films made during the 1980's.I feel this film is powerful in describing what we fear. I also believe it does something other movies of the genre cannot. What it does is create a world too horrible to imagine beyond the dry concept of death. In Hellraiser it goes beyond death which would be a good thing compared to the endless torture you'd face at the hands of the cenobites. And in my opinion serves as a more intellectual film than many others of the same genre.Enjoy the film.",Hellraiser
357,sparkz1989,predictable,6,2 May 2007,"I bought Hellraiser as I was told by a friend it was a great movie, and gosh was I disappointed. The storyline is predictable and the whole story very dull. ------If you don't want to know the storyline stop reading here------ ************************SPOILER WARNING************************ basically put; couple move into old house, man bleeds on the floor and spawns a half dead zombie who has escaped from the demon Cenobites (escaped after he died, what the hell? and never told how), wife kills people to give more blood to the zombie so that he can become fully human, daughter finds out makes deal with the Cenobites, zombie kills every one apart from the daughter and her new boy friend and she gives the zombie back to the Cenobites. ***************************************************So because I could see two scenes ahead for the whole film I'm giving this film a 6 - it's original (2 decades old), some good effects for the age of the film but some SHOCKINGLY BAD ones too {ie the rubber skin with hooks in}, and just too predictable.",Hellraiser

359,cschaefer77,Old School Horror Movie,10,12 March 2010,"Hellraiser. What would such a movie be about? That's what I asked myself when I was a kid. So I taped the movie on a VCR (my parents didn't know what they got at this time) and watched it alone and in the dark - and that's how it's supposed to be watched! Sure, if you see this with modern eyes, you may recognize some ""cheap"" effects, but hey, watch it, look over the cheap effects and you'll be happy you tuned into this! I must say, that in the 80's, you got a lot of horror flicks, like Friday 13th, Nightmare on Elm Street and so on. But this movie really got me. The story is the main point. It's not about a bunch of teenagers, who got to the wrong address. It's more about human relations and things we dream about (nightmares obviously included). The acting is o.k. If you watch this, you want to know how it ends (so did I) and if you like Clive Barker and his stories, you want to see it anyway. And, relating to the first four(!) movies, it's not repeating itself. I don't want to give any spoilers in this review, but this movie scared the hell out of me. Imagine you got a puzzle in your hands that can open the gates to heaven or hell - you don't know which - and you are able to solve it and it turns out to be, well, hell. What would you do? That's basically all this movie is about, but there is so much more... I must say for myself, that I can agree with all characters in this movie. I like all of them, they're build up like real persons, including the guy in the attic (you will see), who get's the ""box"" in the first place. So, if you want to see a real good horror flick with a story, that blows your mind - go for it. If you want to see some gore - go for it, too. If you are scared easily and don't want to see any horror movies at all - go home, lock your doors and hope, that Pinhead (sorry, in the first movie it's ""lead cenobite"") isn't hiding below your bed!P.S.: If there was any idea about the movie ""Hellraiser vs. Helloween"" - Pinhead would win!!!!",Hellraiser

Life, death, love, hate, betrayal, forbidden knowledge, mistakes... With this film, Clive Barker touched the essence of what makes us human. Through divine and demonic symbolism, metaphoric storyline and Faustian references he dares to walk the path of purgatory only few of them dared before (Goethe:)...). He is one of my favorite writers, and although there are some deviations from the plot of the novel (some people might be annoyed because of that), it is still an excellent movie in its own format.

First we saw the release of Clive Barker's The Scarlet Gospels which was a wonderful send off to everyone's favorite cenobite Pinhead. Then we were given the exhaustive and highly entertaining documentary Leviathan: The Story of Hellraiser and Hellbound: Hellraiser II which I consider to be the final word on the making of the first two films. And finally to end the year, Arrow Video has given the fans The Scarlet Box which contains new 2K remastered transfers of the first three Hellraiser films and is loaded with all sorts of cool (old and new) extras that should please any hardcore fan of the series.Read the rest at http://www.clivebarkercast.com/2015/11/29/review-the-scarlet-box/",Hellraiser

IT was a film that I had always been too scared to see because I anticipated it being horrifying as it had always been described to me as such.While not horrible, it's not necessarily all that scary. It's incredibly gory, but even the gore is campy and bad by today's standards. It's still not something to watch if you're faint of heart.That being said, watching the movie was not a waste of time. I enjoyed it, but it was not at all frightening. More of an interesting theme in a movie. The premise of the film is indeed interesting and the film was worth watching for that purpose.

When I saw 'Pinhead' for the first time I realized I was watching a type horror film I had never seen before. The plot is nothing too special, its the typical monsters from hell setup with the damsel in distress, of course everyone thinks she is nuts, until they are killed off. This film shows Barkers visionary as a director, you must remember at the time there was so much cheap horror such as Nightmare on Elm Street, Holloween and Friday The 13th. Many people consider Wes Graven or Steven King as the horror film kings but for me it has to be Clive Barker.Never less than totally committed to scaring you to death!!!",Hellraiser

367,mech_filter,A turning point,10,25 October 2000,"[NO SPOILERS IN THIS REVIEW!]Hellraiser is definitely one of THE modern-classic horror films, no less than Halloween, Friday the 13th, Scream, and Stephen King's best.Like all of those, Hellraiser marks a horror turning point.  In this case, that point is a sympathetic, even provocative, connection of the genre to what might be called ""underground sexuality"".  The entire premise of Hellraiser is allure of the forbidden, and the eventual difficulty in distinguishing pleasure from pain, excitement from fear.  (And after all, doesn't that say a lot about the horror film & fiction genre as a whole?]In more mundane terms, Hellraiser has also been highly influential visually, and one can see clear echoes of it in later films like Jacob's Ladder, Dark City, Edward Scissorhands, The Cube, and Event Horizon (the last two of which might as well be considered unofficial sequels of Hellraiser - in the former, people are trapped in a menacing giant puzzlebox of sorts the surface designs of which are reminiscent of the Hellraiser box, while in the former the gateway to a hellish other dimension is a sphere that looks like it was made by the same force as created the Hellraiser cube - and there's even some common dialog! See if you find it - there's only a word or two difference, and the creepy invitation is delivered almost exactly the same way.)Subculturally, the fetish/gothic/industrial scenes have taken a major clue from the Hellraiser series antagonist-cum-antihero Pinhead and his Cenobites (and secondarily from his ironic alterego of sorts, Tim Burton's Edward Scissorhands).  Pinhead is a PIB (""people in black"") icon.  You'll see Pinhead costumes at fetish balls, fetish art like that of Michael Manning shows obvious Cenobite influences, the fetishwear displayed in publications like Skin Two often looks like it was designed for the demons of Hellraiser, and what's a darkwave party without a styrofoam mannequin head full of toothpicks and painted to look like Pinhead (for the hors d'oeuvres, of course)?Influentiality aside, is it a good movie?  Absolutely.  The acting is first-rate for a production of this  funding level (and better than many far more expensive films), the actual horror really is pretty scary, and in a creepy, subliminal way as well as sudden-shock, in-your-face way.This alone sets it apart from about 90% of other non-B horror films (and 99% of B-movie horror films).  You can thank original author Clive Barker for that.  The sets are not only believable but imaginative.  The multi-continental cast lends a worldly and less parochial sense (contrast the Scream series; it's almost retch-inducingly ""way"" American). Hellraiser's characters are absolutely unforgettable, and amazingly they are ALL simultaneously repulsive and sympathetic, from Frank and his needy desperation combined with heartless viciousness, to Kirsty and her innocence (which is both annoying and grounding), to the Cenobites and their juxtaposed sinister menace and righteous hedonism, their mixture of exploratory fascination and loathsome outright psychopathology (not to mention their conflicting present selves and ultimate origins, which you don't learn about until Hellbound: Hellraiser II.)  And the whole fantasy meshes well with our culturally-derived notions about the dangers of black magic, the tricks inherent in a deal with the devil, and the sexual yet torturous nature of Hell.  On top of all that, the plot is solid, the pace just what it should be, the very slight humor breaks needed but subtle, and the premise of Hell as a dimension or sidereal alternative reality is a wonderful modern take on the Underworld, far more plausible than a Dantéan subterrain.The only points worth criticizing would be the special effects. Some of them are downright hokey by today's standards.  When the film was made they were all passable, but imperfect.  This could eventually be improved be a ""Star Wars Special Edition""-style overhaul, replacing the cartoon electricity and rubbery muppet minions with (or overlaying and improving them with) computer-generated effects.  Others will disagree of course, but they have the existing version of the film to satisfy them.If one can suspend disbelief of the somewhat lacking special effects, Hellraiser is a fantastic and disturbingly enjoyable film, the influence of which is certain to be felt for decades to come.",Hellraiser
368,flea_the_drummer,"An atmospheric, sophisticated horror film.",9,3 December 2009,"Hellraiser is a remarkable film about two powerful sins: greed and lust. The horror of the film does not come from the Cynobites, creatures who torture others to induce pleasure. The true antagonists are Julia and her lover, who constantly take advantage of and manipulate others. The effects are remarkable for their period and stand the test of time. Although the film contains a liberal amount of gore, it is not excessively disgusting nor gory just for the sake of being gory. It's just enough to make you feel uncomfortable without crossing the line of being ""distasteful."" The designs of the Cenobites are both unique and eerie. The music also adds atmosphere to the film, creating tension for the audience. In contrast to other horrors films of the era, such as The Texas Chainsaw Massacre, Halloween, and Friday the 13th, the monsters are not mindless slashers. This adds a level of depth not achieved in the films mentioned earlier. If you are a fan of horror, this film is a must see. After the film ends, it will leave you asking yourself many questions about the state of humanity, the afterlife, and the true meanings of pain and pleasure.",Hellraiser

372,bigsnakedeath,Utterly Savage,10,13 February 2021,"This is amongst the greatest films period, not just in horror.
Far deeper in theme and symbolism than almost all horrors of the time. The themes of sex, masicism, sadism, death and reincarnation are overflowing but delt with in all seriousness without any gags or gimmicks to detract from the real sense of brutality. Only the mind of a madman or genius could envisage this and Clive Barker has always been this master of darkness.
Possibly only The Exorcist, The Thing and the grossly underrated Event Horizon comes this close to a perfect horror, no cheesy one liners, gags or gimmicks (yes, Nightmare on Elm Street is Nothing even remotely close to the quality of Hellraiser as I have never rated it as a true horror due to the cheesy comic dialogue)extremely dark, very gory and oh so gripping. This holds your attention from start to finish as long as you can handle the gore and guts. The make up, set design, visceral body effects and even the lighting effects are outstanding, beautiful and disturbing all at the same time, creating a whole other world that seems as real as our dimension.

But if you watch a lot of old horror movies you get used to it, and you become able to ignore that stuff and keep watching it.

Kirsty confronts them, but to no avail...she is quickly shipped away, when she just happens to possess the puzzle box...she opens it up, and out pop the Cenobites...please forgive the director for plugging in the weird creature traveling down the corridor of the Cenobite dimension...I think he was trying to show how Kirsty's curiosity is best left in her imagination rather than in reality...if only Julia learned the same lesson...anyway, the Cenobites are ready to take this girl into their arms to show her their pleasure, which is interesting, because she herself is a virgin character whose life is not ruled at all by pleasure, but by compassion...yet another dichotomy to Julia...Kirsty offers a bargain to the Cenobites (the devil?); she will lead them to one of their escapees, Frank, as an exchange for her own soul, which they accept...any deal with creatures with pins in their face I would say is suspect, but it moves the story along...the final confrontation between Kirsty and Julia, good vs. evil, doesn't end in the way most movies portray this epic struggle, but it is very satisfying...Frank ends up betraying Julia and kills her...since she so easily betrayed her husband for pleasure, it seems fitting 'Frank' would just as easily kill her when she became useless...much like her attitude towards her formerly living husband...Frank, in Kirsty's Dad's skin, finds his perfect pleasure in perhaps the greatest sin in the book: raping his niece in the body of her father...a very disturbing thought, if you ask me, and a perfect end for Frank's character; for the Cenobites come, and take him away...and, just when you thought everything was okay, the Cenobites go back on their deal with Kirsty and try to take her soul...another betrayal, but what do you expect from a bunch of demons?...Kirsty plays with the box, cries ""GO TO HELL,"" which they do, and the movie ends with the man in the desert asking another victim, ""what is your pleasure?"" ...this movie is profound, with a great story, believable characters, believable acting...there are truly no slow parts in this movie, as it moves along quite nicelythis movie deserves more credit than it receives for its ingenuity, creativity, themes, and perfect conglomeration of all things that make movies great...may you never seek after pleasure for pleasure sake, for, after all, a great big guy with pins sticking in his head just might stick you with a bunch of spears and shred your skin off...I'm not saying; I'm just saying...",Hellraiser
384,Axit112,Don't come to daddy,2,20 October 2019,"In the 80s this film was pushed hard. I wanted to see it. I didn't see it. I was 8. They demonstrated some quite well produced effects. Better than Henson's puppetry. There's a man with pins in head (spoiler?). They didn't think about a lot more. My goodness this bad. Pretentiousness without character. If you decide to watch it, please consider what else you could be doing first because whatever that might be (all possibilities included), that would be the better use of time.
Watching this film feels like shaking the hand of your mugger. Or a face drill. Or having a void that rings louder than any dwindling hope. Because what's the point in trying anymore when this is what gets a 7 average.
It's a fact of life that you only recognise the good in contrast to the bad. But the ugly in this countercraft is not matched by anything yet witnessed. This is not horror, it's horrible. Not scary but weary, not shocking but.. actually it is shocking- like licking a battery... for dinner.
In all seriousness though, I think it's crap and way, way overrated.
Enjoy.",Hellraiser
385,MJordan23,Hellraiser 1-5 Reviewed,10,3 March 2006,"This is one of my favorite movies of all time. It has a lot of gore. My favorite cenobite is Pinhead. This is such a good movie. If I were you I would rent this right now! My favorite Hellraisers from best to worst is Hellraiser1, Hellraiser2, Hellraiser3, Hellraiser4 and then finally Hellraise5. Hellraiser1 is rated R for gore, language, and brief sexuality. Hellraiser2 is rated R for brief language, gore, and brief nudity. Hellraiser3 is rated R for strong violence, language, and some sexuality. Hellraiser4 is rated R for strong horror violence, gore,language and some sexuality. Hellraisers5 is rated R for gore, language and sexuality. Rent all these movies because they are all good. So,I hope you like these as much as I do.",Hellraiser
386,CokeVoAYCE,this movie sucks,3,1 November 2020,"By 2020 standards, this movie sucks. the special effects are laughable, the acting is subpar, and the plot is predictable and lame. the only thing interesting about this movie is the concept.
furthermore, i can't stand movies in general where a character has so much plot armor that when they should die, they somehow manage to barely survive every single near death experience by a tiny slither. it really takes me out of the realism of the movie, and there's a lot of that in this, mainly with the husband-guy's daughter surviving every little thing when she very clearly should have died.
next, the plot was pretty predictable from very early on, knowing the guys wife was going to betray her husband and continue to feed as many people as she can to frank. that's why i feel the plot is predictable and lame.this movie has an interesting concept going for it, in that you can unleash ultimate pleasure and ultimate pain in the form of heaven and hell from that box. that's the only reason why this movie and franchise took off and became so popular. i think this concept is worth exploring and can be done well, but this movie definitely failed to do it. i still have hopes for the series and hope the remakes in the future are actually decent movies though.another thing that annoys me about this movie though is it says that the box can unleash the pleasures of heaven and pains of hell, but you don't see any of heavens pleasures brought down among the box's subjects, only the tortures of hell. where the hell are the good parts of the box to be seen? i would've enjoyed to see that too, but a shame it wasn't in this movie. hopefully in the future movies they take the time to add that in too.overall, i guess it's worth watching for the concept and because the series is so popular you want to be familiar with it for when people talk about it, but don't expect an enjoyable or good movie, you'll be disappointed. keep in mind this is review is by 2020 standards. this movie might of been 10/10 quality material in the 70s/80s, but it ain't it anymore. so keep that in mind when you read this review.",Hellraiser
387,harlin-96188,Hellraiser broke rules,10,10 February 2016,"After the glut of slasher films in the late Seventies and early Eighties, featuring more or less the same baddies - masked men out for slaughter in the name of implacable revenge - Hellraiser was, for me at least, a revelation. I mean, I can still remember seeing Hellraiser for the first time, and there are very, very few films about which I can say that. I was about to start secondary school, and my friend Ben told me about a free midnight showing at the movie theater near my house. So it's the middle of the night, and I think to myself ""hell, it's free - why not?"" And then the movie starts. A man buys a mysterious puzzle box from a stranger in a foreign country. The stranger says ""Take it, it's yours."" And the man walks away. Then the stranger says ""It always was."" . And then the puzzle box opens up and hooks fly out of it and tear the man into pieces.And this film does work and does still hold up to the extent that it does because the film isn't really about the Cenobites - it's immediately about Julia, Frank, and Larry, the things we do for love (the novella was called The Hellbound Heart), and the price we pay for desire (Frank betraying Julia to get a crack at Kirsty, for example). More distally, it's about the corrupting influence of the box as it comes into other people's lives. To the extent that the film is about the box and those it encounters, it works more effectively in a multiple-film framework because you can tell all kinds of stories within that, and I think that's why the film opens and closes on scenes of people acquiring the box. But that's not the direction in which future films would go. Future films would, instead - at least for awhile - focus on the Cenobites as franchisable characters",Hellraiser
388,avrilmaiden666,Greatest horror ever made.,10,13 September 2005,"The most shocking thing about this film was its low budget yet amazing graphics and oddly enough Pinhead in the credits its called lead cenobite the film is scary,entertaining and leaves you craving for the rest in the series most movie monsters scare you while ripping people to shreds and making you jump the cenobites scare you just by being there and its that atmosphere witch leaves you feeling uneasy and on the edge of your seat you end up rooting for the cenobites Pinhead will easily become your favourite monster ever and the way it builds to the climax with the cenobites is fantastic the other films cant match its greatness but there fantastic as well if your into a nightmare on elm street or Friday the 13th you'll love/have to watch this film.",Hellraiser
389,godinho-ricardo,A masterpiece,10,19 April 2021,"A masterpiece, one of the movies of my life. The soundtrack is amazing, and the plot is fenomenal, and when pinhead arrives...",Hellraiser
390,mtmcconnell,Not scary; Highly overrated,4,5 April 2018,"Man.....I'm not gonna lie. I don't see what the big deal about this movie is. Some scenes are decent and gory. None are really scary though! None of this movie scared me, and I watched it by myself at night. I love horror movie, BUT I truly don't see why this one is a classic! To me it was uneventful and lacked suspense. Only reason I gave it this many stars was bc of Kirsty. At least she was something to look at!",Hellraiser
391,thenastyhabbit2,Freaky,10,29 January 2006,"I saw this movie first when I was 8 years old. It started off me second favorite horror films, and it dared to be different. Pf course its still a splatter punk horror film, but the English know how to scare. Clive Barker did an excellent job with the story, the casting was magnificent, I love the cinematography, and the SPFX were great for its time. All in all, a very scary movie. I'm 21 years old and the cenobites still give me nightmares. I took two classes in high school that involved movies, Mystery and Horror and cinematography course. I did a project in both classes (different of course) on this movie and its sequels. I received a perfect grade. In mystery and horror, my objective was to scare the pants off of my classmates and really gross them out. This movie worked. My fellow classmates still tell me that they have nightmares about Hellraiser. And in Cinematography, i did a project on sequels and how sometimes they can be better than the original. I won when I showed them Hellraiser, Hellraiser 2: Hellbound and Hellraiser: Inferno.",Hellraiser
