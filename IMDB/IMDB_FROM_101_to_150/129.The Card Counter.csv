0,nogodnomasters,This is how it starts,4,24 September 2021,"William Tell (Oscar Isaac) spent 10 years in federal prison for the crime of torturing prisoners. He learned to count cards while in prison and keeps a low profile as a blackjack player. He meets Cirk (Tye Sheridan) whose life is a mess and La Linda (Tiffany Haddish) who runs a ""stable."" She gets backers for good players like Tell. Eventually Tell agrees and then plays poker (no card counting) for the rest of the feature. You keep waiting for him to beat a loud mouth.The film is a drama. Tell is haunted by his past, but deals with it in his own way. The film is a slow burn that never catches fire. The ending was messed up.Guide: F-word. Sex. Male nudity.",The Card Counter
1,CinemaSerf,Underwhelming and undercooked revenge drama...,6,7 November 2021,"I'm not quite sure what I was expecting - but this rather meandering drama left me leaving the cinema asking what or whom this film was for? Oscar Isaac (""William Tell"") is a gambler - a successful, under the radar kind of fellow - with a military past steeped in trauma. He encounters a young man ""Cirk"" (Tye Sheridan) with whom he has something in common - both men have suffered at the hands of his former CO ""Gordo"" (Willem Dafoe). The older man, wishes to temper the anger and lust for revenge of the younger, and takes him under his wing. Except, well, he doesn't really. He takes him on tours of the poker games, shares his winnings, introduces him to his fixer ""La Linda"" (Tiffany Haddish). That, though, is all he seems to be offering the young man - a shell upon which he can become a bored, barnacle!. That's when I found myself looking at my watch. Towards the end, the plot takes a swing for left field that is not only sad, but also a precursor to an ending that is frankly really quite poor. The dialogue is strained, and though Haddish easily wins on the star front here, the rest of the cast sort of loll around in a soporific haze of emotional baggage that really is quite dreary to watch. Maybe I just wasn't in the mood, but looking around me in the cinema - plenty of other people seemed to wondering why they hadn't gone to see ""Spencer"" too...",The Card Counter
2,neil-476,Not for everyone,6,10 November 2021,"The Card CounterWilliam is an excellent gambler who gambles and wins small so as not to attract unwanted attention. He has also served time for being photographed mistreating prisoners at Abu Ghraib - Gordo, who taught them all the tricks of mistreatment, didn't get photographed and is now doing very nicely thank you. William encounters Cirk, a troubled young man whose father shot himself in the aftermath of the Abu Ghraib debacle. Cirk wants revenge against Gordo. La Linda, who manages a stable of gamblers, extends an invitation to William.Paul Schrader writes and directs this four hander (with extras) and I don't really know what to make of it. Tiffany Haddish is good as La Linda, but almost entirely superfluous. Willen Dafoe as Gordo is pivotal, but not in it much. Most of the meaningful content is between Oscar Isaac's taciturn, dead-eyed William and Tye Sheridan's closed-off and unsympathetic Cirk.It's a slow burn. There's a lot of poker, but it's not a significant part of the drama. The final 10 minutes or so suddenly becomes gripping, but you may have lost interest before then. It held my interest.

3,bombersflyup,"Yeah, no.",2,17 September 2021,"The Card Counter is weird mostly, parts disturbing.Elements of ""Rounders"" and ""Casino Royale,"" teasing with a thought or two, but disappoints. With much of the setting at the casino and poker table, there's no table talk and only one hand shown and it's a silly one with an A2 and 7's calling on an 899 board. Also the same players getting to the end isn't reality, as playing perfect doesn't guarantee anything, cards still have to run out. The characters and performances beside Isaac are bad and he isn't great either. The music throughout awful as well, but most of all nothing happens and what does is just weird.",The Card Counter
4,blanbrn,Dark character study of doomed soul who's tortured past seems to follow him.,6,12 September 2021,"Director Paul Schrader seems to use a little bit of ""Taxi Driver"" as an influence with his latest dark character study drama film ""The Card Counter"". The story follows William(in a good performance from Oscar Isaac) as an ex military interrogator who after his prison release puts one of his learned skills and vices to good use. That happens to be he now travels as a poker and card player competing in world series games all around the country. However his life is still haunted by past memories and his old military boss Gordo(the great Willem Dafoe) plays a part and a connection and a return to a downfall is meant for William. Along the way William has a sidekick and partner in La Linda(the sexy Tiffany Haddish and I loved the scene in which she sports that sexy black bra in bed with Oscar!) a sexy and professional street smart gal who provided some sexy eye candy scenes, and she even bonded and gets intimate between the sheets with William as she guides his winning table ways. Overall film is nothing great still it entertains with drama as one is trying to escape a dark past still it shows life is all about luck and a gamble even when love and doom is both present.",The Card Counter
5,ops-52535,just another timeless...,4,17 September 2021,"Waste of my time to see something new and good on the fleemarket, because this game of cardmanship was a strange trip to the cardcounters wonderland, where the bunny is black and the deck of cards just like a deck of cards, with some segments of flashbacks of bad consiousness and a wrathening sense of revenge, that takes eventually place, but why , how and the outcome of the revenge is left in limbo, the whole film goes actually in limbo if you ask me. Only one aspect can be set in the limelight, very nice filmographical presentation, but thats it...acting is not bad but boring, story and plot is daft and slow, and if you pay the ticket to become a better pokerplayer, then the book ''poker for dummies '' will teach you more.Im a grumpy old man with a whole lot of time to spend, therefore im not angry about such foolplay of a movie and it doesnt hurt, but if you measure your life in money per hour, then save yourself from this one.",The Card Counter
6,UniqueParticle,Story driven and enriched with captivating characters,9,10 September 2021,I was blown away by Oscar Issacs performance he really embodied William Tell in the best way possible; I really hope he gets a fair amount of recognition and maybe a nomination! I'm so glad I got to see Card Counter in the theater it's everything a drama/thriller should be especially by acclaimed director Paul Schrader. The writing is so smooth in every instance needed and the gambling felt so authentic. I hope others appreciate this fairly paced drama about a man that loves blackjack and routine along with following rules quite a lovely film highly recommend!,The Card Counter
7,Thanos_Alfie,Simple but nice...,6,4 November 2021,"""The Card Counter"" is a Drama - Thriller movie in which we watch a man who is an ex-military interrogator becoming a gambler. His mistakes from the past haunt him and he tries to find redemption and salvation from his present actions.I liked this movie because it had a nice and interesting plot consisted of mystery and drama. The interpretation of Oscar Isaac who played as William Tell was very good and he made the difference. Some other interpretations that have to be mentioned were Tye Sheridan's who played as Cirk, Tiffany Haddish's who played as La Linda and Willem Dafoe's who played as Gordo. The direction which was made by Paul Schrader who is also the writer of it, it was very good and he presented his main character with very few information something that created a mystery behind him while he mainly focused on his present life. To sum up, I have to say that ""The Card Counter"" is an interesting movie with a simple plot that I am sure you will be interested on watching so, I recommend you to watch it.",The Card Counter

9,imseeg,"Mesmirizing, cruel, suspenseful. BUT a bit uneven and lacking in spark at moments as well...",7,28 September 2021,"Beware: I had to skip some scenes that were just too cruel and nasty.The bad: this movie (like many other Paul Schrader movies) did confuse and disturb me in (un)pleasant ways. Let's not forget Paul Schrader wrote the brilliant ""Taxi Driver"", which Martin Scorsese directed. Now both Scorsese and Schrader are back together again, but did they create fireworks again? Not exactly. This movie is firstmost a character portrait of Oscar Isaac, a hustler at gambling, with a very shady past and HIS PAST comes back to haunt him. Unfortunately the execution of this story is simply not a directional gem. Not bad, but certainly not terrific either...The good: the acting is great. The suspense is good. The terror is haunting. I just kept guessing where this story would go. And THAT's the real charm of this movie: an INTRIGUEING plot, with excellent acting performances.This director Paul Schrader is bound to confuse and divide audiences. But THAT's the ""charm"" of many Schrader movies...",The Card Counter
10,jtindahouse,A flat movie with very little going for it,5,20 September 2021,"Whenever I see ""such and such presents"" on the cover of a movie I think to myself oh no, this movie obviously isn't very strong and they need to attach a good filmmaker's name to it to try and trick people into thinking it's good. I hoped that wouldn't be the case with 'The Card Counter' but it absolutely was. This movie was a bit of a mess.There are a lot of scenes where the lead character narrates different casino games and explains how best to win them. There is the odd interesting one like the card counting explanation, however most of them are embarrassing to listen to when you know a thing or two about casino games. They are both over-dramatised and over-simplified at the same time.The film itself is just bizarre. Characters find connections without the film doing anything to sell them to us. We are just supposed to accept them. It's really odd. Also for a large portion of the film we have no idea what the point is. Things just kind of drift along and you wonder why you are even watching this. Then at the end it tries to make up for all that lost time, but again it is just so out of place, unearned and unusual that it has no effect on you at all.I wanted to like this film, I really did. The premise sounded so good in the synopsis. I assure you though, the promise of ""cinematic intensity"" is not lived up to for one minute. This is one of the least intense films I've ever witnessed. I'll generously give this a 5/10. Not one I'd recommend.",The Card Counter
11,stevendbeard,Redemption/Revenge,6,27 September 2021,"I saw ""The Card Counter"", starring Oscar Isaac-the Star Wars movies, Sucker Punch; Tiffany Haddish-Like a Boss, Girls Trip; Tye Sheridan-X_Men:Dark Phoenix, Ready Player One and Willem Dafoe-Aquaman, John Wick.This is a movie about a troubled man, Oscar, that is seeking redemption for his past. Oscar was a military interrogator working under-and trained by-Willem during the Guantanamo Bay years. Oscar went to prison and Willem got off free and went on book tours. Oscar learned how to count cards while he was in prison and becomes a gambler when he gets out, winning small amounts in different casinos, not raising any alarms-the House doesn't like big winners. Tye is the son of a friend of Oscar's that had problems with Willem that ended badly-Tye wants revenge. Oscar tries to talk Tye out of his revenge scheme-he thinks it will end badly for Tye-and feels that by doing so, he will be redeemed for things he did in his own past. Tiffany is a money backer to Oscar, putting up money for him to play with-they split the winnings-the goal being the World Series Poker game in Las Vegas.It's rated ""R"" for violence, language and sexual content-including graphic nudity-and has a running time of 1 hour & 51 minutes.It's not one that I'd buy on DVD but it would be alright, as a rental.",The Card Counter
12,kluseba,Collision course of haunted pasts with promising futures,7,14 October 2021,"The Card Counter is a crime drama with significant ups and downs which makes for an overall slightly above average viewing experience.The story revolves around William Tell, a former private first class, who has spent an eight-year stint in a military prison for his role in torture and prisoner abuse in Iraq. Once out of prison, he is living a lonely life on the road as a gambler who is traveling from one casino to another. He grows closer to an acquaintance from the gambling world named La Linda who is escaping from her own violent past and planning on finding a sponsor for the talented gambler. William Tell meets a young drifter named Cirk Baufort who is in a negative state of mind after years of mental and physical abuse from his father who eventually committed suicide. The trio starts traveling together but just as the three loners feel like they have finally found purpose in life, tragedy puts their relationships to the test.The Card Counter convinces on several levels. First of all, the three lead characters are intriguing and have much depth. Their background stories share violent similarities but also distinct differences that make each character charismatic and unique. The relationship between these characters is constantly shifting and changing from start to finish.The movie also has a gripping sinister undertone. This atmosphere is provided by repetitive locations such as anonymous motels, boring highways and soulless casino alleys. It's further supported by dimmed light effects. The moody soundtrack plays in appropriately as well.The film's final thirty minutes are certainly the highlight as things spin out of control. These scenes will keep you on the edge of your seat and keep viewers guessing how things are going to unfold until the final scene that is both beautiful and tragic.On the other side, the movie also has several downsides. Its pace is very slow which makes it difficult to get into the film in the first place and keep watching it until the rewarding finale.The actions and dialogues are as repetitive as the atmosphere and locations. The film shows several overlong gambling segments and the conversations revolve around haunting pasts colliding with potentially brighter futures.Despite its downsides, The Card Counter has grown on me and is worth a try if you like slow-paced dramas with a violent twist carried by profound characters. The movie needs some time to get started and certainly has several lengths but all those things pay off in the final thirty minutes of this charismatic crime drama.",The Card Counter
13,Pairic,Searching for redemption,8,6 November 2021,"The Card Counter: Yeah, William (Oscar Isaac) counts cards at Black Jack tables, he is also an accomplished poker player, he honed his skills during his years in a military prison. He was one of the fall guys for the abuse of prisoners at Abu Ghraib He explains the odds in Black Jack, how they change as more cards are dealt, his philosophy of poker and other games is expounded. He likes to fly under the radar, not to win too much. An acquaintance La Linda (Tiffany Haddish) wants him to take on a financial backer so that he can move into big time poker tournaments. William is reluctant until he meets Cirk (Tye Sheridan) whose father was also imprisoned due to the Abu Ghraib events. The senior officers and the contractor, Major Goro (Willem Dafoe) who trained them in ""interrogation techniques"", weren't charged. They encounter Major Goro, now a consultant speaking at a Security convention, William wants to divert Cirk from his plans for revenge against Goro. The world of competitive poker is explored, leading players all have their own quirks, some crack under the pressure. William has his own demons to contend with as he dreams of the atrocities committed at Abu Ghraib. A dark thriller/road movie as William and Cirk travel from casino to casino, there is something of the Eastwood/Bridges vibe from Thunderbolt and Lightfoot between them. Where the film is headed remains open until the final fifteen minutes. Not one you'll forget in a hurry. Written & Directed by Paul Schrader. 8/10.",The Card Counter
14,masonfisk,MORE OF THE SAME BUT NOT BETTER...!,6,11 October 2021,"Paul Schrader's (Affliction/First Reformed) latest which stars Oscar Isaac, Tiffany Haddish & Tye Sheridan. Taking place in the world of gambling, Isaac, a former military man who worked in black ops sites where intense interrogations took place, makes his way in life making money as a consummate card counter (even though he's pretty good in other games of chance) but when 3 people come into his orbit, his life is thrown a-kilter. Haddish, a bankroll who he's known from before, offers her financial services to make a play for a foreign shark currently 'killing it' on the poker circuit, Sheridan, a young man who claims his father served along side him in Abu Ghraib befriends him & Willem Dafoe, his commander from his torture times, just happens to be giving a lecture about security at one of the gambling venues. Isaac served time for his past bad deeds (seen in flashbacks) & as we see him dictating his thoughts in notebooks (shades of Dafoe's character in Schrader's Lightsleeper), he's on a razor's edge of keeping his wits about him. Isaac takes Sheridan on the road w/him & as their relationship grows, Sheridan admits he's on a mission to kill Dafoe (his father was incarcerated as well for his war crimes) which he fails as Dafoe kills him in an off screen break-in at his home. Hearing the news, Isaac decides to finish the job, damn the consequences, even though he's developed an amorous new turn w/Haddish. Being the kind of film Schrader has pretty much perfected in his 40 plus career, you can't fault him too much for going back to the same well again & again (he loves that ending from Bresson's Pickpocket!) but here it seems he had 2 separate ideas, the gambling angle & the revenge narrative, which he thought he could merge together but unfortunately the union is a divisive one which never gels together & even his handling of the gambling aspect almost feels half-hearted as we never engage w/Isaac's predicament. Nice to see him doing what he does best but Schrader owes it to himself to do better.",The Card Counter
15,leftbanker-1,"With Its Faults, Still Better than Most Films Lately",7,2 October 2021,"The biggest fault is something I moan about constantly these days: at 1h51m, it's at least 21m too long. It was also about 20% too weird. Wrapping up the furniture was obviously some grand, symbolic gesture that I'm too stupid to understand. I would say the same about the final confrontation.To my knowledge, this is the first movie that mentions Abu Graib and how only a few flunky soldiers were burned at the stake while their superiors got away without even reprimands.Great acting all around, but I wish Shrader had gone with more of a straight-up revenge story.

16,Movi3DO,Not my taste,6,11 September 2021,"Pick a card.Another movie from director Paul Schrader, the man behind First Reformed, a disturbing masterpiece that I absolutely loved. This one was also executively produced by Martin Scorsese, so naturally I had high hope for this movie.This gotta be one of the weirdest movie that I have watched. For the first hour and 15 minutes, I was very confused about what was going on. The pacing was slow and pensive with Oscar Isaac character going between casinos. There were large amounts of crash courses on blackjack and a major interrogation program. I was bored out of my life.Only after that the movie revealed itself: a tale of redemption. Things got more disturbing and captured my attention. The cast was all good. Willem Dafoe had too little screen time to make a mark.In reflection, the style and storytelling were similar to First Reformed, but Reformed was way more disturbing, and I could see where the movie was going, which was scary. Card Counter, though, felt directionless for the majority of its runtime, so I didn't feel the impact much.Overall, it's not my taste. 6/10.",The Card Counter
17,lareval,Brooding Talk and somber score don't make a movie,2,12 October 2021,"Oscar Isaac may be a pleasure to watch, but this movie was not my cup of tea. A frustratingly boring experience. Not recommended, in my opinion. I respect those who like it though.",The Card Counter
18,sweidman-28016,A Surprising Standout,8,16 September 2021,"""You know the phrase tilt? Just like a pinball, any man can tilt. You could tilt.""Paul Schrader's The Card Counter tells the story of an ex-military interrogator turned gambler given a chance in redemption. Soon enough, this road takes him down a path haunted by the ghosts of his past. This is a case where the trailer didn't match the level in which that movie was at. I watched the trailer two or three times and didn't feel it necessary to watch it, even with the greatness that is Paul Schrader. But once the early reviews rolled in from Venice, it surprised us all. Luckily, there was an advanced screening last week and I could attend. We may have been a little late to take our seats and had to sit in the very front row in front of a 40 foot tall screen, but it was worth it. The Card Counter is an interesting thriller that you don't see too often. Schrader has a distinct style. Those who've seen his films know it, and it comes quint in handy here. Had this been in the hands of anyone else, it probably would've been one of those January or August movies that only makes box office money one week and never talked about again. This is indie so it won't make too much, but it's one to remember. The screenplay is smart and well written. The dialogue never felt awkward to me and had a nice flow.We had a great ensemble of actors for this. Oscar Isaac never disappoints, and though his character is mysterious and we could've gotten a little more, he is very good. Tye Sheridan has more than I expected, but I forgot how good of an actor he is. He's one of those actors that you can tell will have this amazing performance someday and become a household name. As for Tiffany Haddish, I felt a bit conflicted. She fit her character on and off. Maybe it's the writing or just characterization, but I wanted to like her more. It was like she was trying to be serious but she also provides the comedic moments throughout. I think she's a good actress, but maybe this wasn't exactly the best fitting role for her. The story takes quite a few turns. Slowly, and this is a slow burn, it becomes so intense that you're at the edge of your seat. Sometimes it becomes hard to tell where it's trying to go, or goes in places it really doesn't need. The ending conflicted me. I like it, but it didn't need to fall into the place it did. In order to be plausible, we would've needed a scene or two extra. The score and cinematography fit the dark story. The trailer shows a strange combination of camera work, and it may seem weird out of context, but once you see it play out it works well. Everything falls into place nicely. Paul Schrader is a writing and director that I find myself getting excited for with each new film. This isn't his best, but one that surprises and stands out this year.",The Card Counter
19,Draysan-Jennings,Lost me with the ending,6,18 September 2021,Other then the bad acting from Tiffany Haddish and the terrible ending this was a fairly decent film. I just didn't understand why he called the police on himself. I thought he was going to kill Gordo then head back to the poker game and win it all. Didn't happen.

20,steiner-sam,"A psychological story of the ""survival"" of a former Abu Ghraib interrogator",7,14 September 2021,"It's set in the present time with a few flashbacks to the Iraq War in the early 2000s. It's the psychological story of the ""survival"" of a former interrogator at the Abu Ghraib prison in Iraq. The story is told exclusively from the perspective of the former interrogator.William Tell/William Tellig (Oscar Isaac) is a gambler who spent 8 1/2 years in prison. He was a Private who worked at the Abu Ghraib prison and was among those soldiers pictured in the notorious pictures of interrogators with prisoners who experienced ""enhanced interrogation"" techniques. Tell manages his guilt by an extremely repressed personality that gambles on a modest scale to avoid notice. He is skilled at counting cards at Blackjack and is skilled at Poker because of his disciplined playing within the percentages of success he has learned during his prison years.At one of the casinos he visits that is holding a military convention, he sees Major John Gordo/Rogers (Willem Dafoe), an ex-military man who, as a private contractor, taught enhanced interrogation techniques to Tell and others but was never charged. At the same convention, Tell encounters Cirk (Tye Sheridan), the son of one of Tell's colleagues at the prison who became abusive to his wife and Cirk before finally killing himself. Cirk wants Tell to help him capture, torture, and kill Gordo.Tell resists Cirk's request and tries to persuade Cirk to reconcile with his mother. He wants to help Cirk, who has many debts, and finally agrees to enter the celebrity gambling world with the help of a manager named La Linda (Tiffany Haddish). Over time Tell's repression recedes enough to allow a romantic relationship with La Linda.Tell gives Cirk a substantial amount of money just before entering the final round of the World Series of Poker, and Cirk agrees to reconcile with his mother. However, Cirk also decides to still go after Gordo.Despite the drama of the storyline, this is a word-heavy movie with only a few scenes of violence. The verbal descriptions are sometimes more graphic. The portrayal of William Tell by Oscar Isaac, in my view, is Oscar-worthy. Tiffany Haddish is also excellent. Tye Sheridan is less strong, and Willem Defoe essentially only has a bit part.I would have given the film a higher score, but the film's climax suffers believability issues. It deserved a better screenplay in the last 10 minutes or so.",The Card Counter

27,Come-and-Review,Diary of a Card Counter,9,13 September 2021,"The Card Counter in a way sums up the best of Paul Schrader's range: it undeniably belongs to the screenwriter of Scorsese's films, its elegance meets the expectations for a film of the director of First Reformed; yet, it manages to avoid redundancy, and maintains a distinct trait of its own.A character driven screenplay, as many of Schrader's films, it builds on the mistery surrounding its lead, William Tell (Oscar Isaac) and his shadowy past, as he tries to seek a form of redemption in helping a young boy (Tye Sheridan) that has indirectly been affected by events similar to his own.An unpredictable outsider reminiscent of Travis Bickle from Taxi Driver, but more methodical and rational, a character that acts as narrator in Schrader's signature voice-overs but whose psyche remains out of the viewer's sight, a feature that further increases the fascinating aura of this contemporary dark romantic hero.The one negative note is the marginal role of Willem Dafoe's character, central to the story but that hardly has any screentime, and of whose motivations hardly any clue is provided.It is also another Schrader film that homages Bresson, although subtly. While First Reformed is strongly derivative of Diary of a Country Priest, The Card Counter references Pickpocket, although in a less persistent manner.(extract from my full review on comeandreview)",The Card Counter

29,bastille-852-731547,"Bleak, well-acted, but only moderately effective character study",7,11 September 2021,"Paul Schrader's new film is, to no surprise, another dark and meditative character study that seeks to analyze complex questions relating to vengeance and morality. Oscar Isaac gives a strong leading performance in the film, and his lead role was the primary reason I was interested in seeing this. I wasn't sure whether this would be that distinct and authentic a film or a more generic one, but the very strong reviews out of Venice convinced me to see it. The film's performances are generally strong and its aesthetics are potent, but its narrative doesn't hold up quite as well as one would hope.The film's plot centers on William Tell (Isaac,) a former military interrogator who served 8.5 years in a military prison. He has an obsessive interest in poker, and plays in various tournaments while aspiring to go to the World Series of Poker. After crossing paths with a financially troubled young man (Tye Sheridan,) a plot of revenge on a former commanding officer at Abu Grahib (Williem Dafoe) comes into formation. Isaac's character acting is disciplined and methodical, while clearly conveying the character's emotional torments, erratic tendencies, and interpersonal challenges. Tye Sheridan's performance is strong and thorough as well, and does a good job articulating a genuine sense of grit. Tiffany Haddish plays a friend of Tell who often accompanies him to various poker tournaments, but her character is unfortunately not as well-utilized within the story as she could be. I love Williem Dafoe as an actor, but unfortunately he is underutilized here as well. The film's aesthetics are characteristic of Schrader and, to a lesser degree, Scorsese (who produced the movie,) but that makes them no less strong--color contrasts, rock music, wide shots in both scale and scope, and an overarching sense of grittiness. Despite these strong qualities, the film's plot unfortunately ends up becoming more predictable and uneven as it goes on, and ends up muddling its worldview and messages on morality--or the severe lack of it.

31,Oktay_Tuna,Memorable But Lacks Something,7,13 October 2021,"This film is a Paul Schrader film, even if you had only watched 1 film from him, you would know. I like his work, not a huge fan of him but he is definitely a great writer. The film starts with an explanation in card counting and at first I was like there is no way a film can count me card counting but then I realised that the movie wasn't trying to teach me card counting. It was just demonstrating that the main character had a lot of free time in the prison to learn that and master poker etc. Then we get introduced to a typical revenge plotline and with single hints throughout we realize that what the main character wants to do is show the kid that revenge is bs and actually belirler that this will work but it is very clear that throughout the journey all the kid thinks of is revenge(Google earth etc.) And in the end the kid actually wins the argument between the two even though he dies(the main character gets the revenge but it is not a clean murder, he wants to get caught after it which I thought was very interesting in terms of character analysis) His love interest(in a way) also provides a lot of symbolism, one being his chance at redemption. The main character is a very complex character and the film is thematically very rich. What I described so far sounds like a 10 but then why 7? Because I didn't feel like I was watching a film. This could have been a better book rather than a film. There is a lot to talk about and it is a memorable experience but I can't say I enjoyed it that much(the suspense was there but only for a short period of time)",The Card Counter
32,MongoLloyd,How do you spell Kirk with a C?,4,12 October 2021,"This is the most pedantic storyline I've seen play out as a film in a long time. The essence of the storyline is a little too ""Hard Eight"" for my liking, although the lonely life of a card counting professional gambler IS fascinating, the story quickly veers into amateurish and implausible territory. For no discernible reason, the card counter asks some unlikable stranger he briefly met to ride with him on his gambling journeys. And then decides to bail him out of his debts.

33,soulexpress,The best film I've seen this year!,10,27 September 2021,"THE CARD COUNTER is a film for thinking grown-ups with an attention span, which accounts for its low regard at IMDb. These naysayers are better off with routine Hollywood drivel like JUNGLE CRUISE, HALLOWEEN KILLS, and whatever piece of Madea garbage Tyler Perry is currently working on.As for THE CARD COUNTER, it is a brilliant film that crackles with dramatic tension worthy of Hitchcock. The whole time, it felt like a violent catastrophe was just two seconds off. The three leads each turned in a memorable performance worthy of Oscar consideration. The cinematography is beautiful and Paul Schraeder's direction is razor-sharp. Yes, the pacing is leisurely, but the story held my interest from beginning to end.I would rather see a dozen more films like THE CARD COUNTER than one more $100 million epic about some doofus with superpowers.",The Card Counter

There are pacing issues and it needs a more compelling through line, imo.

39,TheAnimalMother,Watch Your Weight,8,25 September 2021,"It's all about weight. Tipping the scales! Is that a spoiler? Yes...and no.If you haven't seen this film yet, I wouldn't recommend reading this past the 'spoiler alert below' note near the bottom. However the majority of this review before that note should not negatively affect or spoil your viewing of the film.I'm a person who has played in many, many poker tournaments and let me just start by saying that really, this is not at all a poker film. In few ways is this a true reflection of the modern Texas hold 'em tournament game, nor is this of any real importance to the story. So, it really doesn't matter. However for those who are interested in this because it may seem like it is actually a 'poker film'; Don't bother, it really isn't. I imagine that most, if not all of the Blackjack aspect is legitimately true numbers wise. Though I'm not even entirely sure about that. Nor does that really matter either, and Schrader may have even messed with that just because these things ultimately have little to no meaning in the film in full scope.What are we really counting here?For the most part, Paul Schrader films are only for certain types of film lovers. Many will find this film slow and even pointless. On the other hand many will find it entirely engrossing and will find the watch a very worthy and somewhat unique experience. Many Schrader films are just that, a real experience to watch. This film fits into this mold because it's a film that challenges the viewer emotionally, philosophically, morally. It will challenge your comfort zone at least to some degree, just as many of his other films do. Schrader films are often a lot closer to real life than most American films, not in that every aspect is entirely authentic nessicarily; But in that they resemble truer to life type human experiences than most films are ever able to capture/mimic, and these are almost all internal experiences. The complexities of human characters are more real with Schrader, and because of this the dilemmas often feel more real as well. This, no matter how convenient some aspects of the story may sometimes seem.I've seen a few people making comments in their reviews about this film not being realistic in some ways, and that this ruined the film for them. My advice, and even question is, why would you go into a film expecting anything/something? From the very beginning of this film, it's made plain as day that this is not a story that has any interest in being 100% authentic about our world; That is other than capturing realistic internal human type experiences. That's all that really matters here! Pretty much everything else is just the dressing, the convenient delivery system if you will. If you didn't see this, that's most likely because you were too busy looking for other things. You may as well watch the film with you're ears stuffed with cotton. Narrowness of mental focus will rarely find a Schrader film worth it. Watching a film is not an action in truth, other than just letting it in. Your senses are already in absorption mode without doing anything, like autopilot. It's the doing that gets in the way of clear vision, the only thing to do is to quiet your mind and take it in. In other words, focus on watching the film. If you're not letting it all in, are you even really watching it? Think about the film afterward. Trying to fit a piece of art into your own limited vision of what art should be is an endeavor rooted in self centered control. Artistic work is a kind of communication, and trying to put boundaries or rules on it is a mockery of it's very purpose; And the greatest art of all is that which is reflective of the self, simply because this can often inspire growth, internal evolution, progression, and this is definitely such a work.In terms of acting, this film comes somewhat close to perfection. In my view Schrader has written a number of great screenplays over the years and this is definitely another one of them.Watch those emotional calories now!***Spoiler Alert Below***We all know the feeling of when something is weighing heavy on us internally or when a weight has been lifted. A weight upon our conscience one might say, or one may call it spiritual weight or something similar. However you choose to define such feelings, it's in these very familiar, yet often less looked at aspects of the internal human life that Schrader's film is interested in. Tipping internal scales that produce extreme reactions in the real world is honestly such an important and relevant topic right now. This film really looks at how extreme events can take a toll on people internally, especially for those who cannot find forgiveness (Or other means of healing) within themselves. Sometimes this weight becomes too much for a person to bare, and in some way or another, the weight eventually manifests into worldly action. The danger of entertaining the thought of the extreme manifestation is even subtly and wonderfully put into the dialogue here.This is an 8.5 out of 10 on my scale. The film has serious weight!",The Card Counter
40,levybob,"I'm Sorry, but this is simply not good",3,11 September 2021,"The Card Counter is a type of story we've all seen and / or heard before. A character has his or her life in order. Everything is focused. Each day like the day before. The same clothes, food, job, lack of emotional vulnerability. And this seems to be working. Until one day something or, more likely, someone comes along and our 'hero' is forced to take a risk. To deviate from the prescribed norm. And that gets either good or bad results for the hero. And forms the story's major plot device.And here is why this latest 'take' on the story does not work. (1) We do not know what drives our hero; we have no idea of who her is or why he is so controlled. (2) We do not know what there is about the someone who comes along that would cause our hero to take as big a risk as he does. (3) The plot contrivances are so over-the-top that the viewer all but screams 'No'. A three-way chance meeting at a trade show is the coincidence of all coincidences. (4) A whole lot of action (in fact nearly all action) takes place 'off screen'. (5) The fish-eye lens used in dream sequences and flashbacks does no one a favor. (6) This is a small character-driven film; a rarity nowadays. And as such it has the responsibility of being better. (7) Director Paul Shrader; what in the world were you thinking?And there's more. It's dark. The music is mind-numbing ....

The presentation thrown at us right in the beginning feels engaging and interesting but with time, the quality starts to feel mild and down-way. The main attraction Oscar Isaac has delivered a performance that's seems good enough but little a bit stiff at some point. Other actors have done reasonable work also. In terms of story there's nothing spicy that blooms from the roots of the plot, it's just one single thing that revolves around and goes on in a repetitive way for almost two hours.

Just about everything but being entertaining. A card player takes a young man under wing and wants to help him. Why? The young man is about as interesting as a brick. In fact all the characters are boring and one dimensional. The pacing of this film is snail like. You're practically screaming at the film for it to move along.The dumbest thing of all is the film is called ""The Card Counter"" because the main character counts cards at blackjack. Yet he spends the whole movie playing poker. It'd be like calling the movie ""The Baseball Player"" and it's a movie about a guy playing basketball. It just seems like there wasn't a lot of thought put into that aspect. In fact, you'll ask yourself, why was this made? Who thought this was a good script and would be entertaining?

At least Oliver Stone served in Vietnam.This movie is not really about poker, casinos, the mob or anything else you might be expecting from the title, it is a hot mess of anti-American wokeness.The plot has holes large enough to drive through, and is mostly unbelievable. The mere act of wrapping everything in your hotel room in clean sheets you carry around in a suitcase would take several hours, especially the way it shows him lacing string and tying knots on table legs. There would be no time to write a few chapters in your journal then go play poker for hours, check out by noon and start over again in a new hotel room every day.That singular precept is not possible to do, and it is never explained why the person, supposedly a brilliant card counting card player, would even waste 6 or 7 hours a day doing this just to undo it it the next day, then do it all over again. Just dumb.I believe Hannibal Lecter cooked and ate parts of his enemies. I do not believe this guy does this to every room he stays in, and changes rooms every day, and don't really care why he chooses such an unexciting hobby.The rest of the movie is just as unbelievable. His dreams of Aby Ghraib, his new-found young friend, his upending his life to give the kid he's only known a few days all that money, if the kid will only speak to his estranged mother.I don't think that Tommy Wiseau could have helped this movie.

With some sort of psychological aspect to 'em, right??! Like Rounders meets Lie to Me. I'm ready! I'm waiting.. waiting...
Ok, cut to Tye Sheridan's character, and more of the interrogation/torture storyline - ok, ok, I'm with it, he's a card counter, but this is really a revenge story!

Be prepared for a very very detailed character study acted superbly by Oscar Isaac - and not much else so go in with low expectations.Sure it has some deeper meaning and themes like all of Shrader's scripts and Oscar Isaac does a phenomenal acting job that maybe rivals Ed Norton in Rounders yet this script is blaise and predictable even though it has some wonderful layers to it playing with the Poker Card Counting and past of Will Tell. And some might find some thought provoking element of US Guilt/Redemption for the treatment of prisoners for 9/11 and the human rights violations yet that is it and there is so much time wasted on the guilty\redemption character study and endless poker scenes that it ends up being 2 dimensional with a very predictable ending that maybe another draft should have been written to build up more on William Dafoe's character and the other supporting characters or even a more complex ending instead of this flat dull ending. Or maybe that is the entire point of how Shrader wants to portray the current state of US govt and military having an empty morality that has no remorse. I was only taking orders and now I have to live with my guilt/death.Spoiler: The card counter Will Tell wants redemption and the 1st act gets the point across beyond any doubt except that the 2nd act dwells so much on it again that he suddenly is awakened by a new love interest and making $$ to save little Cirk and try to give him a new life and direction only to be shocked in the 3rd act ....to witness the obvious predictable outcome of Cirk wanting to instead ""still"" kill William Dafoe for his fathers death/suicide (which is pretty obvious since Cirk is obsessed by this one goal and never shows any indication otherwise and even says this Poker life is pretty repetitive and boring... much like this script) . So the idea that Shrader thought we would all be shocked by this event and the grand finale of Will Tell having to now complete the redemption and be forced to kill his nemesis is not really a big surprise plus it is done in such a lame dull rushed manner. William Dafoe just walks in the next room for his demise like a lame duck with not much to say at all which pretty much is how one feels once the movie ends - except there is a tiny bit of love interest to wrap it up that for some odd reason is thrown in to the movie with Haddish who barely has a part in the film much like Cirk character that is pretty blaise also that really does not even feel believable. You almost wish that Shrader would have added some depth to his character and instead of asking him to visit his mom with all of the poker winnings tp start a new life- it would have been wonderful to find out Cirk is something entirely different. Shrader even writes the lines and makes us think maybe there is a chance this script has more depth with line from Isaac Oscar saying "" The fear is at the tip of your fingers, feet and your ... but Nope. Cirk just goes along and does the obvious of failing to kill William Dafoe and forcing Will Tell to kill his nemesis for killing his supposed son....and the film is all about just guilt/redemption and nothing more.This could have been a masterpiece yet it falls apart in so many areas that it fails in the end except for being a fabulous character study by Isaac Oscar who does a phenomenal job.Hopefully Shrader will have better luck in his next film as they all cant be Taxi Driver or Raging Bull.5 stars for Isaac.",The Card Counter

There's no apparent connection between gambling and the protagonist's past. It's merely coincidental, as a function of free time, and there's no deeper meaning to it.Despite the varied filming locations, the film still manages to come off as somewhat low budget. It also seems like some of the sets were re-used for different locations.There's also not a whole lot of on screen chemistry, even though the film tries its hand at a contrived romance. It would have helped if the other characters had some of their own scenes to develop their backstory. But, as it is, we just get a cursory explanation for why they exist in the film, which doesn't really get fleshed out. As a result, we don't care about them.Consequently, the film becomes somewhat predictable; and the climax is ultimately just defeatist and depressing, and not really satisfying from a movie-going experience.",The Card Counter

105,kboi,I liked it but wanted to REALLY LIKE IT,5,17 September 2021,"I so wanted to like this movie. And I did up to a point. The gambling topic and casinos are always an interesting topic to me. Seeing the Martin Scorsese name associated with it, I expected greatness. The movie had an interesting look to it. It did move slowly at times as the main character (William) was a moody, thinker type the entire film. That character trait did add drama to the story because you just didn't know whether he was sane, insane, a good guy, or bad guy. As the storyline progressed, we started seeing the dark, hidden past that haunted him. Where it fell apart for me was the final 15 or so minutes. Time and distance realities seemed to go into fantasyland and the viewer was expected to just accept the unbelievable in order to get to the movie finale. For a serious drama, I found that unacceptable. This movie can be considered a deep thinker movie and I can see some people truly liking the ending. I just felt disappointed and was hoping for a better climax to what was an interesting lead up to it.(BTW: Blackjack card counting, assuming no devices are used to do it, is not illegal or cheating in the U. S. as someone alluded to in their review. Casinos don't like it because it can hurt their profit margin and if they suspect a person is doing it to their financial success, they can ban them from their privately-owned business property.

108,williamguilfoyle,A Metaphor For Getting To The Source Of Suffering,10,10 September 2021,"Just came out of the film about an hour ago. Sat with it for a bit, perplexed.*Spoilers follow*I was confused by the American flag-clad frat-boy-looking poker player and his entourage.Who are these guys who continually yell, ""USA! USA! USA!""It all came together when I realized that Oscar Isaac's character left the table in the end, and walked away from the poker game he was playing with the ""USA"" guy, and went straight to the home of the guy responsible for being, yet never punished or publicly called out as, the source of the greatest immoral acts of America since the Vietnam war.It became clear, just now, sitting in this bar drinking Crown Royal and an IPA, about an hour after the film, that the film is a metaphor for getting to the source of suffering, and for forgetting the worthless fighting and competition going on with most of us as we argue online with supposed ""Patriots"" with American flags in their profiles who are simply propagandized tools of the power structure. They are often known as ""MAGAs.""Willem Defoe's character is symbolic of a heartless American war machine, a greedy immoral character who speaks at a seminar in a casino, of all places, an establishment that is all about the greed. And Defoe's role in the film is literally ""Guy who teaches people how to torture human beings.""The more I think about it, after watching the film an hour ago, this film is freaking amazing.What a powerful message.Oscar Isaac's character was the guy who enacted the very training he was told to use against the ""enemy"" only to be punished with prison time. Yet, he was never done with his sentence, even when released. He sought out redemption by working to gain the funds to help guide and set right Tye Sheridan's character, by veering him away from the same path Isaac's character had been on: a side of murder, torture, disregard for life and humanity.In the end, the poker player (the fighter/warrior) sits at the table, and as the MAGA (tool of propaganda) looks across at him and is ready to bet/fight, Oscar gets up, leaves the table, and heads straight to Defoe's house to take out the system itself.It doesn't get much better than this.I'd say this film, The Card Counter, and mother! By Darren Aronofsky would be a great set of films to show in order to deprogram an America under the spell of propaganda and idealism so resolutely that reality in general is unobtainable; a very dangerous and sorry prospect for a world when the nation these people inhabit has the most nukes.",The Card Counter

But when it comes to drama, she's too twitchy and doesn't seem to know which way to play a scene. This movie is so low-key that it barely has a heartbeat. What we want to see is a story arc where a man who has come to terms with his bad deeds, slowly convinces himself to do justice to a bad man.

112,doyoubelieveingod-39954,The latest worthy addition to the Schrader canon,8,19 September 2021,"** Heavy spoilers towards end **This movie was bound for a lot of 1s from angry viewers complaining about it being slow, boring or pointless. Those who will get and enjoy films like this know the deal and it will find its audience.This film is pretty bleak and tragic, but more in an existential way than a parade of horrors. It tells the story of a man unable to move on from his past, opting instead to keep spinning in place with some well-crafted commentary mixed in.I think the performances were very good. Haddish grew on me as it went (her character is just so wholesome), but she needed to be fleshed out more. My biggest criticisms are that I think the script could have used one more draft, the directing style was off-putting to me for the most part except for two things that were absolutely fantastic (the date and the fish eye stuff), and there are a lot of glaring problems with the audio.It fumbles on some stuff but I think it mostly sticks the landing. I was disappointed with the ending initially but the more I think about it, the more it grows on me and completes the picture. Cirk and Will form a father-son type bond (La Linda also as the mother) where Will sees him as a chance to redeem himself for what he took part in. Like the card counting system, he's been in the negative for too long, and this would be a positive to at least neutralize the balance. When he ultimately fails this when Cirk dies, he finally gives in to his fate and avenges Cirk and punishes the unknown agent of destruction, a symbol for the forces of evil entangled in the situation at Abu Ghraib and post-911 American foreign policy, let's say. This coincides with the allusion to the legend of William Tell.My anticipation was that he was going to take the higher path, since Cirk and Will are shown as yin and yang to a degree (including the classic of Cirk in white and Will in black when they have their first meeting at the bar). Also I thought he would confront the imposter American - a symbol of the legacy of our various military occupations, and the broadcasting of american exceptionalism - but I feel I just played into Schrader's hand. Some of this is tricky to extrapolate, but hopefully you get my meaning.I think it's over all very good, but there are just too many big flaws with it to recommend it as a masterpiece.",The Card Counter

However, it's only downhill from there. The movie seems to have an identity crisis, with two different plots that never seem to mesh together well. Not to mention the fact that either plot really isn't that interesting. The card playing scenes are the best parts of the movie, but it takes forever to get to them.(Side Tangent: You gotta love how this movie's about someone who learned how to cheat at blackjack, and then spends the whole movie playing poker.

Oscar Isaac's screen personae was charismatic as usual but Tye Sheridan and Tiffany Hadish's performances sunk under the weight of the poor direction.

With a great lead acting performance, but possibly the worst supporting performances I have ever seen.Oscar Isaac is excellent, displaying all the depth, emotion and nuance you'd expect from one of the best. His gravitas carries large sections of the film, and maybe could have made the movie good... if not for the issues.From the moment Haddish is on screen, she sticks out as a horrible sore thumb. She doesn't fit in any part of this world or movie. In a serious movie, she can't stop her stupid goofy smiles (even when people are rude or mean, she just has the same vacant smile as if they just said something really suggestive).In a realistic movie, she is constantly bombastic & unbelievable. In a movie about interior dialogue & Isaac's face telling us volumes, she just bluntly says the most annoyingly obvious thing. Huge parts of this were the writing, obviously, as every line she said made me cringe. But the lines that weren't half bad she still gives with wooden delivery & the wrong tone every time.I honestly cannot think of a worse performance by an actress that I have ever seen... and I'm really trying to think of one worse.How they cast her, or wrote such a horrible part (even the costuming is awful & clashes horribly with everything about the film)... I can't say. And the chemistry she has with Isaac (and his character) is even worse. Their supposed love story is the most not believable storyline I've tried to watch in a very long time, it was so cringe worthy that I actually started looking away every time they were on screen together.The choice of actor for the kid also seems suspect, as he was pretty terrible every time he spoke too. He seemed bored, disinterested with every line he delivered (including those relating to his supposed anger toward the man he wanted to kill). And the character design didn't do him any favors.The entire plot about the kid never made much sense. What exactly did Isaac see in this bratty, moody, unlikable soul? He calls him ""a good kid"" multiple times despite no evidence of this. The kid doesn't even seem to like HIM, or even say thank you, even after he gives him hundreds of dollars in every city they visit.Also... this kid just drops everything to ride around & do nothing all year with him? Huh?Aside from these huge character & actor issues... the movie is dull. The pacing is way too slow, we don't find out the true heart of what's wrong with Isaac until about 30-40 minutes in... there's not a tense or interesting scene until the final half hour.An interesting idea & great performance by Isaac that could have been at least a decent movie.But it isn't.

It ends up having a slow pace and has technical problems in some scenes. Despite this, it is positively surprising due to Oscar Isaac's acting, who managed to bring a good performance to the screen.

148,msmi-41284,A solid entry in the Paul Schrader cannon of self-destructive men,7,3 October 2021,"Stop me if you've heard this one before. A lonely man who lives on the fringes of society seeks to atone for his sins by helping someone else. This is Paul Schrader's bailiwick, and with Taxi Driver, First Reformed and other screenplays he's written throughout his career, he's created a genre of films all to himself. (His body of work could be called a ""franchise"", a commercial connotation that I'm sure he would find darkly humorous.)Like many auteurs, Schrader can't resist revisiting themes that beguile him. Fortunately, he keeps finding different sides of the same protagonist to show us, like a jeweler examining a diamond's flaws through different sides and angles. Schrader's ruminations on the self-destructive nature of men isn't for everyone, but when he's on his game, as he is here, his films have a hypnotic quality that filmmakers half his age would be unable to replicate.Oscar Issac plays William Tell, a former soldier at Abu Ghraib who served eight and a half years in a military prison for his part in using enhanced interrogation techniques on prisoners of war. He learned how to count cards while serving time, and spends his days driving from casino to casino, earning just enough to not get thrown out. His constant travels earn him a living, but they also help him avoid remembering the things he did in Iraq that he still feels guilty about. Chance encounters with Gordo, a former military contractor who ""taught him the ropes"" (Willem Dafoe), Cirk, the son of a fellow soldier at Abu Ghraib (Tye Sheridan) and La Linda, a former poker player turned tournament recruiter (Tiffany Haddish), offer Tell avenues for redemption. Things don't go as planned, and violence becomes the only path left for Tell to purify his soul.Issac, leaving big-budget spectacles behind for the moment, delivers one the best performances of his career. He gives Tell the cool, dark and dangerous façade of a human assault rifle. His slick-backed hair and zero tells belie the lethal intensity lurking just beneath the surface. Haddish dials things down substantially, giving her performance a warm vulnerability while retaining her trademark swagger. Schrader directs the proceedings in ways that clearly channel Scorcese, but with much more patience for observation. Scenes play out organically, with the actors taking the lead instead of the camera. The movie operates at a casual pace, and its payoff is not what you would expect if you haven't been paying attention. The scenes of torture may be difficult to stomach, but Schrader knows that like all sins, if they aren't acknowledged and confronted, they will always stay with you, no matter how long you try to run from them.",The Card Counter

But a lot of you are apparently so inundated in kiddie Marvel or John Wick movies, baby rattles for grownups, that you're no longer able to discern or appreciate this quality - which requires a bit of patience. Cinema is not (just) to entertain you or to offer escape, it's to get you to think and reflect on society and on your own lives. And to make things better.

It can't decide what it wants to focus on so it ends up not delving into anything in a satisfying way.First of all i thought this was a movie about poker, it is not. I would've wished for some suspense in any of the poker scene. Maybe it was to convey that the main character was just as bored of playing as we were of seeing him play? Probably, but it took way too much screentime, especially since the scenes lacked the suspense of playing high stakes. I don't know anything about poker, so maybe a person whit a greater knowlegde of the game would enjoy the scenes more.The main character is struggling with his past and as the film goes on we learn more and more about what happened. The absolute worst part of this entire movie is that it did not make me feel sympathy towards the main character, or even feel like i understood him. If a movie that is so heavily based on one characters storyline can't convey that, it is not a good movie. I wanted to root for the main character, but I never got motivated enough for it. Even though his motivation for playing poker tournaments was a huge focus in the movie, I never actually felt it. In a good movie you will understand the characters motives without it having to be said, in this movie it is the other way around.

Which is disappointing because the film shows the best explanation for card counting in blackjack, bluffing in poker, and gambling in general that would make it easy for the casual non-gambler to understand.Oscar Isaac's character William Tell is a compelling character that is trying to make amends for his past indiscretions and throughout the movie you see flashbacks that slowly reveal the person he was and is now. But in a movie called The Card Counter none of this matters. The casual movie goer would think this is a movie about cards.

179,dhweste,Best movie so far this year. You will want to take a long walk afterwards,9,2 October 2021,"I honestly do not understand the collection of negative reviews this movie has accumulated. It is an excellent (although very bleak) meditation on the war on terror and it's lasting impact on American life. Despite scorcese producing do not expect goodfellas or the departed, it's much more like the Schrader written Taxi Driver which is similarly patiently paced and largely character driven. Although the movie is ostensibly about gambling and card games, it is really about 2 people whose lives were deeply affected by U. S. government torture. Rather than focusing on the tortured, the movie concentrates on the lives of the frontline torturers and the ugly lives they lead trying to live with their horrendous actions.Isaac is excellent, a great subtle performance. On the level of Ethan Hawke who played a similar role Shrader's First Reformed. Haddish is quite charming and brings some necessary lightness. Sheridan is also strong. All the performances are understated yet complex.There are some very jarring sequences depicting acts of torture committed by American soldiers during the Iraq war. It is truly unsettling to see all the reviews referring to the film as boring as I was very affected by the sequences and it suggests perhaps a desensitization to this violence. None of these reviews even mention this stuff! Despite growing up during the Iraq war and the Bush era of the war on terror, I still find the reality of American actions to be deeply disturbing. This film does not shy away from that reality but it also dares you to view the torturers as human as well, a very risky yet ultimately successful venture.This movie is excellent. If you're looking for a film that is well crafted, well acted, and not full of cgi and action sequences see this movie. Know that it is a patient, thoughtful film punctuated by scenes of brutal military violence. Perhaps the best single reflection on America in the post-9/11 period during this 20 year anniversary.",The Card Counter

187,cfischer83-1,Garbage,1,8 October 2021,I never give reviews but I'm so mad at this move for wasting 1 hour and 51 minutes of my life that I'll never get back. This fails on every conceivable level. You know how some movies are so bad they're good? This is so bad it's beyond good and all they way back to bad again. Boring. Pointless. Bad acting. Green screen for half the movie with no reason. Pointless story. Did I mention pointless?,The Card Counter
188,jcliffordh,#WTHDIJW,1,18 September 2021,"I'm going to do everyone a favor as some reviewer said ""what the hell did I just watch""! Slow! Pointless! I can't tell you what the plot is, was or should be! To say this was bad, gives every other bad movie a bad name! I believe Norbert was better and i walked out on that!if i could sum it up in one word, that word is #HORRAWFUL.",The Card Counter
189,Ryan-Teets,Horrible!!,3,11 September 2021,"Oscar Issacs was great, but the whole thing is just missing any point. This garbage should never have been released in theaters. This is no Ocean's movie or anything entertaining whatsoever. Even the dark under story barely makes it to the surface and you are just left there wondering when the plot is even going to begin. What a waste of time. I haven't seen a movie this bad since The Rum Diaries or Moonlight.",The Card Counter

195,horpelkrufkin,Not good,5,4 October 2021,"I am not sure how they were able to get the A-List actors into this film. The script is average. But the execution, in every other way, is middle of the road at best if not horrible.Cinematography:
Horrible. I think the producers did a favor for a friend.Editing:
Also horrible. The actors did quite well, considering the below average script. But the shots were horribly assembled and should be reassembled immediately.Soundtrack:
Music wasn't bad, but wasn't used well because the editing was not good.Directing:
I'd say that other than acting, this is where the film was at least average. The actors were quite good and I hope they got paid that way. But what the director, editor and cinematographer did with their work is a damned shame.I would pass on this film.",The Card Counter

197,georgevarghese-79521,Director should be fired,5,17 September 2021,Terrible directing and waste of incredible talent in Oscar Isaccson. Tiffany hadish missed the mark. Storyline was very poor. Martin Scorcesse assisted in this movie and it looks like everything he touches turns to dust (similar to irishman)- long transitions and empty screen time.Pick up the pace and work on more engaging video angles and cinematography!,The Card Counter
198,nathanwilliams-42233,"Worth a watch, not much more",5,11 September 2021,"Whilst the final act is engaging, the journey to get there is slow, at times to the point of tedium. The story takes us from casino to casino, never truly giving a sense of where we'll end up, not really giving us a reason to care.The dialogue has moments of humanity, but more often than not it felt heavy-handed, as if the film was written by a first-year film student attempting to prove their genius to their peers. Isaac's performance is good, given his main direction was probably along the lines of ""don't give away your emotions, but remember that your past hurts."" Sheridan is given very little to work with in terms of bringing his character to life, although one scene in particular allows his character a moment of relatability. Haddish brought the most lively performance of the main cast, but her characterization is probably the weakest. Defoe isn't on the screen long enough that his performance would pull the film one way or another.I'm firmly on the fence about the visual style of the film. There are times where the angles used in conversation highlight the fact that you're hearing dialogue written for a movie, and not experiencing a conversation between people. Additionally, there are many shots that linger for what feels like an eternity, without the emotional weight or stunning beauty that usually demands that kind of visual style, leaving you wondering when the film will be allowed to resume. This includes some of the transitions between scenes.Finally, the audio in this film has some strange moments, including phasing between mics, varying levels in the dialogue within a scene (if often sounds like switching between two mic positions or different takes), or ADR that doesn't quite match what you're seeing on the screen.All told, The Card Counter sets out to tell a story of redemption and reckoning with your past. It manages to do so, but isn't particularly compelling along the way.",The Card Counter
