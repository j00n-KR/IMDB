0,SnoopyStyle,hints of originality fades into forgettable action,5,18 June 2021,"""Infinites"" are people who have achieved a form of immortality through reincarnation. They have split into two groups in a battle of good versus evil. Evan McCauley (Mark Wahlberg) has always have knowledge beyond his experience. He forges a sword for a drug dealer in exchange for illegal meds to keep his sanity. He gets arrested and attacked by Bathurst (Chiwetel Ejiofor). He is saved by Nora Brightman who brings him into the world of the Infinites.This seems to have an intriguing elevator pitch. It's the story of reincarnation as a superhero movie. So the start seems fine. The drug dealer, the police station, and the epic escape are all fine. Once the movie starts doing expositions, it completely stalls. Wahlberg starts reverting back to his Wahlberg mannerisms. It's the blandest of action thrillers and the most bombastic. It takes any hint of original concept and turns it into forgettable non-descript action.",Infinite
1,claudio_carvalho,Brainless and Senseless,4,20 September 2021,"""Infinite"" is a brainless and senseless action-sci-fi film. The flawed plot is a complete mess, without character development, but based on an interesting premise: an original view of reincarnation. Unfortunately, the reason why the villain Bathurst, performed by Chiwetel Ejiofor, does exist is amazingly stupid. Bathurst wants to destroy the mankind and all the living things on Earth since he has been bored of reincarnating for three hundred years. However, he has a bullet that holds the souls of who is shot in a chip, avoiding the soul to reborn and reincarnate again. So why doesn't he commit suicide with this bullet and avoid all the troubles. What is the purpose of existing The Believers other than seek out for the egg to avoid the destruction of life on Earth? Therefore, to like the story, the viewer needs to turn off the brain and watch the good CGI only. My vote is four.Title (Brazil): ""Infinito"" (""Infinite"")",Infinite
2,nogodnomasters,Look Inside,6,19 June 2021,"The film opens with plot narration. There are people who remember all of their past lives. They are divided into two groups, one that wants to make the world better with their experience and another group that wants to destroy all life on the planet so they can end the cycle of reincarnation memories. People who have past memories drive cars fast and do a lot of fish tailing. It was a bit overdone. Evan McCauley (Mark Wahlberg ) has memory issues and only has glimpses of his past and a metal plate in his head. He is the only person who knows where the ""egg"" is located a device that can destroy all living things on the planet.Now they do have bullets that can stop the reincarnation process, but rather than shot themselves in the head, they must destroy the world. Since Evan is the only person who knows the location of the weapon, why try to make him remember if you are the good guys? Let him forget. Lots of fighting and crazy stunts.Guide: F-word.

3,kosmasp,Very realistic ... not,7,5 October 2021,Anyone who thinks that Fast and Furious has gotten way over the top with stunts and what not ... well wait til you see this. Just the beginning alone takes the cake ... not the car chase per se ... but the stunt out of that ... scene. You'll know what I mean when you see the movie.I guess it sets the tone. And then we get Mark Wahlberg. Depending on how you feel about him ... you will love the rest of the movie or loathe it. I was ok with it ... he has some really interesting over the top scenes and stunts. Well his character does. Add to that some really good actors ... or funny ones ... and you have an intriguing if flawed movie. Could be worse ...,Infinite

5,paul_haakonsen,Good enough entertainment for what it was...,6,1 August 2021,"I stumbled upon the 2021 movie ""Infinite"" and actually hadn't even heard about it prior to getting to sit down to watch it. Weird, I know, right?But I must admit that the movie's synopsis sounded interesting enough, and usually Mark Wahlberg tends to provide adequate entertainment, so of course I gave ""Infinite"" a watch.And I will say that writers Ian Shorr and Todd Stein definitely managed to churn out a story that provided with solid entertainment for the course of the movie. And it was a storyline that actually had a lot of interesting aspects to it. So yeah, I was definitely well entertained while watching ""Infinite"".This movie is driven by a good combination of action and storytelling. Sure, this wasn't a tongue in cheek narrative that required all that much attention from the viewers, but the writers managed to make the storyline deep enough to actually involve the audience a bit more than just popcorn munching.And yeah, the storyline does come off as being rather predictable, which it also is at times.There were some moments in the movie where the laws of physics were simply and blatantly just disregarded, which made me curl my toes. But it was just a minor thing, because the movie proved to be entertaining.Sure, this is essentially your average run-of-the-mill action movie with Mark Wahlberg, and a lot of things could be said for his acting. But I was entertained for the action ride that it was.I am rating ""Infinite"" a six out of ten stars. The movie is worth a watch, as it combines action and story well enough.",Infinite
6,CinemaSerf,"Looks good, falls short",6,6 October 2021,"This is one of those films that has a solution right from the get-go, as plain as the nose on your face that by the end, or maybe even the end of the beginning (as Churchill might have said) you would cheerfully have applied to yourself... Poor old ""Evan"" (Mark Wahlberg) has an amazing memory, but is constantly hassled by vivid hallucinations that are driving him towards a mental breakdown. Somehow, though, some semblance of sanity rears it's head leading ""Evan"" to wonder if is he part of a plan to destroy all of mankind, or is he part of the solution that may just save it from Chiwetel Ejiofor's ""Bathurst 2020"" (sadly, no, not the Aussie motor car race)? The plot itself is quite interesting, and the overlapping memories creating the terrifyingly unstable state of our hero could have made for a much better effort had director Antoine Fuqua not tried to cram far too much into 1¾ hours. The sacrifices to characterisation and detail, coupled with the relentlessness of the action scenes (that actually serve to sterilise the plot, somewhat) just leave us with way too many holes and a totally undercooked story. Wahlberg is well passed his best, and though Sophie Cookson tries hard as ""Nora"" the whole thing just gets lost in it's own maze of confusion and poorly adapted dialogue. Sadly another example of a film that threw money at the talent and the look, but scrimped on an intelligent screenplay.",Infinite
7,neil-476,"Enjoy, but don't bother bringing your brain",7,17 October 2021,"There are a small number of people called Infinites who get reincarnated, and remember all their previous lives. One group regards this as a blessing, to be used to serve humanity. The other group regards it as a curse. They are led by a man who so badly hates 9 months of confinement with all his previous lives' memories in his head that he has invented a bomb which will destroy all life - his misery will only end when he has nothing to reincarnate into. The bomb has been hidden by one of the other group whose memories didn't boot up properly last time he got reincarnated.This, and other, interesting material gives rise to quite a lot of fairly routine, though well-staged, action and car chases plus a few preposterous moments (I suppose if you know you're going to be reincarnated then you may well ride a motor cycle off a cliff at a cargo plane armed only with a samurai sword). It's a pity that more weight wasn't given to the material itself, as it gets fairly short shrift next to the action.Chiwetel Ejiofor is class even while he's slumming, and Mark Wahlberg is - well, Mark Wahlberg.",Infinite
8,ferguson-6,over the top,4,10 June 2021,"Greetings again from the darkness. At one time or another, we've all been awed by a cinematic special effect. Some remarkable work is being done by the specialists in the industry, adding previously unimaginable elements to movies. As with most good things, too much of it can be detrimental to a cause. The latest greatest example of this is with Antoine Fuqua's (TRAINING DAY, 2001) current film, INFINITE. In a mind-bending science fiction thriller (think THE MATRIX), we expect special effects to play a role. What we get is a tidal wave of CGI that leaves us shaking our heads and wondering why no one recognized the extreme level of ridiculous reached here. The goal seems to have been to go above and beyond any ""Fast and Furious"" movie so that a comparison can't be found.Mark Wahlberg stars as Evan Michaels, a diagnosed schizophrenic with violent tendencies when he's not on medication. Evan is haunted regularly with hallucinations and dreams that seem real, and he's blessed with knowledge and skills that he's never learned and memories of places he's never been. As it turns out, Evan is part of a group called ""Infinites"". This group is divided in half: the good guy ""believers"" and the let's-end-the-world nihilists. These infinites are able to carry their memories from one life/body into the next as they are reincarnated. It's a terrific concept based on the novel ""The Reincarnationalist Papers"" by D. Eric Maikranz. Responsible for adapting the story for the screen are Ian Shorr and Todd Stein.One of the believers, played by Sophie Cookson (GREED, 2019), works with Evan in an attempt to access a specific memory for the location of a device (""the egg"") in hopes that they can save the world. Simultaneously, the nihilists and their powerful leader played by Chiwetel Ejiofor (12 YEARS A SLAVE, 2013) are trying to access that same memory in order to use the device to destroy the world. The story really boils down to good versus evil and trying to save the world instead of destroying it. Not overly complicated, which is a good thing in a Wahlberg film.Mr. Wahlberg, who looks increasingly like John Cena's little brother, does get to flash his biceps and abs multiple times, including a sequence as a blacksmith forging a samurai sword using ancient techniques. In addition to his typical physicality and always furrowed brow, Wahlberg's interjected wisecracks - the ones that work in his simple comedies - are lame and simply out of place here. Mr. Ejiofor, a previous Oscar nominee, goes all out in his outlandish portrayal of the super villain - it's quite a contrast to his more usual subdued dramatic performances and actually fun to watch.The supporting cast is solid and includes Dylan O'Brien, Jason Mantzoukas, Rupert Friend, Wallis Day, Toby Jones, Johannes Haukur Johannesson, and Liz Carr. As you might expect, given that the memories cover multiple centuries, the film's geographic locations are varied, and the characters bounce from Mexico to New York City to Scotland to Indonesia. Wahlberg and director Fuqua previously collaborated on SHOOTER (2007), but as mentioned previously, the special effects are just too far over the top here. The opening car chase scene is exhausting, and since we don't know why it's happening or who to pull for, it's mostly just noise without reason. Later, there is a stunt (teased in the trailer) that ensures anyone trying to give the benefit of doubt to the film will instantly surrender. A few attempts are made to trick viewers into believing some deep philosophical thoughts are at work here, and that life is bigger than all of us, but mostly we are left wondering ... why the absurdity?Premieres on Paramount+ on June 10, 2021.",Infinite
9,bombersflyup,Bad.,1,13 June 2021,"Infinite is pretty hard to sit through, with elements of The Matrix and like a video game, but you don't care about anything.Wahlberg sells out, poor casting, dialogue and choices everywhere.

10,deloudelouvain,Enjoyable sci-fi with plot holes.,6,10 August 2021,"After finishing watching a movie I always ask myself if I was entertained. In the case of Infinite I would be lying if I said no. It was entertaining, even with some severe plot holes, and scenes that didn't make much sense. It's just an interesting concept for a plot, maybe not perfectly executed, but still it was pleasant to watch. The cast was good, no complaining about that, so honestly I don't get all the extreme negative reviews. What do you expect from a sci-fi movie? It to be realistic? I don't. I just want to sit down, relax, and enjoy the show. That's what I did. Is Infinite going to be remembered? Probably not. Do I care? Certainly not.",Infinite
11,siderite,A complete failure,4,10 June 2021,"You've already seen this movie before, only it was with immortals or vampires or secret societies or some bull like that, yet my guess is that you've seen a better version of it. Infinite is a pure made for money, soulless and ultimately pointless production. The premise is magical in nature, but the entire film is about fast cars and futuristic weapons. The story itself is filled with logic holes, the action is underwhelming - minus a car chase at the start which was actually good, the acting is either bad or over the top and the human resource is underused.This is not one of those angry reviews for a movie I hate. I do not hate this movie. It's just really really dumb and I wish it was better. Against all odds I actually like Mark Wahlberg, but he keeps making incredibly idiotic films. Chiwetel Ejiofor actually tried to carry this entire thing on his acting and he couldn't. But look at all the other known names in this film: Dylan O'Brien is present only for the starting car chase scene that I mentioned above. He does a great job, then he dies. Rupert Friend is also in that, with much much less screen time. Toby Jones appears two times. I don't know Wallis Day, but I see that she played in quite a lot of series and she is highly rated; she says like three things in the entire thing. What happens in the rest of the movie, you ask? CGI establishing shots or tech that doesn't get explained or really used, random car chases and shootings and sword fights, almost unrelated to one another and without any sense and bad bored ""please shoot me"" acting.Bottom line: avoid this like the plague.",Infinite
12,Cineanalyst,Reincarnation Without a Soul,3,29 July 2021,"Hear me out, there's a kernel of a clever idea in what is a widely--and deservedly so--panned movie, ""Infinite."" Or, rather, it could've been made into something nifty by more competent filmmakers. Note how the action set pieces are all over the place. Lousy imitations of long Michael Bay-type car chases in the beginning and Marky-Mark air-bender in the end, choppy cutting around the stunts here and longer takes relishing in the fight choreography there--even some brief bullet-time-like-footage à la ""The Matrix"" (1999) to go along with cribbing its pseudo-spiritual narrative, sometimes it seems like generic sci-fi and at others it's merely fetishizing Eastern culture and religion, there's a headquarters that's never fully developed and a training montage that seemed to have been abandoned halfway through it. It's a mess, but consider the central premise here of reincarnation. Memories migrating to new bodies. Imagine an intelligent filmmaker who didn't just blithely rip-off other action movies, but consciously built upon those memories, transferring their souls to this new host. Alas, this isn't that.Appropriate given that ""Infinite"" appears to be the first big movie to premiere on the rebranded streaming service Paramount+, that it especially reminds me of a couple recent movies from the ancestor of streaming channels, Netflix: ""6 Underground"" (2019) and ""The Old Guard"" (2020). The opening car chase seems largely straight out of the former Michael Bay flick, and the control of history by immortals is of the latter. I want to focus on that first sequence, though, because it's such an abysmal cold open it sabotages the rest of the picture. I don't even care to ponder the premise that has transmigration of souls across race but apparently not sex. As with Bay's movie, it begins with its star narrating, and there's the unnecessary slow-mo shots, fast-car porn and incoherent action as destruction is wrought. With Bay, though, there is a coherent aesthetic--just as in those ""Transformers"" abominations. I don't like it, but I respect that he has a point of view, albeit one that involves destroying art to make way for his shiny cars, big explosions and gratuitous objectification of female body parts. Ancient Egypt, Renaissance Florence and all things beautiful to be run roughshod over.The Mexico City car chase here, however, has no character once so ever. Nothing about the situation and none of the characters have been established. Wahlberg's narration sets up the overall reincarnation gimmick, but he doesn't lend any personality to the chase itself as did Ryan Reynolds's interruptions. So, it's just an ugly, stupid action sequence with no stakes, no interest. We only learn later what it was about. I see why they added the Wahlberg narration at the bookends, too. Imagine how much stupider the premise would sound without it--if it were just dropped on us, as it is with Wahlberg's character, next to that private jet--after another car chase.I could mock Wahlberg all day, too, or wonder why Chiwetel Ejiofor is wasting his talent in this, but they just appear too capable beside the very bad acting of Sophie Cookson. It seemed as though she had the same blank expression until the climax. It's an atrocious performance. Anyways, the highlight I think comes early on from the sword-purchasing drug dealer. This character is the movie in a nutshell. Forget the apocalyptic plot and opposing teams of immortals, it's just inexplicable violent action under the facade of a superficial appreciation of culture and history, cinematic or otherwise, Eastern or Western. It's pretty much the only scene that successfully builds any compelling tension, too--over whether the movie incarnate will get away with chopping off a hand for the stupid thrill of it with the exoticized, Orientalist object, or whether all of that will be dragged out for the an entire feature by the supposed innate goodness of Wahlberg. Even if that didn't require an absurdly abundant amount of faith, it's still a faith that's ultimately unrewarded, but there I go again mocking Marky Mark.",Infinite
13,Thanos_Alfie,Crazy story...,5,13 October 2021,"""Infinite"" is an Action - Sci-Fi movie in which we watch a man starting to figure out that his hallucinations are visions from his past lives while he has to deal with a serious danger threatening human kind.I have to admit that after reading the description of the movie I did not have high hopes or expectations from it so, I was not disappointed. It has an interesting plot but not something that we have not watched before. I believe that the general idea was lost somewhere in the middle of the movie. The interpretations of both Mark Wahlberg who played as Evan McCauley and Chiwetel Ejiofor who played as Bathurst (2020) were good but nothing special and even with their interpretations they could not save the movie. To sum p, I have to say that ""Infinite"" is a nice action movie to spend your time and nothing more. I suggest you to lower your standards before watching it otherwise I am sure you will be disappointed by it.",Infinite
14,cruise01,Mindless escapism with an interesting concept and action packed thrills,10,11 June 2021,5 out of 5 stars.Infinite is an awesome science fiction action film that delivers an interesting concept about reincarnation and people having the abilities to remember there past lives. While there a group of bad guys lead by Chiwetel Ejiofor who are trying to retrieve a weapon that can eliminate all life. While Mark Wahlberg discovers that his past lives have been in an everlong battle trying to save it.Great plot. Seems similiar to other science fiction films like The Old Guard. And how reincarnation plays a factor and there are two groups of people who have the ability to remember there lives. One that is trying to end that life cycle and one trying to save it.The cast ensemble is great. Mark Wahlberg takes up the action role and delivers. Chiwetel Ejiofor plays a great villain. Sophie Cookson. And Jason Mantzoukas did good as well. Rupert Fiend and Dylan O Brien were good with there short roles.Antoine Fuqua did great with this action film. Definitely would be a summer blockbuster film. Lots of mindless action. Car chases and shoot outs. Fast paced. And a thrill ride that never slows down. The film is exciting. Loud.

15,Floated2,Confusing and falls flat,3,18 August 2021,"Infinite is apparently based upon a series novels and now adapted into a big budget film. With a relatively interesting premise and concept, the end result isn't great. This film lacks suspense, mystery and good writing. Mark Wahlberg doesn't seem to fit the character.This feels like a film which takes parts from other past greater films. And what we have is something quite confusing and not that engaging or entertaining. Quite disappointing.The signs that this film wasn't going to be anything special was it being rescheduled from a theatrical release to a straight to streaming release (and only a few months notice in advance). It was set up for a sequel and to kick start a franchise, though due to the struggles and criticism of this film, we highly doubt a sequel will be made.",Infinite
16,eddie_baggins,A horrible sci-fi with an even worse Mark Wahlberg performance,2,24 June 2021,"A film with (please forgive me) infinite possibilities on what it could provide in a thrilling sci-fi action romp sense, the first collaboration between director Antoine Fuqua and star Mark Wahlberg since their hit 2007 film Shooter is instead a DOA big-budget affair that its backer Paramount Plus must surely be questioning its investment in.Based on D. Eric Maikranz book The Reincarnationist Papers, Infinite harbors deep down within itself an intriguing set-up of warring factions of whom have the rare ability to be reincarnated upon death and reborn with past memories to do life all over again on a constant loop but as has been the case in recent times of both the career of the once good Antoine Fuqua (Training Day seems like lifetimes ago now) and the phoning it in Wahlberg, Infinite is a by the numbers affair without a single ounce of originality or creativity, squandering any chance it had of being something worthwhile from the moment it begins.Perhaps too consumed with the thought of opening more gyms/burger joints (an oxymoron if there ever was one), buying his kids basketball cards or renting himself out to betting ads, Wahlberg in particular here brings the film down to the doldrums with a robotic performance where it appears as though his in a constant state of shock and awe, mouth a gasp and eyes wide opened with final confirmation that gone are the days where Wahlberg's services in these type of mid-tier but watchable thrillers was a good thing, with the one-time Hollywood heavyweight in dire need of doing something better with his time.In this instance however Wahlberg isn't alone with the likes of Dylan O'Brien, Rupert Friend and in a genuinely can't believe it existed cameo Toby Jones all badly lowering their colours in Fuqua's bland exercise in wannabe sci-fi spectacle, with the only joy found in this cast centred around a running with it Chiwetel Ejiofor as the films egg-hunting bad guy Bathurst 2020, who runs rampant in any of the screen time he is given in what's probably a future Razzie nominated performance that at least provides us with some type of enthusiasm and effort.With everything falling a part in a cast sense and with a plot line that will lose most viewers very early on with a range of daft and bizarre movements; SPOILER ALERT - in particular a whole story revolving around the fact Bathurst 2020 wants to stop being reincarnated by destroying the world when he holds a specialised de-carnation gun in his very hands? Infinite is far from enjoyable in any aspect with all the fun from this amateurish production stemming from witnessing how a film like this could see the light of day.If Paramount Plus is going to release original content like this, its highly likely it won't be sticking around too much longer in the public realm.Final Say -As a car crash in motion Infinite provides some mild entertainment but in any other sense this overblown, undercooked and bland offering is a dumpster fire of epic proportions. A new low in the quickly sinking career of both its leading man and director.1 jar of honey out of 5.",Infinite

18,subxerogravity,"Too cool (seriously, too cool)",6,10 June 2021,"Infinite takes style over substance to a new level.I heard about this movie a week ago when a coworker told me the trailer was hot. I'll say this about the Antoine Fuqua flick, he took a four-to-five-minute trailer and extended into a full movie. That's actually impressive that he was able to keep up the energy for the entire movie.Of course, that does make for one problem. The action is hot, the visuals are stunning and the style is wild, but then there is that slow moment in the film when Markie Mark's character is explained. He's a special human being that gets reincarnated over and over again but is fully aware of his past lives. He's not the only one and a collective of these people have taken two sides: one good, one evil.It's around here that I realize this movie is missing something. That sounds strange to say considering John Wick is one of the best action movies I've ever seen with a plot so cliché, it literally pokes fun of itself. It worked for Wick but it does not click here.The unclicking plot reminds me of the Old Guard (Both stories about a form of immortality). I hate to say that I like this movie more. Like I said, it's got the style, it's also got the action and the combination makes for a flick that looks like I would have blindly paid 25 bucks to see this on an IMAX screen (I never got that feeling from the Old Guard).It's too bad Charlize Theron did not get cast in this one instead. Markie Mark felt utterly useless in this flick. I don't think I've seen Wahlberg be so dull. Old age must be catching up with him. He did not even make me laugh. Realistically, you could have replaced him with a wooden board and it would not affect this movie.Chiwetel Ejiofor was the only notable performance in the film. Somehow his bad guy got through all the fluff and was able to shine.I was hoping to get the same shine out of Jason Mantzoukas who's usually good for one laugh as the comedy relief, but all his jokes were swing and miss.Well, I don't want to say too many bad things about the movie, but I feel this goes into the vault of Ninja Assassin for me. It's an action movie I'll tell people was good, but whenever I see it every few years, I watch it like I never saw it cause I always forget why I like it. A little unfair comparison for Ninja Assassin, but I see Infinite going down this road.I enjoyed it while I enjoyed but its forgettable.",Infinite

The concept is good, but not very cinematic, so it feels like they tried to add action to ""Ad Astra"". With Mark Wahlberg as the main protagonist, a lot of the movie, as I could think was ""Somwon stohl mah teddy bwear"" so that ruined the vibe a little.A large part of it is that the story takes place over centuries if not millenia, so clearly that's not part of the movie, so we miss out on caring about who these immortals are as characters. You're sort of just told to care about them.For at least part of the movie I identified with the villains more because their plan is actually laid out with some level of clarity and a surprising amount of reason: kill everyone and there is nowhere to resurrect.Sort of a fun interpretation of ""When your enemy goes to ground, leave no ground to go to."".Ultimately this is a high end cast, with plenty of money behind the production, so it looks good, and has an interesting concept, but just sort of falls flat on the execution.

With Antoine Fuqua as director, one expects solidly staged action and some semblance of a plot. While the action is occasionally decent, the plot is a total disaster. Writer Ian Shorr is aiming for a high concept actioner that combines the sci-fi-ness of Assassin's Creed, the set-pieces of Fast & Furious, and the aesthetics of Wanted. Unfortunately, Infinite gets nowhere with an aimless plot that runs in circles, boringly etched characters (even Marky Mark's one-liners don't pack enough punch!), and a popular cast that seems to be in it only for the paycheck. Wahlberg's script choices have rarely been critic favourites (except for The Departed and The Fighter) and this one's no different.

Director Antoine Fuqua soon became attached to the film with Chris Evans stated to headline before Evans dropped out due to scheduling issues with Apple TV's Defending Jacob and was replaced with Mark Wahlberg. Positioned by Paramount as a major blockbuster and potential franchise kick-off for the 2020 Summer movie season, the movie was pulled from release due to the ongoing pandemic and pushed around the release calendar until Paramount decided to reposition the film as an ""original"" for their recently rebranded Paramount+ subscription service. The movie received generally negative reviews from critics and audiences, and rightly so because Infinite is probably one of the most unengaging and dull big budget action films of recent memory.When the movie begins we're thrown into an elaborately produced car chase in Mexico City following three characters running from someone after having acquired ""something"". There's no lead up to this chase save for a very brief and quick opening narration telling us about Infinites, Believers, and Nihilists and because no character or stakes have been established this major action sequence that opens the film just feels boring because we have no idea what's happening or why. We then end the sequence cutting to Mark Wahlberg's Evan McCauley who's a troubled man dealing with schizophrenia and the stigma that comes with it (as seen with a painfully on the nose job interview seen that I think is trying to come off as comedic but just feels grating) and somehow McCauley can operate and maintain a forge smithing swords for low level drug dealers despite living in a rundown apartment with no identifiable source of income. Wahlberg is a major reason why this movie doesn't work, despite looking really good for his age he was pushing 50 when he made this film and he is beginning to show it. McCauley's journey of discovering he's an Infinite is very much inspired by Neo's journey of discovering the world is an illusion in The Matrix, but because of Wahlberg's age and more hardened approach, he really doesn't fit this ""finding your true self"" arc all that well. In my opinion Dylan O'Brien probably should have been Evan while Wahlberg should have been treadway because O'Brien is both young enough and strong enough as a leading man, as seen in his turn as Mitch Rapp in American Assassin, that he'd feel more at home in this type of role than Wahlberg who's really too confident and strong of a presence to fit a role like this (not as bad a miscasting as The Happening, but still pretty ill judged).Of course beyond the miscast lead, the movie has other issues in its characters and world building. The Believers and Nihilists simply do not have engaging characters or personalities with most the information being heavy expository exchanges rather than actual character or world building moments. Chiwetel Ejiofor as Bathurst has a particularly embarrassing exchange with Toby Jones that becomes unintentionally funny when he explains his motivation for wanting out of re-incarnation as ""humanity as a living obituary in a dying newspaper on the floor of a bird cage in the corner of an old hoarder lady's apartment"" while Toby Jones has honey force poured into his mouth and screams about ""love and friendship"" which just left me agasp at how ill judged this sequence with TWO brilliant actors whom I'd seen do great work now spouting some of the most inane exchanges I'd seen outside of a Star Wars prequel. The rest of the cast is pretty much non-entities with Sophie Cookson's Nora barely even registering with her core of reuniting with a lost love carrying so little weight I routinely forgot she even had a ""lost love"". The one performance I thought kind of worked was with Jason Mantzoukas as a neutral Infinite known as The Artisan who uses his countless lives to indulge in hedonism and never ending partying and only allies himself with the believers because if the Nihilists succeed by his words """"the party's over"", on occasion the character can become a little much, but he's really the only character I'd say leaves any sort of impression because he isn't directed to be overly stoic and reserved.The action sequences are fine for the most part as typical for Antoine Fuqua but he does feel a little restrained by the PG-13 rating as Fuqua typically is more at home with an R. Not that Fuqua can't work with PG-13 material such as his better than expected Magnificent Seven remake, but Fuqua is best known for emphasizing grit and intensity, and it feels like he's not really allowed to go full force with that style here with many of the sequences feeling like they'll feel at home in something like Bulletproof Monk or G. I. Joe Retaliation. The action is serviceable, but it's in service of such a lifeless and passionless script it's really hard to care what's going on even if it's ""technically"" done well.Infinite is just boring and lifeless. With a miscast lead and a mixture of being overly simple whilst overly convoluted, Infinite takes a promising concept of tapping into past lives and runs makes it dry and without energy. While on occasion some of the exchanges verge into unintentional hilarity, most of the deliveries of dialogue are so mechanical and exposition heavy there's nothing to latch onto for engagement so you just start noticing things you've seen before and point out where they came from because you're so bored. Infinite may have had its eyes on an expanded franchise, but this is likely a ""one and done"" deal.",Infinite

The thing is the heroes of this groups have been reincarnating again and again on planet earth. And the anti-group is fed up of reincarnations and want all life to end. So who will win?Cinematography & Direction: Quirky! The anti-group is more powerful but still somehow it has less possessions. With direction, I expected deep sculpting, for instance the main character could have intensive built-up before enlightenment. Other than that justified.Acting (& music): Acting is average, in some cases good (villain & artisan).

Seems like they spent more time on the visuals than the screenplay. Some of the action stunts are over the top unbelievable and more appropriate for a Marvel movie.It just seems the director Antoine Fuqua was going for something like a Christopher Nolan film without a good story as a foundation to build upon..

The main villain's plan is pointless since he just could've committed suicide with a cyber bullet and call it a day. Why go through all this only because you're sick of living, there are easier exits than developing a super-bomb.I also would've enjoyed actually seeing the Believers doing something good for humanity besides kung-fu and shooting.

There's a lot of potential with this. However, the script seemed to use this premise as an excuse to avoid having any character backstory. Well, since people can remember their past lives, we just gonna show some old pictures and random flashbacks, and we will call that proper backstories, or so the writers thought.That's pretty much the only way the writers used the premise. Instead of being creative, they used the most generic and formulaic sci-fi plot. Almost everything, including the characters, were straightforward and predictable. The dialogues were also cheesy and cringe.The first decent aspect was the explosion and actions. The huge budget was into this, and at least it was entertaining so see car chases and buildings getting wrecked.

From the beloved classic Training Day to the highly entertaining The Equalizer films, Fuqua has demonstrated skillful handling of action sequences. As expected, Infinite delivers several fighting scenes and car chases, mostly riveting and quite enjoyable. The third act gets extremely over-the-top concerning the action set pieces, which are only tolerable due to a special yet underdeveloped character trait that ultimately justifies the more absurd moments. Mauro Fiore's camera work and Conrad Buff IV's editing are decent enough, but the last act features too much shaky cam and excessive cuts for my taste.Story-wise, that's where things get tricky. Ian Shorr's screenplay boasts a genuinely interesting premise with exciting world-building to support it. However, the tiresome voice-over from Mark Wahlberg - who offers a good performance just as the rest of the cast - holds heavy exposition that's then repeated in dialogues across the movie, stretching the runtime unnecessarily. This narration rarely adds anything relevant to the story or impacts the viewer's opinion about the protagonist.In addition to this, it's one of those films that carries tremendous storytelling potential but never reaches it. Personally, I truly find the concept intriguing, but its development doesn't leave the base of its premise. In fact, just by watching the main trailer, most of the world-building is given to the audience in those few minutes. Honestly, in better hands, this movie could have been the beginning of a new franchise with infinite - no pun intended- possibilities to make sequels, prequels, spin-offs, or even trigger the start of a TV show.As it is, Infinite is nothing more than an inoffensively entertaining flick that could have been much, much better.Rating: C.",Infinite
34,SoumikBanerjee25,A Fascinating Concept Let Down By Inferior Writing.,5,9 July 2021,"Is it just me or Mark Wahlberg does have an uncanny resemblance with John Cena!? No? Okay Never Mind. Jokes apart, ""Infinite"" is Paramount Studios' latest offering for their OTT domain. An Action Blockbuster whose primary narrative is based on the fascinating conjecture of 'Reincarnation'.A hypothesis, where people die a physical death but their spirits are immortal. Their conscience (or soul) finds another body straight after the previous one's demise. This divine cycle continues for generations through several lifetimes. The followers of Hinduism and Buddhism have always believed in this philosophy since time immemorial and now is the time for Hollywood to make their way into it! An enticing choice, I'll give you that but...there's a big but to it!If only the Script did a wee but justice to this otherwise great-sounding idea; maybe things would have turned out differently. At the other end the Action, the Visuals, even the Contemporary Score, all been stupendous! As one would normally expect from such a huge budget spectacle; no real surprise there! It is self-evident that I thoroughly enjoyed this across-the-board grandiose appearance.However, my biggest criticism is about how rushed & unascertained this entire thing was! Mr. Antoine Fuqua (The Director; famous for his The Equalizer series with Denzel Washington) I find it rather odd that you out of all people could make such nondescript work of art.You managed to secure some prominent names for your ensemble, You also persuaded the studio to shell out millions of dollars on this project, besides; the underlying concept too had enormous potential, to begin with. In spite of all this; look at what you've done! You made a sub-optimal & half-hearted iteration of what could have possibly been an epic Action Adventure.Such a pity!On a side note, I really think Dylan O'Brien should have been at the forefront. Don't get me wrong, Mark Wahlberg is a convincing protagonist and I do admire him as in these bad-ass characters. Excuse my ignorance, it's just that I firmly believe Dylan would have played this role with greater efficiency! Again, that's my personal opinion; yours might vary.",Infinite

36,trinaboice,Turn off your brain and enjoy the stunning action and visuals,6,18 June 2021,"IN A NUTSHELL:
""Did you ever have a dream so real that it felt like a memory?"" That's the question the audience is asked at the beginning of the film. A man discovers that his hallucinations are actually visions from past lives. This mind-bending film was directed by Antoine Fuqua.Mark Wahlberg's schizophrenic character says ""Reincarnation is comforting but it's a spiritual way of saying 'Better luck next time.'"" What do YOU think about reincarnation? That's what this film is about but with a new twist.The movie was brought to Hollywood through crowdsourcing. It's based on the book The Reincarnationist Papers by D. Eric Maikranz. Paramount Pictures bought the rights to the movie after finding the book in a hostel in Nepal. The author had written an invitation and challenge to readers to get the story made into a movie with a promise of a financial reward. It worked in only 18 months!THINGS I LIKED:
I'm such a fan of Mark Wahlberg and will watch pretty much anything he's in. As expected, he has the required physicality and snarky humor to deliver an extremely entertaining performance.Academy Award & Golden Globe nominee Chiwetel Ejiofor is another actor I consider to be a chameleon. He's excellent in everything he does and won a BAFTA Award for Best Actor for his role in 12 Years a Slave.I hadn't seen Sophie Cookson before in anything I remembered. She's beautiful and also has the athleticism to be believable in action sequences.Speaking of action sequences, there are a ton of them! Kudos to the stunt team that did an incredible job.I was sad that Dylan O'Brien's role in the film was so short. I absolutely loved him in the movie LOVE AND MONSTERS. What a fun flick!Liz Carr creates such an intriguing character that simply belongs in this universe.Some truly stunning visuals.Tons of crazy car chases. The movie looks like it must have cost a lot of money to make. I looked online but couldn't find the price tag.Retractable steering wheel. Very cool. Lots of other cool weapons and gadgets.The movie was filmed in Cardiff, Wales. I went there about 5 years ago for the first time. If you want to learn more about Wales, check out the heartwarming movie I just reviewed called Dream Horse.There are some fun Easter eggs such as a sound effect heard from the movie Transformers and an M82 Wahlberg used in the movie Shooter, both Mark Wahlberg flicks.The world-building is intriguing, although a bit bloated.Just turn your brain off and enjoy the beautiful locations and action sequences for a fun summer flick. I think I enjoyed this movie more than most film critics and viewers who rated it very low.If you enjoy this movie, you'll be happy to see the opening that is created for a sequel. Is that something you want? Comment down below to let me know!THINGS I DIDN'T LIKE:
So many mind-numbing action sequences.The convoluted plot might confuse viewers, rather than enlighten them.Despite all of the action and CGI, the movie somehow feels bloated and empty at the same time.Tons of cliches.Some of the CGI didn't work.The movie acts and feels like it's more smart and deep than it really is.TIPS FOR PARENTS:

Great Watch!,8,13 June 2021,"I dont know how people can even compare this to the matrix its totally different, it stands alone as its own and I thought it was a pretty decent movie. Mark Wahlberg is always a personal favourite whether that being comedy or action he excells in both. This is a movie about reincarnation I think some people got confused thinking its about time, it literally had nothing to do with time. The CGI wasn't overly used like a lot of people said but when it did it looked incredible. I feel like Dylan O'Brien could of had more screen time but when you see it, its pretty obvious why he didn't, he was great but his character is the reason, you'll get it. The story was quite intriguing i found myself very entertained for a large portion of the movie, usually if a movie isn't great or below average I check how long is left and I didn't at all this time round.Ignore the critics as they are the only reviews you'll be seeing, them and people who take movies way too seriously, you gotta get to grips with the fact that this is a movie... not a documentary, its not real so don't expect everything to be realistic, if that was the case there wouldn't be any creativity and you'd call it ""Average"" although I did feel the first half was much more entertaining but the movie as a whole was quite intriguing to watch, I do feel the movie was better than the trailer though, glad I watched it.I highly recommend watching this, despite the reviews I still watched it and I was really impressed with everything, phenomenal story with action and humour to balance it all out, I wanna be reincarnated so I can watch it again!",Infinite

Nothing it delivers is good enough for its premise.One day, someone will make a story worth telling, were people that have lived for hundreds of years will actually come to life on the screen and sell you a story that is worth telling. As it stands, Infinite is too grounded and boring. The villain provides himself with the answer to his problem from the beginning (sure, a little technological rework would achieve what he desires), and his outlook on life is simply childish for someone that is supposed to be really smart.

50,shanayneigh,This was horrible,2,27 August 2021,"Oh wow... Since he's an absolutely horrible actor, I tend to stay away from movies with Wahlberg. But I actually liked Shooter, his former collaboration with Fuqua (a director who is more miss than hit), so I gave this a try. Color me surprised that Wahlberg sleepwalks through yet another movie.The movie starts out fine with a pretty good car chase starring some people you will never see in the movie again. A title card tells us that this chase takes place ""the last life"", and the following scene where we meet Wahlberg's ""character"" (a generous use of that word"" takes place ""in this life"". But there are no clues like hairstyles, architecture or costumes if ""the last life"" took place in the past or if ""this life"" takes place in the future.And how the whole reincarnation works is muddy to say the least. Are you instantly reborn in a new infant's body, or is your consciousness transferred to the body of an adult?If you are reborn, why is Wahlberg's character 20 years older (and that shows in his face, no matter how many pushups he can do) than Sophie Cookson's character whose alter ego in ""the last life"" died slightly before Wahlberg's?If your consciousness is transferred into an adult, why are they starting to have flashbacks in their teens, i.e. Circa 35 years before this story in Wahlberg's case?Or is the consciousness transferred when they die in ""the last life"" to a teenager and they turn essentially into sleeper agents until they remember their past? In that case, this means that Wahlberg has been puttering around for 35 years before he had his epiphany. What the hell has Ejiofor's character been doing for the last three decades in that case? Just put the search on hold and wait for Marky Mark to start remembering?My god, this is such a poorly written movie!I have to say that I zoned out after a while, I had zero interest in the nonsensical story, especially when Neo, sorry, Wahlberg essentially got super powers.The action is amateurish. Apart from the laughable CGI which made John McClane duking it out on top of a fighter plane in Die Hard 4 seem realistic, the editing is appalling. Just look at the fight between Ejiofor and the guy who looks like a viking. There is zero sense of geography or even continuity between the shots.",Infinite

To say this movie or at least its story has no ""soul"" is an understatement, its merely a bunch of ideas borrowed from other works & popped into a blender, the idea of reincarnation is interesting but in "" infinite"" its used as nothing more than a gimmick to facilitate all the silly clichéd one liners & mindless fast & furious rip-off stunts.Yes it's well made, brilliantly filmed & choreographed but the story /plot is childish, characters are silly & unrealistic, it is Comic book story telling at its worst.Infinite has nothing new or original to offer, from its story/plot or its situations or stunts, all have been seen before & recently, nothing new there, but it dosent even attempt to disguise that fact or to even weave them into something that could be classed as its own identity, it's simply copy & paste.If you are easily entertained with silly dialogue & all too often seen physics defying stunts with flashy cgi then this is for you, you will enjoy it, but if you have a modicum of intelligence above ""beavis & butthead"" & actually enjoy even a semblance of a coherent story/plot then sadly Infinite is nothing more than Meh!, which is sad really because handled properly this could have actually been a good movie, much better it seems than any involved had the capacity to actually realise.Infinte makes every Marvel movie look like a shakespearian masterpiece.Why writers, directors, producers think covering up a poorly written story & plot with fast moving stunts & sparkly cgi is ok is beyond me, a well constructed plot & story beats stunts & cgi every time & its about time they realised that.Even after all the sillyness has finished the movie has the audacity to end with a meaningful speech about reincarnation by wahlberg, utter codswallop.Best character in the movie was played by the best actor in the movie, Jason Mantzoukas, always a pleasure to watch.This should have been better.",Infinite

62,carlos-pires,Edge of the seat thriller comes up short,4,13 June 2021,"I'm pretty sure I will have forgotten this whole plot completely in a couple of weeks. Why? Because, in spite of the very original premise, this is yet another ""spite movie"" with Mark Wahlberg trying to show he could have been a decent Jason Bourne. Other people might blame director Antoine Fuqua, but I actually think he managed to do a great job, and I suspect that Marky Mark is to blame for everything that's wrong with this movie... Which is not much. This is an edge-of-the-seat fantasy/thriller with superb production values, a superior cast, and above-average scriptwriting. The problem is, with such a valuably-original premise, the burden on the director and production is to deliver something at least twice as good as ""The Old Guard"", but, alas!, it falls short. That's actually an understatement, 'cause it's actually missing a whole mile.Bottom line: watching this movie is a rewarding experience, as it plants some new ideas in your brain, but at the same time it is a disappointment because anyone can clearly see some 200 different paths that this narrative might lead you to, and 199 are more interesting than the 1 they decided to publish.PS: one final piece of advice for Marky Mark: you are as good an actor as you ever were a rapper. Just give up, and save us all the embarrassment of trying to find excuses for your disappointing performances. Maybe you can be a successful personal trainer, gigolo, or garbage disposal technician, but you surely never were and never will be a real actor, no matter how much protein and steroids you can pump into those biceps.",Infinite

But the fight choreography was very poor. Not convincing at all.I think the director thought this was going to be his 'Matrix'. But it lacked any of that style. Cheesy one lines. 'Need a lift?' Cringe.Main villain was like a bad reject from a Bond film.And why didnt he just us the 'Dethrone' weapon on himself instead of wanting to destroy the Universe in some poor mans Thanos plotline.They attempted some kind of emotional depth with a tenuous love story type thing which wasn't convincing at all. You genuinely do not care about any of the characters.It felt rushed.

I say that because it's tough to give it anyrhing above a 6, though I'd be pressed to give a 6.5 at best. The whole reincarnation premise had so much potential and in my opinion is the single best thing this movie has to offer, the possibilities were INFINITE and yet...in this day and age, the filmmakers chose the flashiest, most convenient and outlandish version possible. We have unexplained advanced technology throughout the movie, the main characters only reincarnating as beautiful and fit people, for some reason one of them can defy physics (pretty cool, won't lie, but it comes outta nowhere), and a massive plot hole that cannot be ignored, but is, or else it'd be a 30min movie. Pacing is sluggish and exposition is sense where it doesn't need to be, while letting aforementioned plot holes just exist without explanation. That said, some of the action scenes are very well done and highly enjoyable; only there's so very few. Next to the premise at its most basic level, what drove this movie to be so watchable was the performance and character of Chiwetel Ejiofor, executed with praise. I enjoy Mark Wahlberg in most movies, as niche as they may be, and it was sad - almost funny - to see how he really has no range in this. Bottom line, I think it's worth a low-price rental, so long as you shut off your brain - despite that being what they sometimes try to evoke.",Infinite

Could have been much better but still worth a watch for the fans.,6,18 July 2021,"Fantasy/action movie. Wahlberg returns to yet another fantasy/action film, which demonstrates the idea of reincarnation and multiple lives. Only a small percentage of people really have the ability to remember memories of past lives. Some of them are trying to change the world into something better with the knowledge of the past, others have lost faith in everything good, and they want to end everything, every trace of life, every repetition of a life/death cycle, every memory. Chiwetel Ejiofor in an unusual role of evil also very good in his role, like the rest of the actors. The film starts promisingly enough with plenty of action and effects, only then it slows down its pace. The idea of the bad guys in the story is completely shallow, they've just lost faith and that's why they want to destroy the whole world. Also, despite some good action scenes, and some effects, it could be much better overall. I liked it as a concept but the implementation could have been much better with more work. It leaves room for sequel and I would like to see one, but with a lot of improvements. Still overall a nice and interesting movie, worth a watch for the fans of the genre.",Infinite

So they are visibly bored and apathetic (transfusing to the audience), weirdly to mention Mark Wahlberg, who worked together with Antoine Fuqua in 2007 on the quite decent movie 'Shooter'.I expected at least a grain of 'Wanted' here, but Director Fuqua is far from being capable to deliver any notable resemblance, despite recycling so many design elements from that paragon.

While some of these are certainly worth a watch, Infinite is fine as a movie to have on in the background while you tidy your house or talk with other people, because very little of consequence happens.This is a Highlander/Matrix rip off in which two groups of immortals-through-reincarnation fight over a mini egg which has special powers. Now the fact that it doesn't actually matter if anyone dies simply removes any tension during punch ups because they simply don't matter. The fact that such a plot hole exists should have stopped this being made in the first place, but as usual there are books which are popular so here we are (who said people who read books are smarter anyway?).This is basically action punch-ups by numbers so the plot is just excuses for a fights with lots of expensive looking weapons, lots of SWAT looking men simply there to be killed by the main characters and some silly martial arts.There is some very dumb conceptions of mental health in particular schizophrenia, which is described as being a split personality/more than one personality in the same body, which is central to the plot. There is also some dubious notion that if you beat someone up enough they will remember things they have forgotten. Its basically psychology 101 for the insane.The scene locations look very odd, supposedly New York looks like a London council estate.As do the cast and their lifestyle, everyone is an edgy looking supermodel that seem to be rich as everything they wear, do and surround themselves looks ridiculously expensive. It may be to make the characters seem more important to us but it has the opposite effect on me. I have no connection to the rich or that lifestyle so I ended up caring even less.Marky Mark does his usual looking confused face for the full movie and the bad is black.

A permanent look of befuddlement on his face, for every reaction. And being out acted in every scene.

This is a massive pet peeve of mine, don't assume that your audience is so dumb that you need to repeat what little plot there is in narrative dialogue multiple times as the film progresses.This could've been a much more enjoyable film if they spent less time padding it with typical action film clichés and instead spent a little more time developing the plot.",Infinite

Very ambitious plot tries a little too hard to be the next mind bending sci fi epic and comes off a tad pretentious given how muddled the story becomes, a lot of things don't exactly add up. Jason Mantzoukas or better known as Raffi seems to make everything he touches a bit better and his comedic nuisances are felt throughout. Antoine Fuqua is still great at making the action sequences super exciting but i just didn't find myself that interested in any of the characters. As we go on the film gains momentum in its stupidity, the smart cool vibe it was going for comes off a bit dull and uninspired. A lot of turn your brain off gun play and explosions, which are great but the story offered minimal memorable substance.The ending loses its luster being so cgi heavy.",Infinite

That and it does have a nice premise. This movie could've worked about learning about your past lives and how we learn the mistakes from them. And the action and stunt does have some effort out into. But the movie is poorly executed with the story being boring and predictable. I can't say I'll spoil anything, but there has been some moments I knew that was gonna happen throughout the film. And the characters are bland and easily forgettable. I can recommend for the major Sci Fi fans. Otherwise though, it's not really worth your time. It could've been an action packed spy film, but this has came out a complete waste of opportunity. And ultimately, this is the kind of film I'm not gonna remember anytime soon.

The movie from start to finish feels like it has tons of predecessors before and the director and writer didn't even try to change it a little bit to make it stand out. The acting of all the actors stands out as average. The screenplay is okay. After a few minutes into the movie it feels like you can predict everything that's gonna happen next. The way the presentation is done it's heavily predictable with every scene.

It reminded me at moments of Wanted, The Matrix, The Old Guard and a host of movies from the past decade. The effects are also unpolished, leading me to believe if there was a budget, it went to Mark and Chewy. It was great seeing Bobby Mercer and Victor Sweet together again, but the same chemistry wasn't there.A Fuqua has really slid, I used to look forward to his movies, but I get the impression, Hollywood doesn't have the faith in him that they used to, and for good reason. This movie had a good premise and Mark tends to give a convincing performance, but he wasn't surrounded with an equally impressive cast.Rule of thumb, if you see Jason Manzukas or his name anywhere associated with a movie, you can pretty much be sure it's a low quality production and before anyone mentions John Wick, that whole story line with L Fish was garbage.",Infinite

The script is so bad that even the writer couldn't see the biggest plot hole of all.All this is told to you at the start of the film but there are essentially two groups of immortals. One wants to keep the world safe, the other is hellbent on destroying it (they get the catchy moniker ""nihilist"").Now here's the thing, as far as I understood from
The film, the nihilists are fed up being immortal, so by destroying everything they won't be reborn.But there is a weapon that already exists and they already have that. This weapon will capture your soul and so you are not reborn. So rather than using that to stop themselves to stop being reborn, they try and find an egg......oh **** it, I give up.....it's a **** film and honestly the only saving grace is that it isn't very long.Just watch something else because this is boring, derivative and utter utter nonsense.

Wahlberg is just Wahlberg, sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't and in this it doesn't, he just looks confused.The 'plot' is utter garbage, a group of humans have the ability to continuously be reborn and so act as guardians to humanity but one of them (Ejiofor) hates the constant rebirth so invents a doomsday weapon that will destroy all life on the planet hence making it impossible to resurrect. He also has a magic gun that when he shoots one of the 'Infinites' with, their memories are lost. Obvious solution? Shoot yourself in the head!Anyway, enter our amnesiac hero who has to be rebooted because he knows where the lost weapon is and the weapon is found and lost and found again, all against a background of inane shoot outs, pseudo religious babble, swordfights and awful CGI. Of course, in the time honoured tradition, the bad guy has an army of special ops types who can't shoot straight and a slinky blonde sidekick who dies stupidly, none of whom seem to mind that they are fighting for a cause that will see them and everyone they know dead!Mindless and boring, don't bother.",Infinite

A select few, called the ""Believers"" and ""Nihilist"" are immortals in the sense that their soul lives forever in many bodies. And they are in battle with each other.Here is where it fails - the leader of the Nihilist (ie bad guys), wants to end the world because he is tired of being reborn. With everyone dead, no one can procreate and he would not be reborn ever again. To him being immortal is a curse. Get this, through all the years of them fighting the believers, the nihilist has invented a bullet that can trap the soul in a chip. Thus disabling any immortals shot with this bullet to be reincarnated.Do you see it now why the plot got messed up? The leader of nihilist already have the power to end his life and never be reborn - just shoot himself with this bullet!The effects are good.

Now, THEY JUST RIPPED UP AN ENTIRE POLICE STATION BY DRIVING THROUGH IT, BUT NO COPS CHASED THEM because in NYC apparently, once you've driven away from a crime scene, NO dispatchers would call helicopter or MORE COPS to chase you.

Except I was bored after the first 7 minutes. What I can't figure out is how they talked Mark Wahlberg into doing this. He's usually a better judge of films. Predictable hackneyed script, subpar acting, poorly constructed plot, but decent special effects. Worth watching if you can't find anything else, I guess.

I just felt like the story was told in such a bad way. It was as if Thanos and the avengers were going against each other, but the infinity stones were an egg and they all could reincarnate, and then fight each other in another lifetime.The poorly done action scenes, and the bad cgi did not help at all. Also, has Mark Wahlberg always been this bad of an actor? I feel like this role was not for him. When it comes to his and the other actress I felt no chemistry between them. It was all meh. Whatever.

155,chrisbrooks-19259,Walberg and Company,7,11 June 2021,I feel a little strange about this movie so i am going to break the rankings down in pieces. Action was great right from the beginning so that part I give a 10! The actor selection was great too that I give a 9. The SyFy part of the movie was really cool especially mixed with the action so that I give a 9. What hurt this movie was the story I guess. It left me hollow and unfulfilled but I don't know why. I seemed to enjoy it but it didn't leave me wanting more so that part I give a 4. My overall review is a 7. I really wanted to make it higher but I can't which saddens me.It is still worth a watch for sure if Action and SyFy is you thing! Starts out GREAT! Enjoy!,Infinite
156,World-viewer,"Good premise, bad execution",2,7 July 2021,"Very poor script for an otherwise promising premise. Others have elucidated upon basics of the plot so I will not get into it. I just have one question. Spoilers ahead:The whole movie is basically about preventing the end of the world by preventing a madman, Bathurst, and his acolytes from getting their hands on a mysterious device known as ""the egg"". The ""genius"" who created it, and all known ways of recreating it, are killed and destroyed by the protagonist, Treadway.The movie opens with Treadway in possession of the egg. In PHYSICAL possession of the egg. Holding it, while he is driving, being chased by aforementioned bad guys.So here is the question. Why doesn't he just destroy it, then and there?? Instead of trying to ""cleverly"" hide it and leaving clues as to where? Yes, yes, we know why. It's plot-holes like that that give this whole movie a very comic-like feel. Why doesn't Bathurst simply ""freeze"" his own soul like he freezes others? If he can get someone to create a doomsday device, he ought to be able to get someone to create a ""fridge"" of sorts.. like the Ghostbusters' ghost-traps but one that should last indefinitely? He certainly seems to have enough money and resources.Another thing. The leading lady confidently mentions there are about 500 ""Infinites"". And how do the ""Infinites"" know how many people there are, like them? How would anyone seek out such a person? How do they know when the 2nd life begins? Why is it assumed the number of such people is finite?And finally, suppose Bathurst did succeed, how do we know he will not simply reincarnate into some slug on some other planet? Or as some alien bacterium? Can you imagine eternity spent endlessly coming back as some alien fauna? How is that worse than living out multiple lives on Earth? Is that a risk worth taking?And one final critique. Much like in Mile 22, Marky Mark talks too much. Way too much.Otherwise an interesting time-pass movie.",Infinite

164,mluinstra,It is worth the watch but could have been much better,6,11 June 2021,"Good car chase at the start and some good fight scenes during the movie, but there was a lot of stuff that just didn't make sense.1. The bad guy wants to kill everyone and every thing because he did not want to be reincarnated, but he currently has the technology to put his soul into a micro chip (which he used on the good guys). Why doesn't he just chip himself and store the chip in unbreakable material and put it in space or something?2. The bad guy knows where the good guys headquarters are but does not go there to kill them until a certain point during the movie. Why did he not go there to destroy them much earlier?3. Near the end of the movie, Mark W gets on a motor bike after seeing the bad guys leave on a jet. Why? Turns out he somehow knew there was a cliff and that the jet was going to fly by this cliff and he planned to jump his motor bike onto the wing of this jet? Seriously? I'm all for cool stunts, but he didn't know the terrain or the jet's flight path, and even if he did, his plan was to jump his bike onto the wing of a moving jet?4. Mark W's character has the location of this egg in his memory and they FINALLY find a way to get his memory back and the bad guy has been on them from the start of the movie. Given the importance of this egg's location and the fate of the world at stack, he just blurts out where it is?5. The main bad guy wants to kill everything and everyone because he hates remembering all of his past lives. Why is he the only one that is going crazy because of this? There are thousands of immortals and they all seem to be dealing with this condition just fine. Was he far older than the others? Was he just a nut case? Why did it pain him to remember the past lives?6. Who made this doomsday device? It must have been super technical and advanced considering it would destroy all life on the planet. Why would anyone ever make such a device and how? They said if it was lost that such a weapon could never be made again, why not? It was made once, why not again? Did they not keep the blueprints? Why not just make another one instead of trying to find this one?The list goes on. However, the movie was still a fun flick that is worth watching once. I won't need to watch it ever again, and it won't win any awards, but it was still much better than all the crap that is out there now.",Infinite

There are some things that are not true: the windows are bulletproof and yet one gets rolled down? That means it can't be bulletproof. Yes there is some delayed editing like start should say year, then when we see Mark should be ""present day"" but it comes later. But overall the concept is there and feels like it was taken from comic book in parts, then book in other, then various lines of facts. Overall it is a good technique to bring in an ""outsider"" and then we the audience discovers as he does. I see no problem with the CGI. I enjoyed it. Was worth my time.

The other characters were well casted. Perhaps if Dylan O'Brien had Mark Wahlberg's role?The first action sequence was pretty great, then it just fell apart after that.

This is such a comedy because in this movie people can drive a sports car through a wall and break it without any scratches. In the first minutes of this movie you can hear who are infinite people.

But when the truck hit the other car, the car will be severely damaged. This is ridiculous when you compare this to the sport car after breaking the wall without scratches.I saw The Ice Road movie and I thought that the movie is the worst movie of 2021 year but this is worse than The Ice Road.In summary - in this movie there are many logic holes, poor writing, bad directing, quiet good performance of actors, good camera, average quality of VFX...",Infinite

Mark Wahlberg is the protagonist of this film and has knowledge from his past life of a DNA destroying egg bomb that Chiwetel Ejiofor wants to use to Thanos the Earth so they never have to reincarnate again.This movie is filled with exposition, especially from Sophie Cookson. She is absolutely terrible in this movie with her flat delivery. To be fair the screen writer made probably about 90% of her dialogue exposition. Still many things are unexplained. Like why Ejiofor's character once he gets the bomb decides to fly away with it instead of blowing it up on the spot. Does it need to be blown in the atmosphere?There is a weapon in the movie called the dethroner which when a person is shot with it their soul/consciousness is trapped and uploaded to a micro sd card so they can't reincarnate.

It's like The Matrix, Avengers End Game, Inception, and a bunch of other movies rolled up into a big ball of awesomeness. You can stop reading right here if you're 12 years of age or older.*****Spoilers Ahead***** (can there be spoilers for a spoilt movie?)For anyone who continued to read, some plot dilemmas:1. The Thanos like supervillain hates being re-incarnated over and over again, so he wants to destroy all life. Yet, in his everyday possession, he has a ""dethroner"" weapon that easily ends that experience for anyone he shoots with it. Question: Why not just nicely ask someone else to use it on him and not be such a jerk to the rest of us (and every species on the planet)? At least Thanos only wanted to kill half of the universe's living beings.2. How does the Rhonda Rousey character keep managing to match/meet up with her fellow reincarnated romantic interests (and others of her kind) at roughly the same stage of life as when they last died?3. Why does a guy who can't get a job as a restaurant manager but who possesses the ability to create Japanese Samurai swords at a level surpassing any master blacksmith in the past 200 years not just sell his swords to willing buyers with lots of money and a taste for that kind of thing instead of fruitlessly using a recruiter to try finding him restaurant gigs? Why sell these transcendent weapons to stupid face-tatted drug dealers for his meds rather than opening a badass blacksmith shop, training apprentices, going on reality TV shows and otherwise making a mint such that he can afford his (relatively inexpensive) psych meds?4. How does the bad guy happen to be everywhere at once, immediately, whenever the good guys have just arrived? It's just silly stupid how easily he penetrates the communications, activities and security of the supposed enemy whose sole mission is to defeat him and prevent his master plan of destroying all life.5. Why didn't said bad guy just raid and destroy the good guys' headquarters from the moment it was created given its lack of defenses?6. How is the Rhonda Rousey chick supposed to restore all the souls that were taken by the ""dethroner"" which are kept at the bad guy's Scotland estate without bringing them all back to the good guys' HQ thousands of miles away and individually reanimating them with the stolen souls?OK. I think I've gone on long enough. Thank the heavens for bittorrent and even streaming services. If I'd paid to see this in a theater and wasted $30 on sodas, popcorn and parking/bus fare/gasoline I'd have been pretty pissed. Instead, due to the benefits of piracy, I was able to view this laughable abomination of a film (which is a low point in Antoine Fuqua's career - and that's saying something) and offer my warning to everyone else. I wish I could post video ""spoilers"" of some of the ""stunts"" as well. Quite an amazing feat to drive a motorcycle off cliff after accelerating up an unpaved mountainside and land it on the wing of a rather large cargo plane....oh wait that means I need a #7.7. If the supervillains are also reincarnated over and over, starting as babies, how do they manage to have a totally state of the art massive complex and estate complete with a runway, helicopters, out of this world weaponry and a massive cargo plane in Scotland without any scrutiny from local/regional/national authorities and who are all the idiots in black unis and face coverings willing to die in the one life THEY have to enable the wannabe Thanos character to end all lives (including theirs and their own families) in the universe?See where I'm going?

200,nincubura,Intellectually deeper than other recent Sci-Fi releases,7,18 June 2021,"While intellectually deeper than other recent Sci-Fi releases (e.g., Stowaway) the action sequences were over-the-top unnecessary, and more actual story development instead of mere narrative would have been appreciated. Action plus narration equals weak filmmaking skills, but great comic book writing skills. Oh wait, that's what Hollywood has become: a comic book derivitive industry without a single creative synapse -- because Americans don't have the education to comprehend more.I'm tired of Mark Wahlberg's monotone affectation, with only one facial expression -- wrinkled forehead. For a character with eons of subconscious personality trying to come out, he sure seemed inappropriately insipid. Imagine Mark Wahlberg and Lauren German cast together, as a deadpan Vulcan couple! Ooops, Lauren German can't even wrinkle her forehead. I guess Wahlberg would have to play it as the emotional half human.",Infinite

It's so bad, it's laughable yet, like a masochist, I stayed to see how much pain it could inflict on my sensibilities and how far and fast it would sink into the abyss. It's a train wreck, riddled with Mark Wahlberg's bad acting (and for the life of me, I don't see how he's gotten this far with limited acting ability), but here he is. And there's so many movies mixed in it like Flatliners, The Old Guard (just nowhere close to being as good), The Matrix (rip-off), a little bit of The Fifth Element and Assassin's Creed.

The beginning is really good, the middle is alright and then the ending is just whatever. And what everyone says about the bad guy in this film and how he has the power to kill himself to end his rebirth without killing others is true. That shouldn't be his choice to kill everyone because he's tired of it, he's literally the only one. He's literally mad at everyone because his brain remembers everything right away in birth he doesn't get a chance to live a different life until he remembers everything, so basically he's just a jealous a**hole who makes no sense. Mark Wahlber has given better performances. Lately his action movies have been disappointing. He did better in his other movie Joe Bell. He's still one of my favorite actors. And I think he was in his prime from 2005-2010 when he made Four Brothers, Invincible, Shooter, The Departed, and the Fighter.

How did the antagonist get a video feed of the testing room where Treadwell was being stored?

The script was as if a manic had written it... all over the place.Anyways, the visuals are almost top notch and the actors are almost all A rated... which is why I'm wondering how the script was so blandly written? It was as if a child wrote it, because everything was so entirely boring and unconvincing. The plot was ridiculous actually more than that if there is such a word. Why didn't the guy just shoot himself in the head with his own gun? Not a spoiler if you have no idea what I'm talking about.The females were attractive and Wallis Day is a bombshell if I've ever seen one. She should have had more face time and maybe it could have been better. Although, Sophie Cookson isn't so shabby herself and she looked beautiful in her role... her lines were just garbage. She was actually the only one who was slightly convincing throughout the entire movie.

The story is about humans that reincarnate every lifetime without losing their memories... then there are the ones that want to use their knowledge to help humanity and those who want to destroy humanity... ok, fine so far for sci-fi and could be really good.. but.. the villain has developed a weapon to kill these special people by entrapping their soul so they can't reincarnate... yet... he wants to destroy humanity so he won't reincarnate again (he's tired of living) ........... well just turn the weapon on yourself dude!!!

Why would the guy who hates being reborn, who also has a gun that can trap souls (whatever absurd concept is this...) wants to destroy everything instead of just ending itself?2. Why is everyone except the vilain stupid? I mean they get killed like flies, except the main characters.3. If the superbomb can kill everything why does the villain need to fly to Glasgow?

Frankly, you won't sympathise and relate - you simply can't - with any of the primary cast such as Ejiofor, Dylan O'Brien, Sophie Cookson and least of all, the lead star, Mr Mark Wahlberg. Chris Evans must be relieved he opted out of this film due ""scheduling conflict"". The ephemeral The Highlander (1986, Lambert, Connery) with less sophisticated CGI was a better film and value for your money. The last I heard is that people behind this mindless car crash is going to finance a sequel - and more thereafter.

This movie was so entertaining & it had some really nice acting scenes specially by Ejiofor. Wahlberg was great too I always liked this guy he's very underrated & people don't like him for some reason. The movie has an Assassin's Creed feeling to it & I loved it.

It had that same kind of feel Wanted had with Angelina Jolie and James McAvoy. I believe this would make a Great 1 season series if they did this correctly. Personal note? It's a Movie who cares if there is religion or reincarnation in it. If you are going whine and complain ? Then you need to take a serious look at what you believe. If they keep etching out all the different cultural beliefs or religions (and yes even Atheism ) then movies are going to be a lot less colorful.

Hell yes! This is a good romp.My main criticism is that good storytelling is indispensable - a movie isn't a great movie because of its action sequences, it's because of story. This one has a few moments that make me think the casting doesn't quite fit the story's timeline.I also bet that they left a lot of content on the cutting room floor - perhaps a directors go for broke recut would bring back some elements that were too brief and undeveloped - but that they clearly have footage for.This is a solid 7 to 7.5.",Infinite

I am not sure what these other reviewers are expecting but this is what filmmaking is all about. Telling a story. Using our imagination. Maybe perhaps they have gotten to see everything and now all stories feel like rehashed pieces of other stories. Ironic how this sentiment reminds me of the main villain in this movie. He is tired of seeing the same old things.Well, this is the nature of mythology. We began with stories around a campfire in a cave. Then we moved on to religion. Now we mix religion and mythology and technology together and we create movies.It felt like a wonderful mix of The Matrix and Cloud Atlas. I'm not saying this film is the next big sci fi film but what have we gotten since Edge of Tomorrow & Blade Runner 2037? Was Mark Wahlburg the wrong casting choice? Maybe so but he does a fine job. Was the story a little rushed? Perhaps. Yes, more world building or character development would have been welcomed whole-heartedly.Look I've seen everything in my life. I've seen so many films. To rate this below a 6 would be an absolute crime. I see people handing out 3s. Now if I were like them and wanted to ruin the rating system I would give this film ""a 10 to balance out the bad reviews"" but I believe in being objective. And objectively you could never rate this below a 6. Anyone that believes otherwise is bitter or in a bad mood.I'm not saying this is the next big thing but it really was an amazing ride. I found myself wanting more. I really loved the infusion of buddhism and science fiction. If anything I am disappointed it ended so soon.If the premise interests you? Don't listen to anyone that ever rates a movie below a 5. If you go to an imdb review and there are a lot of reviews below a 5, ignore them. Only pay attention to what is above a 5, unless you're into campy horror or cult classics that aren't meant to be taken seriously.I'm not asking for every film to remake the wheel. I just want to enjoy something imaginative. Something halfway believable. Something to make us forget the day to day 9 to 5 drudgery. The lack of magic in this world is because people fail to see it. This movie is escapism. It's grand. It's beautiful.

The action was about the only thing I felt they put the money into, but the motorcycle cliff jump onto a plane was very cheesy. Chiwetel Ejiofr also was acting a bit unhinged.

Acting was decent, some much better and outshining the others (especially Sophie Cookson), and the visual effects were alright. Was the film great? No, but it wasn't awful either. It was fine. Best way to describe it. I think had they casted someone besides Mark Wahlberg, someone who can appear intimidating and badass, it would have gone better. I'd recommend watching if you just feel like putting on a movie and having a nice time-just don't expect too much. I overall enjoyed the movie more than I didn't.",Infinite
313,mykjohnson,Top notch,8,17 June 2021,"I'm saying for you to disregard the naysayers. This movie is awesome albeit with some holes. It's refreshing to see Mark actually acting and not panting and breathing heavily like most of his films.The story is about about 500 souls that remember their past lives when they reincarnate. Turns out that Marks character is one of these people who have now divided into two groups. One wants to further mankind but the other wants to end it all.They've thrown everything at this movie from the nice Aston Martins to the round the world action sequences. They even had the Captain America bit...you'll know when you see it. They had Mark take his top off at every excuse in an effort to appeal to a certain demographic.Like I said the story has some holes but I still think it's a great movie with good actors and cinematography.So...
I wholeheartedly recommend this movie.",Infinite

Great CGI and high tech product placement (fold out phones, Ferraris, Aston Martin, retractable steering wheel, etc...). It's no Black Panther but some of the toys could have come from Wakanda.You have to suspend your common sense. For example, Bathurst, the antagonist, wants to destroy the Earth because his reincarnations are painful for him but he could easily suspend his conscious on an SD card and stop reincanating via his Dethroner. He's already imprisoned 40% of the infinite population in this manner.

I spent half the movie turning the volume up then down again! Crazy.4. What happens to all the others in the wall? They say they want to save them, the blow up the room. So are they freed or just destroyed??5. Probably my biggest let-down was Marks training fight scene. This could have been an AMAZING scene if it was extended a bit further.

So...) and use the bomb egg to kill every living organism on the planet. Then theoretically he can't reincarnate & that's the plan.

Maybe hide it in the deep Mariana Trenches or even better float it off into outer space or some other weird idea!! Instead of making the earth a barren land or so..
And finally when he does have the egg & bomb integrated to go off, get on with it immediately man. You have been waiting to do this for quite a few lifetimes. Why load it onto a plane?!

But this, 'Project Power', 'Code 8' and '6 Underground', all good movies in their own rights, just lack depth...be it characters, plot. Acting skill or a mixture thereof.Overall the actors all did great with what they had. One minor exception was Sophie Cookson who seemed to be trying to visualize the emotions of the character too much, so her character was like fries at the bottom of the fast food bag...you can eat them, but they are cold and a bit stale.I guess you could say it is like going for a drive around the block instead of through the forest or along the beach. You are on a drive, but it is just like the other times you took that short trip...not much new and a bit dry...but definitely more enjoyable than doing chores around the house, which is what the others have been like at times.It is definitely at the top of the list of movies released this year, mainly due to how horrible many have been, but it definitely watchable and enjoyable.",Infinite

However if you don't look too much into it, this film is quite enjoyable.Not necessarily a good vs evil movie. Comes together nicely and actually makes sense. You actually do feel sorry for the protagonist even though you're rooting for team Wahlburgers.500 individuals on Earth retain the memories of their previous lives. The antagonist is mentally fatigued from the memories that haunt him. He wants his constant reincarnation to end and there is only one way for this. To end all life on Earth so that reincarnation is no longer possible. In theory this makes sense.

My overall feeling is that it reminds me of a Young-Adults sci-fi fantasy story. It's convoluted, and the characters make a variety of nonsensical choices, and things tend to jump around a bit leaving you feel like you're somehow supposed to understand some of the characters' backstories.Okay, so if you're into movies like The Matrix, Tenet, and stories like The Highlander and stuff like that, then you'll probably enjoy this movie just fine. The acting is nothing to talk about - both in a good way and a bad way. Again, none of the actors is trying to win any awards with deep, long gazing emotes. This movie doesn't have time for that, they're too busy shooting and driving fast, and being immortal or something.So yeah, I give this a 7 because it's a fast action sci-fi bonanza of smash-stuff, and that's exactly what it set out to be, it doesn't really pretend to be anything other than that.

How do you screw this up??As soon as our main character learns about their amazing gift, we're shifted into a stupid battle between good and evil. We don't get enough time to see how he could use these talents in his everyday life.It reminds me of the movie Jumper with Hayden Christensen. We get to watch as that character benefits in his everyday and personal life from his gift before we're thrown into a crazy battle that's been going for a Millenia.This movie jumps right over that fun stuff and throws you directly into something you don't care about with a main character who is boring and side characters with zero personality. Just the classic STRONG, POWERFUL and OUTSPOKEN women. One with ugly dyed blue hair, one who is young with unwarranted self-importance, one who is old and fun and then of course the love interest who again... is very strong and smart.They have definitely filled all their 'quotas' here and at the point where Derek from 'The Good Place' said ""I resent the gender labelling"", my eyeballs rolled so far back into my skull that I could see my brain crying.I really hope somebody takes this really great idea and makes it good!

445,hanijossi,What happened? Did Antoine Fuqua run out of good ideas...,4,4 July 2021,"Sadly this movie just doesn't deliver. I had high expectations when I learned about this stellar cast and of course the project being directed by one of my all time favourite action movies Antoine Fuqua. Something with this movie didn't click whether it was the poor script, the horrible CGI or simply just a case of reaching far too out that you managed to get your own hand chopped off.The main protagonist and antagonist Mark and Chiwetel both deliver in the sense that the bad guy is after something to achieve world annihilation (nothing new here of course). Sophie as Nora plays a great supporting role and she was fully believable. However the story just didn't gel well and after nearly 110 minutes I found myself asking what the hell just happened. Some of the names and objects in this film fell flat and made up by like a 5 year old.Don't get me wrong I love the cast and director of this movie but much to my dismay this film just doesn't deliver. However if you just want to watch some mindless action scenes without any cause or rhyme or reason then you will enjoy this film. My rating is 4/10 (just for the decent action scenes!)",Infinite

473,c5150-86344,A baffling mess,2,11 July 2021,"I refuse to believe Antoine Fuqua directed this, or even that Wahlberg actually read the script and thought, ""sure this seems good."" The whole thing looks and feels like a mashup of The Matrix, Highlander and XXX that would've come out in the early 2000's. All of the action scenes have a cheesy CGI look to them, a far cry from the grittier action Fuqua usually excels at, and Wahlberg sleepwalks through this as if he finally read the script after he had already signed on. As for the plot, you won't fully get it and you won't really care. A character dies in the beginning which is set in 1985, and he gets reincarnated as Wahlberg, who I guess we're supposed to believe is 36? In the finale, Wahlberg jumps out of an airplane holding a samurai sword and grabs onto some metal case that's plummeting to the ground with one hand, lets go so he can fight the bad guy in midair, then pushes off the guy to propel himself back to the metal thing, all while still holding the damn sword.

Just by the first couple of chase scenes, you got this Angelina Jolie's Wanted smell, with it's heavy, unbelievable, CGI thats hit you in the face and makes everything unbelievable. And It only gets worst when you start being over explained the mythology behind the plot. Lots and lots of complex names and rituals that, frankly, I could have lived without. But then, I hits you right on the face, as they go to see The Oracle ... sorry ...""The Artisan"" and get out of this suicide door car to unblock Neo's ... I mean...Evan's memories to free their friends for being stuck in a computer program and save the human race from a bad guy that cannot stand being on it any more and rather end it all that keep being a part of it. It all made sense. Suddenly I started noticing the slow mo, the bullets paths, the electrodes on his head to get him going on the beginning of his path; there were so many ""tributes"" that ended in the great ""awakening"" when Neo, I mean, Evan remembers it all and the Agent Smith uses the ""it's impossible"" line. Finally, I realized I was seeing a ""Matrix for dummies"". I was seeng the same movie but with a 2020 touch, Matrix ripped of it's greatness and originality to become a mixture of it with Jupiter awakening to become a movie that you can forget so easily that, if I were you, wouldn't bother watching.",Infinite

611,sondrehoyland,Nonsensical plotline and reasoning,2,4 November 2021,"I love the premise of the show, however any sort of loyalty towards the worldbuilding is not present.Throughout the entire show there are logical flaws for almost all decision-making when you take into account the world the movie takes place; and even some nonsensical changes in the flow of story as the following scene would become a more bombastic action viewing.The entire mission for our main character is to prevent our bad guy from getting an item that will wipe out all living things. However the movie clearly establish that nobody know where this item is (except our main character who has problems remembering his past life). We are never once told why we need to find this item, presumably to destroy it before our bad guy can use it, but as we know nobody knows where this item is it. This means that finding this item is non essential, especially so when we get to know about other pressing issues our good guys are facing.The reveille situation of the movie as well as the story's ""problem"" is made laughable by the technology that has already been presented, and characters that have lived countless life's not being capable of picking up the simple skill of planning ahead...If you like world building, DO NOT WATCH THIS MOVIE!Example from the movie (slight spoiler):
One of our good guys enters a weapon room before fighting our bad guy (to buy time for our hero; as we get to know was not needed in the next scene). He launches a surprise attack by throwing a weapon, which the bad guy block with moving one of his henchmen to block it (instead of steeping to the side). The fight goes on and our good guy is know weighting for the bad guy to deal the finishing blow, which he then does after a little moment.Now as we know the characters we are following reincarnates, there is absolutely no reason why our good guy did not load himself up with explosives as a last measure when he were in the weapons room.(SPOILER BELOW)
As we know our bad guy has this gun that can trap people from continuing the incarnation, I am just baffled by the rezoning why he did not equipped himself with a way to kill himself before he gets trapped; ESPECIALY SO when he earlier in the movie told our hero to find a way to kill himself before succumbing to such a fate....",Infinite
612,sondrehoyland,"Good pitch, terrible execution...",2,4 November 2021,"If you dont think to much when watching a movie, I guess this is fine. But if you like to engage in the story being presented at all... Do not watch this movie.I see that Mark Wahlberg is getting some criticism in portraying his role, but to me, he feels the most believe in this story. With the background of his characters mentality clearly shown and told, the attitude he express feels the most logical.I can justify the antagonist not using the gun on himself as he wanting to confront God. But our good guys super scientific location(apparently not a stronghold, spite being at war) not even doing a body analyze before storing their old bodies in some futuristic fluid... I mean... At least one of the incarnated people there would like to do statics on changes in the peoples vessels from life to life.It baffles me beyond comprehension. They say that they are trying to figure out how the incarnation works. So what is the reason they don't do a full analysis on the vessel after the soul leaves it?!As for Chiwetel Ejiofor I love the first scene but I feel that his character doesn't make scene afterwards... Like why is being trapped in the womb for less than 8 months each life such a torture; he says it is boring... If he were to try to advance science time here could be properly spent just thinking. Even if not wanting to wrap his head around complex thought experiments, he could mentally hone his combat capabilities or just meditate... The scene where he is being suffocated with water is never explained as he said he gets all his memories when he is in the womb... so is he meditating... Could he not also do that in the womb...?If his justification was the receiving all his memories instantly where a pain so great he could not describe, I would get it. But boredom what?",Infinite

Many of the mythologys in Hindus (and it's branches of Baudh, Sikhs and Jains) believe that we are all reincarnations of our past self. There's also a popular superstition that children very small are acutely aware of that past which they eventually forget as they grow up.Sadly as strong as this concept is, it has been badly patched up together with a poor story that barely manages to fit the potential of what could be done here.The traditional partition of heros and villians, a hero who couldn't remember his life for 80% of the movie to actually do anything exciting with it and a villian who is unable to tolerate past memories as they come while he's in womb. They're as pathetic as they come.

No amount of suspension of disbelief can overcome a nonsensical plot that insults your intelligence. No amount of overdone CGI effects can compensate for incredibly poor story telling and laughably cliched characters. They could have done so much better with the premise of this movie, but there you go - it's just a pointless cash grab filmed by utter hacks.I don't know what Marky Mark was thinking getting anywhere near this burning tire of a movie.

634,greatones33,Entertaining yet Confusing,7,10 June 2021,I enjoyed the movie for its special effects and the performances of the two main actors Mark Wahlberg and Chiwetel Ejiofor. It is a good action scifi movie. Where the story falls short is in how confusing the plot is especially if you are one to get on your cellphone during the movie. If you aren't giving the movie your full attention it's easy to get lost in the plot. This is because the main characters evolved over different time periods in previous lives and have different names. Mark Wahlberg's character lost his memory and has to recover it to recover his fighting skills to go after the protagonist Chiwetel Ejiofor. The story is something of a combination between Assassins Creed and The Matrix. The fight scenes and choreography are all good. This is one of those movies you really need to pay attention and then watch it a 2nd time to better understand it.,Infinite
635,romansamurai,You either care about story and plot or you don't.,5,10 July 2021,"Or maybe you're somewhere in between. If story and plot are important to you, you will not like this movie as it forgets it's own plot half way through and just runs on steam from tons of fight scenes and fun play. Story is not important. Even the decent cast couldn't save the story for its plot holes.If you just want to watch an action movie without worrying if plot makes sense, this is not bad at all.Spoilers may be below. Some idiot on here thought this plot was cohesive. Just goes to speak volumes about people who rate this movie 8 - 10. As I said. Enjoy the movie for action but don't pretend it doesn't have plot holes which are explained in other various reviews on here. Such things as, the previous incarnation died 35 years ago. Mark is 50. How do they all find each other. Why not just shoot himself or anyone who wants to stop reincarnating with the Dethroner. How do they deal with hundreds of years of memories coming back, loved ones, children, death, experiences like that, coming back with memory will screw your psyche pretty badly. Who created all this equipment they have working with the incarnations. How are they suddenly able to just pull someone's consciousness and soul into a chip. There's a ton ton more big questions that movie doesn't even bother to gloss over, let alone answer. The movie started out pretty good touching some of this and building up on it, but then just focuses too much on fighting half way through and that's it. Not a bad flick all things considered. But not a 7-8. 4-5, maybe a 6 if you really want to like it.",Infinite

It won't give you superpowers, it won't give you ""Neo"" bullet dodging reflexes, it won't make you an instant master of things that have only been invented during your current life (like drones or attack helicopters) nor make you capable of inventing futuristic weapons and munitions, Star Trek style holodeck sims, 3D computer interfaces and such. In fact, when it comes to Science, an ""infinite's"" knowledge would always be LESS than the modern science graduate. (Sorry mate, that doctorate in Physics you got in you past life in the 1950s wouldn't even include knowledge of rocket propulsion or String theory, meanwhile any education pre Newton wouldn't even include gravity or the laws of motion. ) So no, being an ""infinite"" won't make you Tony Stark either.When the movie doesn't even know what its own premise entails, it can't help but be just a complete mess of a movie.

Don't read any further if you haven't seen it because of spoilers.What I don't understand is: If the Nihilists have invented a weapon that pauses an Infinite's reincarnation...why don't they use it on themselves to take their souls out of circulation?

ok here goes the spoilerlook, I understand the villain wanting to no longer live the endless cycle of reincarnations with past memories,
but they even created a mechanism that breaks the cycle, couldn't you apply it to yourself and your own cycle to action instead of just ending the world? Also, the fact that the artifact that the villain wanted was in the protagonist's old body... this for me was the worst...
the characters in the film needed the protagonist to remember where the artifact the villain wanted was... which was inside his old body... which was inside their headquarters, with the intuition of scientific analysis... of the deceased... .dude, they didn't even use an X-ray on this? How they studied that body,
analyzing the surface of his skin?

He breathes his character with an intensity that few other actors bring to the screen. Mark Wahlberg is Mark Wahlberg, and plays McCauley in a way that makes you want him to succeed. The action scenes throughout the film are as equally entertaining as any in the Fast and Furious franchise, and just as fun to watch.

706,williamruiz-01342,My bar is high for Fuqua and Wahlberg; They fell short on this one,4,15 June 2021,"1. The producers and screenwriters were either limited in their creative ability by some resource or lacked the vision to fully develop the potential of this story line.2. Faqua too has great ability, so I think this film was rushed or something. Perhaps this particular storyline is not within Faqua's range because there was a complete disconnect in final product to the audience. Explosions and futuristic technology simply doesn't fill that void.3. Acting and scenes were awkward at best. An impossible romance that seemed to be developing, and a clash between personas throughout the film just shows that the producers and director were not in full control of all the elements that developed along the line.4. Mark definitely played into his usual characters (i.e. Rugged guy with a past from MA). This could have been an opportunity to transform his usual style into something more.. 'next level'.

The movie started off with a cool chase scene that immediately got my attention. The story is really original. I love how the writers created an exciting world that revolves around the concept of reincarnation. You can't tell from the trailer but this movie is basically about Mark's character, Evan McCauley, being the key to saving the world. The actors did a great job and all the action sequences moved the movie along so quickly that before I knew it, the movie was over.

So that they stop reincarnating their memories, and that since he is tired of that he wants to... kill all humanity *evil laughs in the background*. Why doesn't he kill himself with one of his bullets? For there to be a movie of course. And he wants to achieve that thanks to an egg that kills anything alive and is more powerful than any nuclear bomb, how did he make it? A wizard did it, yes it is also a magic movie.Wait I'm not done yet. It turns out that this egg was hidden in the protagonist's own body (in his previous life) and that the good team saves each body to investigate why they have that power, really?! Years investigating them with super technology and they didn't even do an autopsy on his wound? At least one x-ray? Incredible, this story was written by a monkey.And to finish a scene worthy of Fast and Furious with Evan the gray jumping with the motorcycle to fall at the exact moment on top of a plane, magic, because he had no friend with a helicopter that took you there, right?And best of all... apparently the protagonist has magical/psychological powers that he inherited from his ancestor Merlin that allows him to control his surroundings or something like that (I didn't understand well what he does) ruining the little credibility that the film had and confirming that it is a movie of magic and no action. Well, he walks on the plane thanks to that, then he doesn't use his power anymore (nobody knows why) and at last we have the expected action scene that one would expect from someone who inherited centuries of memory in an instant, and obviously it sucks. If they want to suffer see until the end, even has a scene like matrix dodging bullets, didn't I mention that they can both predict and dodge bullets?From what you will see the script is terrible, and that I didn't exaggerate in anything beyond the jokes about wizards, and I didn't even mention the typical nonsensical scenes in fights or escapes or how the hell they get to all the places or how they fight with serious injuries, etc.And yes, I know that a single star is exaggerated but it is to compensate for the other exaggerated ones that give it 5 or 6.",Infinite

There is a select group of people who have infinite lifes and after every death are reborn. There are the good ones and the bad ones.The movie started out great. It made me think I'll have some fun time for 1 hour and 45 minutes...The prolog scene with Dylan O'Brien and some other actors had the right balance, but that scene was set in an earlier life of the main actor and lasted 5 minutes.We got to the actual movie actors and plot afterwards...Back to now, it all comes down to a missing egg which can destroy humanity. The only guy who knows where it is has lost his memory, but somehow the good guys want to make him remember. WHY?It got more absurd... To get to that piece of information Dylan O'Brien's present incarnation played by Mark Wahlberg ""almost"" died. Somehow manages to come back to life after all are grieving for a couple of minutes and then tells everyone in the room where the egg is. OF COURSE the bad guy is so smart that he gets access to that information too.Since I mentioned the smart bad guy who got acted pretty well. He is surrounded by gorgeous women, one which is torturing him for some unspecific reason. He lives on a huge palast, has any technological advangement one can think of. Has a private army of black suited elite commandos, created a weapon which can destroy humanity and one which can stop the good guys from getting reborn.BUT, he wants to die....It seems to bother him that he can relive all his past memories in the birth stage and he isn't believing that there is some purpose in what these praised creatures named Infinites do.Somehow this smart guy, carries with him a weapon (the one which stops the rebirth cycle) for decades and it doesn't occur to him, that ""hey, I could use this on me."" NOOOO. He has to stop every life on earth, to achieve his egoistic goal.Then, at the all deciding scene on a plane, he watches Mark being able to walk outside on a plane with his just re-discovered special ability and the bad guy says two times, ""Impossible"", but he doesn't get enticed enough to find out how he did and if his suicide mission could be put away for a bit, until he figures out the new data and how it affects his non-believing opinion.At the very end Mark shoots the bad guy with the bad guys own special weapon, THANK YOU MARK. Win win for both sides......Oh, it was also an interesting bit of info to see that the egg was INSIDE of the main actor past persona. How did he put it in there? Driving a sports car to the limit, chased by police and heavy traffic, cutting himself with a knife, making a small cut in his belly and then inserting that huge egg without much hassle into him. He then, burns the wound, which isn't much bleeding anyway, probably so for the egg to not falling out. Of course he could do extrem stunts after that operation as well. WE all know you can do such things with a full stomach....This movie had so many plotholes that it gets kind of fun to try to find them all. Therefore my three stars and for the prolog scene which was cool.I wouldn't watch it again and wouldn't spent money on it. For a mid-week distraction watch, it could be used to make fun out of Hollywood and make us feel smarter, lolol.",Infinite

756,Zuko-Halliwell,"Good Film, Better Screenplay",6,16 June 2021,"Let me just start by saying that I read the script for this movie over a year ago. I've read several scripts by the writer, Ian Shorr, and I'm a big fan of his work.I enjoyed the movie, but I was disappointed by a very major change that was made from the script. In both the script and the movie, everyone thinks that Evan is Treadway, but in the script, it's revealed that Evan isn't Treadway... he's Abel. Now, I know what you're thinking, Abel was Dethroned. But he died a split-second later. The Dethroner only downloaded some of his consciousness, and THAT'S why the memories of his past lives didn't fully come back. In my opinion, having Evan be Abel would've subverted the ""chosen one"" trope that the movie suffers from. It also would've left the door open for a sequel, because it was never revealed who or where Treadway's reincarnation is.There are still parts of the movie that I enjoyed. I think Bathurst is one of the greatest cinematic villains of the 21st century. I understand his motivations and I sympathize with him, but I can't condone his actions. Also, Jason Mantzoukas steals the show as the Artisan. All in all, I say that the movie was fun, but it would've been better if they had stuck to the script.PS, Many of you are wondering why Bathurst doesn't just use the Dethroner on himself. I can answer that. Being Dethroned is not the same as dying. Their subconscious is basically locked in a box forever. Imagine being buried alive but never running out of air. That's why he won't use it on himself.",Infinite

I kind of love Wahlberg, but I don't think he's a good actor and in this movie he is at his worst and totally out of role. The plot is so stupid I was offended, I had to watch it in 4-5 takes because I couldn't take more, the supporting roles are ludicrous, the reincarnation system, which should be the center of everything, is not explained apart from a generic outline, it doens't seem developed or thought out and too many things don't add up. The action scenes are over-the-top as I would expect from Fuqua, but everything is pointless, I couldn't care less about anything.

765,d-canseyidoglu,7 Because it was different,7,14 June 2021,"I like Mark Wahlberg a lot. But frankly, he just didn't work for this role. I think if he ought to star in this movie then he should've been old Treadway instead of new one and let Dylan take the wheel.They seriously had a good concept. The opening was interesting and exciting. But whenever we turn back to present time it just became boring and felt like there is a two kind of movie but not one whole. Past and present did not work together.I love how they made it feel real though. Characters get shot well they either die or hurt real badly. It doesn't give you the impression that protagonists can never die and god mode has activated so that they can defeat whatever comes in their way unlike all those action packed emotionless movies you don't feel nothing towards your main action fella. Here though the problem is that actors give you zero emotion. You don't feel for them. Mark was a wrong choice Sophie is a worse choice. She is a beautiful piece of wood. She gives you zero feeling. Her acting is dull and boring. She is really gorgeous though.Oh and remember I said everything feels real and it is different. At some point you kinda ask for cliché stuff too. Like our main guy Mark and main girl Sophie should fall in love. Instead there is this dead lover of Sophie and there is zero possibility between Mark and Sophie. Plus, the guy is dead! We don't even see him. Yeah I mean I still like it for trying to be different but average audience would again FEEL NOTHING for our characters.This could have been a very nice movie but it failed during casting.

806,kimberlydevinebrink,Such a waste of potential,3,26 June 2021,"This movie had so much potential... Strong cast, great effects... and yet, somehow, it's beyond bad. Beyond really bad. The complete waste of money and potential is truly as irritating as the lapses in the film.Much of the film is encumbered by nebulous flashbacks of the same exact scenes. The acting will switch from good to flat/unbelievable in a single scene, and it becomes obvious the actors were stifled by inexperienced direction. Imagine my shock when I realized the director wasn't inexperienced... I cannot imagine what happened to make this film what it is.The entire movie gives the sense of watching a power point by someone who just figured out how to do the effects, and we all have seen the swooping fonts I am descring, but hasn't yet learned how to organize the information he's trying to convey.",Infinite
807,peanutsdad-65386,"I liked it, but remember it was just a movie",7,10 June 2021,"Was a great concept, was a good origin story. Sequels would be great. I watched it. I enjoyed it for what I was. It's not gonna get an Oscar, but it wasn't make to. I was an action flick with a good story. Other reviewers need chill out. It's a movie!!!!",Infinite
808,orellanasergio,Good movie,8,11 June 2021,"Everyone thinks they know everything now and days, good movie with obvious twists and turns for a movie fanatic.",Infinite
809,tonibg-2,Interesting concept and that is it,3,12 August 2021,"Started promising and nothing after that....
Waste of potential and actors.",Infinite
810,nrrobert-55689,Talk about ruining a great concept...,1,12 September 2021,"Watch if you want to be disapointed. Every line was hard to digest and the scenes were arranged in an unappealing way. The plotholes are to great to pass you by and breakes any bit of immersion as soon as you start to get in to it. And wow, who TF approved this script?",Infinite
811,hackberryonline,How did this get made?,1,16 June 2021,"My first thought is how did this ever get made? My second is can I watch it again? Oh spoilers btw!Dude wants to end all life because he doesn't want to reincarnate again but he has a gun that stops you from reincarnating... shoot yourself. Also, the gun traps your soul in a computer chip? What? And this gun is how old? At least the 80s, whatever souls are made of they can fit on 2kb of memory. Also when he gets the life ending bomb he doesn't use it, he flies off with it. Why? And when he does fly off with it they fly 15ft from and parallel to a cliff. And why are people helping him? He wants to die forever because he is conscious from a few weeks old in the womb and has a sucky 8 months, nobody else experiences that so why does his army want all life to die? His charisma? He doesn't have any.Oh and then the ending, guy hands the father a card and says when your son starts asking questions about his past to call him. Then the son shows he has full memory of his past lives and who he is but beardo mcweirdo just says 'see ya later' and keeps on walking? How did this get made?",Infinite
812,mickmcgran,Dreadful,1,9 August 2021,"Wahlberg looked to be half asleep most of the time. Boring beyond belief, nothing positive to say about it.",Infinite
813,andydownes-17597,"Great idea, poor execution.",3,4 October 2021,"I'm impressed I got past the ridiculous and utterly unnecessary car chase at the beginning which added nothing to the story.The rest was just poorly done, despite a big budget.This is actually an interesting idea but wouldn't need any of the stupid action sequences if the story itself was made better.",Infinite
814,mrwashington-88574,An obvious flaw...,5,14 June 2021,So the Believers had Treadwells body all that time... and never came across the egg? Am I the only one confused by that?,Infinite
815,bk877754,Perfect,10,11 June 2021,"I know we guys been through a long journey to experiencing the movies but this time this movie brought spirituality with TFF combos.. It has perfect opening and ending but in middle I could be more dramatic or kind of talk, overall 10/10,",Infinite
