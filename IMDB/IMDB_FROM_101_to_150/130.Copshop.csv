0,Prismark10,Copshop,4,17 October 2021,"Copshop has some similarities to cult movie Assault on Precinct 13.Unfortunately Copshop is not as tight as John Carpenter's low budget opus.Frank Grillo plays Teddy Murretto, a wanted man who intentionally gets himself arrested so he can land in jail and hopefully be safe.Gerard Butler is Bob Viddick, the hitman who is after Teddy. He also gets himself arrested so he can get to Teddy.Mayhem is caused at the quiet Nevada police station as another hitman called Lamb enters the proceedings. There is also a dirty cop roaming about.Keeping everything together is officer Valerie Young (Alexis Louder) but she has been injured by her own bullet.With her fellow cops dead, she needs to trust one of these men to get Lamb.An incoherent story, this is a messy film. Only Louder comes away wit some credit. Butler and Grillo are stuck in B movie limbo.",Copshop
1,nogodnomasters,Cause Ted is Dead,5,17 October 2021,"Valerie (Alexis Louder) is a rookie cop in Gun Greek, Nevada. Teddy (Frank Grillo) ,a mafia fixer who arranges deals between contractors and government is being chased by other criminal elements who want to kill him for skimming money. It also has something to do with the murder of the Nevada AG, but was not explained very well. There are numerous elements of government involved in the schemes which also includes drugs, again not explained. For protection, Teddy gets himself thrown in jail. Bob (Gerard Butler) is paid to kill Teddy and plays drunk to thrown into jail next to Ted.This is an action film with most of it playing out in the police station. The plot was not overly explained and leaves gaps.Guide: F-word. No sex or nudity.",Copshop
2,paul_haakonsen,Phenomenal action crime thriller...,8,15 October 2021,"I have to say that I was more than genuinely and thoroughly entertained by this 2021 action crime thriller from director Joe Carnahan. And if you enjoy that particular genre of movies, then ""Copshop"" is most certainly well-worth the time and effort.The storyline, as written by Kurt McLeod, Joe Carnahan and Mark Williams, was a genuinely entertaining and well-written one with a great plot. And it had that good old classic feel to it, so the writers definitely hit the nail right on the head here. ""Copshop"" was enjoyable from beginning to end.There is an abundance of great action to the movie, just as there was a great amount of narrative storytelling and character development to the movie, so there is something for just about everyone here. Again, a testimony to the great writing done for the storyline.And it should be said that ""Copshop"" wouldn't have worked as nicely as it did without the stellar cast ensemble that were a part of the movie. I thoroughly enjoyed watching Gerard Butler in the movie, and it was so refreshing to see him out of the usual heroic character parts that he usually takes on. And it should be noted that he made an excellent bad guy in this movie. But Gerard Butler didn't carry the movie alone, no, he had Frank Grillo starring alongside him, and he was also putting on a fantastic performance in ""Copshop"". I am not particularly familiar with actress Alexis Louder, but she really put on a great performance alongside the likes of heavyweighters Grillo and Butler. But then there was Toby Huss, wow! Talk about a greatly cast actor whom totally stole the light. He was beyond phenomenal in ""Copshop"", and it was such a blast to see him in that particular role.""Copshop"" is a good old fashioned action crime thriller that is topped off with an abundance of action. So strap yourself in for 1 hour and 47 minutes of great entertainment.Hands down, this movie was really an amazing surprise for me, as I hadn't expected it to be as intense as it was, nor were I expecting an action crime thriller to be so encompassing in terms of script and character gallery. So thumbs up here, way, way up.My rating of ""Copshop"" lands on a very well-deserved eight out of ten stars. If you have the chance to sit down and watch ""Copshop"", you most certainly should do so.",Copshop
3,CinemaSerf,Daft thriller just about worth watch,6,16 September 2021,"In loads of old westerns, the sheriff would ask you to leave your guns at the door - well, this requires you to do that with your brain. If you try to study it in any sort of detail, then the plot holes will sing far more loudly than Aretha Franklin (or Jennifer Hudson) could ever hope to do. If you do, though, then it is quite an efficient little shoot-em up that sees wily old Gerard Butler (""Viddick"") and his prey ""Murretto"" (Frank Grillo) engaged in a life or death siege inside a police station with only the rookie ""Valerie"" (Alexis Louder) and an armour plated door between them and the mad as cheese ""Lamb"" (Toby Huss). Why are we in this mess? Well that becomes evident pretty quickly and as the film gathers steam, the tension builds and the last fifteen minutes provide for quite a decently paced - if rather implausible - ending. Louder takes what plaudits there are from this, she actually turns in quite a decent performance. Otherwise, it's just a good excuse to sit back and watch as we really don't care if anyone survives - except, maybe, her...",Copshop
4,A_Different_Drummer,A SWING AND A MISS,6,11 September 2021,"Joe Carnahan, fresh from the word-of-mouth hit BOSS LEVEL (easily one of the top films of the decade) reassembles the team for his version of ASSAULT ON PRECINCT 13 (1976). Although there are some interesting moments, and some big names on-hand, the result is mainly a nothing burger. You can literally skip the first 30 mins and still follow the story. In fact I recommend it. In spite of the name cast, newcomer Alexis Louder steals the show.",Copshop
5,UniqueParticle,I absolutely loved Copshop!,10,17 September 2021,"Such an exciting thrill ride despite anything that doesn't seem fulfilling I'm very pleased! This movie is everything I'd want in Joe Carnahan film or action story. I love the chaos that builds up, the dark comedy, cinematography shots, and the way everything played out. If anything I don't like the small amount of boring bits but I can void that out cause even those parts were entertaining. I don't know who will appreciate my review but I'd definitely recommend this fun movie.",Copshop
6,cruise01,Old fashioned shoot up action flick that is witty and bland with the humor,6,22 September 2021,3 out of 5 stars.Copshop is a fair action thriller film that feels like a 1980s neo noir action flick. A film that feels like it is meant to be released in the nostalgia 80s action films.The plot follows a sheriff lady. A con man and a hitman all being stucked in a middle of nowhere police station. While a psychopath assassin is after the con man who has something that they all want.There are some twists and turns with the plot. While leading up to a shoot up action conflict. Frank Grillo. Gerard Butler. And Alexis Louder all did good with there roles. Seeing all three in action was entertaining.The action sequences are decent and adds nothing new to the genre. Plot is decent and forgettable. And the direction is cheesy with its forced humor.,Copshop
7,Tweetienator,Needs a Filler Killer,6,19 October 2021,"Somewhat okay but nothing remarkable, the ""professional"" killer guys for sure should think about taking up some other job career. Anyway, one of those action movies where everything but the action is filler time and unbelievable, especially many dialogues are wanna-be cool cat talk. Some serious cutting to give the story some more momentum and a more serious tone (characters, dialogue) would have done Copshop a good service. To sum it up: solid but missing some spice.",Copshop
8,Fella_shibby,Action n star cast overshadows the movie's flaws.,7,17 October 2021,"Grillo with a man bun like Tom Cruise in Last Samurai which nobody saw was epic.The movie tried hard to be like Assault on Precinct 13 but the lack of atmosphere, tension n suspense prevented it.In fact the low budget VFW starring Stephen Lang is a decent take on defending the 'Alamo'.",Copshop
9,jtindahouse,"A brutal, unforgiving film",9,15 October 2021,"Action/thrillers aren't always my favourite type of thrillers, but if they are made as well as 'Copshop' is then there is no way not to love it. This movie is brutal - and I loved every minute of it. It did get off to a slightly slow start, however once the action began it was relentless.There are three levels of characters in this movie. There are the cops who you obviously root for first. Then there are less evil criminals, and they trump the ultra-evil criminals. The movie is quite clever too in the way it doesn't always let you in on which category a character falls into. The movie isn't in your face with twists and turns, but it does have some quite subtle ones that I really appreciated.There was a little bit of unrealistic and unnecessary silliness at the end that I thought the film could've done without. Otherwise though I had a great time with this movie and would highly recommend it. 9/10.",Copshop
10,stevendbeard,Lots of Surprises,8,17 September 2021,"I saw ""Copshop"", starring Frank Grillo-Hitman's Wife's Bodyguard, the Captain America movies; Gerard Butler-Hunter Killer, Law Abiding Citizen; Alexis Louder-The Tomorrow War, Black Panther and Toby Huss-Reno 911!-tv, Halloween_2018.This is a good action movie with lots of surprises. It starts off with the theme music from the 1973 Magnum Force-Clint Eastwood classic-playing and only gets better from there. Frank plays a con artist that is on the run from assassins hired by the people he stole money from. He decides to get himself arrested to hide out in a safe, protective area, jail-he strikes Alexis, a rookie cop, to get arrested. Gerard is one of the bounty hunters on his tail and does the same thing-getting arrested, not striking Alexis-to get close to Frank. Then, Toby shows up. He is another, more psychotic killer that justs starts shooting at everyone in sight as he delivers funny lines. He is the funniest part of the movie. Overall, I really liked this one.It's rated ""R"" for bloody violence and language and has a running time of 1 hour & 48 minutes.I would buy this one on Blu_Ray.",Copshop
11,tadpole-596-918256,"""Ms. Rambo, or how I learned to perform . . .",8,22 September 2021,". . . major surgery on myself and others"" COULD be the title of this revisionist action film. However, its ACTUAL heading is listed as COPSHOP (which sounds like some sort of illegal car scavenging business). This flick is chock full of lovable characters, suggesting many spin-off opportunities (were it not for the fact that all but two of them meet with violent deaths by the end credits). Hopefully, the sequel will generously expand the COPSHOP universe (starting with Val's yet-to-be-seen spouse).",Copshop
12,dar0417,Solid,6,12 October 2021,Lot's of crazy action with Gerard Butler and Frank Grillo. Like always you go in thinking just another action film and it turns out to be freaking awesome.,Copshop
13,Pairic,Intriguing Thriller,8,12 September 2021,"Copshop: We've had sieges of police stations before but his film has some original angles. Teddy (Frank Grillo) punches cop Alexis (Valerie Young) to get himself arrested, he fleeing from hitmen. But one of the killers, Bob (Gerald Butler) feigns drunkenness to end up in the same lock-up. An interesting station, comedians, slackers even a corrupt cop. Actually corrupt cops are everywhere in this film. Things get even more interesting for Teddy, Bob and Alexis as a rival hitman, Anthony (Toby Huss) arrives at the copshop, Anthony is truly psychotic, carrying a Bugs Bunny Balloon and sounding like Foghorn Leghorn. An internal siege develops with cells, narrow passages and an open pln squad roo becoming the battleground. Some savage violence and indiscriminate killing though this is leavened by by a streak of dark humour throughout Copshop. The tension is maintained and the film has a touch of early Tarantino about it, especially the dialogue. An intriguing thriller. Directed/Co-Written by Joe Carnahan. 8/10.",Copshop
14,masonfisk,DWELL IN THE SLIME...!,8,27 September 2021,"A current release from Joe Carnahan (The Grey/The A Team). When a scuzzy con man/racketeer goes on the run (after absconding w/some ill gotten gains) fleeing from a hit (he was being transpo'd by the Feds but then some fake cops looking to off him create a bloodbath), his only choice is to hole up in the safest place he figures so he walks up to a police officer, played by newcomer Alexis Louder (in the midst of breaking up a fracas occurring outside of a hotel), & punches her in the face, getting himself arrested. Safely locked up in the county jail, out mark, played by Frank Grillo, finds himself joined in the opposing cell by a fake drunk, played by Gerard Butler, who is actually a hit man tasked to off Grillo. Louder knows there's more than meets the eye since things are not adding up which only gets ratcheted up even further who one of her corrupt colleagues calls in a tip bringing another hitman, played by Toby Huss (stealing nearly every scene he's in), who violently kills the majority of the other deputies & is intent on breaking into the cells (which Louder has locked herself into) to complete his mission. What follows is a variation on John Carpenter's Assault on Precinct 13 filtered through the mind of Elmore Leonard w/great characters in a fractured situation especially Louder who is font of calm intelligence & pointed action who commands our attention at every turn. Carnahan had tried this trope before in his Smoking Aces release from 2007 but I felt he had an uneven mix of drama & comedy (the drama upended the humor in my opine) but here it's a perfect stew (when I actually saw the trailer for this film I got nervous...thank God I was wrong!) which gets a good balance of laughs & winces. Also starring Chad L. Coleman (Tyrese from the Walking Dead) as Louder's superior.",Copshop
15,valleyjohn,Tarantino Lite,7,16 September 2021,"Gerard Butler is having a bit of a renaissance in his career after making some poor career choices several years ago and Frank Grillo is at the peak of his acting career after being in some very successful TV shows but without doubt the star of Cop Shop is a someone who I don't think I've seen before and that's Alexis Louder .On the run from a lethal assassin, a wily con artist devises a scheme to hide out inside a small-town police station-but when the hitman turns up at the precinct, an unsuspecting rookie cop finds herself caught in the crosshairs.The best way to describe this is it's a Tarantino lite action thriller . While it's not as good as anything Tarantino has made , because of the characters, the dialogue and the music , it definitely has that feel.The film is nearly entirely set in police station ( hence the title ) and that give it a claustrophobic feel , in a good way .The first half it's mainly setting the story up and the second half is all out action .Nobody can be trusted apart from Valerie and it's almost impossible to avoid the flying bullets.Sure it's far fetched and and a little monotonous at times but I enjoyed it for the most part .I'm sure there will be plenty of people who are sniffy about the film but there is no denying it's unearthed a new star in Alexis Louder .I think we might be seeing a lot of her in the future .",Copshop
16,masonsaul,Great thriller,8,10 September 2021,"Copshop is a great thriller that's funny, witty and tense with some satisfyingly unpredictable moments, even if it takes a little too long to get going. Frank Grillo, Gerard Butler, Toby Huss and Alexis Louder all give incredible performances and Ryan O'Nan is great. Joe Carnahan's direction is excellent, it's extremely well filmed and suitably stylish with lots of energy. The music by Clinton Shorter is excellent.",Copshop
17,rgkarim,Will you Be Shopping For This Thriller? Succeeds in Some Levels and Cops out in others,7,18 September 2021,"LIKES:Decent Pace:
It moves for a non-action movie, with enough characters and engaging conversation to try to connect the web of lies surrounding the truth. Copshop does little to divert you from the main story, and continues to change the story amidst several parts of the police station to give you the full story, the way a good book does you know? By continuing to show these elements, they bait you into staying into the show to see how it plays out, refreshes your interest that time mostly seems to fly. Well done there!Acting:
Not Oscar worthy, and that is pretty much okay for a movie like this. Yet, they accomplish the goal of this crazy movie and make a go of creating a ""colorful"" cast of ""heroes"" so to speak. Frank Grillo has the conman role down, a teetering loyalty that you always question in his search for answers and survival. Gerard Butler brings his usual bag of intensity to the market, doing little to waiver from the intimidation factor he's made famous in 300 and the Fallen series. What's nice is that it's twisted in a slightly different manner and it works super well with the darker comedy aspect. Toby Huss brings a parodical nature to the role of a killer, a blend of funny, overemphasized accents, with cheesy lines and examples that is both terrifying and humorous at the same time. And the unsung hero is of course Alexis Louder, who takes the role of Val very ell in the dynamic she has to balance on profile. Strong women is there in all the right folds, but still realistic, Louder's portrayal runs the grounds of fun, laughs, and attitudes that is the central engine driving the bus. It's a fantastic central character and one that I did enjoy for the most part.Character utilization:
What else can I say about this, but they fulfilled the goal of bringing lots of characters in and practically using them in a meaningful way. Certainly there are extras with a limited inclusion, but for the most part Copshop accomplishes the goals of making sure there is a reason for them to be in the movie. It's smart writing and even more so respectful to the actors and players in the story so I give them props.The Dark Comedy:
It's the bread and butter of this movie, Copshop is a semi-exciting adventure that does little to mirror the horrors of the dark underworld. Teddy's story is a twisted dance of morals, and everyone who gets dragged into the mess has to put themselves underneath the microscope and examine their own issues that life throws at them. Copshops story is certainly a big slice of irony, conveying double standards and balances of trust and just how incompetent some things in the modern age are. However, the writing itself supports this, and some of the hyperbolic descriptions and portrayals are hysterical to listen to. Though certainly a bit drier than the usual comedy, it works well in this movie at sort of pulling the dramatic veil off of this crime series and injecting a little fun with it. Even up to the last seconds of the film, that comedic tone remains and it was fun to watch with only going too much a few times for me.DISLIKES:The Language Aggression:
Not going to affect a lot of people, but with the comedic gold of straight up irony and dialogue, is only lost to me by an obsession with the F word in all its forms. Copshop does have the realistic nature of how a lot of anger and ire is shed, but for a movie that works a bit on the comedic poking, I'd have liked a little more effort to spice up the other elements I was enjoying in this film. Dark comedy does not always have to rely on an aggressive dialogue, and given some of the potential we saw with this movie, I could have been entertained with more of those irony moments mixed in different scenarios/ways.The Story Elements:
There was again hope of a deeper lore beneath the visage of the con artists and killers, and it offered a lot of promise for some characters that were more interesting past the tough guy personage. While I can say they did hit some of these elements quite well, I can't say that it was entirely worth it in my opinion. Teddy's whole stakes are bult up more than they should be and even his backstory is only lackluster in the actual development skill level than I think it's worth in the end. Viddick's character is sort of the lone wolf style, mysterious and deeply dark, but again only hinted at in some fun dance that suggest a potential sequel if it does well enough. Yet where the story severely flops for me is the whole interconnected crime itself and just what is the whole involvement and big picture that involved so many people. Sure, I can put the clues together in a simple explanation that covers the bases, but after so much build up and stringing... the whole explanation is lost to the Dark comedy. It's disappointing to some degree, and I would have liked more to fleshing out the points of all the carnage to sort of up the stakes.The Action/Competence:
The movie does a decent job of setting up the premise for why there is so much carnage, but at the same time it's comedic twist also sometimes defies logic for the competence of several of the characters. Val manages to have more competence than most of her fellow officers, but even our shadier characters make stupid lapses in judgement that moments before were much sharper. Action wise, the movie does little to stroke that click, again taking a realistic take like Law and Order does in most of the episodes. While it is again a lead up to some funny moments and dialogue, the fact that the characters sort of break is not as entertaining to me.The VERDICT:Copshop was a nice surprise in terms of the comedic approach they took with a tried and true drama. Certainly not the wettest of the laughs, this film is all about stabbing at life and the irony we have as life hands us choices. With fun characters and parodies of titular titles, and writing that supports them super well, you will find a lot of the gold in the writing at this time. And while this is certainly the highlight of the movie, it's also the biggest hindrance in some of the other categories you might be looking for in a crime thriller. The action fits the rules they have established, but it does not have the bite or confidence that John Wick does, so don't expect that kind of carnage. Throw in the fact that the movie breaks the character's competence for more laughs is not something I enjoy as much anymore. Finally, the story itself is complete enough to get your thrills out, with a little help from your experience with other shows of the genre. However, for all the hints and petering about, I had hoped for connecting the pieces and diving a little more into exploiting the kryptonite of each character to really bring the story full circle. Overall, the movie is a nice surprise and worth a watch at home when it comes out in a few weeks.Action/Crime/thriller: 7.0
Movie Overall: 6.0.",Copshop
18,burlesonjesse5,VIEWS ON FILM review of Copshop,6,21 September 2021,"""I'm gonna kill you"". That's the understatement of the year when it comes to 2021's Copshop. There's a lot of bullets that fly all over the place in Copshop. A lot of them miss, a few graze, and a few hit. Just ask an entire police station and a couple of prostyle killers. Oh wait, you can't.Anyway, Copshop is about a con man who voluntarily gets locked up only to find out that he shares the prison barracks with the actual assassin who wants to kill him.Gerard Butler and Frank Grillo star. One looks like Ian Anderson in the early days and the other looks like Antonio Banderas via 1995's Desperado. Both have enough sweaty testosterone and chutzpah to solve the energy crisis. And both seem to get right back up like energizer bunnies after getting shot.Released in September of this year, feeling like Assault on Precinct 13 with steroids, and harboring opening title credits straight from the 1970s, Copshop feels like something Quentin Tarantino and John Carpenter would combine forces on. Sadly you're better off watching their individual movies just by themselves.Granted Copshop isn't a bad film, it's just an uneven one. Intertwined between violent shootouts and feisty one-liners is otherwise annoying dialogue and characters who try to be too darn witty. Copshop's plot, well it's its own Mexican standoff. There's too many directions, too many points, and lots of personas chiming in.Oh well. At least you get director Joe Carnahan's standard ending that's abrupt, gotcha-inducing, and thought-provoking. Carnahan is truly a style monger and his flick The Grey is a favorite of mine. But sometimes he comes off like a Tarantino clone who ignored the Academy and just went for schlock. Unfortunate.Bottom line: Copshop might be the film Joe was born to make but it's more like he might have been ""born"" yesterday. ""Chopped"" shop.",Copshop
19,vengeance20,"Great Action, But Too Few & Far Between & Plotless",3,11 September 2021,"So I went in with zero expectations to see this but saw from the trailers that this might actually be good given I've seen Gerard Butler & Frank Grillo in many films from Gerard's Fallen Films to Franks 2 Purge Films!The films plot (?) follows 2 men being imprisoned at a county jail when a serial killer enters & high jacks the jail with a corrupt officer to take down the police force I think... that's the plot basically, not much in terms of what the main goal of this film was meant to be about as it's very disjointed.I found the film to be action packed, but mostly overloaded with too much talking & dragged scenes which didn't add anything to the already disjointed plot. In fact, the film jumps around from scene to scene & you can hardly make ends meat with the story or what is going on, there' no obvious narrative or plot to speak of which does indeed make this film come off as pointless with little action in it. The action itself was mediocre at best. Nothing impressive or unique.Moreover, the film drags at 1 hour & 43 minutes & has way too much talking scenes & scenes which didn't add to anything. There's no plot as each scene doesn't gel well with the next & most (if not all) of the charters were paper thin. The reviews saying this is great tell me that they must have seen a different film as it can't be this one. The ending itself made no sense at all.Overall, you'll be mostly bored with this film which is clearly overrated for the sake of it. It has little action, too much talking & dragged out scenes & has a 0 plot to it.3/10.",Copshop
20,omendata,Amalgam of 70'S & 80's Cop Shows Replete With Blatant Tarantino'esque Plagiarism,6,16 October 2021,"I could not believe what I was hearing or is it just me but the intro music to this movie is clearly ripped from Dirty Harry? Then we have the loud , big black cop doing his Captain Dobbie from Starsky & Hutch although I surmise only us oldies will remember or even have heard of those names.I actually long for those old days when I hear the use of the ""f"" word in literally every single paragraph of almost every movie now; it is as if this is now the accepted way we should converse in society; no wonder society is in retrograde evolution reverting back to the jungle. All semblance of story, good acting and everything else that made movies like Dirty Harry, Starsky & Hutch or even TJ Hooker a decent Saturday nights viewing - I dunno but i find the overuse of foul language very tedious when watching a movie these days!From there we get someone who is trying his best at a Tarantino lite...and let us not forget Tarantino and many of his ideas have come from other movies he watched when he was working in a Video Rental store, so neither are that original - This feels like Assault On Precinct 13-lite with its wafer thin storyline and utterly massive end credits list - where did all of it go?Butler is getting old and seems to be treading water and has never been a particularly great actor limited like most of his kind to movies of the violent kind, not to mention his chronic alcoholism which has aged him tenfold, whilst Grillo always gives a good performance and excellent performance from Alexis Louder elevates it above what it would have to been with a lesser actress in the lead role but the Stand out role for me though was Toby Huss as Lamb with a completely over the top but excellent performance which both make up for the lack of substance and script that lurks within this hodgepodge of cop movies!All in all - A bit of a mish-mash of a cop film with some truly awful dialogue and being fair as I always am with my reviews it has some good acting, camerawork and some good gore sfx so it gets a just above average 6/10 tonight.",Copshop
21,martimusross,"Good Start Then Spiralled Down, Don't Bother!",5,14 September 2021,"CopshopThis movie got off to a very good start and then about 45 minutes in the dialogue became stilted, the acting stiff, the plot repetitive, and the scenarios contrived.To my mind Gerald Bultler sabotaged his own movie by being desperate to engrandize his role without sufficient substance and have the last word.The female cop played by Alexis Louder did a fine job but you ""can't make a silk purse out of a sows ear"".Overall this is 5 outta 10 at best, meaning watch it on TV if you are minded.",Copshop

23,bob-the-movie-man,Ludicrous plot points ruin a promising actioner.,5,15 September 2021,"Positives:
While the three male leads have fun with their roles, the star of the show for me was the (unknown to me) Alexis Louder. She delivers a really strong performance here, with a confident stillness in some of her close-ups.There are a number of nice lines in the script, some of which made me laugh out loud, which I wasn't expecting to do.As a 'park your brain at the door' shoot-em-up, the ending is fun, similar in many ways I thought to the claustrophobic violence of ""Free Fire"".Negatives:
Here's YET another example of a script that is downright insulting to the audience's intelligence. There are some genuine ""WTF"" moments in this script. I can't go into details without dropping spoilers, but the biggest of these - you'll know it when you see it - is a genuine ""HANG ON A MINUTE!!!"" moment.The sound mix drowns out a lot of the (already drawly and indistinct) dialogue with the incessant music. It's really difficult to pick up on some of the lines.There's something surprisingly 'retro' about the whole movie, right down to the use of split screen at the end. The titles feel as if they were from a 70's TV show like Kojak. I could imagine this would work well... if the movie had actually been set in the 70's!Summary Thoughts on ""Copshop"": There's almost a good little action film buried in here struggling to get out. Alexis Louder makes a very positive impression with the best parts of the film happening when she is verbally sparring with Butler. But a good action movie needs to keep things credible, albeit on the edge of credibility (e.g. John McClane's lift shaft fall in ""Die Hard"" is very much on the boundary, if a little over it). Thanks to some ludicrous decisions within the script, this one lost all credibility for me and took me right out of the story.(For the full graphical and video reviews, please check out onemannsmovies on the web, Facebook and Tiktok.

24,Movi3DO,Not a lot of action but still fun,8,26 September 2021,"Time to shop some cops.Gerard Butler and Frank Grillo collab in an action thriller. This is hype because they are the two of my favorite badass actors in action genre. However, this movie was a fun time for a surprisingly different reason. The action was not the focus, instead it was the funny dialogues and weird characters.My favorite character had to be Anthony Lamb, played by Toby Huss. This guy was a psychopathic clown that cracked me up every time he was on the screen. Alexis Louder as the main cop was pretty badass at the end.Even though there wasn't a ton of actions, the last action scene was quite entertaining. The shot with the revolver was especially awesome.My problem with the movie was it dragged sometimes. Also, Butler and Grillo didn't have enough action scenes.Overall, an entertaining and funny thriller. 7.5/10.",Copshop
25,JohnRayPeterson,What an ending for a crime thriller!! Loved it.,8,21 October 2021,"First you read the IMDb synopsis for this movie, then add that the rookie cop is one hell of a good cop, one of the few in this crime thriller. At the root of the movie's very good plot, and it does have one I thoroughly liked, is that the system of justice is corrupt, and not just in Nevada where the action takes place, but across the country. So, Alexis Louder, who plays that good cop, Valerie, is definitely caught between a rock and a bunch of hard places which are at every turn. She has great lines to deliver and she delivers them extremely well. She's also a badass and I love badass female characters. Then you have big name actor Gerard Butler who plays the hitman Bob Viddick, but he's not the only assassin, he's the good assassin, as opposed to Toby Huss who plays the psychopath assassin Anthony Lamb, an absolutely delightful performance. Yes, there are a bunch of killers in this movie, and some, besides Bob and Anthony (those two are competitors), are cops. Frank Grillo, who plays Teddy Muretto, the conman on the run from the mob's assassins, is no newcomer to the big screen nor the tv screen, so he delivers as good a performance as Butler, but Butler's character has the best lines and probably the best role (it's a matter of preferences), as the good assassin, just like I said before. I should mention that as conmen go, Teddy is good at it, and will likely con you as he did Valerie. Oops, that's more spoiler than I should have mentioned.When you're done watching this movie you'll understand why I call Bob a good assassin and you will agree with me. The reason Teddy is on the run from the mob's hitmen is because he was caught by the FBI on some crime and turned snitch on the mob; you just don't do that and expect to have a long life expectancy, hence the assassins contracted to eliminate him and any living relatives including his wife and son. The movie has as much and as good shoot 'em up action as any of your preferred shoot 'em up action movies. You might wonder how so much story can be packed into one movie, as I've described. It's because of good script writing, as I see it. Then there's the dialogue. It made everyone of the four main characters interesting and distinct. That dialogue between Bob and Valerie sets up the ending scene perfectly and I absolutely loved the ending, one you will not forget any time soon, but you won't guess what it is and I won't tell you why as I hope you see it.",Copshop
26,Neptune165,Anyone notice the car exploded but flipped over with no damage to it?,3,18 October 2021,"Don't waste your money, besides Butler and the creepy old dude, roles Don't fit the actors, cheesy, And The main hero in this movie with over the top abilities was a woman while most of the male characters were either weak, stupid or crooked. The main actor had a subordinate role which to me was deeply disappointing. They also had a large gang of cops not in the cop headquarters that were crooked and blood thirsty. A movie so bad that the main protagonist ""Valerie Young"" switches her dominate hand from being left to right at the last 3/4s of the movie to try and save it, it doesn't. Nothing in this movie makes sense. That supposedly diverse female lead is a disaster. No acting skills.",Copshop

28,statuskuo,A 70s Cartoon,8,18 September 2021,"I love any movie where smart phones are non-existent. In this case it needs to be in order for much of what unfolds to happen. Twists and turns when an assassin (Gerard Butler) is hired to take down a mob ""fixer"" (Frank Grillo) and what stands in the way is a naive yet street smart cop (Alexis Louder). Pure western setup.It is unfortunate that this movie may find its audience years later where people discover it.Yeah there are a lot of Tarantino-isms such as talking about mundane things which violence is around. But this is probably closer to ""7 Psychopaths"" where the dark humor keeps it from being ugly.Director Joe Carnahan balances a nice mix of western cop tropes without it being too familiar. It's also a shame that peoe will see it at home rather than the theater..I think some of the joy is because of its subtleties...in a movie where it is over the top. If you are a fan of 70s music, you are in for a treat. It pays an large tribute to the wonderful scores that Lalo Schifrin is famous for. A lovely throwback to when music follows the characters and where it isn't afraid of playing a sinister theme to indicate ""bad guys."" Special kudos to Alexis Louder who is just adorable but also the moral spine of such a violent world. It wouldn't surprise me if she showed up in an episode of ""Fargo"" Here she balances sweetness, newness and joy of being good at what she does though she is clearly in over her head. I loved her!Overall, it is a great time waster. It is what cinema should be.",Copshop

30,ethanbresnett,Oh dear,5,13 September 2021,"Copshop had the makings of a decent film, but failed to cobble together its perfectly fine ingredients into a tasty dish.At its core there is a very decent premise. Essentially a dodgy guy gets himself arrested to avoid the wrath of those who want his head, thinking this will offer him a level of protection. He couldn't be more wrong...Plenty of scope for entertaining and action packed hijinks, right? In theory yes, but they got it all wrong. It was such a slow film at the start, and until Toby Huss' character turned up (a brilliant performance it's worth noting) this film was a bit of a chore. Stunted and cringe dialogue mixed with inauthentic character interactions led to a pretty bland first 30-40 minutes.As mentioned once Huss' character turned up things got a little more interesting, and we saw glimpses of what the film could have been, but they were only sporadic glimpses.Aside from Huss none of the lead performances were worth shouting about. Butler didn't shine at all and Frank Grillo and Alexis Louder were very forgettable.There was some decent action, but all of it was very been there done that. If you've ever seen an action film before you'll have seen the sort of sequences that Copshop served up. None of it was bad action in fairness, but it was so few and far between. Considering this is allegedly an action film there was a criminal lack of action. The fact that the film was easily 15 minutes too long didn't help the pacing of the action.Overall this was a big disappointment. It had good intentions and was entertaining enough to squeeze 5 stars out of me, but I do feel like this could have been a lot better.",Copshop

director: Joe Carnahan
starring: Frank Grillo, Gerard Butler, Alexis Louder, Toby Huss, Ryan o'nan, Kaiwi Lyman, etcOn the run from a lethal assassin, a wily con artist devises a scheme to hide out inside small-town police station-but when the hitman turns up at the precinct, an unsuspecting rookie cop finds herself caught in the crosshairs. Despite some promising moments, Copshop was not good at all.My first few positives would be the cinematography, fun set up. Great performances and likeable characters with good chemistry. And a decent mystery. The film was visually inventive and stylistic. With some clever shots that bought humour and tension to the scenes. In particular the point of view shots and use of shadows. And the film especially in the final act had some creatively shot scenes with interesting use of colour. I also thought the set up was fun. Having Frank Grillo's character get intentionally arrested was very funny and a unique set up that got me intrigued as to how the film would develop. I also found the characters to be very likeable. Gerard, Frank, and Alexis's characters were all charming, didn't take no crap and all the characters bounced off each other well, all three had fantastic chemistry with each other and were a great trio. With all three performances being very good. Gerard butler in particular did a great job, this was a darker role for him, but he did really well. The big standout for me would be Alexis Louder. Her lead performance was very promising. She showed a lot of charm and charisma and delivered a passionate and intense performance. I also thought the mystery of what Teddy (Frank Grillo) did and why he was targeted was interesting and created an intrigue about his character.However, my first few negatives would be the colour grading, pacing and unneeded conflict. As well as a lack of set up to the main plot point and tonal inconsistencies. A lot of the colour grading and lighting really bothered me in certain scenes. I could hardly see what was happening due to everything being so dark and it really bothered me when I could hardly see the characters face. The pacing of this film was painfully slow, 90% of the film was set in one location, and with such a lack of plot it was just the characters talking to each other most of the time it was bland and lacked consistent entertainment. A lot of the conflict also felt unneeded, a lot of the time the conflict wasn't really explained so all the characters were doing was constantly shouting at each other and it gave me a headache. There was also a complete lack of set up to the main plot point, there should have been more plot to this movie. It was so thinly written because there was this big mystery around why Teddy was being targeted that hardly got answered at all, this was just lazy writing. The film was completely tonally inconsistent. At times it was trying to be serious and then it throwed loads of attempted jokes and this would often clash with what was happening in a lot of scenes, it just felt like the film didn't know what it wanted to be.My final few positives would be the use of gore, good dialogue, and fun twists. As well as an entertaining final act. The use of gore within the action scenes was effective, it gave a lot of shock factor as so many characters were killed off and gave the film a needed edge to it. I thought the dialogue was strong for a lot of the film. It was cleverly written and played on genre tropes well and delivered some needed laughs thanks to the delivery from the actors involved. The twists in the film were solid. As the film revealed all the different parties that were targeting Teddy including dirty cops it kept the plot mostly entertaining and increased the stakes for the characters. Finally, the final act was very entertaining. They finally picked up the action and the last half an hour or so was thrilling and intense and got me questioning what was going to happen, so the film redeemed itself slightly and there were definitely some shocking moments I didn't see coming.My final few negatives would be the lapses in the logic, dumb characters and predictable set up for scenes. As well as the lack of character depth and the humour falling flat. This film had so many unrealistic scenes where characters survived for way longer than what they should have and it got to a point in certain scenes where it just got ridiculous, or they would make it seem like a character was dead and then they suddenly weren't, and it was just jarring. I also thought there was just dumb characters and predictable set up for scenes. These cops were dumb and it's as simple as that, the scenes where they would die were painfully predictable and the script was lazily written and took the surprise out of their deaths. There was also a complete lack of character depth, the characters were extremely one dimensional and were type casted as one specific thing. There was so much time to add a lot more to the characters, but they just didn't add anything to them, so it made it difficult to connect with them. Finally, the humour for the film was just bad. It was very awkward as the film was trying so hard but pretty much none of the jokes landed.Overall, Copshop has great performances and a promising lead with Alexis Louder. Good chemistry between the cast and a fun final act. But it doesn't stop the film from being lazily written, poorly structured and tonally all over the place. And it was just bland and forgettable. Never taking advantage of its fun premise.Overall score 42/100.",Copshop

If there were, I was too hypnotized by the fun violence to notice.I liked the characters, I liked the setting, I liked the story and I liked every development.

38,nidhunmoviebuff,A loud yet enjoyable old-school action flick!,7,25 October 2021,"If you are looking for a Tarantino-esque, old school action thrill ride then director Joe Carnahan's delightful 'Copshop' might be a good bet. With Gerard Butler and Frank Grillo in top from the film is a gritty, tenacious and brutal saga about a hitman in search of a mob fixer turned FBI informer.Set in the rural landscape of Nevada, a gritty, no-nonsense police officer (an electric Alexis Louder) gets added to the mix to generate a thrilling Mexican standoff between the law, an informer and a mob hitman.Despite the bullets seemingly flying back and forth throughout the film, there is enough witty dialogue and character building to keep you hooked and constantly shifting allegiances between our protagonist as layer upon layer of the complex personalities become unraveled.It is heartening to see Gerard Butler return to his best in recent times, first with the splendid survival thriller Greenland (2020) and now Copshop, a return to his home genre of gritty action which made him a global superstar.Copshop is a an end-to-end action-infused, fun ride.

It felt like it was trying to emulate Tarantino/Ritchie in some ways with dialogue and jokes, but it fell flat for most of it. Frank Grillo and Gerald Butler do pretty well together in it, as well as Toby Huss, but there's so little plot that the film takes a while in sections to get to places and by the end the flaws will annoy you.Such flaws include dumb characters, suspension of disbelief, jokes falling flat, weak writing, bland action sequences/shots, obvious story beats and decisions, and bad CGI. The score was pretty generic too. By the end you're wondering how it took roughly 100 minutes to reach that conclusion.

But on the other hand Teddy is a professional conman with narcissistic tendencies. Lamb is a combination of all evil since he is a full scale psychopath and as all psychopaths his mind works in a very efficient way and also everything he does is justified in his mind.Valerie is pretty much what every cop should be like. Very capable, very intelligent and has a very strong moral compass.That is why she will never stop going against evil even if she is in danger.Hubert on the other side is the worst kind of corrupted cop since he would do anything to cover up his traces.There is a story which is very well told since until the end there is no way to predict what will happen.There is huge character development which is unusual in action-packed movies and of course there is action, suspense.From the trailer I thought this was going to be a movie like smoking aces. Where many psychotic killers go after a contract which was pretty much a big part of the movie Boss Level which I personally loved.But Copshop is much more than that. It is not done in a way where killings are done in a kind of fun way to watch. There are many deaths but not for the sake of them. It is not a splatter movie.Every death is very very intense. Every single one of them builds suspense. There is a lot of graphic violence but not revolting . They never show the faces after they have been blown out with a shotgun or decapitations. It manages to remain out of the horror genre.And this makes the movie easier to watch and has a rewatch value.I really do not understand the low-star reviews because the movie is truly outstanding.",Copshop

What a villain for this type of film.Basically, Toby Russ, Gérard butler and Frank Grillo (until they end when they kinda ruin his character) are the best parts of the film by a great deal.

52,brianjohnson-20043,Not a polished story at all,4,21 September 2021,"I didn't dislike the drama that I think they were trying to present in this film. Good thrillers where someone doesn't know who they can trust are awesome. That seemed to the heart of what this was trying to be. But that intrigue got muddied with a lot of other ideas.I just didn't like how all the pieces were put together. Most of my gripe is related to the writing and perhaps editing/directing, because the tone didn't seem to work. It was too inconsistent to work as a comedy or drama and didn't crossover between the two extremes effectively like Jojo Rabbit or a rare similar movie which somehow manages to effectively present both extreme comedy and drama in a cohesive way.It felt like copshop was often trying too hard to be funny. But I rarely laughed and rarely did the audience because the occurrences and style seemed too dramatic and real to not take the events and drama very seriously. And the comedy was too fast paced and frequent to feel like acceptably odd funny moments within an actual crisis. It just felt like a writer wanted to have it all and didn't care about the overall presentation of all of the components put together. Either that or the editor screwed it up. I'm guessing the former was more of the issue than latter. Typically big issues stem from the script itself.",Copshop

56,tvdefrancesco,Decent Start Terrible Execution,3,20 September 2021,"The preview made me really want to like this movie. This movie started off pretty well and then started teetering. Then finally we got a flashback. I was excited, we were finally going to find out the backstory. This movie fell off of a cliff. The backstory was so vague and cheesy and didn't explain anything. The scene where his car blew up was laughable. Frank Grillo's occupation was vague and laughable. Why did FBI agents and police give up their lives for his?Secondly the female actress was terrible. So bad it was laughable. I leaned to my friend twice and said does this scene seem really strange to you? She talked like she was leading up to a punchline that never came. Same Monotone voice over and over. The movie couldn't overcome this alone.Third the story was jumbled and no died. They did 4 ohh this person is not dead reveals in a row. Hilarious. People would get shot 10 times and not die. The one cop who was bad but worried about stealing inventory became a psycho murderer really quickly. Teddy was supposed to be the Devil apparently but they gave him a wife and son who we never met nor cared about to do the opposite and humanize him. The two cops coming back from the scene of his murdered family were joking and laughing like it never happened. Way too much slow mo at the end as Teddy is shot a 100 times. And then the slow mo scene of him running and her doing the predictable spin the barrel shot, cuz you know...who wouldn't try that for the first time in a life and death situation. And then after all that he wasn't even dead yet. For some reason Feds and politicians trust a lunatic to murder people for them and not talk. We know the difference between a professional and a psychotic yet they felt the need to explain it to the audience twice. Every gun had unlimited bullets especially the automatic. When she's trying to get into the cell the guy literally fired 500 bullets from one clip.Then there was the ending. The weirdest most awkward scene. Gerard Butler saves her life, her whole department was murdered, and she has been shot almost to death. So she decides to steal the ambulance leave the paramedics on the side of the road and then goes after Gerard Butler. Then we have a 2 min scene of them driving and humming and singing to the radio.

60,RetroRick,"Not a bad film, but watch it for newcome Loudon's action debut",6,19 October 2021,"A homage to the cop movies of the 70s this is a heavier on style than substance or plot kind of movie. There are a times when it seems slightly clumsy in its set up of the situation, but ultimately it gets its act together and delivers a quite tense second half.Butler and Grill as respectively cat / assassin and mouse / mark are perfectly adequate in their roles, but the film kind of drags until the second assassin turns up. The great revelation of the film though is Alexis Louder as the young shaven headed but cool as a cucumber young female cop - the one that Grillo suckerpunches at the outset.From looking like she might be the - dare I say it - 'diversity hire' at the beginning, she evolves by the end of it into one of the best female action leads since Alien's Ripley. I was simply bowled over how charismatic she was playing against veteran names like Butler.It would be a great shame if we don't more of her.I'd also note that while there are few occasions when she seems like she might be a little too good (the impromptu tracheotomy comes to mind) one of the reasons she convinces is she's very far from invincible. Indeed for much of the film she's laid low & vulnerable. For a relative newcomer this is a star turn.All told a mostly enjoyable film, that sometimes feels a bit forced & stylised.",Copshop
61,RobTortureWright,The FalseShop,5,17 October 2021,"The fact that a trained Police Officer would lose a bullet from a Revolver no less and simply not care, not look for it and not even notice just ruins any realism and completely takes you out of any immersion that existed. Gerald Butler played his part very well as usual and instantly made the film better when he was on screen. One of the stand outs was the Psychopathic Hitman named Anthony who brought some wackiness and fun to the film, if only for 10-15 minutes. The lead character was overly pushed as some sort of superhero who can do everything and acts like Denzel Washington in The Equaliser.... Only the wish version. The ending was awful and almost hints at a sequel but I feel like Copshop simply vanished from the box office and didn't do great sales so I doubt that will happen. Overall a very basic film with a mashup of story that's all over the place and ultimately ends up going nowhere satisfying.",Copshop

The only nice thing about this film was that it gave me the opportunity to just shut my brain down after having such a tiring week. The main cast had some good chemistry that I enjoyed, but their acting was sub-par. The graphics/visuals to the film were distracting by how bad some of them were. At the moment I can't nitpick any ideas of what would even make this film good. One thing for sure was that I thought it would be funnier. The trailer seemed to point at some, not so forced, comedy to happen throughout.Overall, I wouldn't recommend seeing it in theatres even on a cheap night.

68,shadowfax73,A bit too cliched,5,5 November 2021,"Nothing new to see here. I mostly enjoy Gerard Butler films because he usually plays three dimensional characters, doesn't come across as pure on Rambo. His characters have vulnerabilities and he usually wins out in fairly realistic ways. So, action drama with Gerard Butler, what could go wrong? Well the story for one. Starts off intriguing and then gets more and more bogged down with exposition and character bonding.What detracted from the film for me was the bad-a$$ female cop. To perfect. Too gung-ho. Too on top of everything. Even when she's shot the heroics just tumble out of her. If it was a male rookie cop character he'd be nervous, stumbling and basically in shock at his first encounter with real mayhem but because the character is female, all bets are off and she is written as a take no prisoners warrior. Enough with the female Rambos. Strong women are one thing but cliche characters to get female viewers going rah, rah, rah is just cheap.The Gerard Butler 'Fallen' movies are perfect action dramas as they either don't push agendas or not in an obvious way.",Copshop

It feels much more like a directors first film, when someone is experimenting and unsure how to tell a story and are just throwing everything into it.So it ends up a bit of a mess, some odd visuals where they seem to have shot most of the night time scenes in daylight and then cgi'ed them dark, it looks a bit cheap but I think its supposed to look comic book like, at least this is used through much of the movie so is consistent.There are a couple of good scenes in the film and the Toby Huss character at least adds in a bit of lightness when he arrives. But on the whole the film just feels disjointed, they tried to mix together four or five classic films and styles, taking bits from all of them, but didn't spend enough time actually making their own film work.The last third of the film I found quite dull as by that point you don't know who you are supposed to care about and you don't really care about any of the characters either, so its just a bore.

78,cschultz-2,Viciously Entertaining,9,19 September 2021,"""Copshop"" Distributed by Open Road Films, 107 Minutes, Rated R, Released September 17, 2021:Swindler and career criminal Teddy Muretto (Frank Grillo), on the run from the cops, the FBI, and the Mob after being implicated in the murder of a prominent and influential Nevada politician, assaults a police officer as a means of getting himself thrown into jail for temporary sanctuary. Hot on Muretto's trail, resourceful hitman Bob Viddick (Gerard Butler) feigns a drunk driving incident to get himself thrown into a cell adjacent to Muretto's.As the two men bicker, insult each other, swap tough talk, and plan their next moves, they're dismayed when the police station comes under siege from Anthony Lamb (Toby Huss), still another hitman on Muretto's trail--one who's genuinely disturbed. Worse, Lamb has accomplices among both the cops at the precinct and the district attorney's office.A rollicking, tough-as-nails, testosterone-fueled explosion of a movie, ""Copshop"" benefits enormously from a sharp and mordantly funny script from Kurt McLeod and director Joe Carnahan that contains a number of surprises and double-crosses and consistently goes in unexpected directions. Sort of a mishmash of early Quentin Tarantino classics such as ""Reservoir Dogs"" and ""From Dusk 'til Dawn"" and an especially demented Road Runner/Wile E. Coyote cartoon, the picture is loud, violent...and viciously entertaining.Action movie veterans Gerard Butler (""Machine Gun Preacher,"" ""Olympus Has Fallen"") and Frank Grillo (""The Purge: Anarchy,"" ""The Purge: Election Year"") plainly have a ball doing what they do best. But while Grillo and Butler strut, swagger, and sneer, ""Copshop"" is all but stolen away from them by Alexis Louder as an amazingly resilient rookie police officer who's every bit their equal, and then some. Also contributing a scene-stealing turn to the picture is Toby Huss as a cheerfully sadistic professional assassin who enjoys his job way, way too much.Directed by action/adventure specialist Joe Carnahan (""Blood, Guts, Bullets and Octane,"" ""The A-Team""), ""Copshop"" is more than a little reminiscent of ""Rio Bravo"" from 1959 (and John Carpenter's 1976 remake, ""Assault on Precinct 13""). The movie takes a while to work itself up to full speed, but when it finally gets revved up the picture establishes its own rowdy identity and really comes into its own. This is a movie that would've been right at home at a drive-in theater during the 1970s. In its bullet-riddled glory, ""Copshop"" is Joe Carnahan's masterpiece.""Copshop"" is rated R for strong, bloody violence and pervasive adult language throughout.",Copshop

81,guskeller,Fun and flashy with heart,8,20 September 2021,"Fun and flashy with an unexpected amount of heart, Copshop is a solid B-movie. The story is very contained (primarily taking place in one location), which allows for focused character development and potent action sequences. Often, movies like this come across hollow, but because the characters are so definitively written and well-acted, audiences will buy-in through emotional connection. From top to bottom, the cast elevates the snappy material, and that is the driving force of this film. Still, Alexis Louder deserves specific credit for bringing a layered core performance.Meanwhile, Copshop is strengthened by its technical aspects. The music stands out as it sets a classic and animated tone. The camera work is dynamic, using dolly-zooms, overhead shots, and a variety of movements to keep the limited location fresh. The editing meticulously builds tension in the first act before unloading high energy sequences later on. Indeed, there isn't a clear weakness to be found in this movie. So, because of its tight narrative, snappy dialogue, distinct ensemble, and smooth filmmaking, Copshop hits as a well-rounded piece of entertainment.Writing: 7/10

Alexis Louder is ""too cool"" to be there and by the time ""stuff"" hits the fan it's deep into the run time of the film. Acting is not that good and how the hell can a person be shot, bleeding out for what seems like forever can all of a sudden pull a bullet out of their gut, mend themselves, and then have dead accuracy (when they shot themselves the first time) while having no problems running/ducking? Oh right, women power..... That being said, the idea that Butler's character could survive after a short range blast with an automatic weapon is a joke as well who pops up at the very end when the ""dirty"" cop shows up to kill Alexis Louder's character.Instead of the dumb stuff that was in this film, I would have liked to see something happen with the mysterious mob-like group that had the DA killed and who are tied into everything who are talked about in the film and who Grillo is running from. But no, we get a boring movie with some actions/bullets near the end and over-the-top but ""serious"" can't be stopped Alexis Louder (see Army of One to see a decent kick-A women lead) and to an extent Butler who looks too-bored to play a different character than his ""Big Nick"" character.Save yourself time and avoid.",Copshop

The only reason to watch this film is the stellar performances of Alexis Louder and Toby the psycho killer.The rest of the actors were as you can imagine... Frank Grillo tries to play John Travolta in Pulp Fiction yet fails and Gerard Butler is still playing the same role of his last films of action hero bad ass yet nothing really different so no surprise there. Obviously he needed the money and maybe there is a sequel with this terrible ending.Once you get past the pathetic first hour of the films set up or lack of a set up..... enters the Toby Huss as a very fun psycho killer... and the story finally kicks off from its B movie story that feels like a student film with one location and horrible supporting actors. Louder seems to be the main element that ties the film/story together yet it feels like almost 2 different movies - one is a B movie and the other one is some 70s Female Lethal Weapon/Jackie Brown movie. And it never really makes any sense so the writer/director just turns it into a shoot em up/action for the 3rd act and that is probably the best part of the film.Watch without any expectations and you might enjoy it.5 stars mostly for Louder and Toby Huss who steal the show.,Copshop

112,puzgolac,Weak script and a terrible female lead,3,14 October 2021,"This movie could have been entertaining if it was an action movie, instead of trying to be smart and meaningful. The action scenes are too few and far between. Of course, you can have a great movie without action, but you need to have a good script, and that is nowhere to be found here.Butler and Grillo do pretty much nothing here until the very end. They are not great actors, so they are best in action scenes, not while trying to be smart and deep. Unfortunately the action scenes, as I said before, are too few here, so, as far as they are concerned, we have a case of two mediocre actors struggling with weak material. But the absolute worst is the obligatory strong black woman caricature, jammed in here just for the sake of ""empowerment"", ""diversity"" and ""insert the buzzword of the day here"". I don't think she is a terrible actor. In fact, it seems that she is, unintentionally, playing two different characters - a normal person and some kind of superhero ninja turtle or whatever. The thing is, when she is being a normal person, she is realistic, relatable and you find yourself rooting for her to come out on top. But, the script often insists on her being some kind of superhero and then you just want her to die. I often found myself rolling eyes at the cringe she kept throwing at the audience.The one bright point in this mess is Toby Huss. His is a great type of character for this kind of movie and he did his part brilliantly.Overall a completely skippable b movie.",Copshop

I hate to say it, but I think this potentially decent film falls prey to the insanity of wokeism running rampant through Hollywood these days. I don't have anything against minority heroes or heroines, but if a film is promoted as having Gerhard Butler as the lead protagonist tough guy, and the movie ends up making a 95-lb. Black female no-name actress the toughest cop in the shop, things become ridiculously unrealistic. I won't spoil any key plot points, but suffice it to say that it's amazing how some people can recover from gut shot wounds, and are able to accomplish spine crushing acrobatics, with no medical attention required.

The movie is also quite the nutty slaughterfest, everyone turns on everyone and so shots are fired, it's definitely a thrilling watch! Frank Grillo and Gerard Butler really don't have that much to do in the movie and the true star ends up being Alexis Louder playing officer Young. She was really good in the movie and helped root the audience in the conflict.

139,frosteliza,Poor quality Tarantino wannabe....,2,18 October 2021,"Claptrap which ticks all the boxes for political correctness.I'm a great fan of both Gerard Butler and Frank Grillo, but both are utterly wasted in this film. The script manages to kill all suspense, and has no dark humour whatsoever. You really don't care who the good or bad guys are, or what happens to them. It must have been difficult to make a film with such a decent cast and plotline boring, but it was the one thing the director succeeded in.The technical side is also appalling, featuring so many staged and unlikely gaffes it's almost funny. Or maybe it was meant to be funny, and I missed it.Bent cop pulls large gym bag out of his bottom drawer and heads for the evidence locker. Nothing suspicious there, then.Contract killer has a 300-round machine gun. Jolly useful.The heroine gets shot once in the stomach and sits around half-dead for a good portion of the movie, before suddenly springing to life and performing incredible acrobatics.On the other hand, Gerard Butler and Frank Grillo get shot multiple times and it hardly slows them down.There is completely bullet proof glass to the cells, but you can put your elbow through the armoury window.Oh, and changing the keypad code to the cells requires a write process of at least thirty seconds - twice.Most of the police seem to be toting large calibre single-shot cowboy guns. They fool around with these in a way which I personally found quite frightening by suggesting even in a movie that a police officer would do any such thing. Then they fire them one-handed, and (unsurprisingly) never hit anything. Whatever happened to the two-handed Weaver Stance? In an era when the ultra-realistic combat style of John Wick is the de-facto standard, why make something so incredibly amateurish?And the ending is absolutely ridiculous. It looks like the director changed his mind after taking the closing shot and said, ""hey guys, how about we have some love interest between the brutal contract torturer/killer and the honourable lady cop?""WARNING: just in case you think the film will be harmless fun to watch with your partner, there are some wholly gratuitous scenes of torture and violence a la Tarantino, which don't add anything to the film and further reduce my rating of it from three stars to two.",Copshop

Let me try to be objective: I've just watched 1 hour and 48 minutes of something that really wasn't able to arouse any emotion in me. Not even the fact that the charming Gerard Butler starred in this movie - here undermined by the total lack of an interesting plot. There's nothing we can engage with, in order to make the passing of time more enjoyable. The film goes on by itself, the viewer is not particularly caught by any sudden change of scene, by any turn of events.

The acting is not that good, the background is seen again and again, the storyline is poor and boring, the script has no point in its favor - how is a movie like this supposed to keep viewers interested?

Butler and Grillo are as always, enjoyable to watch. The action in this film is suprisingly very well-shot and never dull, repetitive or formulaic. The writers did a commendable job , with constant twists and information being revelead slowly, creating a tense atmosphere in the films only location. Characters are nicely developed to the point where you genuinely care what their outcome will be.

161,onefinesixtynine,Maybe I'm jaded from all the COVID era movies,9,19 October 2021,"I do believe the bar of comparison has been dropped significantly due to lack of production of higher budget films during this pandemic and I was maybe expecting this movie to follow suit despite having the talent it has employed, but I was mistaken.This movie isn't absolutely knock your socks off, it's going to win every award it qualifies for, type of flick but it is the type of movie that has enough talent in the writing arena that you don't see how it's going to turn out 15 minutes into watching it and although I could have handled Gerard Butler to have had a larger part in it, I can say that if he had to take a spot at 2nd, I don't think there could have been a better pick for the headliner than Alexis Louder. I think that even those that performed in this movie down to the smallest roles did an excellent job of acting in this movie but Alexis Louder really stood out in this one.I've seen several of her movies and I'm by no means a critic, but she never just grabbed my full attention in any of them like she demands you to do in Cop Shop. Maybe it's because she's never had the spotlight in anything I've seen her do prior to this, or maybe it's simply because she is good enough that when she's taken a part of less significance, she does such a good job of it that she doesn't just steal the show? Well whatever the reason, after this performance I assure you I'll be looking forward to seeing anything new from her, and I'll most definitely re-watch what she's already done from a different perspective now.I'm not going to spoil the movie for you, but I can say that if you're an average Joe (or Jane) like I am, you're going to really enjoy the break from reality you'll get from this one.Will it be the best movie you'll ever see in your lifetime? Most likely no, but it will keep you on the edge of your seat, and it does have the ability to exude a few emotions from it's viewers and to me that's the litmus test for a good movie because it means it's captivated the audience.Take a chance on this one for sure! You could definitely do a LOT worse at the box office right now.",Copshop

167,silke-96356,This I by far the WORST movie I have ever seen,1,5 November 2021,"I have seen many bad movies in my time, but this is by far THE worst of them all. The many twist and turns are incredibly alike, and just creates a confusing film with gigantic gaps in the over all story and especially the background stories. Everybody was just corrupt, and nothing made sense. There were so many loose ends that it wasn't even possible to keep track of which storylines were lacking or not.Is it simply not possible that cops can be THAT stupid. And how can a movie be realistic if the three main characters keep getting shot and never die. And that is another thing, I really had a hard time figuring out who was the protagonist , as all of the other seemingly irrelevant cops just die on spot, like a damn set of dominoes. I mean to invite a man inside looking at his mug shot that reads mass murderer, and exclaiming ""wow you really look like this guy in the photo"" is not funny it is simply stupid and unnecessary.Also I wasn't impressed by the camera work. The zooms in particular were very weak and and blurry. I cringed when I saw the focus.I can see how this irreverent psychopath who, out of nowhere, came in to the picture. Was supposed to be a comical relief. But it did not work. He was a terrible singer and very out of context, and it was not funny to comment on his singing skills in this terrible situation.I just feel like this was a failed attempt to combine Tarantino and die hard in a failed action comedy. Who without intention became a slapstick comedy.I was not impressed i was merely in shock of just how bad of a movie you can make.From the boring start, which could easily have been skipped. To the ludicrous ending, with a failed split screen duet.If I could rate this film under 1 star I would, and I cannot recommend wasting your money on this trash.",Copshop

Today it's either just stuffed with CGI , leaving nothing to the imagination , plots with like sizable sinkholes throughout or politics been rammed down your throat. I'm happy to conclude this film has none of that.These days when you watch a Gerrard Butler film you know exactly what you getting ,action , bit like opening up a can of baked beans.The film reminded me a bit like Assault on Precinct 13 ,meets Die HardThe action characters humour and most importantly the plot left me talking to my pal after the film walking away both hugely satisfied ,what we had just both witnessed .

178,intervulvae,It's a man's world...,10,22 October 2021,"A good progressive film, it has all of them men: overweight, slack, corrupt, white and black, even an extrovert Hispanic klutz, some sharp and tough, one superlative psychopath, hitmen, fixers but also a cute mignon with contrasting ethic, fitness and especially gender with the rest of the staff (one that seemed to be 100% masculine, immoral and hazardous).It's a man's world, lawless and chaotic that desperately needs a woman's touch or trigger. When the bullets start to fly, she's there to hold her ground and the workplace together but more importantly to send the last one of them back to its originator.The movie slowly built tension through witty and tenseful dialogues some superb camerawork, but culminated in a gory and action-packed discharge.An incendiary recommendation from this user.

183,Humboldtdda,Great Performance from Alexis Louder,8,17 September 2021,"-SPOILERS-So this is a slightly different and edgy movie. There are some plot mis-connections. There are a couple crooked police. Unclear how they tie together. Basically it is a pice station siege movie. Good action. Of the two criminals who are locked up Grillo and Butler it is really hard to figure out why each of them want the other dead. They try to link it with a murder of the States AG, but there is really some plot holes. Louder's performance really stands out. She carries the movie. It should have been better tied together. Action scenes are fun to watch. Kind of a low budget affair as other than Butler had really not seen any of the actors. Almost the whole movie takes place at the station which is a giant set. Intrigue was interesting, but the final ending really made no sense.",Copshop

It's wall-to-wall scene chewing fun and intense action.Never in my life did I think I'd recommend a Gerard Butler film but here we are.Too, this is not my typical fare.

The actors generally connect with their roles and have good comedic timing. Sometimes the acting/directing/writing could be a bit better, but it has the general feel of a well-done independent comedy. Really nice use of subtle (and not so subtle) subtext on gender and race dynamics, and it was nice to see how the story evolved its badass hero(es).",Copshop

It's like it's supposed to be a gritty thriller in a police station, but the people who made it never bothered to learn anything about police or even visit a police station. Everything in it is completely unbelievable and inaccurate, but not in a fun campy self aware way. Just in a sad b movie way. Except I'm sure it had a big budget. I have no idea how this got made.

Yea, that's what cops do on a regular basis.The police department of a little, irrelevant desert town in the middle of nowhere in Nevada apparently has a state of the art facility the size of a large corporate center in the middle of a major metropolitan area.
