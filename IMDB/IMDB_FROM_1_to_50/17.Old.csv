0,SnoopyStyle,like the idea,6,19 September 2021,"Guy (Gael García Bernal) and his family have been given an exotic resort vacation. They and other guests are brought to a secluded closed beach. Soon, they realize that the kids are growing older by years and nobody can escape.Like a lot of M. Night Shyamalan movies, he has a fascinating idea and a twist. The idea is really good. The twist explains some of the idea but in reality, it's not actually necessary. It would be more compelling to have the group stumble upon a mini Bermuda triangle from which no one can escape. As for the group, I do have an issue with them not doing everything to try to escape. They often feel stuck by their own inaction. The only one truly figuring out stuff seems to be Jarin. What got me is when Kara tries to climb out. Instead of helping, almost everyone is trying to stop her and stop Trent from joining her. First of all, one of the adults should have tried climbing before then. I also wonder why they don't try to tie together a rope or MacGyver something. The pool noodles are meant to be funny but I just wondered why that's the first time we're shown them. Then there is the passing out bit. The story yadayada a lot of that away. Nevertheless, I still like the idea. It's a fun Twilight Zone episode. M. Night continues to do the twist at the end and this one is fine. This is interesting.",Old
1,boblipton,"If All The World's A Stage, Why Do We Need A Movie Theater?",5,25 July 2021,"A bunch of tourists go to a luxury resort, and then head out to a very private beach. When they reach there, they find strange things: a couple of corpses, some wreckage, and then they begin to age physically themselves, at a rate that will have the children in the group dead of old age in 36 hours.I'm not giving any spoiler alert on this, because if you've seen the trailers, you know this already. This being an M. Night Shyamalan movie, we expect twists and turns, and mysteries within mysteries. A very good cast, including Gael Garcia Bernal, and what looked to be some very interesting prosthetic and CGI special effect offered the prospect of a movie layered like an onion.The technical side was well handled, but as to the layers of mystery, they weren't there. The script might have meditated on the seven ages of man. Instead it was more intent on cataloguing the minutiae of the situation, and asserting that being physically old increases your vocabulary and gives you a fine, philosophic attitude, even though you've only got six years of experience. This may be as you like it, but I am not interested in winning flame wars with people who insist things should be absolutely consistent in a fantasy. It's a fantasy. If your goal in life is to demonstrate that you're a better film maker than Shyamalan, then get out of your parents' basement and wangle a job in the industry. For me, the point of fantasy and science fiction are are to offer us a chance to look at a philosophic problem without considering all the messy, real-life details that clutter up a discussion, the unhappy childhood of Sauron, the whataboutism of the Elves cheating the dwarves out of their fees, so they're no better..... real life is messy, real life is complicated, real life requires constant, wary compromise, but fantasy allows us to consider matters and say ""What if"" without distraction.Except if you don't really care about the question, you're just more interested in working out how people age at a rate of 20,000:1 in detail, and winning the argument in that Reddit chat room. I sympathize. I've been there, I've done that, and I've grown up. Not just physically, but also emotionally and philosophically. Some, anyway.",Old
2,nogodnomasters,Off Limits,6,8 August 2021,"A family is vacationing at a tropical paradise resort, better than Cancun. They are offered access to a special secluded beach, just for them and as it turns out a few other folks. Once on the beach, they are kept from leaving and they are aging rapidly. As it turns out someone in every family has an illness.I liked the concept as it was new to me. For the most part the beach scenes were chaos with no one knowing what was going on, including the audience. They needed to spend more time on the ending which was anti-climatic.Guide: 1 F-word. Implied sex. Near nudity.",Old
3,kosmasp,"Help me, help ... others",7,2 August 2021,"It's funny that I read so much about a ""return"" of M. Night .. I thought his last movie had that covered. But then again, that was a few years ago, so maybe some already forgotten about that or he vanished again for them.Having said that, you have to suspend your disbelief in many regards and there still may be things that you have to swallow and not liking them. One of the biggest things I had issues with is the wife of ""Guy"". It's not so much her accent (others have one too), it is that she does not convey most of the feelings her character is going through. I understand those things, but not because of her performance, rather despite it. You may see it differently and just because I didn't like her performance here, I am not alleging that she can't act. Maybe it is a fish out of water situation - no pun intended.And then there are small things, like when the rapper uncovers ... I think it is in the trailer, but let's just say somethng truly horrific. M. Night should have taken a look at the behind the scenes material of Jaws. Spielberg had a similar scene where the boyfriend of the girl that goes skinny dipping, finds her the next morning with the Sheriff. His reaction to the finding was never satisfactory ... and the same can be said about the scene on hand here. So I am not blaming the actor - it is just a rather ""impossible"" thing to achieve. I almost started laughing at the scene - very inappropriate I know.And yet still you will say, why a 7? Because through all those things that I might find disturbing and did not like, I was able to suspend my disbelief and was able to enjoy the idea this movie is based on. I personally am surprised there are so many Youtube videos ""explaining"" the ""twist"" ending ... I do think it could not be clearer ... and I dig it overall.Of course there are themes of aging, about what our journey is, about family and other things. It's philosophical at its core - what you make of it, is totally up to you of course. But because it is Shyamalan you also will get scenes, that some may have problems with visually (shock effect wise). Think top model (I like her craziness, in the context of the movie, same is true about her husband and doctor) and you'll know what I mean by the end of ... it! Pun maybe intended.Is this predictable? Yes. Dialog and performances sometimes cringe-worthy? Also yes ... fight through it and just enjoy this for what it is. A thriller with a ""message"" (or two)",Old
4,Sleepin_Dragon,An enjoyable movie.,7,28 July 2021,"I have read several really bad reviews about this film, and the last film or two I watched from Shyamalan were average at best, but there was something about this film that I did enjoy.It flew by, it wasn't slow or dull, nor was it particularly scary, instead it relies on the primal fears many have (self included) about the ageing process, and the passing of time, if you are someone who has the slightest worry of time passing, this will resonate.The location work is awesome, and the production values are superb. Great acting throughout, it's always great to see Rufus Sewell's cheekbones.Not sure if it was my ears, but I found some of the dialogue a little muffled at times.All in all, this was good, 7/10.",Old
5,paul_haakonsen,M. Night Shyamalan strikes out again...,3,16 September 2021,"Wow. Just wow.This movie was laughably bad. There were so insanely many plot holes and things that made absolutely no sense in this movie, that it got more and more progressively difficult to take the movie seriously, much less enjoy the narrative, as the movie trotted on. I just ended up shaking my head in disbelieve throughout the course of this atrocity of a movie, and you can't help but roll your eyes at this attempt of making a mystery thriller.The storyline told in ""Old"", while it certainly had an interesting concept, just fell short of being entertaining, and it was increasingly becoming more and more of a struggle to sit through the ordeal that is ""Old"". And believe you me, this is definitely not a movie that I would recommend you rush out to spend your time, money or effort on.Sure, the acting performances in the movie were adequate, and there were some talented performers on the cast list. But they had precious little to work with in terms of a proper script, and it was restricting their performances.The character gallery in ""Old"" was interesting enough, but again, too many things just made no sense, which ended up reflecting poorly on the characters, due to some seriously inferior writing.I was lured in to watch ""Old"", given the movie's poster and its interesting enough synopsis. But with it being an M. Night Shyamalan movie, I can't really claim that I was thrilled or having much of any expectations, as I haven't exactly been a fan of his movies.""Old"" was a dud, another swing and a miss in the track record of Mr. M. Night Shyamalan.I am rating this heap of a laughable attempt at writing a mystery thriller a generous three out of ten stars. Sure, the movie was nicely produced and edited, but in terms of script, story and entertainment, this was just not cutting it.",Old
6,BandSAboutMovies,"As in, ""I'm getting too old for this...""",2,23 September 2021,"There was a time that people wanted to give M. Night Shyamalan the title of our generation's Rod Serling, but as time goes on, his films have gone from Twilight Zone to Outer Limits to Tales from the Darkside in quality and now, they hover somewhere around stories that even shows like Monsters would say, ""Well, that seems pretty bad."" Actually, I really like Monsters and feel bad associating that show with Shyamalan's output. Maybe a better example would be to imagine if Night Gallery was only the Jack Laird comedy bits and The Sixth Sense with none of Serling's contributions.To be even more honest, I feel bad dunking on Old and the works of Shyamalan, which get worse with each release and his hamfisted attempts at being a modern William Castle, like when he got SyFy to air a documentary that claimed that he died as a child and could therefore speak to the dead, suffer from a lack of aesthetics and none of the wonderful hullaballoo that Castle exhibited.So yeah - Old is not good. What did you expect? Each of his films is the very definition of something I usually love, the hijinks ensue film. Get a great concept: an island makes people prematurely age and then...hijinks ensue. But the hijinks here are pretty predictable. And while the director said that he wanted to explore the way his father saw the world through his dementia - dude, I'm dealing with that in my family right now and I don't really want to wade through it in my entertainment - I think this movie would be best experienced if you had no way of comprehending just as shallow and pointless it all is and just enjoyed the pretty pictures.The most entertaining thing about this movie would be the director's statement, which claims that this was influenced by Australian New Wave films like Walkabout and Picnic at Hanging Rock, along with The Exterminating Angel, which actually made me giggle and then get really mad. Also, throwing out Ran, Rashomon and other Japanese films is a desperate stab at ""hey I'm an artist!"" while saying you're influenced by Twilight Zone and Jaws is like saying that you enjoy drinking fluids and eating food.This story was based on the graphic novel Sandcastle which gives no answers as to why the island rapidly ages people. Of course, we needed the twist to explain it. You know, the real twist would be the director not having a twist in his next film and trying to push himself beyond the hackneyed. Here's to hoping.",Old
7,CinemaSerf,A wasted opportunity.,6,15 September 2021,"I was really disappointed with this. It's an intriguing story from M. Night Shyamalan that is really let down by some lacklustre casting and a really lousy script. A few holidaymakers are taken to a beach where they discover that not only are they trapped there, but that they begin to age rapidly too... Can they escape? Sadly, I didn't really care - the characters are pretty unremarkable, and although the setting is beautiful the rest of it is slow and dull to watch. Rufus Sewell stands out as probably the worst of the bunch, but only marginally more so than an equally out of place Gael García Bernal who really did look like he was just waiting for his cheque to arrive. The last twenty minutes could have retrieved the situation had they be handled better, but what little jeopardy - or plausibility the story had had until then just evaporated. Shyamalan ought to have enough clout nowadays to ensure his quirky and intelligent stories are better presented in terms of talent and, especially given it's his own screenplay - writing too.",Old
8,ferguson-6,M Knight keeps swinging,5,30 July 2021,"Greetings again from the darkness. THE SIXTH SENSE (1999) and UNBREAKABLE (2000) created a movie bond with filmmaker M Night Shyamalan that will always exist. In other words, I continue to go into each of his projects with hopeful expectations of another classic. Of course, some have been pretty good (SPLIT, 2016), while others are barely watchable (THE LAST AIRBENDER, 2010). His latest lands somewhere in the middle, but does feature a stunning beach setting (Dominican Republic) - one whose tropical beauty hides a sinister reality.The film's synopsis is captured in the trailer: tourists experience a mystifying and terrifying phenomenon while on a day trip to a gorgeous secluded beach. The director adapted the film from the 2010 graphic novel ""Sandcastle"", written by Pierre-Oscar Levy and Frederick Peeters. Shyamalan specializes in one thing: big and creative ideas. He is a risk-taking filmmaker, but one not always focused on execution, coherence, or details. Especially awkward here is the dialogue. None of these characters talk like real people. Lending to the awkwardness is the attention given to each character's name and occupation ... except for the kids, where age is the significant data.Due to the nature of the story (and the effects of the beach), the cast is significantly larger than the number of characters. We ride along with one family as they first approach the luxury resort. Insurance actuary Guy (Gael Garcia Bernal) and his wife, museum curator Prisca (Vicky Krieps) are vacationing with their 11 year old daughter Maddox (Alexa Swinton) and 6 year old son Trent (Nolan River). The couple clearly have a strained relationship and appear headed for a break-up. Encouraged by the resort manager to spend the day at a secret remote beach, they are joined by Charles (Rufus Sewell), a surgeon, his calcium-deficient trophy wife Chrystal (Abbey Lee), their young daughter Kara, and the doctor's elderly mother Agnes (Kathleen Chalfant). Another couple is there as well, nurse Jarin (Ken Leung) and his wife Patricia (Nikki Amuka-Bird), a psychologist. Already at the beach when they arrive is rap star Mid-sized Sedan (Aaron Pierre), replete with bloody nose and the corpse of the woman who accompanied him.It's best not to go into specifics about the progression of things for these folks on the beach, but it can be noted that they frantically try to find a way back to the resort. When all attempts prove unsuccessful, that ridiculous dialogue fills in many of the gaps for us, though you should know the science doesn't hold up ... think of it as fantasy instead. As their day at the beach moves forward, other actors take over: Alex Wolff and Thomasin McKenzie are teenage Trent and Maddox, Eliza Scanlen is Kara, and later, Emun Elliott and Embeth Davidtz become Trent and Maddox. It becomes frustrating for viewers as the professions are emphasized: Guy spouts statistics at every turn, Prisca discloses she's not a pathologist, and Patricia attempts to get everyone to bring their feelings to group. Ugh.Despite the many missteps and the overall mess of characterizations, Shyamalan (who also appears as the driver who drops them at the beach) does serve up a creative idea - one that will likely get viewers questioning their own mortality. Mental illness is addressed in a crude manner with Rufus Sewell (a fine actor) bearing the brunt of a poor script, while physical afflictions and the effects of age come off a bit better. The strange looking woman serving up custom cocktails at the resort is Francesca Eastwood (Clint's daughter), and Shyamalan's patented plot twist ending does make sense and even has a contemporary feel to it.",Old
9,morrison-dylan-fan,"""Ah, but I was so much older then,I'm younger than that now.""",8,28 July 2021,"Discussing with a friend over the phone about meeting up and catching up,we decided over the weekend to hang out and go to the cinema. Checking the listings,we were surprised to find a new M. Night Shyamalan title had just been released. Only seeing the poster before going in,we got set to experience the good old days.View on the film:Taking place in one location for 90% of the runtime, co-star/writer/directing auteur M. Night Shyamalan reunites with John Dies At The End (2012-also reviewed) cinematographer Mike Gioulakis for their third team-up, which continues to expand on Shyamalan's distinctive stylisation of placing the audience in the middle of an unfolding supernatural event, via superb, long take sweeping panning shots scanning across the beach.Shyamalan uses the sweeping shots to wonderfully draw the impression that when the characters are distracted by something for just a few moments,they turn back to the person they were talking to,and are confronted with the horrific sight of that person having rapidly aged.Whilst some of the practical effects have a rubbery bounce,Shyamalan gazes at the rapid ageing with delightful in-camera tricks, as close-ups on youthful faces transforms in arc shots,as they decades ripple away in the blue sea.Adapting Frederick Peeters's and Pierre-Oscar Levy's graphic novel, (the second time he has done an adaptation) the screenplay by Shyamalan links the group of stranded strangers together with a great expansion of his major recurring themes,from couple Guy and Prisca taking their family on a holiday as their marriage falls apart,whilst inquisitive kids delivery chewy dialogue that opens the mystery of the beach,and the surrounding ocean filled with the souls of past islanders (water as a symbol of death/rebirth being a big recurring motif in Shyamalan's works.)Coming from a family of doctors, Shyamalan gives his personal background a Sci-Fi spin,via the rapid ageing of all those on the island, being revealed to also give people the ability to heal at a fast speed.Opening the final via a paper with odd symbols/ signs on it, (continuing from the weird alien markings of Signs (2002-also reviewed)) Shyamalan unveils a peculiar,over-reaching twist ending (complete with flashbacks) on the power behind the island,which never gets old.",Old
10,FeastMode,a good addition to the shyamalan filmography,6,27 July 2021,"I went into this movie blind, which definitely made my experience better. I had a good time. It has some cool ideas and concepts that make me think. I was into it throughout. And it has some very creepy and memorable scenes. I was debating between a 6 (good) and a 7 (awesome). Gave it a 6 for now, may change it to a 7 on second viewing (1 viewing, 7/26/2021)",Old
11,wellthatswhatithinkanyway,A sad missed opportunity for Shyamalan to shine again,4,28 July 2021,"STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday MorningA group of high end holidaymakers, including teenagers Trent (Alex Wolff) and Maddox (Thomasin McKenzie) who have gone along with their parents Guy (Gael Garcia Bernal) and Prisca (Vicky Grieps), make their getaway to the exclusive resort where they hope to relax and unwind in the sparkling scenery. However, when they arrive on the beach, with fellow guests Charles (Rufus Sewell), a doctor, and his younger partner Chrystal (Abbey Lee), Patricia (Nikki Amuka-Bird) and her husband Jarin (Ken Leung) and a few others, they mysteriously start to age.........and had better get to the bottom of it.By now, the name M Night Shyamalan really should have served as a red alert to avoid at all costs. After bursting onto the screen over twenty years ago with the jaw dropping, highly original Sixth Sense, from 2002 onwards his output took a steady decline in standards, to the point where each successive film became gradually more ridiculous and nonsensical, and eventually people just couldn't be bothered any more. But something about Old, his latest offering, showed a spark of promise that had been absent for a while, another high concept production that had a spark of potential. But sadly squandered it.If I was sensing something that wasn't there, it seems the producers weren't, as the absence of any press screenings in itself should have sparked a red flag. But I gave it a go, and built up some high expectations. I really tried to get in to it, but a premise as far fetched as this first needs to establish some connection with its characters, to flesh them out a little and get under their skin. Sadly, none of them come off as anything more than cardboard cut outs, who it's impossible to care anything for, or care what happens to them. And with that massive barrier in place, the ensuing outlandish insanity of the story is further hampered in having any appeal.It would be nice one day for a director like Shyamalan, who is at least known for inspired and original ideas, to one day strike lucky again with another winner, but here's just hoping he manages to put it all together right. **",Old
12,cricketbat,An intriguing story that gets fatigued quickly & becomes a little absent-minded,5,28 July 2021,"While Old starts out with an intriguing story, the idea gets fatigued quickly and the film becomes a little absent-minded. I appreciate that M. Night Shyamalan is trying to tell original stories, but the characters in this movie didn't act or speak like normal people. It took forever for them to realize what was going on, and then they suddenly leapt to all sorts of conclusions. I prefer Shyamalan's other geriatric thriller, The Visit.",Old

14,851222,Disappointing,5,27 July 2021,"Greetings from Lithuania.""Old"" (2021) had a good premised. And its concept was also pretty interesting. First like 30 minutes were interesting and involving. And it got one or two pretty good scenes near the end on the beach (no spoilers). Other then that ""Old"" is nothing but a poorly written, sometimes laughably acted (because of bizarre and poor writing) and sadly not very well directed film. On paper i guess it sounded way better, but its unfortunately M. Night Shyamalan's job as director and writer that failed.Overall, i secretly hoped that this might me a good movie done by this once legendary director. His ""Split"" was pretty good one, but other then that he did not make a good movie since i guess his ""Signs"" in 2002 - almost 20 years, its a bit of a miracle this creator still gets to make movies but i guess as long as they are profitable that's all that matters. Unfortunately ""Old"" is not the case in terms of good film. Its not the worst
M. Night Shyamalan has ever done, but sadly that is the best i can say about it.",Old
15,nairtejas,Cool Theme Conveyance,6,26 September 2021,"I liked Old not for its horror elements (at least the very little that it has) but for its themes about aging and regrets in life, something that hit home. There may be several flaws with this weird drama but the central theme of how we take life lightly when we are aging slowly really stayed with me. Recommended.",Old
16,The-Sarkologist,"Entertaining, but not Outstanding",6,3 August 2021,"Shamaylan seems to be one of those directors whose films make money despite the fact that the critics don't seem to be all that impressed with them. Okay, he has had one massive flop, which happened to be The Last Airbender, but other than that he seems to continue to churn out films, and those films continue to make money. The other thing is that he seems to be one of those directors that has a lot more control over his films, and yeah, there are a few of them that fall into that category.I won't say that this film has a twist though, and when people do use the word twist in the film it is put in quotes. It's sort of more of a reveal, and I have to admit that it is pretty difficult to go one better than the 'Bruce Willis is a ghost' twist that pretty much left everybody gaping in The Sixth Sense. Still, it wasn't too bad, even though I can't say that I am a particularly big fan of his films.So, the story is about a family that goes on a vacation to an island resort, and the owner of the resort suggests that they go on a trip to a secluded beach. However, they aren't the only ones that are going to the beach, and when they get there they discover that things don't seem to be all that great, particularly since they discover a body, and then an elderly lady with them just dies. What becomes apparent though is that people seem to age much faster than normal, and I note that there is a mention that the reason they have a lot of food is because there are children with them.I'm not sure how I would categorise this film, though Shamalyan does like his supernatural thrillers. I don't necessarily want to call them horror though because they don't seem to fall into that category, even though I consider horror films to be much more than your typical hack and slash/blood and gore type films that people seem to equate with horror (which I actually don't consider to be horror films, but that is just me).Anyway, it isn't particularly bad, but I wouldn't be putting it up there amongst some of my favourite films, though I do have to admit that I did like the premise - to an extent. I guess the thing that I did have an issue with was that the children, while physically ageing, also seemed to not only mentally age, but also gain knowledge as well - namely with being able to communicate as an adult as opposed to being an adult, but talking as a child. I guess the reason this irritated me is because language, and communication, happens to be a learned trait, not something that is biological that develops as one physically develops. Still, other than that, it wasn't bad.",Old

19,cruise01,Unsettling mystery thriller that will leave you guessing.,8,24 July 2021,"4 out of 5 stars.Old is a good thriller film and one of M. Night Shyamalans better films. Which his films are hit and miss with its direction. Old is a hit film. Has a mystery plot. Thrills and themes with a message of time being against us.The plot follows a group of people on a vacation. Going to a resort where they all visit a hidden beach. Which gives them the luxury and beautiful beach. Only until they discover that they are aging at a rapid pace. The kids are growing rapidily. The adults aging. While they have trouble escaping the beach which they black out and end up back at the beach. They cant swim or climb the rocks surrounding the beach without blacking out. The group try to solve the mystery on what the connection is that they have in common. And how are they aging.Good thriller. The cinematography is great. Capturing the beautiful landscape and shocking tone the characters have. The music score is good. The cast ensemble is great. The twist ending is not that bad. Which did not disappoint like M. Nights other films.It does have an interesting concept without going into spoiler territory. And leaving a bit of mystery with the characters connection and the beach. The theme of people not having enough time to spend it with there loved ones was also good.I will say the only negative thing about the movie is it does have a shallow ending that does not feel satisfying.Overall, a good thriller thats worth seeing.",Old
20,zkonedog,Some Very Interesting Themes Completely Undone By Sometimes Laughably Bad Execution,4,2 August 2021,"M Night Shyamalan is one of the most difficult Hollywood directors to figure out. His resume boasts some all-time classics (The Sixth Sense, Signs, The Village), but is also plagued by some all-time stinkers (After Earth, The Happening, The Last Airbender). It often feels like one never quite knows what they are going to get walking into a Shymalan picture. Unfortunately, ""Old"" falls much more firmly into the latter category as opposed to the former. While filled with great concepts, this latest M Night joint is almost hilariously bad on the execution front.For a very basic overview, ""Old"" sees a husband (Gael Garcia Bernal), wife (Vicky Krieps), and two children (Nolan River & Alexa Swinton) stumble upon a strange beach while vacationing. On this beach, the aging process seems to be sped up, rendering an entire life cycle in the span of mere hours. Seemingly unable to escape, the family--along with others--must work to find answers before the clock quite literally runs out on all of them.In terms of the ""seed idea"" for this film, it is a doozy. Easily the best in a Shyamalan movie since his heyday of the early 2000s. There are interesting themes (aging, parenting, puberty, etc.) at nearly every turn here just waiting to be brought to the surface.Alas, none of that potential is realized. Instead, ""Old"" plays out like a rather cheap, predictable, & often bland thriller. It technically hits all the beats it should, but with none of the emotion that should be present. Shyamalan is far too focused on the ""what is going on?!"" of it all when the character journeys should have been first and foremost.Only making matters worse is the fact that none of the auxiliary components are anything to write home about. The soundtrack/score didn't wow me, the acting is just okay, and the visuals are more played for cheap thrills (one scene in particular is utterly laughable) than anything substantive.Of course, one can't critique a Shyamalan flick without mentioning the twist ending. That is certainly present here, and actually not half bad as those things go, but even that is wasted when the film extends 10 minutes beyond it. End right at the twist, and ""Old"" might jump up a star for me.Overall, though, ""Old"" is a pretty hollow ""thriller"" when all is said and done. It ends up being a sort of ""worst of both worlds"" situation for Shyamalan. It isn't nearly up to the par of his earlier works, while it also lacks the focus of more contemporary efforts like ""The Visit"" or ""Split"". Just a generic--bordering on bad--romp.",Old

Night Shyamalan films, life really is like a box of chocolates in that you just genuinely don't know what you're going to get.There's the oh so sweet (The Sixth Sense), the decent (Split) and then there's some real sour taste flavors (The Happening/The Last Airbender) that make the topsy turvey director one of the most unpredictable working in the Hollywood system.Going about things his own way over the last few years with self-financed low budget projects that can turn a profit with the smallest of success, Shyamalan does what he has rarely done in his career previously by here stepping away from his own material too adapt graphic novel Sandcastle that was created by Pierre-Oscar Lévy and Frederick Peeters, creating one of the strangest and most jaw-dropping Hollywood films you're likely to catch at the cinema this year in the form of Old.Rounding up a cast loaded with A-grade talent if not exactly household names, Shyamalan takes his stacked ensemble to a secluded beach that one first step onto its shores appears to be sometime of island paradise but is anything but as our collection of hotel guests quickly discover that the beach they are trapped on is one where years pass by in minutes as they race a raging biological clock before they turn to bones and dust.A hybrid of a meditative drama on aging that has significant thriller and horror moments, Old holds within it the very best and very worst of Shyamalan the filmmaker (including a significant role Shyamalan gives himself, instead of one of his regular cameos) with some moments of this film easily Razzie worthy with others genuinely disturbing and memorable creating a frustrating experience that is always engaging in its unpredictability but one that flounders too often to be considered close to good in the true sense of the word.An easily identifiable flaw too the film that rears its head far too often is Shyamalan's suspect script.Dealing with some scenes that even the most respected of directors would struggle to bring to life confidently (honestly some scenes in this film are beyond description), Shyamalan and his cast, that is best lead by Bernal in a rare Hollywood leading man role and Alex Wolff getting to play a 6 year old turned teenage boy, can't always get the audience on board with what the characters in Old are dealing with or how they go about dealing with it and while you'll often be unnerved and on edge, you wish more of the film had managed to gel together in a more finely tuned manner.As is often the case with a Shyamalan film, the film that lays before us lives and dies on its finale and that's another aspect of Old that will be up for debate for some time as while in some ways it makes what has happened before it make more sense, there's a lot of unanswered questions and suspect flippancy that does make you wish for a more shocking and water cooler worthy explanation.Final Say -You've never seen a film like Old before making it an intriguing offering but there's too much here that doesn't work and feels half-explored to make this latest Shyamalan ride something special.2 1/2 rusty knives out of 5.",Old
22,southdavid,Son of a Beach,5,27 July 2021,"This is going to be a tough review to do, as I prefer my reviews to be spoiler free. Generally, I don't think I recommend ""Old"" - though there are some aspects of the film that I did like.Three families arrive on a secluded private beach organised by the resort that they are staying at. Having been there only a short while, several unnatural situations begin to occur. One, they cannot leave the beach, either by walking back through the caves that brought them there, or by swimming away and two, they have all started aging rapidly. This means that the children age from 8 to 15 in just a couple of hours, but for the adults this means they'll live the whole remainder of their lives on their beach today.With the positives first, I really liked the cinematography of the film and the audio work. There are these wonderful spinning 360-degree visuals, and shots that focus on one character perfectly whilst the camera is moving. If this is what you get from Shyamalan shooting on film stock then he shouldn't ever go back to digital work. There are stereo audio tricks too, with conversations drifting in and out focus as characters move through the scene.But technically is, for me, the only place the film really excels. For a few moments, I thought that the film was going to resemble Darren Aronofsky's ""mother!"" in that the trappings of the movie would ended up being an allegorical tale for life itself and had the movie ended with that, I think I'd have been happier with it. As it is, the film rumbles of for another twenty minutes of reveals that don't stand up to much scrutiny and undermined what the film might have been.It's surprisingly chaste for its 15 certificate, with only one scene really revelling in the body horror that could have been a lot more prevalent, and I thought several of the performances weren't great. I normally don't like to highlight performances I didn't enjoy but Vicky Krieps, as matriarch Prisca, is a particularly notable miscast.As I'm sure you can tell from the other reviews, it's a really divisive film. Personally, though it's certainly got some technically fine moments, it's a twist too far.",Old
23,jtindahouse,"Original, great characters and beautifully shot",7,26 July 2021,"I think the thing I love most about M. Night Shyamalan is that every one of his films always feels so unique and original. Rarely do you ever watch his films and find yourself thinking you've seen this a hundred times before. 'Old' is another case of that. No movie in 2021 or later is ever going to be entirely original, however even if similar things have been done before there is a way to put your own stamp on them and make them yours. Shyamalan is great at that.The characters in this movie are the strongest thing it has going for it. They are brilliantly written and equally well performed. Real time is take in particular with the main family to make us fall in love with them before things kick into gear and the proverbial hits the fan. Also there is no one in Hollywood who can cast child actors the way Shyamalan can. He nails it every single time. Not only are the kids in 'Old' not in any way annoying, they are a treat to watch.This is also a beautifully shot film. I'm not someone who notices camera angles and creativity in that department until something special is done, and I found myself noticing a lot of things in this movie. The only criticisms I could find were occasionally the dialogue gets a little simple and unworthy of a movie. Also there's a fair amount of logic leaps you have to take - that was always to be expected with a story like this though to be fair. Otherwise however, this is another Shyamalan film in his career he can be well proud of. 7/10.",Old

And keep an eye out for the resort driver, it's M. Night in his Alfred Hitchcock style cameo. Gael & Vicky are a married couple that vacation at a resort with their 2 kids-5 & 6 year olds. It's a tropical island and their hotel manager tells them about a secluded beach-where most tourists do not go-that is perfect for them. A few other tourists go along, including Rufus, but once they get there, strange things start happening. Such as their kids start growing at a rapid pace-they all are actually getting older, but they notice the kids first. Alex plays their 5 year old son, all grown up in a matter of hours. They try going back the way they came to get off the beach but they start getting headaches and black out. Same thing for swimming or any other attempts to leave the beach. What is causing this? Don't worry, there is an explanation given. I read that M.

26,kevin_robbins,I'd rate this his absolutely worst movie to date,6,2 August 2021,"Old (2021) is a movie the Mrs and I caught in theatres last week. The storyline follows a group of tourists that are dropped off by their hotel shuttle at a ""private beach."" Shortly after arriving at the beach they realize they can't leave while more and more people keep getting dropped off. Over very short amounts of time everyone on the beach rapidly ages. They try to uncover a way off the beach and why this is happening. This movie is directed by M. Night Shyamalan (Signs) and stars Rufus Sewell (Dark City), Gael García Bernal (The Motorcycke Diaries), Vicky Krieps (Hanna) and Abbey Lee (The Neon Demon). The storyline for this had so much potential. There was just too many inconsistencies with character development and subplots. There are a bunch of characters in this...about three of them are well written. The rest are irrelevant and factor little into the plot. There's some awesome special effects in this and circumstances that make you cheer as they unfold...just very well done. But the premise gets old and many conversations on the beach drag and make you groggy and want to fall asleep. The premise just could have been executed better. The conclusion does contain another ""ah-ha moment,"" as you'd expect from Shyamalan, but was it enough to make the movie good? I didn't think so.

27,alindsay-al,An Above Average Interesting Film,6,27 July 2021,"It has come that time that very unique director M. Night Shyamalan returns to the horror genre with Old and I went and watched it today and here is my review for it. The premise of the film sees a group of people sent to a beach where time moves differently and people start to age at a faster rate.Main Character
There are a lot of characters in this film but I would say the two main are two parents played by Gael Garcia Bernal and Vicky Krieps and they are both fine in their roles. There is plenty of challenges for them as actors in the film and they do the best they can with it and what I am going to say next isn't really a slate on them but the film in general. There characters just aren't that interesting, they are pretty bland and generic which makes it hard to care as much as the two performers try their best it just falls flat in the end.Supporting Characters
As said above this is a large cast of characters and what I will say about them is similar to what I said about the main characters. Thomasin McKenzie is a young actress with a growing reputation and she continues that here with a solid performance that makes you care about her character. Alex Wolff is similar, he moves away from comedy for a serious role here and he does it pretty well. I thought the best performance came from Rufus Sewell as a doctor, he truly portrayed just how mad the beach can make these people and how vulnerable can be despite having a high standing in society. But the rest of the cast does very little for me, there is like 10 people on the island and half of them are uninteresting and you are kind of just sat there awaiting to see there fate. Maybe the amount of people could have been lessened in order to give the characters greater depth.Story
The film's story has a lot of intrigue towards its story, mainly with trying to work out what is exactly going on and how it will affect these different people. The film kept my attention pretty much throughout the film and I wanted to just find out what exactly was gonna happen next. But I think this film's ending doesn't hit the levels that they wanted it to and after a good 90 mins or a bit longer it left me with a bit of a disappointing feeling.Script
The script is okay, it is a very serious film which is fine and usually that drama was handled well enough to build the intrigue and mystery into what was going on. Though I felt like this film had some really on the nose dialogue that left me shaking my head and if you see the movie you will know what I mean.Style
The films style is easily the best part of the film. It was chilling and mysterious and was more of a thriller then a straight up horror which is ideal for me. There are few jump scares and tension is built naturally and really cleverly with great sound design and camera work that felt very unique and immersive.Overall
Overall, Old is an above average film. It does a good job in what it aimed too, it is a mysterious and unsettling film that just misses the mark a bit for me but there will be people out there that will love it so if you like the sound of the film then I would suggest giving it a go despite the slightly lower rating.",Old

Maybe she did the film out of loyalty or as a favor, but it was a colossal mistake for her career.

I'm enjoying Shyamalan's Resurrection & feel these smaller & more shocking stories are what he likes to tell more anyway. These are lower budget films that often feel like they're apart of a spooky Anthology or something & i like that.Anyway, Old is a fascinating Thriller about a vacationing family on a beautiful tropical island that find a secret & secluded beach that is full of terrifying mystery. I definitely got an old fashioned 70's survival horror feel when watching this & i liked the mix of different characters all trapped together in a scary situation. The situation is that beautiful secluded beach has a terrifying ability to speed up the victims lifes all the way until OLD.The acting is good from all involved but no one really stands out & they didn't need to as it's an ensemble piece with a bunch of panicking vacationers & it's a solid & unsettling mystery.The thought of getting old is scary in a way as we have no control over that or dying & that makes is terrifying in my opinion but at the same time it's nice to make it to an old person.There's some shocking scenes but i won't spoil it.Old is a good mystery Thriller even if it's no Masterpiece, it's a good Shyamalan movie & feels like apart of a paranoia-horror-thriller set of films with The Happening & The Visit.",Old
34,kluseba,Interesting premise but average execution,6,31 July 2021,"Old is the most recent mystery thriller by controversial director M. Night Shyamalan. It is loosely based upon a Swiss graphic novel that was offered as a gift by one of his daughters. The story revolves around a group of tourists that rapidly age on an isolated beach they cannot escape.The premise of the movie with its intriguing story is quite promising and will keep you watching until the very end. This film doesn't leave any questions unanswered. The atmosphere of the film is tense and gripping. The cinematography is great as Shyamalan can experiment with interesting camera angles and rotations.However, the story itself is rather predictable and the twist in this story isn't a surprising one. The acting performances are at times wooden as this is especially the case for Abbey Lee and Aaron Pierre. Some dialogues are grammatically incorrect and would have requested some proof-reading.At the end of the day, Old is worth to be watched once at your local cinema but it's overall an average film that will soon be forgotten.

They first notice it as the ageing process is more apparent in children but soon a elderly woman dies. Attempts to escape are baffled as they are repulsed by a gap in the cliffs and strong currents. People age two years for each passing hour. While there are a couple of jump shocks the horror here is mostly of a psychological nature, as existential terror spreads amongst them, children become adults, paranoid schizophrenia leads to murder (some violence here). Some good performances from an ensemble cast, especially Rufus Sewell as a demented doctor. Some of the usual tropes do crop up, they all found out about the resort accidentally and the resort manager promises them that it's a special beach (warning bells!).

Things on the outside seem to be going well but a rift in the marriage (Krieps has a medical condition) seems to spell imminent divorce (as gathered by the eavesdropping spawn in their hotel room). Once at the beach, the good times soon dry up as the guests, especially the children are eating constantly (a large food basket was provided by the resort) & some of the latent conditions of the guests start to become more acute which turns out they're all aging at an accelerated rate (the kids are the most obvious as all the young kids on the beach soon become teenagers w/Thomasin McKenzie, Alex Wolff & Eliza Scanlen now playing the older children) due to some radiation the property seems to be emitting. As it appears escape looks impossible (every time someone tries to walk away from the beach or swim to safety, they black out w/some dying in their trying) the dwindling numbers have to deal w/advanced health issues; Krieps goes deaf, Bernal blind w/the worse case falling on Rufus Sewell, a doctor now undergoing obvious loss of his mental faculties causing him to be violent & his wife, played by Lovecraft Country's Abbey Lee, who develops a debilitating loss of bone density. When the obvious twist at the end of the film is revealed, it isn't enough to capsize the narrative but some poky & awkward dialogue exchanges hurt more than they help.

40,Reviews_of_the_Dead,"Interesting Concept and Premise, Bit Too Heavy with Message",8,4 August 2021,"This was a movie that I caught a commercial for. Since I don't watch trailers and realized this was a new M. Night Shyamalan movie, I knew that I would seek it out. This is one Jaime came with me to the theater to see as well. Aside from that, I came in blind just knowing what the title was and getting ideas from that. The synopsis is a family on a tropical holiday discovers that the secluded beach where they are relaxing for a few hours is somehow causing them to age rapidly, reducing their entire lives into a single day.For this movie, we are in a tropical location. Guy (Gael García Bernal) along with his wife Prisca (Vicky Krieps) and their two children are on vacation. Their daughter is Maddox (Alexa Swinton) and son is Trent (Nolan River). She has a good singing voice, but a bit self-conscious and he has a thirst for knowledge. The family arrives at the resort they are staying at. The man running the place is played by Gustaf Hammarsten. He is aided by Madrid (Francesca Eastwood).While there, we get to meet some of the other key people. Charles (Rufus Sewell) is a doctor that is there with his wife of Chrystal (Abbey Lee), his mother Agnes (Kathleen Chalfant) and daughter Kara. There is also a male nurse Jarin (Ken Leung) with his wife of Patricia (Nikki Amuka-Bird). She has issues with epilepsy. Trent and Maddox also meet the nephew of the resort manager Idlib (Kailen Jude).Things aren't going as well for this family as it seems. Prisca has a tumor. It is believed to be benign, but it is still stressful. Their marriage is struggling as well and they're heading for a divorce. This really seems to the last time they'll do something like this as a family.The next day, the resort manager greets them at breakfast. He inquires what they plan on doing for the day and he suggests them going to a nearby secluded beach. He states he doesn't tell everyone about it. The family agrees and they meet in the van. Also joining them is Charles and his family. It should be pointed out; they are driven there by Shyamalan himself.When they arrive there, they realize they aren't alone. The previous night we saw a man there with a woman. He is a famous rapper by the name of Mid-Sized Sedan (Aaron Pierre) that Maddox recognizes. They soon realize there is something up with this beach. Patricia and Jarin join them. It is around then they learn that the woman Mid-Sized Sedan was with is found dead. Charles doesn't trust him and holds him at knife point. It gets even weirder when all the children aged 5 years in a matter of a couple of hours. They aren't the only ones getting older either.That is where I'm going to leave my recap of the movie to get you up to speed without spoiling. Where I want to start is that I'm glad to see Shyamalan back on track for me. His last three movies have been solid. Not up to where he was earlier in his career, but that was a decent run there. Moving from there, this movie has an interesting premise. I'm a sucker for movies with time travel and this one is doing something a bit different. This beach is isolated from everything around it with rocks. For whatever reason, there is a natural phenomenon that is causing anything on it to age rapidly. I think it does well to explain why fingernails and hair isn't growing older, it is just living cells. It also makes sense that children would show aging faster since we get to a certain look as an adult and we are there for a while. I'm on board with this.Where I want to shift next would be how our characters are kept here. Any time they try to walk back through the rock path, they get dizzy and lightheaded. Anyone that tries to swim away runs into a similar issue. There is a comment about this beach and potentially being submerged underwear at some point. This is brought up as it is like trying to come up from under the water too fast. The pressure is too much and it has physical effects. These rocks surrounding them are high and whatever is causing this, is trapping them as well. I think this is a good enough explanation without giving too much for me.The last part of the story that I want to discuss, but also trend lightly to avoid spoiling the movie. Trent notices that someone is watching them. Now if you know me, I'm a big fan of social commentary in my movies. This movie has a shift near the end to explain why things are being done here that feels a bit too heavy handed. I get the reasoning. It is something that makes me question as it is for the good of others. This feels like Shyamalan being a bit too much like Hitchcock by having a reveal followed by an information dump. I don't hate it, but it also doesn't work as well as I think he wanted.That is enough for the story, so I'll go over to the acting. I thought that Bernal and Krieps were fine. If I have any issues with their actions or things they do, it is with the writing. I should slide in here that it gets a bit awkward at times. I do have to blame Shyamalan here as I think he is trying to be too witty and too smart. Sewell is good. There is a reveal to his character as to why he is here that I liked. He plays such a good villain. Alex Wolff and Thomasin McKenzie play Trent and Maddox when they're older. I thought they were both good. Lee, Amuka-Bird, Leung, Pierre, Eastwood and Hammarsten are all solid along with the rest of the cast. I did want to state it was interesting to see cameos by Embeth Davidtz and Emun Elliott as well. I won't reveal who they are though.I think the last parts to go into would be the cinematography, effects and soundtrack. For the former, it is good. I could tell watching this that it was a Shyamalan movie. He can craft his shots in interesting ways. There was one time that I think he went a bit too artistic with it, but I'm not going to hold it against the movie. As for the effects, I think they are solid for the most part. The framing helps here, especially when a reveal happens that people have gotten older. There are some subtle things done here that worked. There is a moment though with character where CGI was used that didn't look good. I liked the idea, but not the execution per say. The soundtrack also worked and fit for what was needed.So then in conclusion here, I'll double down that I think Shyamalan is back on track. There is an interesting premise here and I think we are given just enough to explain it without going too far. I like seeing the struggle of our characters on this beach and how things play out. I will admit though, there is social commentary that feels forced in at the end that I didn't love. The acting was solid across the board. Cinematography was well done and there was only a moment of CGI that didn't sit well with me. For me, this movie is an above average movie overall.My Rating: 7.5 out of 10",Old
41,rgkarim,Starting To Show His Old Quality Of Work,7,24 July 2021,"LIKES:Unique:
The graphic novel laid the groundwork, and this film is certainly off the wall horror from what we usually get. Old's concept of life moving through the span of a day and the terror that comes with each passing minute is a story we often do not get. It's a new perspective on familiar concepts, and seeing the reactions, terror, and race against the clock in an attempt to get past this mystery made for an intriguing concept that bypasses most of the usual tropes we get these days with this genre.The Setting:
Horror movies often involve trekking into some insane area or performing some ritual to bring the horror to life. Old however decides to bypass this trend and just make a typical place like a private beach a trap to ensnare our poor families and unleash the curse it holds. Such a safe setting is off putting, and given the filters used, it adds that haunting desolate environment that helps add to the horror. Narrow strips of land and cove serving as a temporary safe harbor almost made me feel isolated with them, a powerful factor to help up the creep factor.The Make Up/Effects:
The premise is spelled out for you in the trailers, the characters get older over a short course and to make those effects comes to life requires some magic on Hollywood's part. Once more, I tip my hats to the departments, because the gradual aging of the adult cast is fantastically outlined in the prosthetic pieces and digital aging that technology can bring. Slight editions of wrinkles, emphasis of bone structures, maturing bodies and surprised anatomy changes have some impressive attention to detail to give that realistic sheen. The bizarre time lapses of certain influences on the body are very dramatically portrayed, but it's a level that feels very real and terrifying which is what I believe he was going for. I can say that I do also like how well the casting directors managed to recruit similar looking individuals to represent the various age groups, a challenge that can be quite daunting and they delivered quite well on.The Mystery:
We know they are getting Old, but the questions that stuck with me through the movie of how and why were a big part of keeping me engaged in the film. The island holds some type of secret and my eyes and ears were hunting for clues to try and uncover what could be done against this anomaly. Shyamalan's writers did a great job building clues and some foreshadows in to direct the fate of the group, and within the simplistic dialog is a means to discover what is going on. Small details are crucial to solve the case early, but trying to find the answers is almost as engaging as how they will escape this nightmare.The Censorship:
A movie in this genre with these twists can sometimes lead to some grueling moments that scar one's eyes, mind, and psyche. Somehow though, they did a good job of hitting all the concepts promised in the movie without giving too much away. The kids growing into adults could have been revealing and dishonorable to watch, but respectful angles and short time on the subjects maintained their dignity. How did one of the group magically become pregnant (as seen in the trailer), well there is an explanation, just one you don't see on camera. Even some of the outcomes that befall the people have been reduced to background noise or cutaways, helping to not be too disturbing for younger teens that may venture into this picture. In this regards it gets points for helping to push the envelope too much in this adult concept.A Complete Ending:
Shyamalan's endings sometimes can dethrone the whole movie, when the revelation turns out to be a letdown or the ending finishes vague. I'm here to say that while not the most earth shattering finale, Old does at least tie everything together and give you a complete tale with a finish. While the comic book's vague ending helps drive that punch on the morals this movie teachers, this film carries that same moral teaching punch, but just allows one closure and not guessing what will happen next. And more importantly, it gives you all the answers you were searching to solve if you had not figured out the puzzle. In addition, it's near the end that all the lessons of the movie come to heart and I liked what it had to teach for those that like to reflect on their movie content.DISLIKES:Predictable:
Outside of the reveal of the reasons why this beach is used, most of the movie is a predictable mess, even if you have not seen all the spoilers in the trailer. The dialogue alone will steer you into many things, and again paying attention will reveal just what may end up being the primary weakness and endgame of a character. Shyamalan's writing really has little to prove, and he is pulling his familiar tactics out that are familiar, but yet again old hat and telling.The Acting All Other Times:
The Movie again has a lot of impressive features, but sadly much of the adult acting sort of feels off for me as the movie progresses. Many of the adults feel a little illogical and stupid at times, hysteria that feels like it waivers between belief and not quite committed. I don't know if it was the dialogue that felt a little out of place, as the movie progressed and their maturity increased though, the performances matured as well and was the cream of the crop. Still for nearly two hours of semi-okay acting.... I had expected moreThe Inconsistency Of Events At time:
Old starts out establishing rules and seeing the balance of immature and mature, but those rules kind of go out the window about halfway through. You might say it's because they are maturing, and I'll give you that answer partially, but some of the consistency rules were starting to go out the window a little too easily. Trent's handling of things going from tantrums to suddenly logical was more of an eye roll moment for me and the same with Cara given how immature when she hit the teenage years only to become wicked smart mere minutes later. I get that time is not on their side, but I don't think they would have had enough experience to make such transitions.Too much Censorship?This is tough to write, but perhaps at times some of the censorship got in the way of the full effects of the movie. Several big factors that the trailer points out have given you the whole scene and having the time lapses occur super-fast But by hiding some of the details, I think the horror effect may have been diluted a bit too much for those true horror seekers, though again a sigh of relief on certain elements.The Pacing:
I think the thing that really threw me off was indeed the pacing that most reviewers have stated as the key killer to this movie. It's slow definitely, lost in dialogue with a lot of back and forth exchanges that while realistic is a bit overzealous and the repetitious nature of it got stale. This let's up a bit as thing progress, but at that point it becomes a lot more waiting and meandering around than anything else. The last fourth of the movie manages to break through the slog when they actually start looking for answers and closure, but then takes a few unnecessary side tracks that seem to be sort of afterthoughts. Their simple exchanges, while cute, lack any real purpose and the sudden change in approach is a bit boring and a stretch given how things were progressing. Overall, the runtime was fine, but I think the movie needed to figure out which way to tell the story and stick with it than jumping as it seemed to do.The VERDICT:
Shyamalan's storytelling is still as layered and misleading as he likes to try to accomplish and in this movie, some of his original magic is starting to show up once again. Old is unique, an intriguing concept that comes with moral reassessments and a feeling that will stick under your skin. It uses good camera techniques and makeup to really sell the concept and with some creepy tones and well placed acting it succeeds at times of creeping the audience out. However, the movie still is not quite as well executed as the champion films that he has directed in.The VERDICT:

The acting does not quite feel up to par for a nearly two hour movie, and the actors seem lost in direction and interest in writing that is a bit lacking. Inconsistency in the rules helps sort of take away from some of the engaging elements that I liked in the early part of the film, but really it's the pacing that sort of amplifies these moments and drags them out further. Still with a nice complete punch and those other elements this movie turned out not as bad as I feared it would be given his track record, and think it is worth a view at home over the theater.My scores are:Drama/Mystery/Thriller: 7.0

42,burlesonjesse5,VIEWS ON FILM review of Old,4,2 August 2021,"In 2021's Old, the ""old"" refers to vacationers aging like mad via a remote beach in the Dominican Republic (where Old was shot). It's a creepy premise that Old fumbles profusely. Yup, this film could've been so much more (more meaning compelling).So yeah, Old is a thriller that takes the cheap route on a budget of $18 million. With ripen timelines all askew, you never see the stranded characters really age except for 2-3 children. That's because they are replaced by older-looking troupers every half hour or so (the makeup department was obviously on holiday).Old is directed by twist monger and Spielbergian ripper, M. Night Shyamalan. Ever since he found success with The Sixth Sense, Shyamalan has been able to make his brand of movie for the past 20 years. Most of his stuff has been misses while little of his stuff has been hits (I for sure dug Split). M. Night peaked at The Sixth Sense and that's what you call an early peak.With Old, Shyamalan forgets his craft as he comes off like a dude that never helmed a flick before. The camerawork is the main culprit as M. Night shoots with sloppy angles and well, unnecessary whips and pans. The rhythms of the actors suffer due to this and the daft script makes them seem pretty unlikable. What's left is the surprise ending and Shyamalan sadly has that printed in every contract.Old's gotcha conclusion is interesting but it also leaves a couple questions unanswered. I suppose that's why Shyamalan ends Old more than once because he's not confident the audience knows where things are fully headed. Bottom line: Old is a hack job for M. Night Shyamalan who once was hailed as the next Hitchcock. When he makes yet another cameo in Old, you realize this guy is just ""long in the tooth"".",Old

44,vengeance20,Unique Thriller,7,23 July 2021,"Having seen a trailer I was hooked & intrigued as to what this film was going to be like!The film follows a group of people who go to a holiday resort which then leads them to a beautiful, tranquil beach. But something is up with the beach & it is then when people start to age rapidly, that things start to really go off the rails!I found the film to be pretty unique & good! While not amazing, it is a decent enough of a watch & does keep you guessing as the viewer as to what is happening & how the next part of the film will progress, never mind how it will end!While there's a couple of dull boring moments here & there the film does like I said, keep you guessing & the conclusion to the film I think was pretty satisfying! The idea & concept of the film are good & while it seems to be one of those ""sounds good on paper"" types, it's overall a good horror/thriller film!I'd recommend a watch of this!7/10.",Old
45,begob,Time's up!,5,27 September 2021,"Newly arrived at a mysterious holiday resort, a family accepts a special invite to a remote beach, where time starts to play tricks ...Big concept, well set up. The characters are smoothly introduced to the scenario, and the story lays a trail of clues with a light touch. Like Spielberg, MNS has a lot of empathy for child characters, so we get engaging scenes where the boy makes friends and the girl feels the pressure of being outside the circle of her tanned and fit peers.The cinematography has an interesting range of moves to create mystery and tension - a good example is when the kids play tag on the beach, one of them having to stay still while everything around is in motion. The sound design is thoughtful, but the score is over-dramatic, and it really does get laid on heavy as the story begins to flail about for meaning.At about forty minutes there's an overhead shot of characters waking up on the sand, and I think that's the moment everyone realizes ... the director doesn't really know where he's going with this, does he? I'm not sure why the concept goes loop-the-loop like an untied balloon, but I know that a story-teller who messes with time better have a clear idea to get from start to finish. Instead, the actors have to endure fake character confrontations and the overpiling of corpses, while the audience is subjected to some ludicrous shenanigans to wind things up.Apart from the ghost of Bruce Willis, the only convincing thing MNS has put together is The Visit, and that worked because the concept was plausible in the real world. Taking on Time itself is way too much of a stretch when all you have is, ""Wouldn't it be cool if ...""Overall: A pitch too far.",Old

47,arungeorge13,Shyamalan desperately needs the services of a dialogue-writer [+48%],5,24 September 2021,"I'll give it to Shyamalan for his innovative one-line ideas, some of which translate well onto the screen. Old boasts an original concept and sumptuous cinematography (by Mike Gioulakis), but the writing and performances fail to see it through. Once the ageing aspect is set in motion, the film loosens its grip on the viewers, eventually settling for a tame finale. The characters fail to connect due to their weak portrayals and artificial-sounding dialogue.The beachy location is indeed a treat for sore eyes. I cannot get enough of listening to waves in the background, and this film proved to be an unexpected respite in that regard. Getting old fast is a scary notion when you actually give it some thought. But in the movie, it is told in such a way that the science-fiction aspects come second to convenient plot holes. The climactic twist also doesn't land well. Old is ultimately a forgettable fare.P. S - Can we stop killing Eliza Scanlen in every movie? Like, seriously.",Old

51,antoniotierno,Creepy and as usual bit disappointing,7,16 August 2021,"As always, Shyamalan excels in creating and pushing an unsettling atmosphere, filled with tension, suspense, dread and lot of fear. However, Old could lack an motional introspection about human mortality, save for a fleeting moment of reconciliation between Bernal and Krieps.The gallery of disposable characters are also about as fully realised as those in a B-grade story, so we are never fully invested in their eventual fate. All in all it works but it's not the best story ever seen and told by the director.",Old

The environment is heaven like, high level of nature, realistic like typical vacation, but with many twists, holes, and unpredictable and weird things. Still leaves lot of questions unanswered and unrealistic. Nice makeup, intro, and symbolic message I think this movie is trying to give us. It is either about anomaly of corona virus pandemic or other smaller anomalies like pick pocketing that happens on the beach, mental disorders possible cause and solution, corruption in work world, etc.",Old
53,gedikreverdi,It could have been such a suspenseful and scary movie with another director,5,23 September 2021,"So they claimed to be kids that has grew older in the beach and everyone believed them right away and arrested everyone at the hotel?The biggest problem is of course it's a film directed by Shamalayan and the second one is the bad actors especially the mother because she sounds like she's reading all the time. Also, apparently they tried so hard to keep it PG-13 and it didn't workout without the gore. The good things about the movie are the location as the beach and the cliffs looked really good and it definitely could have been a lot scarier and suspenseful. Death of the woman that has a calcium-deficiency disease was really impressive. She got disfigured in the caves as her bones healed instantly in a bad way. But the idea overall is good so I rated it 4 for the sake of the source material.The siblings swam to the coral reef and saved themselves because the kid at the hotel gave the boy a secret message.

The cinematography by Mike Gioulakis is gorgeous. The visual effects are impressive. The performances are the highlight of the film. Gael Garcia Bernal is spectacular as Guy. Vicky Krieps is excellent as Prisca. Rufus Sewell is brilliant as Charles. Alex Wolff is great as Trent Aged 15. Thomasin McKenzie is outstanding as Maddox Aged 16. Abbey Lee is superb as Chrystal.

In my opinion Sixth Sense 1999 is Shyamalan's best film to this date and no other film he will ever make in the future will equal it.This movie is about a group of vacationers who go to a remote resort, unaware what horrors are going to befall them. This is not a typical stranded on beach type of film, it's unique in that aspect.The science fiction element of the movie is vague. I feel the script has plot-holes - it's not a complete film but a rushed up job quickly packaged and sold. The movie is on the French-language Swiss graphic novel Sandcastle by Pierre Oscar Levy and Frederik Peeters which I've never read, nor I'm going to.I would recommend this movie as a fairly decent time-pass but one you'll never care to watch again as with typical Hollywood fare these days...",Old

Well, umm, it really does give out most of the film. So if you haven't seen the trailer, don't, you might enjoy it more than I did.The film is like a darker sinister version of Fantasy Island and Gilligan's Island mashed up. The hotel manager is a swede as the new Mr. Roarke. A little boy who plays the hotel manager's son as the new Tattoo. The male nurse is like the Professor. Chrystal character is like the new Ginger. The character, Guy, is like Gilligan. The surgeon is the Skipper. The screenplay felt like it was written in a foreign language and then dubbed into English. The dialog of the characters just seems weird. Their foreign accents just exaggerate this feeling. Doesn't feel like an American film at all. Not that I have anything against foreign films. In fact about half of the films I do watch are foreign. But it wasn't what I was expecting from M. Night.The ending seemed like it was tacked on as an afterthought to close the story. I was hoping for an enlightening thesis about aging but it somehow then turned into Hawaii-Five-O. Like WTH M. Night?Man, I really like M. Night, but this film might just be one of his worse films to date. But I can't bring myself to give M. Night anything less than a 6.

The premise was interesting and it did try and look at it from interesting angles, although that was probably dictated by the original graphic novel source material. But points for trying to make it interesting, for taking it past the basics.The acting did come across as weird, maybe again related to the graphic novel, although you can't blame that for not fixing that if you felt it was lacking. So possibly a creative choice, which, from the viewers point of view didn't work.The ending was, interesting, although perhaps didn't go far enough to investigate the implications of the set up.

59,abisio,Shyamalan disappoints again,4,27 July 2021,"Shyamalan third, and almost perfect movie, as director was The Six Sense; a masterpiece almost impossible to surpass or even get on the same level. Basically he reached his peak to early in his career and he has been down from there. He made a couple of decent ones but never nearly as good.OLD from the trailer look interesting; sadly when you see it ; is not so.I have to accept his ideas are really good; but his pace is not and sometimes he forces his movies to be longer and slower than necessary.Yes, slow pace helps to build tension; but in some moment you need to start moving and he takes too long to do it.The first 30 or 40 minutes of OLD; start the mystery. People at a resort are recommended and send to a beach where they start aging very fast (about two years every 30 minutes or so). When trying to escape they faint after a while and can even die. Characters are introduced and everything goes fine; but then things get really slow.We are exposed to some unsympathetic characters (and others you will never really know why are there), family crisis nobody cares, some dramas and bloodless deaths.What barely happens is people trying to get out. It seems the director was more interested in the human condition, Alzheimer, racism, old people feelings; than letting the thriller going on.There are some tense scenes in between; but are so absurd do not make sense like the tumor operation on the beach. The scene is simply stupid in every sense.Almost on the 90 minutes mark, things start moving on to a very lazy written, anti-climatic ending; just to justify what happened and give some kind of happy closure.Characters are also lazy written. Gael Garcia Bernal and Ken Leung are sympathetic but there is no much they can do with their characters. Bernal shines in his last scenes as an old, almost blind man; but in the first part of the movie is almost invisible.Rufus Sewell as the nut case, pedantic doctor is fine; but has been type-casted on those roles for a long time.Vicky Krieps is the main problem. She does not act; her voice and accent are impossible to understand. She seems to be reading her lines in discomfort. Every scene she was in make me want to leave the theatre.I saw her in other movies and is not a bad actress; but here seems she was forced to something she did not want.In brief; do not expect shocking revelations like in The Six Sense; and/or a real horror movie; more like superficial drama with science fiction touches.",Old
60,bob-the-movie-man,Dafter than the Dharma initiative.,6,28 July 2021,"""Old"" is the latest from the gloriously inconsistent writer/director M. Night Shyamalan. Will this be great Shyamalan (à la ""The Sixth Sense"") or dire Shyamalan (à la ""The Last Airbender"")? The answer, in my view, is somewhere in the middle. It's a curate's egg of a movie.Positives:
The premise feels very familiar (desert island beach; time slips; weird things happening.... ""Lost"" anyone?). But as a shell for a big-screen adventure it kept me well-engaged.Shyamalan and his ""Glass"" cinematographer Mike Gioulakis use some novel techniques to portray the ageing effects. The angles used feel quite Hitchcockian at times. Shyamalan supports this with the sound design, which makes this a REALLY good movie to watch in a cinema with good surround sound. Often the camera will be spinning showing nothing but ocean or rocks, with the character's conversation rotating behind you in the cinema. It's really quite effective.Shyamalan knows that no visual effects can improve on the horrors your mind can come up with. Although a '15' certificate, the ""sustained threat, strong violence and injury detail"" referenced by the BBFC pales into insignificance (in terms of what you actually see) compared to the equally rated ""Freaky"".I've seen other reviews comment that the ""twist"" (no spoilers here) was obvious. But, although not a ground-breaking idea, I was sufficiently satisfied with the denouement. It made sense, albeit twisted sense.Negatives:
I enjoyed the movie's leisurely set-up, introducing the characters and the movie's concept. (In many ways, it felt like the start of one of Irwin Allen's disaster movies of the 70's and 80's). But then Shyamalan turns the dial up to 11 and the action becomes increasingly farcical. Add into that the fact that you can see some of the 'jolts' coming a mile off, and the movie becomes progressively more disappointing, with a high ERQ (eye-rolling quotient) by the end.In particular, there are inconsistencies to the story that get you asking uncomfortable questions. For example, wounds can heal in the blink of an eye.... but not stab wounds apparently.The cast is truly global in nature: Vicky (""Phantom Thread"") Krieps hails from Luxembourg; Bernal is Mexican; Sewell is a Brit; Amuka-Bird (""David Copperfield"") is Nigerian; Leung is American; Eliza Scanlan is an Aussie; and Thomasin McKenzie (so good in ""Jojo Rabbit"", and good here too) is a Kiwi. But although it's clearly quite natural that an exotic beach resort would attract guests from all over the world, the combination of accents here makes the whole thing unfortunately sound like a dodgy spaghetti western!Summary Thoughts: 'Time' and 'ageing' have of course been a popular movie topic for many years. I remember being both gripped and horrified by George Pal's wonderful 1960's version of ""The Time Machine"" when Rod Taylor threw his machine into fast forward and the dead Morlock decomposed in front of his eyes! Ursula Andress did the same as the rapidly ageing Ayesha in 1965's ""She"". And, more recently and with better effects, Julian Glover did the same in ""Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade"".Unfortunately, ""Old"" isn't likely to join any of these classic movies in my consciousness. It's a diverting enough movie, with fabulous views of the Dominican Republic (which the local tourist board will no doubt be delighted with). A ""less is more"" approach might have made this a classic. But unfortunately, that's not what Shyamalan delivered here. Since what we get is a 'Lost-lite' with farcical elements.And, by the way.... The movie that Charles (Rufus Sewell) refers to starring Jack Nicholson and Marlon Brando is ""The Missouri Breaks"". It has a very unusual John Williams soundtrack, which I have on vinyl somewhere and is probably worth a few bob!(For the full graphical review, please check out One Mann's Movies on t'interweb, Facebook and Tiktok.

61,kjproulx,A Cool Concept that Goes Nowhere,3,4 August 2021,"M. Night Shyamalan has been a director I have admired, but have only connected with a couple of times. Nearly every movie buff praises his film The Sixth Sense as his best, and rightfully so. It's definitely up there for me, but his grounded work with Unbreakable is truly his crown jewel to me. He then had his string of blockbusters like The Last Airbender, After Earth, and The Happening. This is when everyone began to realize his heydays were over. With that said, his return with The Visit, Split, and Glass were all very commendable. For that reason alone, I had some newfound excitement for his next project. Old is now playing in theatres and here are my honest thoughts on what is easily one of Shyamalan's worst films.The concept of this film is quite simple. A family on vacation is invited to a secret beach for relaxation. Joined by a few others, everyone realizes that there is more to this location than meets the eye. As they all begin to rapidly age, their children are now teenagers within hours and some of their health conditions also rapidly return. The first act of this film is very intriguing and it had me hooked, aside from the terrible dialogue. Even though the idea hooked me though, this is the prime example of a film that has a cool idea and never does anything with it.It was at about the halfway mark that I started wondering where this film was truly going because it never felt like it was building to anything. Yes, the mystery of this beach looms over the entire film, but again, the script never dives deep enough to really care about the events on-screen. On top of the fact that the script needed a lot of work in terms of plotting, the dialogue is also atrocious from beginning to end. I understood the fact that these actors had to act as if they were still young children, but none of what they were saying was either believable for that age or it ended up being too cheesy.One of my biggest problems with any film that sets itself up with a crazy concept is that it needs to focus on delivering at least some answers for its audience. A film that remains ambiguous can be amazing if the characters and story are all great enough to make that not important. Sadly, Old falls into the category of a film that delivers answers while also not really giving you enough to understand. I completely understood the point behind how the film concluded, but it was also quite dumb. Again, this is coming from someone who will always give an M. Night Shyamalan film the benefit of the doubt.In the end, Old has a few scenes that I really enjoyed. One scene in particular that I really latched onto was one that involved an elderly couple with dementia, but once again, I instantly forgot about it because it was poorly written. If this concept had been sold to someone else to write and direct, I feel like the reception of this film would've been much higher. It's a very neat idea that goes nowhere and the experience almost felt completely pointless to me. Still, I'll give some minor compliments to the overall concept and a couple of noteworthy scenes. Other than that, Old is easily one of the worst films I've seen in 2021.",Old
62,kuarinofu,One of the good ones from Shyamalan,7,31 July 2021,"Walking into an M. Night's film, most people are willingly accepting some of the weirdness. Thus, it comes to a good weird (Unbreakable, The 6th Sense+) or bad weird (After Earth, The Village+). There are, of course, so-bad-its-good ones, like The Happening or Lady in the Water, but this is not the case.For me personally, this one was one of the good ones.And don't get me wrong, it has its flaws, lots of them, but I enjoyed some of the ideas they have introduced.The premise is simple, but they really did have fun with it. It has its humorous moments, but it got quite tense as it got closer to the end.The acting wasn't the strongest part, and the dialogue was quite Shyamalan-ish. It was even funnier when one of the characters supposedly had a mental illness, but his dialogue wasn't that different from typical M. Night ones. That gave me a chuckle.In the era of copy-pasted Netflix by-the-book films, it's nice to have films like this.Recommended.",Old
63,Movi3DO,Disappointed,6,24 July 2021,"Accelerating Mitosis.After the recent Split and Glass, I was hyped for M. Night Shyamalan's future projects. When I saw the trailer, I was in because the premise was cool. And the movie was meh.The positive thing about this movie was the exploration of the concept. The premise was pretty simple, which could be fully realized from the trailer alone, and there wasn't much beyond that. However, the script applied this concept well to different conditions, and I was impressed with some of them. Also, the cinematography was great with the beautiful look of the sea and the coast.This concept had the potential to create great urgency to the story. However, the movie lacked a lot of that, which made the runtime kinda boring. When the twist hit, I wasn't like ""WOW"", but more like ""that's it?."" It was anticlimactic.I also hated the PG-13 rating, which took away a lot of the horror element that could make me more on edge. Even though Shyamalan's past movies were also PG-13, there were still horror elements that worked well with the atmosphere. I think the R rating would help out this movie. However, there's one good scene in the cave that was pretty twisty and creepy.The acting was not so good. Most of them felt off, especially the main couple.Overall, even though the script used the concept well, it failed to keep me invested in the mystery. Quite disappointed. 5.5/10.",Old

I didn't really like the way it was filmed, it felt very slow when turning the camera and i wish they would have shown more. This had all the potential to be something very interesting an engaging. Yet, the acting, timing and some of the shots were absolutely atrocious. BTW, how did nobodies hair or finger nails grow!

I couldn't stop laughing at it.I will say I do like the Idea of a beach making you age fast, also this is based off a graphic novel called Sandcastle which I found interesting.There's disturbing scenes but sometimes it doesn't tie into anything, but when there is a scary scene it looks funny and I couldn't not laugh.M.

The acting is surprisingly as poor as some of the awful dialogues, despite great casting concerning the kid-to-adult transitions. The main family's arc is one worth investing in, but there are too many disposable, irrelevant characters.

70,SoumikBanerjee25,"Great Concept, Improper Execution.",5,24 October 2021,"Great concept, improper execution!That's how I would like to recapitulate my feelings right at this moment. Among the overabundance of reboots and remakes nowadays; unique concepts invariably bring a breath of fresh air into the scene from time to time.Not to mention, as a keen audience; it just feels incredible to witness something pristine for a change, feels almost like a reintroduction into the vast realm of Cinema or Art in general.But you know what's the downside of it? It's when the idea, despite having enormous possibilities goes down the drain. Just like that. All due to incompetencies and thoughtlessness from the makers' front. Reason? Well, their lack of admiration and sensibility I suppose.At the initial stage, M. Night Shyamalan's 'Old' had presented us with several opportunities, numerous avenues to seek and solidify; but look what had happened, it all ended up being stale and squandered in a sense.The problem isn't in the Story, it's entirely in the implementation. Everything seemed so out of place. Dialogues sounded absurd, discussions that were taking place between two or more people came across as inconsequential or in simpler terms plain stupid. Every little incident incited perplexity and confusion. A lot of it!At times, I was like ''What in the hell is happening?''At least from a technical outlook, things didn't look too bad. From some creative shots and framing to a well-composed score playing in the back; the all-around ambience was well created. A kind of eerie, unnerving sensation that prevailed till the very end.At the same time, I don't have any qualms about the actors or their performances but I gotta say their characters were devoid of any kind of relatability or depth. As a result, when bodies started to pile up one by one, I couldn't care less. And that's a shame!For the most part, they acted agitated and confused and so did I. I don't know if it was the original Intent of Shyamalan to make us all fear for our sanity in-between times, if that's the case; then I guess he succeeded. Well done!",Old

73,MrDHWong,"Yet another farfetched, implausible offering from the divisive director that's so bad it's entertaining",5,23 September 2021,"""Old"" is a thriller film written and directed by @M. Night Shyamalan (""The Sixth Sense"", ""Unbreakable"", ""Signs""). Based on the graphic novel ""Sandcastle"" by Pierre Oscar Levy and Frederik Peters, it's yet another farfetched, implausible offering from the divisive director that's so bad it's entertaining.At a tropical resort, the vacationing Cappa family, consisting of Guy (Gael Garcia Bernal), his wife Prisca (Vicky Krieps), and their young children Maddox (Alexa Swinton) and Trent (Nolan River) are invited by the manager to visit a secret beach hidden away from the rest of the holidaymakers. Upon arrival, the family soon realise that the beach isn't as secretive as they were previously informed as they are also sharing it with three other groups of people: a surgeon named Charles (Rufus Sewell), his mother Agnes (Kathleen Chalfant), his trophy wife Chrystal (Abbey Lee), and their young daughter Kara (Kylie Begley); nurse Jarin (Ken Leung) and his wife Patricia (Nikki Amuka-Bird); and rapper Mid-Sized Sedan (Aaron Pierre). After getting acquainted with each other, the group begin to notice a strange oddity that has caused the children to age rapidly into their teenage years. This prompts the group to deduce that there is something sinister about this particular beach that accelerates their growth at a rate of one year every half an hour.I'm certain that whenever the name ""M. Night Shyamalan"" is mentioned, it conjures up mixed feelings among many people. On one hand, he's the man whose early work is responsible for providing us with some of the most memorable and out-of-left-field twist endings in cinematic history, while on the other he's also to blame for what is widely considered to be one of the worst film adaptations of a beloved cartoon series. Regardless, Shyamalan has certainly left an impact on just about everyone, and love him or hate him, he isn't going anywhere anytime soon. Shyamalan's latest film ""Old"" contains all of the typical elements one should expect from his films by now - an interesting premise, tense atmosphere, and a twist ending meant to put the whole thing into perspective. Unfortunately and unsurprisingly, none of them manage to work here.To start with, the film is riddled with absurd plotholes. It is established that something at the beach is making people age a year every thirty minutes from the moment they arrive, yet for an unexplained reason it is only the children who experience this at first. If the unknown phenomenon was supposed to be affecting everyone equally, how come the adults don't start to notice their own changes at the same time? I'm pretty certain most people would feel different today to how they might have felt a year ago no matter what their age is, whether it's weight gain/loss or other biological factors. Also, the character of Mid-Sized Sedan (which I think is a stupid name for a rapper) has apparently been at the beach a day before everyone else but why does he still age at the same time as the rest of the adults and not 24 hours in advance? The rules of this movie are constantly contradicting each other and become so nonsensical that it's unintentionally hilarious at times.As ridiculous as this film is, Shyamalan is at least able to keep things moving at a brisk pace. In actuality, the laughable plotholes proved somewhat beneficial in the long run as it helped prevent it from ever being boring. Strangely, I found myself adapting to the film's stupidity, finding enjoyment in what bizarre revelation to expect next. Also, to his credit, Shyamalan did do a decent job of obscuring each of the character's faces before revealing their advanced ageing to the audience. It had me curious as to whether that character would have makeup to look older or end up being played by a completely different actor instead. Being a filmmaker infamous for his penchant for twist endings, Shyamalan does succeed in stringing us along until the inevitable surprise at the film's conclusion. Though I wouldn't call it the worst twist in a Shyamalan film (I believe that dubious honour goes to 2008's ""The Happening""), it's still anticlimactic and did nothing more than elicit an apathetic ""meh..."" from me once the credits started rolling.Something I've noticed over the years is that the characters in M. Night Shyamalan films never act like real people. They all seem to be weird products of his own imagination that don't say or do anything a proper human being would in certain situations. This film is no exception as we often see characters unloading bizarre and unnecessary amounts of expository backstory to one another despite having only met a few minutes prior. In one scene in particular, the character of Jarin tells people his name and occupation twice for some reason (""My name is Jarin, and I'm a nurse""). Moments like this stand out to me and make me realise that Shyamalan is incapable of writing realistic dialogue, showing one of his biggest flaws as a filmmaker.With that in mind, I didn't really care about any of the film's characters, aside from perhaps Maddox and Trent. I'll admit that I kind of liked seeing them transform from children to teenagers where they were played by Thomasin McKenzie and Alex Wolff, respectively, as we could have seen how such a sudden shift in age would affect their behaviour throughout the story. However, their interactions with the rest of the cast were so poorly written and badly acted that nothing worthwhile seemed to come from it. Scenes that could have been emotionally touching were instead laughably melodramatic. Just once, I'd like for Shyamalan to write a believable main character or characters that can be taken seriously, because there definitely aren't any to be found here.Although I wouldn't consider it to be the absolute worst we've come to expect from M. Night Shyamalan, ""Old"" seems like it exists simply to remind us of how far this once promising filmmaker has fallen. I am tempted to recommend it on a ""so bad it's good"" basis, as there are definitely some moments that made me chuckle at the film's expense, however aside from that, there's little other reason to watch this. I'm still willing to defend Shyamalan over the quality of his early work, as ""The Sixth Sense"", ""Unbreakable"", and ""Signs"" remain among my favourite thrillers, but his more recent films like this one are sure making it difficult for me.I rate it 4.5/10.",Old
74,Alexander_Blanchett,Silly and it holes like a cheese - but fun,6,16 August 2021,"A little better than expected. Yes it was full of plot holes. Yes the ending conclusion/twist really was a stretch and kind of a poor excuse for M. Night Shyamalan to find an excuse for a twist. And yes the acting was wooden as hell as was the dialogue. BUT it was a lot of fun. I liked the premise and the way the story unfolded. It is good that there are still creative ideas in Hollywood. The only problem is that an idea often sounds amazing but then it is a challenge to fill an almost 2 hours film with it and I think Shyamalan had that struggle. His direction was really not very good here. Weird ankles, weird editing. But hey it was fun and I appreciate that fact a lot.Acting wise there is not much to applaud. Gael Garcia Bernal was really wasted. Good to see him in the major role of a Hollywood film but he couldn't fight that character he had and the dialogue he had to speak,
Vicky Krieps was better but also she lacked some emotions her character drastically needed. Rufus Sewell was campy. If you round it up the only really outstanding work came from the two younger actors Thomasin McKenzie and Alex Wolff.The score was fine and I liked that the film was not shot digitally which gave it the right atmosphere.Its really not the greatest hour of Shyamalan but it is also not the worst by far.Dig into it, switch off your brains and enjoy a creative story. I think then the film works.",Old
75,CANpatbuck3664,"I'm Sick of the M. Night Apologists, Its Time to Hold Him Accountable",3,25 August 2021,"My enduring credo with bad movies is ""find any positives, no matter how small, and talk about them first."" I think Old had an interesting premise, its based off a graphic novel and the idea of being trapped in a beautiful location and aging at an accelerated rate is pretty freaky. The wasted potential only made me more frustrated at the direction this film chooses to go but the notion was there to build off of. You could make an intriguing movie out of that description. The only other thing is that there's a couple of moments of body horror in the movie that posed some interesting and alarming moments. Illnesses advance, problems compound and people change in sometimes gruesome ways in Old. It helped me pay attention for those bits in the wholly sluggish run time. The scares don't work at all and the makeup effects are scattershot at best but they use the concept of rapidly aging to unique effect in these story beats. Good is a stretch but they were the highlights.This is where I start bringing up the things that were making me mad. Who taught Shyamalan how to write dialogue? Maybe his word processor gained sentience? I don't know the last time I heard such laboured, stilted and robotic mush coming out of an actors mouth. This aspect of the film reaches The Happening levels of bad (that's saying something, that movie is a travesty). You can't emotionally invest in these characters let alone believe they're human because NO ONE TALKS LIKE THAT! The banter between characters lacks any situational awareness or accuracy and it made me angrier and angrier as the movie went on.Old's cast isn't going to blow you away but you're going to recognize most of the members of the cast from previous projects. I'm not going to spend much time talking about their performances, the quality of this script and the astoundingly awful dialogue makes it difficult to separate the actor/actress from the character. I thought Thomasin McKenzie was the closest to seeming natural as the teenage version of Maddox. I don't know if anyone is especially awful in the cast (I didn't care for Alex Wolff or Vicky Krieps portrayals but I'm going to give them the benefit of the doubt) but again minus M Night including himself again (even in his ""good"" movies, he's a barely passable actor in cameo appearances), its what's on the page that's dragging this movie down not the cast.Finishing up with the plot, the premise is there but Old completely unravels as it goes along. Shyamalan can't come up with a plausible reason for why this is happening at this spot in space and time, the parents keep leaving their kids alone and then they keep returning shocked when they come back to different people (despite the fact they are aware of what's happening). By the end of the movie, there's just mistake after mistake (I can't cite examples while avoiding spoilers) and while the ending twist did play a little, it felt so tacked on and unnecessary.I was loudly booing halfway through this movie. Who did M. Night blackmail to keep getting more chances? It just doesn't make sense to me. He isn't devoid of talent but his best days were almost decades ago. Its time for him to hang it up, I don't want to be subject to anymore of his ""fresh concept"" movies. They all range somewhere between slightly better than okay to abysmal and they're just too risky to spend $10 to see them blind in the theatre. If he wants to continue to create, he needs someone to slap his hand and tell him no. Old wastes its premise and its cast and refuses to try hard to elicit scares. Old is boring, dumb and just not worth your attention overall. I'd actually rate it 3.5/10 but I'm rounding down in this case because this movie doesn't deserve an extra half point. If you enjoyed this movie, I wish you the best but I saw almost nothing redeemable and as the title says, stop forgiving Shyamalan for wasting your time. Glass and Split were decent because of the cast and when you remove those from his list of credits, its just crap for miles. Skip Old altogether, it may be funny as a ""so bad its good"" watch but I wouldn't take that chance and neither should you.",Old

He is making movies ""his way"", and for the most part, they are entertaining - if not memorable. ""Old"" is no exception to the rule as it effectively combines elements of a Twilight Zone episode with a psychological thriller, along with a sprinkle of his own personal touch.We are taken down a very weird path as we journey along with a group of vacationers at a tropical resort. When the resort director invites them to enjoy a beautiful day on a secluded beach, they all readily accept, being given food, more than enough to hold them throughout the day. As the day progresses however, strange things begin to happen - most notable of which, is that they are aging extremely rapidly. When they try to leave, they are rendered unconscious, only to awaken on the same beach once more. They suffer through a wide range of emotions and predicaments as their own impending death looms over them.This was a pretty solid film with strong performances. I was sold on what I was watching, top to bottom. It was filmed well, with good editing, and excellent cinematography. The notion of aging rapidly while maintaining your level of education and mental capabilities was very intriguiging to me. And the ""why"" of it, the final reveal was pretty original and satisfactory.I would recommend this one, but only at 7 stars out of 10. Though it is a very strong movie, it did feel a bit disjointed in parts and had more of a made-for-tv feel to it - almost like I was watching a modern day episode of the Twilight Zone or The Outer Limits.

79,ronakkotian,Shoddily written with some poor acting,4,26 July 2021,"M. Night Shyamalan is back with another film and I wanted to see Old for a long time to assess whether it was a disaster or a return to form for Shyamalan. Sadly, Old falls towards the former side.Old is about a family on holiday that stay on a secluded beach. After a few hours of relaxing there, they soon find out they're ageing at a fast rate.Old isn't a complete trainwreck but there were enough aspects that stop it from being a good film. The idea behind the film is very interesting and had the potential to be a very emotional and haunting experience but Shyamalan's execution of the idea isn't very good. The writing is one of the film's worst aspects. The dialogue doesn't feel natural and somehow manages to make the film unintentionally funny. It's not as bad as some of the lines in The Happening but Shyamalan should write screenplays with someone that knows how to write next time. The camerawork was something I found to be strange in parts. I like how the camera hid some characters' faces to reveal them ageing but there were also some scenes where I wasn't on board with the way it was shot and positioned. I also wanted more from the characters as I don't believe they were given enough development for me to really feel the more emotional sequences. I did, however, like how the age makeup developed for the characters as it went on. The gradual increase in wrinkles and going through characteristics you would tend to get as you get older was one of the features I liked about the film.Due to the clunky writing, the performances weren't very good either. This film has talented actors like Gael García Bernal and Vicky Krieps but their performances and dialogue delivery weren't good. It's clear that they've not beem directed well. Thomasin McKenzie and Alex Wolff were decent. Rufus Sewell does a good job as well. As with every M. Night Shyamalan film, Old does have a twist ending that tries to tie everything together but I found it to be quite stupid.Old isn't the worst M.

IN A NUTSHELL:This unique thriller is an adaptation of a 2010 graphic novel by Pierre Oscar Levy and artist Frederik Peeters called Sandcastle. The intriguing film is about a family on a tropical vacation who discover that the secluded beach where they are relaxing for a few hours is somehow causing them to age rapidly, reducing their entire lives into a single day.Director M. Night Shyamalan explained, ""The book gave me the opportunity to work through a lot of anxieties I had around death and aging, and things like my parents getting older."" Surprisingly, this is his first film to be shot on 35 mm film stock rather than being shot digitally.The movie was filmed during the Coronavirus pandemic, so the cast and crew had to be tested for Covid each day. The film mimics the feeling of being trapped, isolated, and uncertain about the future...something we all experienced during the pandemic! Thank you to Universal Pictures for inviting me to a press screening IN THEATERS! I've missed that movie theater popcorn!THINGS I LIKED:
I'm such a fan of M. Night Shyamalan and have been for many years. He's had some fantastic movies and some that haven't done as well, but I like supporting his work. That being said, I have very mixed feelings about this film. He is so great at building layers in his stories and filmmaking. This new horror absolutely has layers and his trademark twist at the end. I adore his no-cut camerawork and there are MANY scenes that use that effective technique in this movie. I love that he always puts himself in his movies as a minor character.Another film technique that M. Night Shyamalan uses often in this movie is to show a conversation with two people but only a small fraction of one of the characters is actually shown in the frame.Vicky Krieps is such a striking actress from Luxembourg. The first time I saw her in a movie was in the fascinating movie Phantom Thread.Thomasin McKenzie is so fantastic in all of her work. I'm so impressed with this young actress and always happy to see her in new work.There is soooo much symbolism in this film. While you're trying to figure out what's going on, ask yourself what are the character archetypes and what lessons can be learned from what happens to them.One of the characters keeps asking a question about a movie. Fun fact: The movie he wants to know about that features both Jack Nicholson and Marlon Brando is The Missouri Breaks
Some of the song choices had interesting insights. For example, there's a song called I Will Remain.VIEWING TIP: Sit as far back in the theater as you can if you're watching it on a big screen. There are a lot of scenes that might actually make you dizzy if you're sitting close.Really great sound design.THINGS I DIDN'T LIKE:
This movie is just freaky and creepy and horrifying. I wouldn't describe the film as ""enjoyable."" I could tell the audience was extremely uncomfortable during the majority of the movie. I didn't realize it would be a full-on horror movie with all the classic gore and death. M. Night Shyamalan took some risks with this movie; some will pay off and others not.Most of the movie, you're wondering what the heck is going on and what is it the director really wants to say.The audience I watched the movie with was so shell-shocked that they really loved the few humorous moments in the movie.There is so much artistry in this movie that a lot of viewers won't like it or understand it.There is some poor dialogue that is frustrating.So much screaming during the entire movie.The ending felt very rushed.TIPS FOR PARENTS:
Lots of skin with bathing suits and thong bikinis.You see the naked backside of several women.Violence with blood and gore.People die in brutal ways.Many dead bodies

82,statuskuo,The Anxiety Of Aging,6,1 August 2021,"For those of you who claim to blink one day and your whole life is behind you, this movie may give you major anxiety. The story is of a mysterious island where certain visitors are chosen and carted off to a special place where you age quickly. By quickly the math turns out to be 3 hours would equal 10 years. Having discovered this phenomenon too late the ""castaways"" soon become desperate in trying to find the escape path. If there is one.It's a tragic story of (sometimes) undeserving victims. As if the mysterious resort is giving human sacrifices to appease the God of Youth. Instead it's something a little more than that. If you've seen ""The Village"" you get an inkling of it. In the short amount of time surrounding these poor souls...much is discussed. Regret, love, forgiveness. In that message of ""say the important things to the ones you love before it's too late"" this seems to hang over its head. The rest is just typical Shymalan. Depending on where you sit with him. It may grate on you.I will say this.... I stumbled upon watching this in a room full of, what looked to be, teenage girls. They were silent the entire time. My guess: trying to unfold the mystery.

Night Shay shows up as a driver, then it all started to make sense, this is one of his projects.I probably wouldn't have watched it knowing he directed it, but the poorly written script with tons of cringe inducing lines is like nails on a chalk board to listen to. But still I stayed for the story, as it seemed interesting. A few flaws about dead things not aging, but people decaying into bones and I'm getting annoyed fast.I think this type of movie could have been done better as a Black Mirror episode, as once the aging starts and no one seems inclined to find a usable solution it gets to be a drag to watch.2 Stars for the concept. Zero for execution, writing and direction. A good chance for CGI to save this movie, but nope, M Night uses tons of cut scenes, and rotating camera work to stay within his $100k budget for this movie. There are Netflix shows that have better production.",Old

91,sweidman-28016,Very Disappointing But Entertaining For the Wrong Reasons,5,4 August 2021,"""What ever is happening to us is happening very fast.""Old follows a vacationing family discovering that the secluded beach where they're relaxing for a few hours is somehow causing them to age rapidly, reducing their entire lives into a single day. M. Night Shyamalan. You either appreciate him or hate him. I, for one, appreciate him. Sure, he's had a few movies that were just plain awful and some disappointing signature twists, but there's still enough of his style that I like to make his movies a must see. In fact, I had been anticipating Old for a while now. He's been back at the game lately, especially with work on the Apple TV+ series Servant. Before this came out, people were already divided either saying it looked very interesting or dumb. Though I'm mainly leaning towards disappointment and disliking Old in general, there's still a little bit that I found to like. For one, I was always interested the whole way through. There was rarely a moment that I didn't want to abandon the movie and not want to know what was to come. Shyamalan had the right idea for some of the scenes. To use one scene as an example (and it's not a spoiler since the trailer already shows most of the movie), we see a girl having to give birth and the stakes are high. Rather than staying on her, the camera glides from person to person across the beach to get an idea of what each one is facing at the moment, even if they don't pertain to the situation. Though not completely like it and I do take issue with the strange camera work, that style reminded me of something Paul Thomas Anderson would do. Anyway, there's style throughout, but because of how everything lays out, it doesn't necessarily work.The graphic novel Old is based on is supposedly very good and existential. Shyamalan tries to capture that existentialism, but because so much is altered, it can't compare. Everything is handed to the audience. The movie, mainly the script, acts like we're stupid. Everything is explained in detail so we can't even think for ourselves. The story itself isn't that hard to wrap our heads around and I think Shyamalan thought it to be too confusing or something. And with that, these characters are sometimes too smart for what they should be. Another example, a reveal is made that would be nearly impossible if you just got a normal person. But then again, these characters aren't great. Even with their own stories, it's not enough to make up for the nearly unbearable acting. The only four (and honestly two since some screw time is cut) I could get by with were Alex Wolff, Thomasin McKenzie, Eliza Scanlen, and Rufus Sewell. They were pretty alright. But man! The script is so poorly written that it's funny. A few scenes and lines of dialogue may have been intentionally comedic, but there's a good 30 minutes straight where we were laughing. Towards the end, it doesn't know what it wants to do. The energy is down low, and I will say we get a nice scene at night, but it's lost. All of us were waiting for a twist to explain it all. There isn't really a twist, but more a reveal of a bigger picture. Shyamalan probably thought it to be a twist, but at least the way it's played out, it's not. The ending is almost disappointing. When the credits rolled, all I could think was I was entertained for almost two hours, but wow was that a disappointment. I almost consider it to be one of those movies that's so bad it's entertaining. And I may be an outlier for some, but I didn't hate it, but I most definitely didn't like it. I'm with the mixed reactions that it's been getting. To explain my rating, I'd normally give it a C- (4/10), but I'm giving it a C (5/10) just because I do feel like I want to revisit it. Also, those 30 minutes were wildly funny, partly from the strange use of camera work. In other words, this is a very low C (4.6/10 if we want to get into specific numbers). Anyway, Old was a movie and I watched it and now I can remember the experience for the rest of the year or until I forget.",Old
92,ethanbresnett,Good film? Probably not. Entertaining film? Sure,7,1 September 2021,"I really do think Old is getting a bit too much stick.It has a really intriguing premise with a lot of legs. I don't think anyone can ever really fault M. Night for his imagination and concepts. The execution however leaves a bit to be desired.There are two explicit in your face references to age within the first 30 seconds which are far too on the nose and this sort of sets the stage for the quality of screenplay that follows. It is full of cliches, infuriating characters who react in maddening ways to their situation, and is probably 15 minutes too long for what it is.But there are still plenty of positives. It has a solid cast, always a pleasure to see Eliza Scanlen and Alex Wolff on screen these days. It looks beautiful. The setting and camera work were done perfectly. There was also some genuinely creepy and unsettling horror in here as well. And like I have said it has a really cool and engaging premise which for the most part is well explored.Sure it's not a film that is going to set the world alight, but it is one that probably deserves a little more love.",Old
93,MovieCriticOnline,An utter mess with no characters that mattered,1,21 September 2021,"Not for one second did I believe this was an actual family. The parents spoke with an accent and the kids with a different accent and none of them looked like their parents.Do they cast American actors in anymore? Or is it ALL foreigners who try to speak English with American accents? I have never seen this much ""diversity"" in a film before.Another woke cast. The writing is so on the nose and just terrible. People don't talk like that. Only bad writers write in a way that makes it sound like the actors are reading from a novel. M Night writes a bit like Mamet, but not as good. Can we get something that isn't so plot-driven for once? Just for once write something that doesn't involve some lame reveal at the end?Of course, we have these super-smart precocious kids. And then we have the black guy, who is obviously a rapper with nose bleeds that no one notices. A woke checklist cast to meet Oscar diversity requirements.Then we get the old ""I gotta tell you something important"" and the response is ""Not now."" And then the tired old tennis ball dialogue. You say this, then he says that, and then she say this. No one speaks like that in real life. It didn't help to have them all talk to themselves out loud explaining what they are thinking.There were so many plot-holes in this it was ridiculous. The ""kids"" didn't notice they had grown older despite playing with each other for a while AFTER growing mysteriously. Why does every writer write dumb characters that are oblivious to the obvious? Some of the worst acting ever. The dialogue was just ridiculous. I hate characters that tell us what they are doing or going to do. I.e characters that tell us the plot because it's so convoluted we wouldn't understand it otherwise. It's just bad writing. Movies with too much exposition and characters written that have to explain what is happening always makes a bad movie. There is a reason why SHOW, don't TELL makes for better films.On one hand, they healed so quickly because of time moving so quickly, but on the other hand, they were able to move around in normal time. Why would their wounds heal with lightning speed, but everything else they did, didn't follow that speed? MAde no sense.In the end, there was no rhyme or reason for this movie. It was a bunch of irrational and illogical gibberish. I couldn't care less about any of them nor did I care how it would end because of it.

And at times just seemed like a lot of yelling and careless or uncaring decisions. I really didn't care much for most of these characters. It was more sad than horror. Growing old and dealing with diseases at any age are Horrible and painful.

100,President_George_Washington,FROM THE DESK OF GEORGE WASHINGTON,5,25 October 2021,"Good Morrow, countrymen...if you like plot holes, this is for you.M. has been riding the success of Sixth for over 20 years...pumping out technically competent films that always end up in the Meh Bin. In Old, he does it again...delivers a film that looks good from a technical standpoint, has a promising start and ends without delivering the knockout punch. It's too bad, because if he bothered to fill in the plot holes and show a more impactful ""aftermath,"" this might have been a much better film. Instead, M does what he does best. Disappoint.The premise is absurd. A ""evil"" pharmaceutical company discovers a secluded beach where time moves fast. An hour is a year type of thing. The company builds a resort, which apparently has legitimate guests as well as hand-selected guests that have a medical issue. It's these ""sick"" guests and their healthy family members that get are offered an exclusive trip to an ultra-private beach. Once on the beach, the aging happens quickly - there are some fun moments. A couple of small kids turn into teens and one ends up getting pregnant. Eventually, they all grow old and die...except the two ""kids.""
The group is being watched/monitored from a lone guy on a distant mountain. His job is to ensure no one escapes the beach and - I think - to follow the progress of each person.The reveal is that the sick guests have been given meds for their specific condition and are being used as a fast-track human drug trial. Instead of years to get a promising new drug to market, it takes a day.What? Are you kidding me? The drug companies don't make the decision in a bubble to release a new drug. New drugs aren't given to one person and wait for the results. Anybody who has even the slightest understanding of how drug trials work will be frustrated with this plot reveal.The FDA isn't going approve it - it's ridiculous.At no time do we seen hidden cameras on the beach, nor do we see any of the ""sick"" guests getting their drugs. The two ""kids"" now in their 50's escape by swimming and make their way back to the resort just as a new bus of guests have arrived. They knock over a try of refreshing island cocktails that I assume are filled with the drugs (who knows, it's not explained).

102,eagandersongil,Generic and forgettable,6,22 August 2021,"""Old"" new film directed and scripted by M. Night Shyamalan leaves a little to be desired, the film has a good proposal, and a script of ups and downs, with a direction that does not resemble Shyamalan at all.The script, summarized in an engaging context, the premise is the existence of an Island, whose minerals that surround it make any organic matter present in it rapidly age, basically a day on the island is equivalent to aging for decades, it's something interesting, although during the course of the film itself there are some continuity errors in relation to this created context, the plot twist involving the use of the island is good and feasible, but the script is very bad in the development of its characters, it is very difficult to connect to either of them, although the plotter tries to create that connection several times, it just doesn't work.The direction is also a little disappointing, the use of handheld camera is horrible, the zoom is poorly used and the trail is almost non-existent, there are very few scenes that reminds us that this is a Shyamalan film, because much of it looks like a direction generic, with a clear photograph and a problematic construction of tension, which only starts to work in the second act.In terms of acting we don't have any formidable, but the actors on screen deliver the proposal of each of their characters well, I talked about the inconsistency of development, but small features of them are well worked, it's these little touches of Shyamalan that we have.Shyamalan is a director who always adds more to his work, we usually see a very strong intrinsic moral within his supernatural, we always have something philosophical around the construction of his suspense, here, we don't have that, at least I didn't notice this first look, however It's an interesting observation, Shyamalan doesn't usually use scenery composition and talks randomly, we have some references to a western movie that is mentioned during the film, it's worth checking more about this movie because it talks to the work and it's a cool reference about Shyamalan's own life.""Old"" could have a much better third act and save the movie a little, which in itself is not bad, but we always expect a little more from Shyamalan, who in this work doesn't deliver that something more, we have an unsigned movie , with a generic direction, a script full of hits and misses and a set of reasonable performances.

The concept was cool but like his most of the movies the execution was average. Many things worked against the movie, especially the acting. None of the actors gave a performance that you would remember. Acting was neither average nor bad, it was worst. I am expecting Worst Actor and Worst Actress nominations and maybe winners from this movie.The concept was different but the reason behind the concept was too much simple. If the writer is making a story then he should have a strong reason supporting the story but like other stories, Shyamalan did bad work here.Shyamalan's stories are always different and unique but the problem comes with the reason he gives at the end of the story. Overall, this movie is just a mare timepass and you may get bored after half way through. But you can watch give it a try for it's different concept.",Old

105,fciocca,I cannot believe that this movie was directed by the same guy that created the Eastrail 177 trilogy.,3,1 August 2021,"It is really hard for me to believe that Mr. Shyamalan, the genius behind the Eastrail 177 trilogy, directed this movie. The concept is really interesting, but the execution is weak and uninspired.A group of people is left on a private beach, in the middle of an island, that causes them to age really fast. The problem is that the reason is never established, it happens because nature decided so. The movie is for the most part, set in this location, we see these people panicking, as they do not understand what is going on. I could not get attached to any of the characters, because they are never properly introduced, we don't get to know anything about their past, which are children's aspirations or why they decided to come on vacation on that island. So, I just saw a bunch of random people stressing out for almost two hours and I was not even caring if someone would die. I did not have any reason to.Another thing that really bothered me is how the three children get older: two are 6 and one is 11 years old. They all become teenagers in a few minutes. They are able to grow physically, emotionally and psychologically, like if they were able to inherit years and years of experience in such a short period of time. It does not make any sense and it is not believable at all. If actors would act like children, despite having a grown man or woman body, it would have been amazing, and way more entertaining. The makeup job done to Chrystal, to make her look older is awful. They should have hired a different actress, like they did for most of the actors. I laughed when I saw her with wrinkles. Was not scary at all.Speaking of performances, we have a top cast that unfortunately was not able to show their true skills, because of a poorly conceived script. Abbey Lee was really good in ""Neon Demon"" and ""Lovecraft Country"", but here she is just annoying. Alex Wolff, who nailed it on ""Hereditary"", here cannot carry any kind of emotion. Thomasin McKenzie that I have much enjoyed in ""Jojo Rabbit'', here was uninteresting, and the list goes on. What a waste of good talents.I do not recommend this movie at all. There was a lot of potential. This could have been a true depiction of the fear of getting older. What can cause in some people. It could have been a horror, exploring interesting and really deep emotions regarding life and death. This could have been a shocker, a feature film that would make you think about ageing, and could sensibilize the audience, with a meaningful message. I guess that this was not in the director's plans.",Old

director: m Knight Shyamalan
starring: Gael Garcia Bernal, Vicky Krieps, Rufus Sewell, Alex Wolff, Thomasin Mackenzie, Abbey Lee, Nikki Amuka Bird, Ken Leung, Eliza Scanlen, Aaron PierreOld is about a vacationing family who discovers a secluded beach, but when they are relaxing for a few hours, they are somehow ageing rapidly, reducing their entire lives to a single day. Yikes, Old was perhaps the biggest pile of crap I have ever seen. I genuinely think it's the worst film I have ever seen.Let's be nice and start with the very few positives before my massive rant. The concept was very interesting, some of the cinematography was good. There were some hints of a strange and mysterious tone, with effective use of gore and a decent twist. The film had a very high and complex concept. It wasn't executed well at all, but I commend M Knight for having a creative mind with this idea. Some of the cinematography was very nice, the set locations were beautiful and was a fun setting for this kind of film. The hints of a strange and mysterious tone were promising in parts. Within the first act of the film, Old did manage to partly interest me in the events that were taking place with very jarring changes to the characters and the plot and setting up a mystery well. The use of gore was effective. The cave scene with the broken bones was very grim and well executed, with realistic gore making the scene even more uncomfortable. And the twist at the end wasn't good or bad, it just happened. I stopped caring but I put in the positive paragraph because I didn't hate it.Now for my big list of negatives. There was so much forced dialogue and unrealistic scenes. There wasn't any form of set up and the one we did get was lazy. The cast had no chemistry, and there were too many rushed scenes. This film had perhaps the worst dialogue I have ever heard. It was clunky, generic and awkward and incredibly unrealistic. It made the characters come across as robots. Due to this there was countless unrealistic scenes. There were particular scenes with the younger children were they would talk about really adult things or something completely random and it wasn't realistic behaviour at all. It made the scenes awkward and the pacing clunky. There was no form of set up, instead of establishing the characters we were just thrown straight into the film with no explanation, and then when we did get the set up for the beach it was extremely lazily written. With the characters coming across as dumb by just agreeing to go to a beach with no explanation or development of the plot. The cast also had absolutely no chemistry, I didn't believe or connect with any of the relationships, mostly because they just weren't acting like a family, and because pretty much all the characters were incredibly unlikeable and annoying. Finally, there were also way too many rushed scenes. Just as I thought the film would explain or develop a plot point to make you understand what was happening, they cut away quickly and never explained or went back to the scene. It made the pacing clunky and made the plot hard to follow and confusing.My next few negatives would be the terrible camera work, bland pacing, lack of connection to characters. Odd character decisions and countless lapses in the logic. The camera work in this film was beyond poor. Even if done intentionally there was some terrible shots. Even a student film has better shots. There would be a scene and the film wouldn't show you what was happening, instead it either had a weird, blurred lens or randomly had a close up of an ear or half a face. Really poor stuff. The pacing was also terrible, for such a high concept horror idea, I have never seen something executed in such a dull way. It was lifeless, dull and simply just boring. I also had absolutely no connection to the characters. Due to the issues that I have mentioned from previous paragraphs I just didn't care about the characters. And because they were all dying off so quickly, I just didn't care of feel any form of emotional connection to the characters whatsoever. And there was some painfully poor character decisions and lapses in the logic. There were just scenes of characters randomly running off and doing stupid things with no explanation to their actions whatsoever. Or they Would make a decision that obviously wouldn't work and did it anyway, even though characters had died doing it. It was just filled with countless illogical decisions.My final few negatives would be the script, the bad structure. The terrible performances, the lack of development or depth and the exposition. The script and the film's structure was beyond poor. I didn't view this as a film, it had no structure. It was a series of events with characters dying with no form of development or through line until the very end. It lacked any form of thought into structure and plot. I thought most of the performances were also terrible. Now to be fair this could have been to do with the script. But every performance was so bland and awkward. It was like the actors weren't trying, and that they didn't want to be there. Which is a shame because I have seen a lot of them do good performances before. There was absolutely no development or depth to any of the characters whatsoever, this was a big reason why I didn't connect with any of them. The film made no effort to develop them because they killed them off to quickly, giving them one basic one dimensional trait or reason for conflict and then that's it. Finally, the usage of exposition was painfully bad. When a film must spoon-feed and tell the audience practically every detail due to not being able to do it through the action, it really shows that the film was too complex to be written logically.Overall, Old for me, is the worst film I have ever seen. It was embarrassing and poorly made. The script was poor. And I feel embarrassed for M Knight I think a student could have done a better job. I think I grew old watching this.Overall rating 7/100.",Old

110,Coffee_in_the_Clink,Another excellent film from Shyamalan,8,24 July 2021,"M. Night Shyamalan has just entered his fourth decade of making excellent, suspenseful mystery films. In the '90s he had undoubtedly his most famous film ""The Sixth Sense"", in the '00s he had ""The Happening"", in the '10s there was 2015's terrifying ""The Visit"" and now, in the '20s he has ""Old"", a highly original and taut thriller that sees a family holidaying at a luxurious resort finding themselves literally in a race against time to find a way off of a secluded and exclusive beach, which ages people two years for every half hour that they are on it.The concept here is excellent and very original. Leaving aside the metaphors and deeper meaning in the film which explores our obsession with age and beauty and the finale of old age and death, ""Old"" is a well-paced and knuckle-biting-inducing film that exhibits very clever filmmaking in how the rapid aging process is handled. The cast of relatively unknowns do a great job, and I was chuffed to see Alex Wolff present in the line-up following his impressive performance in 2018's horror masterpiece ""Hereditary"". My only complaint is that I would have preferred a more cynical ending compared to the one that we have, which felt too contrived.

113,deexsocalygal,Creepy,7,26 October 2021,"I liked this but a lot of it could've been tightened up. It didn't need the 15-20 minutes beginning intro showing 1 of the families long drive to the resort. It was pointless & you have to listen to them sing in the car. Also pointless was the hotel scenes of people ordering food & drinks. I could of done without watching the parents fight in the hotel room while their two kids were scared & hugged in the other room. Who wants to watch a couple talk about their marriage problems, whether they should tell their kids they're separating & stuff like that? All you want is to get to the beach scenes where they get old!! Once you get to the beach it starts getting good. I liked watching the skinny blond model grow old. She has a calcium deficiency which made her grow a hump on her back. She's not used to looking old & ugly & neither is her husband the doctor. When her face starts loking haggard he yells at her to go put some makeup on. She can't deal with it & goes to hide in the rocks. That's when she really starts aging. Her arms & legs start breaking. It's intense. I could of done without the doctor going mental. He kept talking nonsense about a movie. I really liked this though & think almost everyone would enjoy it. I can't see anyone getting bored & turning it off. Just fast forward thru the first 15-20 minutes until everyone's at the beach. The aging process is so fast. People age like 50 years in 1 hour. The kids are fun to watch grow from 6 years old to 50. There's an interesting scene of two 6 year olds playing in the sand together a boy & a girl. It switches to the adults & then when they show the kids again the little 6 year old girl is pregnant. That was weird because who thinks about kids that age sneaking off & having intercourse? So she ends of having a baby on the beach. This movie will freak you out. Watch it!",Old

The film has a major identity crisis and is riddled with plot holes. The ending was the biggest disappointment since the ending of Lost...and it's a shame as this is a very unique storyline and to be honest, there could have been a million and one conclusions as to why they were on the beach...and reason itself wasn't bad exactly, it just wasn't the twist I was expecting. The director is known for his jaw dropping twists, but he's failed in his last few films miserably. Some scenes really were excellent but overall it's very average.",Old
115,movieman6-413-929510,Shyamalan plays on a fun way with the fear of aging.,5,24 July 2021,"Old is a new mystery thriller directed, written and partly produced by M. Night Shyamalan, the director of Split, Signs and The Sixth Sense.The film is about a family who travels to a remote beach during their vacation. At the beach, they realize together with the other beachgoers that time works in a mysterious way. A few hours are almost equal to a few years. The beach guests are thus faced with a choice to unravel the mystery of the beach, or to enjoy their indefinite last days.Shyamalan is known for his unusual films that often end with a plot twist. This movie fits nicely into his movie gallery. Unfortunately, he chooses to make the film unnecessarily larger. If he'd stuck with the riddle of people only getting older quickly, he could have stuck with an interesting movie. He also chooses, for example, to respond to the feeling of isolation and how this can affect people again or how people can survive on the beach. For example, he tries to keep you as a viewer thinking about what is happening and what the characters can do best. The film is also reminiscent of the mystery TV series Lost due to location and events.If Shyamalan had just stuck with the riddle of accelerated time and concentrated more on this idea, he could have worked out the film in more detail. That the characters get older can only be seen on a few moments by replacing the actors with older actors or simple make-up effects to make them look older.He also enjoys playing with the effects of aging. This way you as a viewer can feel more involved in the film, because consequences such as the loss of your senses or memory is something that most people experience or have experienced with, for example, their own (grand) parents. Some may also fear this for their future.Shyamalan also screens the film separately, because sometimes he zooms in too much or he rotates the camera too much and too quickly around the different characters.The acting is also somewhat different in the film, because the characters have to behave older and older, which works better with one than with the other. The better acting comes from Gael Garcia Bernal and Thomasin McKenzie, while Vicky Krieps and Alex Wolf come across as more emotionless and as if they were just reading their lines.",Old
116,coombsstephen,Different but also disappointing from Shyamalan,5,25 July 2021,The idea for this film is original but sadly that doesn't make it brilliant. It could have been good if the film was better and the concept flushed out more. Instead it was a very confused film where things kept happening for no apparent reason and with little logic.The attempted twist at the end was a damp squib and was too little too late.

Night Shyamalan. We are used to his films being interesting, tense and constantly surprising us until the very end.The premise is interesting, but the film seems to be missing something. It's directed solidly, but the script isn't good enough and the film seems mediocre.What further degrades the entire film is at times poor and unconvincing acting.There's a lot of pointless dialogue in the film, and even a series of standard clichés from today's film production, truly disappointing. You definitely don't expect that in a film directed by a great director like M. Night Shyamalan.At one point I felt like stopping watching, but since I was wondering what would happen in the end, I kept watching anyway. Unfortunately, even the ending is disappointing. The special effects weren't bad, but they weren't great either. It could have been a lot better. Mediocre, like everything else in the film.A mediocre, disappointing film that is further degraded by meaningless and unnecessary dialogues and mediocre acting.",Old

Petrified and in mortal terror the unfortunates desperately try to maintain sanity as they struggle to stay alive in cramped isolation with time ticking away.

120,zac-04879,Extremely Gripping,7,15 October 2021,"Progressing into Old's gripping concept will usually compel you the most once you've completely ditched all the high hopes you'd take along to an M. Night Shyamalan thriller. Although many of the mixed reviews shared several disagreements and owned divergent opinions, Old's concept was very fascinating and obviously featured an unexpected twist. The director's biggest fans will surely appreciate the familiar underlying design.Surprisingly however, this psychologically-themed thriller is packed nearly to the brink with the combination of clever motives and striking performances. For example, ALL of the components that come with the ageing idea are portrayed with detail and are intelligent. The family all begin with the average parents' and kids' age, before growing to teenagers and elders in an extremely fascinating style.If anything destroys the talent of the story, the automatic swifts between the cast members can occasionally get uneven. But there thankfully are matching reasons and theories that'll make sense behind them. And despite the lack of jaw-dropping moments in most M. Night Shyamalan movies, Old can just get away with entertaining us by providing multiple twists and turns.If you liked this review, check out the full review and other reviews at aussieboyreviews.",Old
121,darkreignn,Intriguing premise makes for an entertaining experience,7,23 July 2021,"""Old"" is pure, B-movie schlock, and I mean that in the best way possible. There was never a point in this movie where I was bored or not having a good time - from start to finish, M. Night Shyamalan managed to genuinely entertain me with an intriguing premise that contained wild set pieces and legitimately disturbing moments.Sit down and buckle up because ""Old"" pulls no punches when it comes to its premise - the concept of a beach that causes rapid aging is interesting in and of itself, but when coupled with M. Night's horrific set pieces, you'll find yourself absorbed into the onscreen happenings. Seriously, ""Old"" might be PG-13, but if you didn't know that going in you'd be forgiven for thinking it had an R-rating; some pretty disturbing things happen in this movie that you'll just have to see to believe. M. Night put a pair of balls on this film, which I respect - this isn't your average teen horror flick.But that's not to say it's so dreadful as to lose fun-factor; there's a really great undercurrent of comedy to this film. You can tell M. Night was having a good time making this, because it feels like the sort of B-movie that you'd find on cable at 2 a.m. With overly exaggerated acting (and sometimes, acting that is just straight up poor), modern-day pop culture parodying, and some totally hilarious reaction shots and funny dialogue, ""Old"" knows that it had to entertain as much as it disturbs. This movie is so much damn fun that you can almost forgive its atrocious acting and god-awful dialogue.As much as I hate to say it, almost everyone in this movie acted poorly, which is shocking due to the caliber of the actors on display. Thomasin McKenzie, Alex Wolff, and Abbey Lee, just to name a few, have all been great in previous roles - here they were either miscast, or led astray by the director. And in fact, every actor in this movie was led astray by M. Night when it comes to the lines they have to deliver. I mean, Christ almighty, it's hard to believe dialogue this bad made it past the cutting room floor. Most lines are delivered so woodenly, so unconvincingly, that if you haven't seen any of these actors in a movie before you'd think this was their first ever performance. Ken Leung is perhaps the worst offender, while Rufus Sewell is the best actor of the bunch here - he acts circles around everyone and feels very natural in his delivery and overall performance.That said, the poor line delivery and bad acting almost adds to the fun - it certainly did for me. To put it simply, ""Old"" is just a good time at the movies. Sure, the acting is bad - sure, the dialogue is horrendous - but is the movie entertaining? Hell yes it is. There's enough suspense, drama, action, and horror at play here to satisfy most audiences, and I'd highly recommend this movie if you just want to relax and have some fun for a couple of hours.",Old

But there are also one or two ideas too many. And the characters talk very strangely and are often unintentionally hilarious. Kinda interesting but far from perfect.",Old
125,TheCorniestLemur,"It never gets...well, old",3,27 July 2021,"Seeing this film was the first time I've been to a cinema in a year and four months.And I regret...nothing.If you, like me, find M. Night Shyamalan to be one of the most fascinating filmmakers working today, and if you, like me, enjoy a good hearty dose of cringe, and if you, like me, have a girlfriend whose only Shyamalan film she's seen is The Visit and wants to see one of his films that is funny and not completely unbearable because you sing his praises often, then like me, you will have a good time with this.And if you don't happen to meet that very specific list of requirements, then you should probably still see it anyway, because after Glass seemed slightly more competent then we're used to by now from Shyamalan, and yet was less entertaining for it, this is him back on top form.I make no exaggerations when I say a good deal of the dialogue and acting in this film could easily go down as the funniest in M Night's career since The Happening. And just in case that doesn't sound tempting enough to you, by god is nearly every single one of his trademarks smeared all over this film. Just off the top of my head, we have:Kids who talk like adults and adults who talk like kids (and if you know the premise of this film, rest assured this does get mixed up, and yes, the results are hilarious)The character always banging on about statistics, lifted straight out of The HappeningThe dumb twist that is made excruciatingly obvious within the first five minutesThat oh so very Shyamalan (TM) way characters never react to horrific things with any sense of urgencyAnd to keep things fresh, this one has some pretty terrible cinematography to make quite a few scenes awkward and tacky looking, which I can't say is an issue I ever had with any of his films before.And seriously, to this day I cannot possibly imagine what M Night is bloody telling his actors on set to get performances like these out of them. I cannot imagine what combination of words you could possibly say to get good actors like Eliza Scanlen, Alex Wolff, and Thomasin McKenzie to emote like this. It's pretty goddamn funny though.Probably the worst thing about this that did quite genuinely hack me off was the waste of potential here. Apparently this is based on a graphic novel, and although I've never read it, from what I understand it's quite a somber exploration of mortality and how we choose to spend our lives, that is until Shyamalan took it and turned it into a by-the-numbers thriller that has virtually no deeper meaning, and where none of the characters have anything more to them than ""we want to not die"", and all of the characters act like they have severe learning difficulties.But is there anything good about this? Well, yes actually. There are a few good ideas here, and I can't really say them because of spoilers, but while the execution is often laughable, there's definitely something kind of creepy in some basic concepts that I would really love to see a better director have a go at. While some scenes are shot abysmally, some are actually shot quite well and whatever is left of Shyamalan's talent surfaces for a brief moment every so often.And there were two death scenes that I thought were quite creative, and even managed to make me wince a bit with how surprisingly nasty they were.But all in all, if you love M Night's cringefests, and like me, thought that The Visit was painful to watch, Split was surprisingly good, and Glass was just boring as hell, and have been craving The Quintessential Shyamalan Experience since After Earth, then you are in for a real treat.",Old
126,youngcollind,"Lofty concept, uneven results",5,25 July 2021,"You can't fault M. Night Shyamalan for not trying. The premise of the film may be preposterous, but it's certainly original and an intriguing new playing field for horror to unfold. It's in the execution where it often stumbles. Choosing consistently to swing wide, leading to some over the top scenarios that can come off unintentionally hilarious. Some clunky dialogue and stiff performances also add to the overall cheesiness. Then there's the mandatory Shyamalan twist that also displays some writing ingenuity, but is too much of a logical stretch to totally take seriously.",Old
127,TheVictoriousV,"Bad, albeit in a way that I've missed",2,29 August 2021,"Old is M. Night Shyamalan's true return to form. It wasn't the cleverly disturbing Split - regarded to be on par with his The Sixth Sense and Unbreakable - nor its sequel Glass that playfully tied it together with Unbreakable as per the Shared Cinematic Universe trend. Instead, this new film brings back the real Shyamalan: the irremediable madman who brought us The Happening and Lady in the Water.As much as I liked Split, this is the Shyamalan I truly wanted back; the one whose films feel almost alien in how they're scripted, performed, and presented. His post-Happening titles left much to be desired in that regard - movies like The Last Airbender and The Visit were purely painful and After Earth merely had interludes of ""so bad it's good"".We may never know if Shyamalan realizes deep down how funny he is. He's a bit like Karl Pilkington; he's funny precisely because he's sincere and isn't strictly trying to be funny. If the idea of a kid reading the future on cereal boxes was used in a comedy, it wouldn't be nearly as hysterical as its deadly-serious usage in The Lady in the Water (the same goes for ""Narfs"" and ""Scrunts"").Here, he provides another admittedly interesting idea: a location that causes its visitors to age rapidly - sort of a pocket of reality where the rules are different. Of course, hilarity ensues before we even get to the anomalous place in question; we're subjected to a number of Shyamalyan ideas on what normal human interaction looks like.In the movie, a group of tourists arrives at a tropical beach (recommended to them by Swedish comedian Gustaf Hammarsten as a shady resort manager) and finds, first and foremost, that someone has died there. The adults are especially perplexed, and as they go to check on the children, they are children no more (and apparently their swimsuits have also grown a few sizes). They learn there is no way to leave or call for aid because of course there isn't.This is but the beginning of the beach's curse. One of the kids, who is actually six, soon becomes a teenager and eventually starts developing a baby in her womb. Ignoring the fact that this imagery is going to appeal to the wrongest possible people for the wrongest possible reasons, how exactly does this work without a father? I thought this place simply sped up the aging process, or does it also download aspects of one's future? Is there a theme about metathesiophobia - about the inevitability of change - and ""losing"" one's children to adulthood, oneself to old age, and one's parents to mortality? If there is a point, I was too distracted by the ""classic Shyamalan"" line delivery to notice any.Funniest of all is Vicky Krieps, whose barely-emotive observation ""Dere is sometheeng WRAHNG with dis beetch"" is a meme waiting to happen, just like the incredibly natural greeting ""What are your names and occupations?"". (If I keep listing the instances of comedic gold in the dialogue alone, I'll wind up reciting the entire script.) The other adults, kids, and adult counterparts are played by the likes of Gael García Bernal, Rufus Sewell, Alex Wolff, Embeth Davidtz, Eliza Scanlen, Thomasin McKenzie, Abbey Lee, Ken Leung, Aaron Pierre, and others. There is little difference in quality or stiltedness between the child actors and the grown-ups, and the character behavior and convos are some of the most genuinely random I've seen since Transformers: The Last Knight.The thing about movies like Old, especially nowadays, is that it's hard not to recommend them on some level. As I wrote in my review of the new season of The Boys (as well as my recent review of the Harley Quinn series, to an extent), bad movies, despite popular opinion, aren't actually more common now than before - rather, films have started being bad in very similar ways, with their generic VFX, wannabe-complex plots, and proclivity for abandoning established rules and characterizations (provided the film in question is part of a long-running franchise) for the sake of an id-political snipe or a performatively woke gesture.Shyamalan, however, continues to be maddening and weird like only he knows how, on top of the purposefully unconventional filmmaking choices that have ""M. Night"" written all over them - the awkward dolly-pans, the framing choices, the staging, the oh so clever symbolism, the title cards, et cetera (and don't you forget the twist). This could not be mistaken for anyone else's work.Old is astoundingly insane; worse than the likes of Black Widow and Cruella, and so much more entertaining for it! The more effective moments of body horror and atmosphere prevent me from giving this my 0/5 ""so bad it's good"" rating, but boy do I recommend this crap!",Old
128,jackgdemoss,"Isolated and compact thrills, plagued by M. Night Shyamalanisms",7,26 July 2021,"There is something so beautiful about a horror or thriller that takes place in one set location over a short period of time with very few scene changes. I always feel more immersed when it is easy to imagine myself on the beach with these characters rather than feeling like a bird watching from above.Old is great in this manner and also in exploring niche scenarios regarding the major theme of the film. I will not go into detail about what the premise is because I believe this is a better viewing experience if you go in completely blind.The two biggest negatives bringing this otherwise solid thriller down are the cheesy dialogue and the severe motion blur. It seems like Shyamalan's dialogue is getting worse movie by movie. Every few scenes you will have lines that feel like they were written by a 10-year-old that just learned English as their second language by watching old movies. Even worse, however, was the brutal motion blur that plagued the entire run. I am worried that I am just getting more frustrated by the 30fps nature of films in general, but using jarring motion blur to mask the low frame rate is never the answer. There is a good reason the first thing gamers do is turn motion blur off when they log in.This is a solid story but definitely one that can be missed in theatres.

He has received a lot of mixed criticism for the films he has made after the masterpiece The Sixth Sense. But I have really appreciated both The Village and Signs. During the pandemic, it has been lean on the film front, and I was happy to hear about this film. But this is far from his best. The idea is amazingly good. But here there is a lot that is not well enough implemented. I struggled most with the dialogue in the film which appeared to be unbelievable and strange. We have become accustomed to big surprises in his films in the past, and moments where we are greatly surprised. These moments are missing here. Instead, we get a medium-horror movie, which at times entertains and at times becomes unexciting. It also seems to me that the end of the film is too simple and the ending comes quickly and unsatisfactorily. Nevertheless, it is important to point out that the stream of films in this genre this film rises above the majority. On the other hand, that's what we must expect from mr. Shyamalan too.

A novel concept however, reduces to only that as the story goes all downhill from there, with the writing lacking any real imagination or depth.The film also criminally underutilizes its talented cast with only Gael Garcia Bernal and Rufus Sewell getting any real content to show their worth with.Another disastrous outing from the master of horror, who is clearly well past his prime.

You would think the movie would be captivating through out as a result of its plot and the fact its shot almost entirely in daylight but the movie does lose its steam at times and I can see why some people wouldn't enjoy or appreciate this. However, I am an avid horror fan and I was eagerly awaiting the 4k steelbook release of this movie. And I really liked it.. Alex Wolff is one of my favorite young actors but he is probably the worst actor in this movie, sadly. That girl that plays the ""beautiful"" one is also in ""The Neon Demon"" and she was equally as disturbed in this as she is in that. Everyone is saying the dialogue was poor. This is not entirely true but there are still many clunkily delivered lines here. Wolff has some of the worst dialogue in the film. I love how M. Night uses moderness in his movies yet they still have a deep mysterious, almost timeless feel. ""Midsized Sedan"" reminded me of a character you'd see in ""Lady in the Water"" and the ""huntchback"" reminded me of The Village""This movie has some very scary parts and very mature subject matter. I personally think this movie is too adult to be pg13 but thats the thing with M. Night; he keeps his films rooted in pg13 territory but pushes boundaries at the same time.

139,PCC0921,Amidst Moments of Genius I Did Feel Some Aging Myself,6,3 August 2021,"Released: July 23rd, 2021
Viewed: July 29th, 2021In the 30 years since M. Night Shyamalan came onto the director's stage, I have followed him, more or less, the whole time. What makes him uniquely interesting to me is the fact that he promotes southeastern Pennsylvania and most of his films are either shot in/set in areas around the Philadelphia area, where I am from. So, it was always entertaining to watch the film unfold, while also trying to figure out if I know the location where he is shooting the scene. He has always been a great Philly guy. In the case of Old (2021), a film that takes place completely on a tropical island resort, nowhere near the east coast of the United States, still has main characters, who are from Philadelphia. Nice touch. This was interesting notion to me, because I could concentrate less on locations and more on the film itself.What transpires from here is a group of tourists are taken to an unknown beach cove and as the hours go by they realize they are trapped inside, a time anomaly bubble and time is ticking faster than normal, making them age quicker. They soon are aware that they are trapped and can't go back out the way they came in. They need to escape this beach or figure out what is going on before time runs out. The film contains all the tricks, techniques and mood found in an M. Night Shyamalan thriller.Now let's look at how things turned out. M. Night Shyamalan always brings along a very unique look at a particular story. He always comes up with interesting ideas on presenting his story. He sprinkles in the camera as if it is exploring the space around the characters, teasing the audience with subtle changes effecting the situation. None of this is more evident as we see the younger characters begin to age. There are certain planned camera angles and pans that help establish a true believability factor. You truly can tell they are aging, even the older characters, who, as you would expect, don't have their physical forms change as much as the kids, but you can see it due to crafty filmmaking. The movie really is a beauty to watch unfold.What hurts the film are the same typical M. Night Shyamalan issues that seem to creep up in his films. He has a good basis on what the story will be about, but as the film goes along there tends to be drag that happens in the pacing of the film. The story tends to become winded and ends up being too long. I felt like I was aging rapidly too. The execution of the filmmaking feels like hills and valleys. He does something that is genius, then follows up with a ""why did he do that""? There are some moments that are silly (calcium anyone?) and some that are pretty frightening.The other thing that hurts his films, I feel, is his need to appear in the films himself. I am all for the Hitchcockian cameo, but when M. Night appears in the film it totally sparks a pompous narcissistic atmosphere that penetrates the mood of the film. It just doesn't feel right. I keep thinking its me and I must be missing something, but the other day, when I saw this film, I felt validated some. M. Night makes his appearance and I hear in the audience a teenage girl say, somewhat sarcastically, ""there he is""! So, if younger people are seeing him pop up in these films and act like its become somewhat tedious and forced, then imagine how the older audiences have felt since 1999 when the Sixth Sense dazzled the nation. Take a break from the acting please. Stick to the Hitchcock way.There still is enough to enjoy this film. It is good enough to be seen in theaters, in fact, it should be seen in theaters. The tropical locations, the excellent camera work, the talented cast and the desire to be thrilled for 108 minutes does translate well in the movie theaters. As with all M. Night films, this one will go down as a cult classic and maybe someday will be considered a modern classic that just needs some time to go by. No pun intended, but for many films they sometimes age better with time.6.1 (D+ MyGrade) = 6 IMDB.",Old
140,kenzibit,Unpredictable plot.,8,22 September 2021,Very unpredictable.... you hardly get unpredictable movies nowadays. I really enjoyed this movie not because I work in a lab but this movie got lot's of hidden messages and meaning of life as we age. It has this very interesting concept of using the effects of a secluded beach to work and facilitate the effects of drugs on specific ailments and doing so explores the effects of diseases to marriage dramas to death. Things I didn't really like about the movie were amateur acting of some of the characters and the shaky camera filming... also the film failed to explain the exact reason behind the aging process caused by the beach but nonetheless a very interesting and unpredictable movie to enjoy.,Old

142,foxtografo,"Interesting premise, weak script",6,24 September 2021,"Watching the trailer I thought this could be an interesting movie. I don't say it isn't, at least at the beginning, but it quickly becomes repetitive, and the characters struggle to figure out anything or get over the facts. I understand it's not a normal situation, and I'm just thinking rationally from the comfort of my seat in front of a screen, but still, at some point, you want the characters to start acting towards a rational solution and make use of common sense.The overall eerie atmosphere is well achieved, it felt really tense and mysterious the whole time. There were really creepy moments, specially the one involving the model and the two siblings in the caves!!It definitely feels like the script should have revised, cut some in the middle that was repeating and lead nowhere, cut some stuff at the end after the twist that was totally unnecessary...
The ending twist was good for me, but then again, it stretched further, it kept adding unnecessary scenes and spoiled the shock, like telling the punch line of a joke and then keep adding stuff after the laughs.The cinematography is good, a couple times I felt like maybe the camera work didn't match the scene, but wasn't a big deal.All the people commenting on the ""horrible, awful acting"", I honestly don't feel like that. Maybe they're missing the point of some of the characters being overgrown children, I think everyone did a good job on portraying different ages of the same character. This is a big part of what Shyamalan wanted to play with, I guess, and it's interesting.To sum up, it's an interesting premise, with good tense atmosphere, but it's stretched too long in the middle and after the twist at the end, so I guess it's a script problem that it didn't work that well...Definitely not a 1* movie, but I see how the opinion is polarized.By the way, why people keep wasting their time writing ""Don't watch this movie"" kind of ""reviews""? It's so childish and stupid. Honestly. That's not even an opinion, it's condescending crap, it's a 1* review for the reviewer! Make some effort or keep your anger for yourselves!",Old
143,jdring2007,effective thriller that sustains mystery and tension for first half; second is more drama and revelations,8,1 November 2021,"I'll put this right out front: I can totally see why a lot people were gravely disappointed. They either expected an outright horror film or wanted more from the ending. Both of which should be realized as Russian Roulette when it comes to movies by M Night. I obviously won't talk much on the ""twist"" at the end, except to say that I thought it wasn't super above and beyond, in fact, I'd made a prediction halfway through that essentially came true. My only gripe with the ending is that it could've been expanded upon a little more, but I understand M Night not wanting to for the sake of dramatic punch. The first half of the movie was a powerfully eerie thriller for me, and while the characters were all moderately interesting, I didn't find myself empathizing for them until the second act. The whole concept is really cool and I thought it was handled tastefully. Because it's PG-13, they were able to toy with unique camera angles to avoid showing nudity or gore, which enhanced the cinematography for me. Acting all around was good, but often felt too theatrical. It really is a movie that tosses you around in its clutches, but I honestly think it deserves some appreciation. A high 7 or low 8.",Old
144,Siamois,"Hey look, it's another movie by that guy who directed ""The Sixth Sense""!!!",2,25 September 2021,"In 1999, M. Night Shyamalan released an amazing movie by the name of ""The Sixth Sense"". That movie had a captivating plot that it revealed bit by bit. The slow pace of the movie was warranted by the exquisite atmosphere, solid writing and some great performances.Those qualities that were found a very long time ago in this director's work are now completely missing. ""Old"" still has a crawling pace but instead of creating tension, its nonsensical story, the awful acting, the poor writing, all contribute to making the viewer cringe.We learn from the trivia section of imdb that the movie ""Old"" is the adaptation of a graphic novel that left a great impression on Shyamalan. Here's a quote from the director:""The book gave me the opportunity to work through a lot of anxieties I had around death and aging, and things like my parents getting older.""""And yet, the handling of the central theme of Old, which is aging, is handled extremely poorly and cheaply throughout the duration of the film. It's almost as if Shyamalayan turned this venture into a ""who dies next"" type of film and didn't bother to explore the theme of maturation at all.Another missed opportunity from a director who unfortunately, never quite recaptured the magic found in that 1999 movie that made him a household name, a long time ago now.",Old

Half of them sound like they just learned to speak English yesterday. Granted the dialogues are atrocious and anyone would seem like a terrible actor reading them, but the actors still seemed really bad to me. And yes, my own English speaking isn't very good and I'm not even half as good of a speaker as them, but I'm also not an actor working on a movie.How can a director who made Split and got that amazing performance of James McAvoy, have these terrible acting in his movie? I still largely blame the abysmal writing and dialogue, but the acting was still bad.The camera work was also really weird and I don't know wtf they were thinking with some of the pointless ""shoot the actors, then pan to the rock wall then go back to the actors again."" NOTHING HAPPENED when the camera panned to them again, they didn't even age, WTF was the point then?Also since when did aging become synonymous with better medicine? Is that what's stopping the medical industry from making breakthroughs and curing diseases?

155,Spartan_1_1_7,M. Night either lands a hit or misses by a wide margin. This one is sadly the latter.,5,31 October 2021,"OLD (2021) is the latest film from the one and only, M. Night Shyamalan, and is about a group of tourists who visit a part of the island they're vacationing on and realize Time is screwy here. Now, I like the dude and have seen most of his work and I admire the fact that no matter what, he still goes out and makes whatever he wants to, so I was naturally looking forward to giving this a shot. From my experience with his filmography, most of his outings either work well for whatever he's going for and can be legitimately amazing or they don't and can fall flat on their face completely. This movie, sadly, joins the latter group.The concept/idea itself is interesting. It's the execution that leaves much to be desired. The group you follow and experience the story through is not interesting nor are there individual characters that you get attached to strongly or care for. They are just sorta there so things can happen to them and if you happen to like some of them superficially, that would be all there is. The dialogue and acting were often awkward. The scenario itself doesn't hold up to much scrutiny if you start thinking about things.I could see the poignant themes, moments or scenes M. Night was trying to go for in accordance with the concept of TIME in the movie but none of them actually landed properly since the structure and execution around them was not set up strongly. There is also a bit of Horror/Creep factor thrown in the mix but it came off as rather goofy instead of scary.Technically, I did enjoy some of the cinematography. The long takes which Shyamalan tends to do were present here as well and were cool. The soundtrack was serviceable, nothing special.Overall, not much to say other than that it was disappointing and certainly didn't work for me. Again, I do like the overall concept and even the twist at the end and had there been strong execution to back this up, I could see this kind of movie as an enjoyable experience but as it stands, it was not entertaining apart from perhaps unintentional stuff. I won't say it was terrible, though, or the worst film or anything of that sort. It's more of a MEH experience than anything else. I'm also glad he is still trying out different stuff instead of conforming and making usual/typical material. Unless you're curious and are a fan of M. Night, I'd say skip this one. And if I were to rate it, I'd give it a 5/10.",Old

157,hoernkeem,"Old (2021, M. Night Shyamalan) Somewhat nonsensical and overly convoluted which is par for the course for Shyamalan these days",3,13 August 2021,"'Old' is the latest film from horror/thriller auteur Shyamalan who, despite a track record that is more miss than hit, still commands a decent amount of respect and credibility. He exploded on the scene in 1999 when his film 'The Sixth Sense' exploded and became an instant classic. With one film not only did he become an A-list director, but he also gained a reputation for having a famous, perhaps now infamous, twist ending. Since then he has tried to recapture that magic lightning in a bottle telling the perfect thriller/mystery/horror style of story. Ultimately he has never recaptured the creative or financial success that he attained with 'The Sixth Sense' over twenty years ago. 'Old' has an eclectic, diverse ensemble cast including Gael Garcia Bernal, Rufus Sewell and Alex Wolff. The story is based on a Swiss graphic novel that Shyamalan received for Father's Day.A married couple with their two young children arrive at a lush, lux resort in a seeming island paradise. They are coaxed to an isolated beach where supposedly nobody goes for a day retreat. When they arrive they find a handful of other people already at the beach. For a brief time everything appears normal, but if you've seen the trailers things go sideways rather quickly. At first weird things are noticed, and everyone starts to wonder what is up as a dead body is discovered. When they try to leave the beach they realize they cannot, and if they try they black out. Shortly they realize the even greater nightmare of this beach is that they are growing old at an excessive rate. They figure out at some point that it was one year of life for every thirty minutes. The elderly die quickly and the kids grow from young to adolescent before their parents eyes. The beachgoers further deduce at least one person in every party has some medical malady and someone appears to be monitoring them from cliffs above which deepens the mystery. For what nefarious purpose has this resort lured them here to grow old and die over the course of a day?Since this is a Shymalan movie you know it will probably be dark, but you also know that good will triumph eventually, and this does indeed have one of his patented twist endings sort of. While the general principle of the movie showed promise I felt it lacked in a few key areas. The behavior of these people was odd from the start, but only enhanced after they figured out what was going on. It seemed like a lot of questionable decisions for a lot of questionable reasons. Shyamalan seems to realize that people are going to poke holes in the plot and goes out of his way to try to answer all those questions, or perhaps he asks those questions so he sets about answering them all in the story. For example there seems to be only three ways off the beach: climb rocks, through a slot canyon and the water, and he ensures he addresses all of them. The main issue with the story is the ultimate reason for all this. When you find out when the resort lured these people to the beach instead of a jaw dropping reaction it is more like really? All that for this? The premise is cumbersome and too convoluted for its own good. They rationalize and justify, but to me it didn't make a whole lot of practical sense, and thus, once again, Shyamalan provides a film with a more than decent setup but cannot stick the landing which, to some degree, ruins the entire film. I started by saying he was still seeking to capture that lightning in a bottle that was 'The Sixth Sense' and this unfortunately is another swing and a miss.Eric's Grade: D.",Old

Night film, interesting concept with poor execution, poor writing/character motivations, and a few WTF absurd moments.Plot holes? Yeah, we got em! Here are a few notable ones I noticed:-They mention nails and hair don't grow rapidly due the cells already being dead in them. Okay. Then why did all the dead bodies rapidly decompose?-The fact that these 6-11 year old kids made the connection from that word puzzle that they should swim thru the coral was extremely far fetched.-The 2 6-year old kids...did it? Really? In like 2 minutes?-Apparently you can perform MAJOR abdominal surgery to remove a huge tumor with a hunting knife and it'll just be no problem at all?-You're telling me 72 previous groups went missing on their vacations and it NEVER led back to this place?

Way too many sequences of people just...standing there and starting. A multitude of accents all speaking at once. Or how about all the nice weird camera angles in an attempt to create fake suspense?All this wouldn't have ruined the film for me by itself, until the film just fell in on itself towards the end.The knife slashing insane guy who was very clumsily ""fighting"" the lead protagonist? Or his model wife...twisting herself into a pretzel because she had a calcium deficiency? No. Sorry Mr. Night, nothing like that would be remotely physically possible, even in the context of this film.

161,theredsky,Old Review,4,30 July 2021,"A fun and enjoyable film but isn't very good. This feels like a M. Night Shyamalan movie in both a good and bad way. Conceptually, the idea is really interesting. There are a ton of cool ideas that are being tossed around here and some of them feel cool and others feel half baked. The cinematography is really great at points but the editing and some shots can be nauseating. The performances all ALL over the place. The mother is awful while Thomasin McKenzie is weird but the schizophrenic Doctor is great. It's just weird that there is almost no consistency within the performances and writing. The moral implication of some of these ideas are really weird. If a child ages rapidly, do they have the concept of consent. I say this because one of the children that ages gets pregnant from one of the other kids. It's really really weird at points like that. M. Night is known to have some cool twists, either really great or so bad that it's funny, but this was fine. It wasn't earth shattering but it was an interesting idea. Some of the dialogue is laughable bad at points and the film doesn't always make sense. There is one person on the beach who has been there for a while but he doesn't age like the other characters and it's never explained. There is also an issue with how stabbing works in this film but that dives too much into spoilers about the film.

Normally I like vacation movies like ""Six Days, Seven Nights,"" ""National Lampoon's Vacation,"" and ""Police Academy 5"" and this was a decent summer diversion. Just different enough from the other Shyamalan movies to be entertaining. The beginning is really slow and the final third of the movie is where the story really picks up.

165,jaredpahl,Same Old Tricks from M. Night Shyamalan,7,30 July 2021,"M. Night Shyamalan is finally back from an interminable detour into comic-book hokum with another of his speciality. A high-concept thriller. Old is the kind of movie that can be pitched in one tantalizing sentence. In this case: A group of people become stranded on a beach where they age at an enormous rate. From there, anything goes. Old has the makings of the best kind of movie. The sort where at any point, any shocking, amazing, disturbing, illuminating thing can happen. It has Shyamalan back in a filmmaking groove that we haven't seen since his under-heralded The Village over 15 years ago. Old is a fine original thriller. It could have been great.There is a great satisfaction in seeing an artist like Shyamalan returning to what we love him for. The man's talents as a clever (if awkward) writer, and his gift for unsettling an audience were largely wasted in his last two films. Here again, is a concept to stand with his best. Old's mysterious beach provides a horrifying idea. What if you were forced to watch your time on Earth race past you and your family while powerless to stop it? That's a powerful dilemma. A situation that is frightening on its surface, but given a little bit of thought, a symbolic sort of nightmare. It's an intensified version of our worst fears about aging, regret, and death. And most of all, it's a limitless horror playground for Shyamalan. M. Night treats the concept like a great puzzle box, dolling out clues, twisting us through a complicated set of secrets, and rewarding close attention.What he forgets to do is give proper attention to those deeper themes. Shyamalan goes to a lot of trouble explaining what's going on on the strange beach. We, as well as the characters themselves, end up with a solid pseudo-scientific idea of what the beach is and how it works. It's clear that a lot of thought was put into the expositional elements. And the concept ends up relatively airtight by the universe's rules. But the act of knowing drains out the potential impact. Had the beach been more of an unexplained scientific phenomenon than a puzzle to be solved, Old could have been something far more existentially dreadful. Its most unsettling moments come early when the characters scramble to understand something so profoundly bizarre. The shock is palpable. We have to provide the dread. Shyamalan allows for those big ideas on life to seep into his science-fiction horror story, but he does so without really cultivating them. I definitely chewed on some chilling ideas while I watched Old. I thought of how I would react had I been on the beach, how I might comfort myself with the thought that anyone could have died any time before or after that day, how nobody is guaranteed old age. But those thoughts came to me disconnected from the movie. The characters are too concerned with the physical challenge of surviving and escaping the beach to bother with such things.There is a twist, one I won't spoil except to say that it is clever but not exactly shocking. This isn't The Sixth Sense where the story switcharoo is the point of the movie. We pretty much ""get"" what Old's twist is from the start. Shyamalan doesn't conceal it. The final act is simply an answer to the ""why"". I smiled, nodded, and gave a silent, polite clap when I found out.Where Old fits into M. Night Shyamalan's career arc, I can't say. He's now emerged, fallen from grace, and come back more times than I can keep track of. I maintain that the Shyamalanissaince began with The Visit and stalled with Split. Others may say Split was the real re-emergence. Glass might have been a masterpiece or a stinker depending on who you ask, and the same can be said for Old. I don't know. But his latest film, an original adaptation disconnected from anything else, is good, robust entertainment. It's a movie by a filmmaker, not a brand manager. M. Night wants to play a game with us, and that game is respectably thrilling. If the bar was ""Exciting summer thriller"", Old clears it. But the bar here is higher. The greatness potential is there in plain sight, and the film doesn't get there.75/100.",Old

Intriguing settings and scenery amplify the overall presentation and the cgi use is frighteningly brilliant.

It's just a strange beach that you can't escape from (like time and death, you can try to cheat it but you can't escape it eventually).When I first saw that Shyamalan was making a movie based on Sandcastle, I was very excited. Then came the trailer.... And finally the movie....
That was so ridiculous and awfully done! I'm really angry with Shyamalan for ruining an amazing story. Shame on him!",Old

176,julieshotmail,"Is Mr. M. Night getting ""Old""?",1,20 October 2021,"This movie is shockingly bad, especially coming from a critically-acclaimed director who has given us some suspense gems over the years. In ""Old,"" it's bad all over the place: bad acting, bad editing, asinine script, questionable directing and camera work. The location isn't even that spectacular like in ""The Beach."" I am hoping as the movie progresses that the bad acting is somehow intentional for effect, but no, sadly that is not the case. Each actor delivers their lines like they are just rehearsing for a high school play. The supposedly suspenseful parts are comically predictable. Ruined by my high expectations, ""Old"" just reveals that M. Night has lost it.",Old
177,catfanatic888,It's all in your own perspective...I was moved,7,9 October 2021,I am a fan of our director but I will admit this wasn't a perfect film. I could be picky and point out things that I didn't like but then it wasn't really a horror film. There was mystery though. I kept trying to figure it out while I was watching it. It kept my attention throughout and the last 15-20 minutes really moved me emotionally. Maybe it's all in your own perspective whether you will like this movie or not. I liked it.,Old
178,andrewrye-06535,Don't expect much and it's ok,4,16 September 2021,"I liked the premise and it must have been a hard movie to get right, unfortunately they didn't really get it right. So you have to ignore the short comings to watch it and enjoy.M Night S. Makes great movies or stinkers and this falls towards stinker. A pity, he is due another great movie but just can't get there. It felt like a short story padded to a movie length. The ideas ran out quite quickly and things seem to have been thrown in as an answer to questions that weren't asked and perhaps should have been. Like the reason for no hair or nail growth. That was daft as the dead girl who was in the water decayed in no time. They all age at different rates and Charles (Rufus Sewell) didn't seem to age at all. The original black guy was there all night and no aging. And although they found rusty cutlery proving non-live items also age and decay, the food they brought was still fresh. I'm sure there are plenty of other issues (like clothes) but as I said, it must have been hard to do this style of story without continually trying to explain why things did or didn't happen. It would have been better or at least saved a lot story time to just say they didn't know why they aged or acknowledge that they all age differently and left it to be explained at the end.Getting very tired of Hollywood casting inappropriate aged actors when their ages mattered. The 2 children (started at about 5 yrs apart and were 1 year in their teens) were played by actors in there 20s. Trent at 15 was played by a 24yo, and Trent at 50 was played by a 38yo?? Kudos for casting Maddox as an adult by a 56yo actress, spot on the money. It's just a shame adult Trent & Maddox couldn't pull off acting as 6 & 11yos. Couldn't really see the cop accepting the adult Trent and Maddox as 6 & 11 yo so readily if at all. The baby scene didn't really come off as the kids should have been about 11 if Maddox was 16. Should have been left out, but there you go.There was no real tension, and no horror and there could easily have been both. I think this is the way it was filmed and with better actors and writing it could have easily drawn you in to the point of ignoring the failings. The cameras frequent panning gave you the impression it was going to do a big reveal, and it never came off, so a bit anti-climatic from a plot device POV.So, a 4 for an original story line and wanting me to go get the book and see if that's a better read.",Old
179,cappiethadog,The ballad of an island,9,10 August 2021,"It was only supposed to be a three-hour tour, as the song goes, but the Howells packed enough clothes to last a lifetime on ""Gilligan's Island"", the CBS sitcom about the shipwrecked survivors of the S. S. Minnow, who stayed lost for three seasons(1964-1967) in black and white, then color. Creator Sherwood Schwartz pitched the show as a social psychological experiment to network executives. When M. Night Shyamalan read ""Sandcastle"", the graphic novel by Pierre Oscar Levy and Frederick Peeters, he wrote a script that suggests an updated ""Gilligan's Island"", a ""Gilligan's Island"" with a ""Lost""-like sensibility. Playing the hotel van driver, Shyamalan posits himself as a stand-in for Schwartz, who films the people that the hotel manager(Gustaf Hammarsten) preselected for medical testing. From the van driver's point-of-view, it's like he's shooting a reality show about drug trials. Technically, it's the pilot. Nobody is expected to be alive for the second episode. Like any television show or film, time is truncated, but here, the aging process exists in an accelerated space-time continuum. Prisca Cappa(Vicky Krieps), a museum curator, found the unnamed resort on a tropical island she tells Guy Cappa(Gael Garcia Bernal), her husband, an insurance adjustor, as being ""better than Cancun."" She'll come to rue this assessment. The secluded beach that the hotel manager conspiratorially recommends to the Cappa family, turns out to be a sort-of movie set they can't escape from.Three is the magic number. The van driver drops Prisca and Guy, along with their two children, Maddox(Alexa Swinton) and Trent(Nolan River) at the site. He hands Guy a picnic basket that, in the father's estimation, contains too much food. Three, accent on the three, children, including Kara(Kylie Begley), the daughter of a surgeon and swimwear model, is the flimsy excuse for the inordinate amount of provisions, similar to all the different outfits that Thurston(Jim Backus) and ""Lovey""(Natalie Schafer) preened against the foliage in presumed humidity, whereas the other castaways wore the clothes on their backs throughout the show's entire run. Three hours, incidentally, is all the time that some of the hotel guests will get. From the audience's vantage point, as these unsuspecting people wind their way through a passageway cut through a mysterious rock formation, the distance between the resort and the beach acts as a performative shipwreck since the beach, for all intents and purposes, is an uncharted desert isle. Nobody is looking for them. Warren and Warren, a pharmaceutical company, made sure their human test subjects left behind no trace of their movements. They're beagles. Not coincidentally, if you subtract the minors; the adults, including rap star Mid-Sized Sedan(Aaron Pierre), the lone survivor from the last group, total seven, as in seven castaways.As it turns out, each guest has a physical ailment, ranging from Prisca's potentiality for stomach cancer(her benign tumor, the hotel manager knows, will turn malignant in sped-up time) to epilepsy, in which Patricia Carmichael(Nikki Amuka-Bird), to the hotel resort's luck, has a grand mal seizure on the patio, and is handed an experimental drug, just like Prisca, disguised as a cocktail. Also, Chrystal(Abby Lee), the doctor's trophy wife, has a calcium deficiency, whereas Charles(Rufus Sewell), the grandiose surgeon, battles schizophrenia. The hotel manager guesses right that Charles wouldn't get along with Mid-Sized Sedan. The doctor acts a little more violently than The Skipper(Alan Hale Jr.) hitting Gilligan(Bob Denver) on the head with his sailor's cap. ""Old"" is especially smart about debunking stereotypes. Agnes(Kathleen Chalfant), the doctor's mother, barely registers what her daughter-in-law has to say, dismissing Chrystal as an airhead, but the blonde bombshell, a sort of Ginger(Tina Louise), turns out to be the smartest one on the beach. Chrystal was in favor of rejecting the VIP treatment, preferring instead, a yacht rental. When Mid-Sized Sedan's friend(both suffered from multiple sclerosis) washes up on the beach, dead, the other adults to varying degrees, are suspicious of his alleged role he played in the woman's death. His stage-name, however, provides a clue to his middle-upper class background, which is unfair, since inner-city appellation shouldn't categorically designate you as a menace. Ironically, in the end, it's Charles who poses the greatest threat to Prisca's family.""Old"", which goes unremarked upon by the filmmaker in any number of press junkets and formal interviews, has more in common with ""Gilligan's Island"" than Peter Weir's ""Picnic on Hanging Rock"", whose influence is largely visual. In particular, ""Old"" recalls ""The Castaways on Gilligan's Island"", directed by Earl Bellamy, the made-for-television movie in which Thurston Howell turns the ""uncharted desert isle"" into a resort. It was the penultimate film in the unofficial comeback trilogy, following up on the heels of ""Rescue from Gilligan's Island"". The Professor(Russell Johnson), don't ask me how, thatched together their rafts and turned it into one giant raft, in anticipation of a hurricane, he just knew, would catapult them onto the open ocean. In due time, a helicopter spots their hut-cum-raft, inspiring The Skipper to declare those immortal words: ""After fifteen years, we're finally rescued."" ""Rescued"" is repeated six times. It's not an echo; it's emotion. Maddox and Trent, their adult selves(Embeth Davidz and Emun Elliott), likewise, end up in a helicopter, but not before they escape their doomed fates by swimming to the coral. With his binoculars, the van driver watches for the ""kids"" to resurface. Arguably, he doesn't wait long enough. The van driver, perhaps, didn't like the violent confrontation between the surgeon and rap artist, agreeing with Sidney(Matthew Shear), the lead scientist, who complains to his boss that test subjects with physical and psychological ailments should be separated. It's an ethical breech. On a filmic level, it's favoring spectacle over narrative. Mid-Sized Sedan's murder was a gratuitous act of violence. The van driver wants the ""show"" cancelled.Only yesterday, Maddox and Trent were kids, which is how you feel when you're old. Near the end, their father says something Gilligan-like, when sitting with their similarly aged mother, observes: ""There's no place I'd rather be than here on the beach."" At the end of ""Rescue from Gilligan's Island"", the titular character seems happy, when the S. S. Minnow II implausibly shipwrecks on the same island. ""We're home,"" Gilligan observes.44 years.44 years those kids lived on that beach. Trent buried his stillborn child and the mother of that child, Kara(Eliza Scanlen) on that island. Maddox sang to her mother just before she passed.They were together for a little while.They were together for a long time.Time can be like that.",Old
180,BijeshNagesh,Simplified Suspense,8,9 October 2021,"The 2021 ""Old"" movie continues the fine trend of bizarre, seemingly complicated, potently symbolic, and thoroughly entertaining stories that have sourced from the brilliant brain of the one and only M. Night Shyamalan.Bright and beautiful locations belied dark stories and scenarios that beset a set of disparate characters in ""Old"". The plot twisted 'neatly' and in time, without undue rush or contrivance. There was an impending sense of 'doom and gloom', one that swelled until it reached a crescendo of true horror and helplessness.Complex themes gradually unfolded in this movie, which I believe its original trailer gave away too much of. Regardless, the film still held worth and value as one of Night Shyamalan's 'signature' projects.The story itself was not an original IP, but based on the graphic novel ""Sandcastle"" by Pierre-Oscar Lévy and Frederik Peeters. Night took the screenplay reins, and made it work for the screen.All the cast members did good work. There was nothing exceptional to say about any one of them, but that's not a bad thing. They were playing full-fledged characters, after all, and their characters drew me in more than the performers themselves. A nod to Night's directorial skills right there.The characters were: Gael García Bernal as Guy, Vicky Krieps as his wife Prisca, Rufus Sewell as the doctor Charles, Alex Wolff as young Trent (Guy and Prisca's son), Thomasin McKenzie as young Maddox (Guy and Prisca's daughter), Abbey Lee as Chrystal (Charles's companion), Nikki Amuka-Bird as Patricia, Ken Leung as her husband Jarin, Eliza Scanlen as the young Kara (Charles and Abbey's daughter), and Aaron Pierre as rapper-on-a-zen-retreat Mid-Sized Sedan. The much younger and remarkably older versions of some of these characters also played their parts well.Trevor Gureckis's musical scoring was subtle and soft when needed and dramatic at other times. The way he balanced natural sounds with specific tonal compositions truly worked its own magic on my all-too-human sense of dire suspense.The makeup department did an excellent job on each character's aging transitions. The 'members of Trial-73' were given all the attention to detail needed (not a penny more, not a penny less) to communicate the message that they were aging unnaturally, notwithstanding the personal medical conditions they already brought with them before arriving on the beach.Mike Gioulakis's cinematography felt larger than life. His pan and aerial shots were outstanding, and so were all the sequences were he got 'personal', dragging my attention and fixing it on the plight of each of the characters stuck on the beach, getting unnaturally older, unnaturally quickly, and unable to find a way out of their grave predicament.""Old"" was a thrill and delight to watch. Suffice to say I will never look at beach resorts the same way again. The film just kept getting better, darker, more frightening, and more suspenseful. It was entertaining, sometimes beyond words. The story may not have been original, having been adapted and all that, but the classic Night Shyamalan touch made all the difference in setting this movie apart from others like it in the genre.",Old

And then, some of the characters started talking. Ever disliked a movie because the dialogues were bad? Things went downhill from there. Had they just STHU, the movie would have had only logic to complain about, which also went downhill from the halfway mark.MNS has made 14 movies since 1992, I feel like the only good one people talk about is still The Sixth Sense from 1999.

The acting in this movie is awful, it's awkward and feels fabricated, same thing goes for the dialogue it is horribly written and every line felt forced, M. Night really needs a co-writer. This movie probably has one of the laziest character introduction ever, they just set up the kids to go around and ask people their name and occupation, really M. Night can't you come up with something better. I think I was supposed to feel bad for the characters but instead I'm suffering with them, I was in complete agony and I just wanted the movie to end.

There was no real back story given for any of the characters before they end up on the mysterious beach so I honestly felt no connection to them or cared when things happened throughout the course of the film.There is an episode of The X-Files from season 2 called Død Kalm that deals with a mysterious ageing plot and it was MUCH better than this film.,Old

For better or worse, OLD is an interesting watch. It has a fun, original concept and some genuinely gorgeous cinematography. The weird thing is, there is so much bad in this movie: bad acting, weird edits, baffling cinematography and story choices, weird dialog etc. But, it kind of adds to the film's charm and quirkiness. I will defend the merits of ""so bad it's good"" movies until I'm blue in the face and this movie hits more than it misses in that regard.I'd also argue that it gets better - if dumber - towards the end.TL;DR: A movie like this sticks out in a sea of banal sameness.The Bad: Where do I start? The acting and dialog are so bizarre in this film; most of the actors (who are foreign btw) come off as these socially uncalibrated robots who don't seem to have their reaction dials set right. The performances are so bad here, for the most part, and it's probably to due with Shymalan's terrible dialog and lack of skill directing actors. It sounds weird to say, but this guy has been making films for 30 years now and he seemed to have peaked in the beginning in this regard.The editing can be quite odd and confusing at times. Characters speak at each other at times. The plot is confusing and full of holes (my friends and I picked out at least 15 on the drive home). And the twist! Shymalan has pigeonholed himself into this stupid formula that really doesn't make sense or pay off here.The Ugly: I don't know if I've seen anything as nearly as awkward as this movie in a WHILE.

193,ObsessiveCinemaDisorder,A good supernatural Twilight Zone-style thriller if you go along with it. Won't turn anybody who dislike M. Night's movies.,7,11 August 2021,"Old, M. Night Shyamalan's latest supernatural thriller, is a feature-length Twilight Zone episode that explores its Benjamin Button-like themes rigorously, pushing its central allegory through suspense and occasional ridiculousness to the finish line. Under M Night's heavy-handed direction, the ideas, while intriguing, are more telegraphed than shown. It works best if audiences go unassumingly along with it.Guy and Prisca Cappa, a married couple on the brink of divorce, take their children Maddox and Trent for one last family vacation at an island resort. Through the manager's recommendation, the Cappas are exclusively offered a day at a private beach accompanied by three other parties. Things turn for the worse as the group discovers they are all rapidly aging on the beach...I personally like Twilight Zone-style stories. They are thematically-driven stories that are allegorical and fable-like in nature. The cancellation of Jordan Peele's two-season revival of The Twilight Zone has me to believe that 2020 audiences find this style to be on-the-nose and antiquated.Outdated or not, theme-driven storytelling has always been M. Night Shyamalan's comfort zone. His two best films are The Sixth Sense and Unbreakable, where he was able to mend the themes, plot, and characters together in balance. As time went on, intentional or not, Shyamalan has progressively veered towards the theme.That's both a strength and a weakness in Old. I was eating up all the suspense and atmosphere throughout the movie, all the time wondering which direction this story and what these characters would do.The cast does a great job despite having to work with stilted dialogue, especially the children who sound too witty for their age. The actors seem constricted to serving the film's ideas, instead of deep-diving into character motivation. M. Night Shyamalan does little to hide what he wants to say and a few times I was taken out by the stiltedness of the script.As I am pointing out Shyamalan's flaws, he's been so consistent through his body of work I have come to accept them as part of his artistic voice. M Night writes his own material, experiments with his own ideas, and always swings for the fences. He shoots his films with old school values, preferring the long rehearsed takes with stretched silences to build suspense over rapid cuts.Old is not for everyone. People who dislike M Night Shyamalan's films will not be swayed. A choice audiences have to make is whether to go along with M. Night Shyamalan.I did. I liked the metaphor in Old and the conclusion the idea arrived at.",Old
194,alexscott-35299,Alex Wolff... your better than this!,4,1 August 2021,"This movie looked really interesting and I really like Shyamalan most of the time so I thought this a must watch, I saw that it had Alex Wolff in it and I really liked him In hereditary so I thought this would be a good watch. While the idea of the movie is really interesting and with the right script it could have been really good it just failed the execution. The acting (other than Alex Wolf) was just absolutely god awful, from a universal film with a well known director, how on earth did they not get some bigger names in this film, the actors are pretty unknown and they can't act for their lives, their line delivery is poor and cringe worthy at times which yes didn't help due to the bad script but still the acting in this is just terrible. Alex Wolf is the shining star in this as he does a great job at delivering his emotion in this role and does a great job just like he does in all of his roles, it's embarrassing for the other actors that this kid who is a pretty new actor makes them all look even worse than they already were. I will give the film this, the camera work is great, there are some great shots in this and I loved some of the swooping wide shots of the beach. The effects are also very good and the ageing effect worked really well on the older actors. All in all I just think this movie is boring and not even worth a watch, it's an interesting idea yeah but trust me it gets extremely boring extremely quickly. I really expected better!",Old

Night Shyamalan's ""Old"" in cinemas now.It's a chilling, mysterious new thriller based on a Graphic novel from a decade ago...""Sandcastle"" by Frederick Peeters and Pierre-Oscar Levy.It's a refreshing take on disaster films of the 70's where you get to know the characters first before they are plunged into their adventure of death and destruction.Essentially its about a family on a tropical holiday who discover that the secluded beach where they are relaxing for a few hours is somehow causing them to age rapidly - reducing their entire lives into a single day.M. Night was keen to explore ageing and its effects in a micro system (the beach) with other other couples and families who have physical and mental health issues.He also felt the subject matter of this film mirrored the isolation people are dealing with during the Coronavirus Pandemic and of being in lock-down and the uncertainty that creates in not being able to leave your home, State or Country.""Old"" was actually filmed during the height of World War C on a beach in the Dominican Republic and marks the first time he has shot entirely outside Greater Philadelphia since 1992's ""Praying With Anger"".Along with that comes the horror, drama, mystery and thriller elements he's famous for as a director and writer...with plenty of jump scares and gore.Shyamalan's masterpieces for me are ""Split"", ""The Visit"" and of course ""The Sixth Sense"" and there are links to his bigger cinematic universe at the end of this motion picture.If ""Old"" feels remarkably like the Australian classic ""Picnic At Hanging Rock"" that's because it was one of the films cast and crew were told are the biggest influence in both style and tone for what he wanted on this film.The other movie being Nicholas Roegs' ""Walkabout"".Also shot in Australia.In its purest essence this a story about humans struggling against the overwhelming power of nature...where nature itself becomes something mysterious, overwhelming and almost supernatural.By the way the movie title that Charles cannot remember (played by English actor Rufus Sewell) is The Missouri Breaks which has no bearing on this plot line.Lookout for: Clint Eastwoods daughter Francesca as Madrid.Body count: 12 (including a dog)

I felt his last film Split was absolutely terrible, generic & accessible garbage.I went into this one with some excitement while knowing that it wasn't faring well with either critics or audiences. But Split did, so who knows?Anyway, immediate comparisons were made to the cringe-worthy TV show The White Lotus, which I quickly got past. I don't see many people point it out but the audio was absolutely pathetic. Constant wall of waves, background score even while characters are speaking softly made this quite a task. Add to the fact that the camera worrk is quite ridiculously overt the top, especially in scenes where it borders on parody. There are some jokes thrown in and everyone acts like they have had a few IQ points shaved off them. This doesn't bode well for a film that wannts you to take it seriously in a premise quite far fetched. There are ways to build an atmosphere of isolation and chaos simultaneously to portray a real and present danger. Lost, which it will be compared to, did that so well. The ending is so rushed and amateurish that the less said the better. Maybe with better/established/credible actors helming some roles would have helped suspend the disbelief: the young, vacationing policeman who gets it all under control swiftly, the creepy resort owner to name a few who conveniently reveals the backstory out of nowhere.

Night Shyamalan's track record, I set very low expectations and was going to wait until this hit streaming platforms, and avoided spoilers...but because I was so interested in the premise I gave in after a month and just went to see this in the theater last night.It starts off strong and drops lots of hints in the very first 15 minutes which is finally realized with - you guessed it - a plot twist. I get M. Night is a one-trick pony but I'm always a sucker for it.I think most of his stories and twists are clever but... this movie could've been 1000x better. The whole middle is just a gigantic mess, acting and script-wise. I typically like the cinematography in M. Night's movies but there's some real bizarre camera work in this one that really took me out of the moment. Unfortunately, it is the acting that knocks this down the greatest number of pegs. I think during the filming this movie they really didn't get the coverage and had to edit together whatever they got out of the actors in a rushed schedule and wrap it up because the performances were so disjointed, that is the only explanation. There was a a lot of potential here and the set and settings were beautiful but, in the end it's just another good story with a decent twist....poorly executed. The whole ends up being worse than the sum of its parts, sadly..This movie would've been way better played out as a miniseries. The plot demands a fast pace, but too much is condensed into less than two hours to try and flesh out a something meaningful, well-sculpted and with great acting. If you're looking for a real similar story with an appropriate look/feel and tone...watch the first season of ""Homecoming"" on Amazon Prime. I feel like 6-8 half hour episodes would've worked much better off to tell this story.I promised myself to not go on an M. Night Shyamalan bashing spree here...but you'd think after almost 3 decades in the movie industry, he would be able to fire on all cylinders...but it seems like every movie he has released after 2004 save for ""Split"" and ""The Visit"", there is just something that is just blatantly wrong with his cinematic engine and he doesn't seem to realize it until it's too late.",Old
201,MovieWarfare,Enticing premise but terrible dialogue and writing ruin it,3,2 October 2021,"M. Night Shyamalan is such a fascinating director, you never know what you're going to get with him. He has made some of the most memorable movies with the best twist in cinema history and he has made some of the worst movies I have ever seen. It's like a flip of a coin, the head is good and the tail is a bad movie situation. The premise of Old is ""A family on a tropical holiday who discover that the secluded beach where they are relaxing for a few hours is somehow causing them to age rapidly reducing their entire lives into a single day"". So does Old (2021) land on heads or tails?Firstly, I love the idea and concept of this movie. The idea of a thriller and mystery story about a beach that ages people is such a unique concept. I also like the themes that are explored, such as people being too focused on the past or the future instead of the present, people's mortality and family dynamic changing with time. There are also some genuinely unnerving scenes, such as a surgery scene and some deaths that are just unsettling to watch. M Night also succeeds in creating a tense situation with the characters. They try a bunch of logical stuff to try and get off the island but it doesn't work so you're engaged on how they are going to get off the island. Additionally, some other characters are acting weird which makes creates a tense situation for our main leads. I also have to praise Alex Wolff and Thomasin McKenzie who play aged up versions of the kids. They have to maintain the young kid mentality which they certainly conveyed from their performance.However, every other actor just gives such an unconvincing performance with terrible delivery. The actors all give such a bland performance with barely any tone in their voice, like a robot. This is partially due to the terrible writing and dialogue. No one seems to speak like an actual normal human being which makes the movie very off-putting. Some dialogue is so cheesy that it is actually kind of funny, even though the scene is clearly not meant to be. There are some exposition scenes where the characters are in a circle and discussing what is going on, which is just ridiculous. A fair amount of the characters make points about what is going on that is definitely right but is something people would not logically jump to at first thought. M. Night also returns with a twist ending, if you could even call it that as it was quite predictable. The ending is very lacklustre and even ruins the tone that was set throughout by making the movie become something different instead.Overall, Old (2021) lands on the tail this time. By this point, I believe someone should let M. Night direct and create the ideas but not let him write the script whatsoever. It is still disappointing to see that even after all these years M. Night still doesn't understand how to write dialogue as Old is one of the worst in terms of dialogue. The enticing premise is able to keep you engaged but everything else is so poor that it's difficult to completely recommend this movie. Hopefully, next time M. Night is able to deliver a good movie because this is not it, unfortunately.",Old
202,Stream2BigScreen_Movie_Reviews,Old Attempts Something New,6,23 July 2021,"Happy weekend, Streamers! The much-anticipated new movie from M. Night Shyamalan, Old, was released in theaters July 23, 2021. Shyamalan has a weird reputation marred by directorial inconsistencies from the highs of The Sixth Sense and Unbreakable to the lows of The Last Airbender and The Happening. From his filmography, the one thing you can say about Shyamalan is that he swings for the fences. In that regard, Old is no exception. I am usually up for giving Shyamalan a chance to surprise me. Here's how he did with Old.Shyamalan wrote the screenplay for Old based on a graphic novel. The story centers on a family, who takes a trip to a resort and ends up on an idyllic, secluded beach that isn't what it seems. Very soon, the family, who are joined by fellow travelers to the resort, begins to realize that strange things are happening at the beach - mainly, the children begin to age rapidly. Then, they have to figure out what's going on on this beach and why they cannot seem to leave. Shyamalan focuses on the emotional dynamics of the parents and children layering a family drama on top of the creepy thriller, and both sides are moderately successful.The parents of the main family are played by Gael Garcia Bernal and Vicky Krieps. They are both fine, though I don't believe them as any kind of couple. Bernal and Krieps, especially, do well with showing their growing concern about this strange beach as well as balancing the simmering turmoil underneath the surface of their marriage. Rufus Sewell and Aaron Pierre play pivotal roles as fellow travelers stranded on this beach. Each has creepy moments that they play to the hilt giving Old a horror movie edge that it needs.Really, Old suffers because it feels like the movie is biding its time searching for an explanation to its premise. The dialogue throughout does too much forecasting about what's to come without being more than just obvious breadcrumbs of things to come. There is one scene that addresses the emotional stakes of the movie, but it comes late in the game so hopefully you're still attuned to what the film wants to say - particularly about aging. Unfortunately, the angst that is displayed as the film moves towards its finale does not pay off as it should - even though the cast does its best.Ultimately, I cannot recommend paying even matinee prices for Old. I say grabbing a handful of popcorn should do it for Old as it's not worth braving the confines of a dark theater. While there is an interesting premise here, Old does not rise above the level of window-dressing even though some actors really give their all. Give Old a shot when it appears on a streaming service - you may thank me.",Old

Only red line being they are getting old and how to get off the beach. I understand that character development wasn't necessary, however I didn't discover all the illnesses.

Overall: 45/100
IMDb: 4/10
Letterboxd: 2/5***This review is based solely on the film and not on the book for which it is adapted from***I was rather disappointed with this film. I found the length of the film to be too long for what it offered. Too much hysteria for my liking (It was too often and unnecessary for where it happened). The film wasn't very thrilling though it was rather dramatic. I also didn't like the constant rotating camera angles around objects or characters to give the impression of chaos. I would have liked to have physically seen the incidents unfold. Truthfully, I was left emotionally empty and I wouldn't really recommend anyone to see this in theatres. The overall premise of the film seemed like a good idea, but ultimately it didn't hit a home run, much less a base hit.Had the film been shorter and more to the point throughout it could've been more enjoyable. The kids seemed to still have their minds as adolescents and so as they accelerated in age and changed body dynamics could've maintained that youthful thought process. The adults could've remained the same actors, but with more age acceleration given to their bodies instead of a slight wrinkle here and there.The gist, too long of a movie that wasn't very thrilling and didn't provide much emotional progress. I'd say pass on this film until it is released on a streaming service. That's all for now....Enjoy the show!",Old

215,FixedYourEnding,"Full of ""plot holes"" but still worth the watch",6,22 October 2021,"From ""Old"" trailer you can already figure out what this movie is about, people rapidly aging on a beach. Unfortunately in the 2+ hours of this movie there is not much else added other then some crazy life scenes (birth of a baby, tumor removal operation) and death scenes (baby dying, mom falling off the rocks, dying of old age, multiple bone fractures etc etc) the only question left for you is ""why""? This is revealed towards the end of the movie and it makes some sense but doesn't account for the multiple un-ignorable plot-holes, such as why mid-size sedan not aging (is it because he is an actual CAR??) how does the coral stop the aging and how did they get out. Why didn't they try to walk slowly out after suggesting it, etc etc. The story tries to answer those questions for the viewers by giving some explanations ""oh, the hair doesn't grow because it is not a live tissue"", meh.Second point, can you really run an operation like that without people reporting missing people in the resort? Do you need a notebook with names to prove that? Your ""research"" cannot count as clinical trials anyway so it would not help you financially, it just doesn't make too much sense.On the flip side, this movie is different than other movies and makes you think. It could have been a lot better if it was not filmed in basically one location for 2 hrs, but it is still worth the watch if you like head-scratches. Last note - Shyamalan appears in more than a cameo in this movie, he is not a good actor, he should do it in the more Hitchcokian way and appear for just 5 seconds, no more.

At the end, we find out those answers. If this was a typical M. N. S. Movie, I wouldn't have been given enough information to ask the questions throughout.Regardless, we all know that Shyamalan's movies are hit or miss. (Generally, miss). If feel that ""Old"" was a miss because there were so many plot holes in the script and I kept getting pulled out of the movie-going experience.Note: I do not know anything about the graphic novel that this movie is based.Some of the obvious plot holes got a band-aid explanation to help resolve script problems, such as the lack of hair and fingernail growth. Ugh.Do Mom's typically bring an assortment of bathing suit sizes to the beach, in case their kids suddenly start to age rapidly? The kids should have outgrown their clothes fairly quickly. I know they had to address the issue somehow, but it seemed lame.Didn't the kids realize that they were suddenly a lot taller than they were an hour ago? They seemed surprised that the adults were looking at them oddly.Although the kids physically aged, their mental age would have remained like children, since they didn't have enough life experiences to help them mature. Yet, the maturity level seemed to increase as their aging progressed.Although the people on the beach aged a few decades in a short amount of time, didn't they need an equivalent amount of food?The rusty knife scene was silly.Soooooo many more problems with this movie.I didn't really care for most of the characters.I'm not sure why I still go to M.

Instead what I got out of it was a refreshingly wacky thrill ride of anxieties and amusingly genuine contrivances that are all awkward, terrifying, and and/or amusing. I viewed this as an art film and it doesn't shy away from having a sense of humor and wonder, to it. It is both bizarre, beautiful, and horrifying, at different times, just like life can be at times. It is also fiction and willing to be absurdist or abstract. This film is like a full lengh movie of an Outer Limits or some kind of episode from some 70s anthology but done with a better budget and a little cinematic flare. The sound score and cinematography wasn't boring, I liked the whole thing, albeit there was some more goofier parts for sure that might fall apart under a second watch. The Ending made me absolutely laugh out loud and go in to an unexpected laughing fit. Walking out of the theater everyone was smirking because I was straight up dying, just the one liner that it ended with and the whole concept having unravelled was trippy, absurd, and tongue in cheek. I really believe M. Night was back on his game with this one I was definitely delighted by the absurd experience.

233,jimwt66,OK if you can get past the flawed time tables,5,9 October 2021,"When they cut the woman open her cut closed and completely healed over within 5 seconds. It normally takes 2-3 weeks for a cut to completely heal like that if not longer. So let's say 5 seconds is 2 weeks that is 28 years in an hour. They said it an hour was 2 years. Most of them should be dead by the end of the movie run time :). The black guy was supposedly there hours before everyone else and yet he doesn't seemed to have aged either the 10 years using their calculations or dead using the cut healing timeline. If a movie is going to focusI disliked the museum mom immensely and was hoping when they said she had a tumor she would be dead real soon. She was outright annoying but when she tried to say her job in the museum was somehow an indicator that she can be trusted that was really stupid.Somehow the dead bodies still decay as if time is still sped up and yet the food, clothes and other items such as towels and umbrella seem to age. The 6 year olds have a vocabulary of older people. Their bodies aged but they did not have the learning that went along with all those years.Shyamalan movies are hit or miss. Sometimes I think he tries too hard to make them confusing in hopes you cannot figure them out. Sometimes he makes them so confusing that it actually gives away the plot. The concept of the movie was interesting. The implementing that concept was flawed. But still give it a view. Even if movies have serious flaws such as not making sense they movie can still be sufficient to fill some time.They did not write the characters as very smart because they did not try some obvious actions. And supposedly the boy was 6 when he went on the beach and yet they figured out having sex and he says he thought you had to have sex 10 times before you get pregnant? WTF?

235,avenuesf,Very poorly planned and thought out,2,17 September 2021,"There's almost no way to review ""Old"" in any detail without revealing things that will inevitably be spoilers. When I first saw the trailer I was anxious to see it; I like Gael Garcia Bernal, and I'm guessing he chose this project due to M. Night Shyamalan's reputation. If that's the case, he made a poor decision. Bernal isn't really given the opportunity to show much range here anyway.There are so many details in the script that don't match up with each other that it actually became frustrating to watch. The film's premise is that a group of people are treated to a holiday at a resort owned by a pharmaceutical company, and once driven to a particular beach and left there, they begin to age very rapidly. The screenplay makes a point to draw attention to each character's profession and paints them all, especially a female psychologist, like caricatures.Despite the children quickly aging, the adults don't seem to age much at all. The makeup people have added a few wrinkles to them, but when the two main characters die from old age they don't look particularly old. Strangely, the characters also don't seem to grow more hair or beards as they age. Someone in the film states that hair and nails are ""dead tissue"" in an attempt to explain that, which is completely false.I think the most incredibly absurd scene in the film involves the characters performing ""surgery"" to remove an enlarged cancerous tumor from a female character's abdomen without the use of anesthesia or any sterile procedures (they just reach in and pull it out with their bare hands while she's lying on the beach, lol!). I couldn't comprehend that the filmmakers could actually think an audience's belief could possibly be stretched that far. They also deliver a baby on the beach shortly after, which is almost as ludicrous.I've seen a lot of horror films and this one actually depressed me with its hopelessness. The last ten minutes seem to be an attempt to tack on a more positive conclusion to satisfy the audience, but it's contrived and feels false .You're further ahead to watch the trailer but skip the film itself.

Those type of scenes were just ridiculous to watch, cause despite knowing why the old doc may have begun to act like that, it still didn't account for why those 2 young men lacked the balls to deal with him nor anything else. And those scenes with their kids lacked any depth, as well, and no one remembering that the Black lady had epilepsy, why even add that condition since it didn't add anything to the plot?The entire plot lacked depth, real content, like there was never any urgency for food or water either??Gilligan's Island has more depth, more mystery too!Thanks!",Old

I didn't think it was possible, or I was hoping it wasn't going to happen, but it looks like hell really doesn't have a bottom. Dialogues are as if written by an artificial intelligence who has never been in contact with a living person. Ever. The camerawork is snappy, self-serving, and amateur. Rendom rotations, characters out of focus or out of frame, just for the sake of it. Characters? A high school acting group would bring such figures to life! Very, very pathetic. You can't believe for a second that you're looking at real people. The story itself would be interesting (it should be noted, being an adaptation, it's not really the merit of the film either, and I'm sure they just ruined the otherwise superior concept...), but it sinks into the sea of nonsense and absurdity from the very first moment. It is an incoherent, plot hole-ridden mess (you stop tracking them like 5 minutes after our unlucky cardboard box cutouts enter the beach...), as if the script had been made on the train to shoot after a night spent drinking and drugging. The end result is ridiculous. Watching a movie directed by Shyamalan becoming more and more of a sinful pleasure, only unfortunately here the ""enjoyment"" part is somehow missed, and instead, every minute you find yourself muttering to yourself in disbelief: what the F am I watching ?!",Old

The rest of his stuff not so much and everything from The Happening was just plain rubbish. Okay Split was not bad (saved by McAvoy) but Glass was just painful.After the trailer I had high hopes that we get to see the M Knight of old, sadly the downward spiral just intensified.The acting in Old is some of the worst I have seen in a general release. It even makes Sharknado look an Academy Award winning movie (that said, the Oscar accolade means nothing these days). The directing is confusing and the wide sweeping shots that is repeated over and over again is enough to give you sea sickness.The customary ""twist in the tale"" is even more cringe than that of the The Happening.Honestly, there is nothing to see here. The 5.9 rating surprises me. This should be no more than a 4/10.M Knight should be defunded to save as all from the pain of watching his movies.",Old
251,damorejj,This movie would've worked much better as a series,5,27 July 2021,"Very original plot, great twist at the end, but poorly executed.The protagonist family find themselves invited to a secluded beach on a tropical island. They go with other guests as well, and quickly discover that things aren't normal in their seaside paradise.A body of a woman washes ashore, and is accompanied by some dude that is just awkwardly sitting in the shade when they arrive. He claims the girl was a woman he just met, and she went out for a swim (we see her skinny dip before her death). First, I don't understand why this man is fully dressed and just watches her go for a long swim and does seem to react until her dead body comes back hours later.The script seems very poorly written here. There's a lot going on at once, the older woman dies, then the dog, the children seem to age only when nobody is watching them, and with the dead woman and the odd guy on the beach she was with, why is there any moments why nobody is watching them...just very bad parenting.The mother of the family doesn't seem to visibly age at all until the final minutes on the beach, and her husband doesn't seem to age much either.The skinny blonde who is obsessed with her appearance doesn't seem to truly age either, her makeup smears and she gets some wrinkles but never truly appears older.Then we have the son, who does age (when nobody is watching) and also seems to get a darker skin tone. How exactly does that happen? Find a younger actor with the darker skin tone! The 6 year old was just so much lighter than his older counterparts.Also, we learn to find out that the beach is being used for medicine research. But nothing seems to be mentioned about the medicine given to the woman with the calcium deficiency, so I'm assuming it just didn't work.At one moment the kids seem happy and the next the son is screaming about how he's going to marry the other woman's daughter.... I mean, do you not realize you're on a surreal aging beach that you cannot escape? Just horrific dialogue here. Especially when the blonde daughter says she just got fat (like it's not a big deal at all) when she's clearly pregnant. I expected so much better from M. Night Shallaman here. The script is just dreadful.Also, the one way off the beach seems to be through the coral. But this coral is only briefly mentioned when they first get on the beach by the father. And it's never even shown until the very end. Just think that was poorly done. The cinematography is amazing but the coral is absent the majority of the movie. So it kind of kills the surprise at the end when we never really knew it was there.I just think the aging could've been done so much better here. Everything seems too rushed and sudden. The father suddenly loses his good vision. The mother suddenly goes deaf. These things should've been much more gradual. So this is why I feel this would have worked much better as a series instead of packing it into two hours.5 stars for originality, but could've been done so much better.",Old

And even that's an understatement.I nodded off so many times during this movie I can't even count.

I should have trusted by instinct and my love for Shyamalan as a writer but particularly as a director.Old is a beautiful movie - horrifying at times, sad at times, but beautiful. You can't look away and it will stay with you. As always, Shyamalan is a master of suspense and he tells a story here that is both transporting and grounded. While dealing with extreme science fiction elements and almost hypnotizing the viewer, he tells a story that is also realistic and coherent.I can't rave about it enough. Set aside time to watch the movie in full without breaks and let yourself be immersed.I've heard criticisms of the acting and the dialogue, but it all seemed fine to me.

258,darklydreamingrahu,This is Bad,3,23 August 2021,"I tried to think of a clever title for this review, but then I realized that I was spending too much time on a movie this dismal.Hey Reader, remember when The Sixth Sense gave us a legendary plot twist that had everybody talking for a whole year?Well, I'm feeling real old right about now, because that was 1999. Since then, Shyamalan has given us some of the most laughingly pretentious movies ever produced.Old is no exception.With a tacked-on twist-ending that fails every logic check along with a host of uninspired actors, you can chalk ""Old"" up as another weak Shyamalan concept film that feels like a 12-year-old asking ""what-if,"" then just full-speed running with a movie made out of the very first thought that formulated in his head.Even though I'm biased against this director because he shamelessly ruined The Last Airbender, I usually still give him a chance for his potential. There is always a whimsical and fantastical atmosphere permeating his movies, which always attracts me.Then, I'm almost always unequivocally disappointed in the effort. Really, someone needs to QA this man's ideas. Then, ask him some basic follow-up questions about his concept. That way, the entire foundation of the ""twist"" doesn't fall completely apart if a single question from any outside angle is asked.Silly expository scenes, dialogue that seems like it was written by a buggy A. I., and yawn-inducing performances round out a movie that loves the smell of its own farts more than the structural stability of its core themes and characters.I'd say that if you're inexplicably one of Shyamalan's legion of fans, then this is like a 5. It's about on par with other bricks like Lady in the Water, After Earth, or The Happening.If you're like me and see his potential, but you generally feel disappointed by Shyamalan movies, then this one won't be changing your mind.Like the three listed above, this one is about a 3/10.It's still better than the Last Airbender though.",Old

261,ksgillihan,Coral!,5,30 July 2021,"The premise for this film is a solid one. I found the trailers to be quite interesting and was looking forward to how it would all play out. It starts decently enough and kept me interested for the first 30 minutes or so. However, when people start getting old, the story and plotline deteriorate faster than bones without enough calcium.The movie is filmed in an odd way as well. I can't really put my finger on it but it just doesn't feel like classic Shamalan. As the characters get older, the story and the acting feel like they get worse. I don't know why or how we are supposed to think that if someone ages quickly, their vocal cords don't. We all know who the kids are supposed to be so why keep their voices young-sounding for half of the movie?I know this is supposed to be a thriller but there weren't a whole lot of thrills to be had. There are numerous plot holes and nonsensical things throughout the film as well. I get that the kids need lots of food to grow but don't adults need food to uh, live as well? If the timeline of aging is supposed to be believed, if any of these people didn't drink gallons of water every second, they would drop dead just from dehydration. Also, how did no one even notice hundreds of people who went missing? Many of them we were led to believe were important people as well. Not a single, solitary friend or relative tried to find out what happened to them?So eventually after people on the beach just stopped caring, the remaining two decide to ""keep trying to escape."" I would have thought that everyone else dying would have been better motivation for them. So apparently the kid from the beginning passed a note to the main character earlier. And what do you know? The note told them exactly how to escape. It was the coral! How did the coral stop the magic super-aging rocks? Who knows! They just do! I think the main issue with Shymalan is that he regularly bites off more than he can chew. Sometimes it works out and sometimes it doesn't. It didn't here.",Old

263,huntersmithx,A unique but not fully cooked summer thriller.,7,2 August 2021,"M. Night Shyamalan might be only a few directors in history who've simultaneously received as much acclaim as mockery. The next in his lineup of thrillers that eerily evoke The Twilight Zone- Old, based on the 2010 French graphic novel, is engaging right off the bat and has a wholely unique concept- a simultaneous evocation of the passage of time and horrors of old age with a Thriller concept of escaping an island before time runs out. The charasmatic Gael García Bernal has been around for a long time, and he delivers as Guy Cappa, the husband to Vicky Krieps's Prisca, the parents to children age up to young adults before their own eyes in the span of hours. The rest of the cast shine emotionally and even to our horror at times despite spurts of clunky or nearly inaudible dialogue. Old turns silly at times and doesn't quite deliver on its promising concept, nor its influence from Australian New Wave classics like Walkabout, Picnic at Hanging Rock and Jaws. Shyamalan does halfway succeed with his trademark twist ending here despite it being rushed.The critics and audiences seem to agree on Old being either decent, mediocre or even terrible; I'm in the first camp however.

Intriguing concept poorly executed. Actors spouting some inane dialog. Characters apparently based solely on their vocational careers. The board game Clue kept coming to mind as I watched this Lost wannabe.

But that's where the line draws. The execution was piss poor and it felt awfully generic that eventually it doesn't seem all that original not long into watching the movie. I also couldn't stand how one plot point doesn't connect to anything and all these random occurrences happen to basically fill in the movies time.The acting was decent at times but the writing was terrible and no one character is likeable. They try to hit you with these backstories to give the characters some life but it only makes the movie worse.The movies run time isn't very long but it feels like you're on the island with them forever with how the pacing goes. I think I had crows eyes at the end of my viewing ""experience"".A movie like this could've worked with much better writing and likeable characters and the whole ""old"" island setting could've been further explored, which I feel it might have brought more intensity to the movie, especially if there was more of backstory to the island and it's condition itself.This movie felt long with little intrigue and ultimately this movie was boring.

This movie was fairly hard to evaluate because in almost every way, there are aspects to appreciate and aspects to condemn. The core premise of the film is a good example of this because while it serves as an enticing spark to generate initial intrigue, the story eventually devolves into a pacing and tonal mess that ultimately leaves the viewer dazed and unsatisfied. Meanwhile, the cinematography stands out for being rather inconsistent as well. Some shots are quite beautiful, while other shots seem like they lost control of the camera.I could go on and on. From the acting to the visual effects, there were moments of delight and disaster. Rufus Sewell delivers a striking performance while Vicky Krieps comes across more wooden. Overall, Old possesses a few too many flaws to land as a genuine success. While there is enough here to give audience members sporadic hope, the film's end result will leave viewers pondering what could have been rather than reveling in what was provided.Writing: 5/10

There is one part maybe two that is arguably a R rated content of violence/scariness.Anyway why I think this movie is good; Old explores unexplored areas for a plot, making this movie very original. Old gives us physiological and action like intense moments. A very scary environment, storyline, and people. Old gives you an amazing sense of unease. It has a mystery for us and the movie characters to unfold. There are moments in the movie that are funny and/or emotional. And Old's setting is absolutely beautiful and astonishing.Even though there are some faults, a cheesy end, and things Old didn't quite explain enough, you can't compare the good things about Shamalan's movie to the bad.Overall Old is an extraordinary thriller horror, which I don't understand why there's so much hate for it, but I would absolutely recommend Old to anyone that can watch it!(Sorry if I spelled Shamalan wrong).",Old

One consistent thing about most of his films is that they have original and intriguing premises, and I truly respect that. This one is no different.I think this film suffers the most from a poor script, period. The dialogue is just so stilted and artificial, and it fails to make any of the characters relatable. Even the best actors in the world would struggle to make an impression with this script.It would have been so much better if they had focused more on making the characters deeper and more interesting as opposed to cursory pawns in an almost robotic story progression. Also, teasers at the end game throughout instead of clueless deaths might have helped.This film has all of the right elements, but the balance is just way off, almost like taking a nice picture and editing the brightness/exposure to stupid levels.",Old

So it gets the first five stars for that reason alone. It's rare for Hollywood to greenlight something completely original.It kept me hooked for the first act, and I was really enjoying it. But while the second act started strong, things began to unravel. I began to question some of the movie's inconsistencies, which meant I was falling out of ""suspended disbelief."" I found the third act a complete M. Night Shyamalan trope, which was predictable with his movies. He's always looking for that surprise hook at the end, but since his first movie, The Sixth Sense, he hasn't nailed it for me. The ending of Old didn't surprise me. It did delve into the ethics of doing something for the ""greater good"" at the expense of the few. A question we are asking ourselves in our pursuit of science and this era of globalism and pandemics. Is it OK to sacrifice the needs of the few for the many? Do the ends justify the means?The acting was a bit stiff at times but decent, but the characters had some depth. The movie could be looked at as a kind of metaphor for the brevity of human life and the evolution of relationships. But I'm not sure that was intentional, or I'm just reading something into the movie that wasn't really there. I'd probably have given it a higher rank had I seen it on streaming service. In a theater, this was a solid 6. Enjoyable but not memorable. With that said, compared to the junk Netflix turns out on the regular, it was a 10.If you are a fan of M.

Despite the great cast it is terribly acted, which has got to be writer/director Shyamalan's fault. If the premise is not implausible enough already, our willingness to suspend disbelief is challenged by the fact that all developments and all attempts at complexity are not woven into the action or plot but simply explained by the actors with shocked looks on their faces. ""We seem to be aging at a rapid rate."" ""I estimate about one year every thirty minutes."" ""Maybe it's something about these ancient cliffs that cause our cells to age."" There is not a shred of humanity in any of the characters, so there is absolutely no reason to care about them. There is no resonance whatsoever to the thematic elements.

The acting in the movie is awful, the characters sound like lifeless shells trying to pretend they have a soul. I have heard two A. Is more expressive than them, and that is not a joke. The character interactions are extremely strange to the point where it seems like it's not even humans having conversations. The concept is interesting, but the execution is terrible. So many scenes in the movie are so laughable, and made even more so by the fact you can tell this is intended to be serious. The death scenes in the movie are so funny because of either how dumb the logic behind them is or just how sheerly spontaneous some of the bucket kicks are. The rules of the beach don't make sense and have several scientific errors in them. The cinematography is shot like a bad music video in some parts and it WILL hurt your eyes. The characters just let other characters, including children, run around on a beach even after making disturbing discoveries about the the beach. It is not hard to guess the plot twist accurately. Me and the audience were laughing nonstop, which certainly defused any attempt the movie made at generating good suspense.

297,jaredkjacoby,Creepy and Creative,8,25 July 2021,"Old takes place at a luxurious tropical resort where a family of four plan their vacation. While Guy and Prisca seem to be estranged, their children look for others to play with. The family joins another family to take a trip to the beach. It turns out that the beach is strange as any time anyone tries to leave the way they came, they blackout and wind up back to shore. In addition, everyone starts to age much faster, especially the kids, Trent, Maddox and Kara.Love him or hate him, M. Night Shyamalan always comes up with some unique and interesting ideas for movies. I feel kind of divisive towards him. While he did make my least favorite film of all time, he has also done some great, slow-paced stories. Old was not one of my most anticipated films, but I wanted to see it because of its concept and trailer. Does it deliver on its premise? Yes it does...M. Night Shyamalan's Old is a great horror film that shows how terrifying rapid aging is in multiple ways. First of all, seeing your kids suddenly become teenagers and then eventually adults is all kinds of creepy. They still have that mindset of a child, but they are trapped in an adult's body. The most terrifying scene though is a scene involving pregnancy. Because the beach somehow causes the aging, the pregnancy process is spread up. It is just a creepy scene on every level from the fact that it is the former child that gets pregnant and how it plays out.The movie relies on its atmosphere, sound design and situations for its horror instead of jump scares, though they are there. It makes for an effective slow-burning horror story. We slowly see these people rot on the beach in pretty agonizing ways. The worst one was one towards the end of the film that I will have nightmares about. The horror elements do not consist of just gruesome imagery though. They also have health conditions that slowly get worse. One character goes blind and another gets partially deaf, making it harder to defend themselves. The script has a few twists of course. It is an incredibly creepy one to say the least. It is partially predictable in the sense that I had an idea on what was happening, but the whole scale of everything that happens makes it believable and even creepier. The only that did not work in the story is that there is this cheesy marriage drama between Prisca and Guy that comes off as forced rather than natural. Sure, it is nice to see a family that does not start off happily married, but it is not as interesting as the rest of the film. Even with this, the story is thoroughly engaging and I was glued to the film the whole time.One thing I admire about this filmmakers for this film is that they got a cast filled with lesser-known actors. The only person I recognize is Alex Wolff. For the most part, it works. The best performances came from the kids who played as Trent and Maddox. They showed a playful innocence for their characters and they never came off as trying too hard. For child actors, they came off as authentic. In general, I really liked Trent's character development. He is an innocent child that has his whole body change in hours and a few days. He still tries to make the best of it and remain optimistic. Same applies to Maddox who is the nicest character there. The film takes its time to develop and flesh out the characters, showing their weaknesses and strengths while showing their motivations of coming to the beach. Their not perfect, but it is nice to see a horror film that slows down to build character moments to help make the deaths more impactful. Even some of the smaller characters are surprisingly sympathetic. It helps that most of the acting is good. The only times it's questionable is when it involves the drama between Guy and Prisca.The cinematography is gorgeous and horrifying. It relies a lot on closeups and they work, but there are also some beautiful shots of the beach where the characters are panicking and trying to find ways to get off the beach. It has a few gruesome shots as well, especially in one of the death scenes later in the film. Shyamalan also uses cinematography to tell stories such as shots of the action figure and doll far from each other with the husband and wife in each shot. It shows how distant their relationship is in a subtle way. The night time scenes are well lit. It is not hard to see what is going on in the dark thanks to how it is filmed, but the film gets noticeably darker. The sound design is great too and it makes feel like I am part of the experience. The musical score is chilling and the sound effects are great. There is one time I heard a baby crying and I thought it was in the theater, but I realized it was in the movie. It is a small thing, but sounds that sound real make the movie so much more engaging.I was creeped out by M. Night Shyamalan's new film. Old is great for being one of those films that get under your skin by being creepy. It has the atmosphere, creativity and story of a strong horror film. The execution worked for me. I was never bored and I was curious to see what would happen next each step of the way. I feel like this movie will be remembered as one of Shyamalan's more underrated films as time passes on. I highly recommend it, especially if you need a break from all the blockbuster films coming out recently.",Old
298,ReliableReview,Fresh story clunky directing and dialogue,5,23 September 2021,This isn't much of a horror as there aren't many scares but the story is original. It would have worked better if audiences didn't know the central conceipt of the plot going in but with a title called Old and a movie poster as such you know pretty much 80% of the plot already. The twist ending isn't much of a reveal and doesn't add much to the story but it is better than the Village. I'd have to say the directing is rather poor with odd camera angles and vantage points. The dialogue is clunky as well. But all these misgivings can be overlooked as it's a fresh story which is a nice changeup from the usual totally predictable Disney superhero fare. Overall I enjoyed it but felt a better direction and sharpening of the script could have elevated the material. The twist ending in particular felt incomplete.,Old

Leaves the viewer frustrated and wondering what's actually going on. If thats what they actually wanted, then they did very well. For me, it loses its momentum several times but several good performances keeps it going through the bad singing where you are dying to see what's happening next.

304,willcrabbe,The Twilight Zone meets Stephen King in Shyamalan's best film for years,8,25 July 2021,"M. Night Shyamalan's latest film Old blends classic Twilight Zone mystique with some elements of Stephen King's work. The film follows a group of people trapped on a mysterious beach surrounded by rocky cliffs and raging waves that appears to cause them to age at an alarming rate.Shyamalan's work can be incredibly hit and miss, with films like The Sixth Sense and Unbreakable widely regarded as masterpieces, whereas films like The Happening and Avatar: The Last Airbender provided the opposite reaction from audiences. All things considered, Old must be one of the strongest films he has made since The Village. It takes a little while to get going, with some very wonky dialogue and idiosyncratic acting and line delivery, but once we arrive at the beach all of this gels together to create an exceptionally unnatural experience that really complements the central idea of the film. There's also notably some very unconventional camerawork throughout that only helps to purvey this feeling further. There were times where I felt genuine unease and anxiety as well as times where I laughed out loud - there's some very bizarre and unnerving moments from Rufus Sewell's character.Shyamalan is probably best known for the twists in his films, and in this one I felt it only served to detract from what came before. The original concept was interesting enough on its own to need the assistance of the twist. At least things that were set up during the course of the plot paid off toward the end, although I thought some of it wasn't particularly well executed. The ending was certainly the weakest point for me and reinforces the idea that in a way similar to Stephen King, Shyamalan struggles to write satisfying ends to his stories.This one has been getting mixed reviews from critics and audiences alike, but I'm definitely in the positive camp. I'd advise you go into it expecting some unconventionality, but recognise that this serves to drive the film, rather than detract from it.",Old

316,ryanlion-38514,I went to theater only because it was a Sham film,6,24 July 2021,"I never go to theatres hardly anymore, because not very movies are good. I have been a fan of M. Night Since Sixth Sense. I even had faith in him throughout some of the not so fascinating films, like the Village. I feel though he is a very inspirational director and one of a kind. I like his style, camera angles etc. At least most of the time, I think his work is worth seeing. I was disappointed with ""Split's"" ending(first half good) also with long anticipatied ""Glass."" However, it seems to be kind of the pattern at least for me. Same goes for this film for me. The concept I thought was really brilliant. Then it felt like showing it's cards a little prematurely. I agree with other users, a little too much hint early on. I mean they literally say there are camera's up there watching us. I think all of us have seen the premise of test subjects on an island or some variance of this early on. Obviously the people filming on top the hill are aware of what is going on, so that can only be bad. I felt like the pacing and camera shots were good. Although, I felt like after a million close-ups on the young girl's body parts got in your face. It was clearly intentional, nobody can be shooting t & a close ups that often by accident. Another thing that really bugged me was how the guy with nosebleed dies and this time there is scars,blood, etc. Why when he was cut on the face it heeled but repeatedly stabbed in the stomach to death, yet a different story. I could go into other potholes but won't. I think most could see the people's demise pretty early or as it unfolds. The film does manage to build suspense at times. The Doctor's wifes death to me was funny. I literally laughed out loud in theatre. I also was wondering how it would wrap up, it was pretty close to what I thought. They did manage to at least a sufficient ending even if half of the film was implausible. For this and being a fan of the director I went to go see it in theatre and I give it a 6. It did feel rushed and would of been better with a R rating. I do support the director as it seems alot of his film have a ""faith based"" vibe or moral to them.

319,afrocut,Growing stale,2,29 July 2021,"There's a fence, I can't believe said fence exists but it does. On one side of the fence there is a group of 20 somethings who grew up with M. Night Shyamalans movies as being their first foray into psychological thrillers, horror and sci fi and because of this they have held him high as some kind of misunderstood genius (the director clearly sees himself this way). And then there is the side I stand on, the side of sanity. We can see what Shyamalans movies really are, amateur vanity projects in search of a good dialogue writer, editor and co producer who is willing to tell him when something doesn't work. ""OLD"" needs all of that and then some. Yet here I am waking up to reviews acting like this is his new classic. Its a mess of a movie, some where between confused comedy and psychological horror drama. And with that It fails on every front: the actors come off either over acting or under acting, the dialogue is comical, the camera work is irritating and nauseating, the ending drags on and on, and even the internal logic doesn't follow its own rules. I found scenes meant to be scary, laughable. Scenes meant to be touching feel misplaced and poorly filmed. It's sad because his films will continue to make money on sheer curiosity alone and he'll never actually learn what is good and what is bad about his work. Something people need to grow, the only thing growing in Shyamalans work is his ego.",Old
320,miinty,"If this was a foreign B Movie, I would've rated it higher..",4,27 September 2021,"... for effort. This movie really feels like it should be good, but it's weirdly off. The acting is strange, like they were improvising scenes/dialogue but not in a way where it worked, it just seemed stiff and that the actors were missing their cues. I dunno, how to explain it... Killing of a Sacred Deer was weird acting that worked, Old, is weird acting that seemed amateurish. I get that the passage of time is in seconds and minutes so maybe that accounted for the lack of panic, but actual panic about the situation seems to be missing... Also, annoyingly, lots of stuff happened off screen??? Was there some sort of moratorium on gore?? UUgh, and those long teasing shots were pretty annoying too, we know the premise, why tease the 'kids' reveal' for so long - By the time the camera panned around - I didn't care. When the movie seems like the story is finally going to open up, it never does, not till the end end when 1 +1 finally equals 2, but by then, you don't really care, 'cause it's too late.I not done with M.

338,ryanwesthamfan,Not A Perfect Film. But Appreciate The Concept,7,30 July 2021,"M. Night Shyamalan is a director who's films I will always go and watch because of how divisive they are and because of that this film was one of my most anticipated films of the year. The film is a psychological thriller about a family on a tropical island who discover that the beach that they are on is somehow causing them to age rapidly.The Good- Although it is not a perfect film I get the feeling that not a lot of people will appreciate this film. For me personally I enjoyed my experience with 'Old'. The creative vision of M. Night, is not the strongest of his films but is the most passionate and you can feel the passion that he put into this film. The message this film gives is very strong and honestly I came out of this film just thinking about my friends and family and really appreciate the little things you have in life. There is a lot of strange and intense moments in this film and I couldn't think of another director who could have made them moments work. All of our main leads do give great performances that all work.The Bad- Some of the line delivery from certain actors didn't work and certain characters did end up coming off as cliche. Some of the editing and cinematography wasn't exactly great either. Now although I thought the ending worked it felt like it dragged on just that little bit and they could of ended it at a different point.Overall Thoughts- If you're not an M. Night Shyamalan fan this film probably won't win you over, however go in with an open mind. Some of the dialogue is cheesy cliche however the message this film gives us really strong and something that is going on in a lot of people's lives. Overall I'm going to give 'Old' a 7/10.",Old

341,malice_o_conner,The 'big emergency' isn't as big as the dramatic ones??,4,29 July 2021,"M. Night Shyamalan missed the mark here, I felt like while this played on everyone's fear of getting old, this also was a mess of human drama. It was like they were in the middle of a forest fire putting out little drama fires most the movie. The characters all trying to hide something cut them off from being relatable to majority of audience and so it's hard to relate to anyone. Some scenes took some mental gymnastics to get through, and that's where it all falls apart. Too much, too fast.When starting the rollercoaster, I did know what I was getting into, but as the situation became dire, everything fell apart, including the characters. Unraveling everything became backseat to the relationship/family/personal drama of life while this emergency situation continues to effect all of them. While there is originality to Shyamalan once again, I feel like the Happening, big hype for little reward. It's frustrating to know the potential was there but the mark was missed here. Wait for stream or Redbox.",Old

There are some freaky semi-gory scenes that are truly shocking and some clever ideas that are utilized decently by Shamalyan. There is a bit of exposition thrown by the cast and I'd rather they had some kind of visual accompanying it or perhaps Shamalyan should have added one of his own new ideas into the mix although I don't know how much stuff he made up for this film because it is an adaptation of a graphic novel by Gaspar Noe. There are some tragic events that occur and leave the viewer with a sense of melancholy and awe. While also there are some happenings that remain ambiguous and are never explained. All in all I want to watch this film again when it gets released on DVD. Because the experience on my cinema wasn't very good due to there being a rest brake(I hate it when it happens, and it happens just to buy food from the local cantine). And now the movie has stopped screening in my country.",Old
349,ncentia,Fundamentally bad,1,19 September 2021,"Clunky exposition, terrible dialogue, terribly acted. Out-of-frame aging and events which are excused as mystery/tension-building but possibly more to do with budget constraints. Hard to care when none of the characters are likeable and have only roughly sketched out premise and development. Would have been more impactful with fewer characters that the audience could actually invest in than a bunch of people yelling over each other.Worst of all, once again Shyamalan exploits stigmatising stereotypes of mental illness as scary and violent. Enough already.Spoiler - Medical trials on single subjects are meaningless.",Old
350,blakestachel,Thriller without the thrill,4,12 August 2021,"I think my biggest complaint is that it was made in the wrong genre. Either that, or M. Night's handling of the thriller isn't effective enough or at all. All of the most interesting elements (the rapid aging, the questioning of ones significance) seem secondary to the desire to cater to a summer audience who only cares about surface level drama. The ""live in the moment"" message is not Shyamalan's most irritatingly on-the-nose premis, but it certainly undercuts what the film could've said; that is about the pressures extended from the rapidity of time and the futility of our reach towards something meaningful. I'd like to see it remade in the style of Antonioni, or really, anybody with anything to say at all.",Old

Descent acting but execution is really poor.. Didn't feel any tension and intensity_didn't feel horror anytime.. Also it hold many plotholes at the same time create many unanswered but stupid questions.. Start is really amazing but drags after 1st half and become predictable yet boaring at same time.. Also it's ending is not convincing..! Not intense and feel really so simple at the end.. Lack of emotional moments and cbaracter development..

The camerawork & sound editing are some of the worst I've seen in ANY movie... I've seen high school film projects that look like Citizen Kane compared to this. The editing is so jarring at times, that it became very distracting.

It's clear there are many more ideas to run with that they didn't end up using either. The ending wasn't immediately guessable and ended up making enough sense to work.The age acceleration make up wasn't done that well, and the wrinkle CGI added to faces didn't blend and looks weird. But the one big big big problem though was the horrendous acting. A few of them played their (poorly written) characters well enough but there was always something off in all their interactions with one another. It seemed forced and unnatural. The acting was just bad. As in, worse than noticeably bad. It seemed like the actors could speak English well enough to communicate but didn't know how to match actions with the words. Especially in the teenaged characters. It was clear the whole time I was watching people try to act, which isn't what I want to see in a movie and is the same reason why I don't like live theater.

388,redcanofevil,OLD BUT STILL GOING STRONG,9,23 September 2021,"Wow what an amazing concept and even tho it is an adaptation M. Night Shyamalan yet again proves his mastery of tackling very risky movies. It has the usual Shyamalan charms and drawbacks but underneath it all it was a solid and gripping film.The bad parts are the obvious, a lesser script, wooden acting and inconsistencies. This was somewhat different in there being no lead actor here unlike every other Shyamalan movie before. The supporting cast does their job to a fair degree but it was lacking in the reaction department. With all thats going in the movie you'd think people would freak out more but they are relatively always calm but not level headed. The script is peppered with the usual too high-too low quips but it does kinda work in this movie considering the plot. The only standout cast was Alex Wolff, yes the boy from Hereditary. Also there are many inconsistencies with the conditions of the events and some events made little sense and felt somewhat offNow to the good side, it is a solid horror movie with none of the usual overplayed stale jump scares. It builds up slowly but never felt it dragged. It is more suspense than a pure physical horror but it does keep you at the edge of your seat. I kinda wish it was more subtle to as to not giveaway some important stuffs but hey the average movie goer are dumb as rock and its understandable why Shyamalan didn't trust them esp looking at how long it has been since a proper movie and not a popcorn flick.That said its not Shyamalan at his best, it could've been much better and not be this mild. It had the right ideas but shied away from it making it feel diluted at times. But credit where its due, M. Night is probably the only one passionate about doing original risky projects and not give in. His dedication to tell a story and the lengths he goes to make a film is astounding. This movie was made because of his anxiety about his parents ageing and such. It deals with such complex emotions and a phenomenon that we experience everyday in our life but hardly stop to comprehend the gravity of it. Say what you want about M. Night Shyamalan but he is an honest director with great passion. Don't like his movies? Fine but don't hate the man. This man deserves all the respect he can get. Can't wait for his next work, the only director that still makes me await and anticipate his next release.RATING: 9/10P. S: The rating is certainly biased and factoring in I havent watched many movies since the pandemic and certainly not as enticing as this. I feel it's a 7.5/10 but I'll stick with it.

390,cmantafounis,Old,3,24 October 2021,"One of M. Night's most accomplished films visually, even if the shots are mostly vacuous and made irrelevant by the stupidity of the script. The dialogue here is atrocious, whether laughably on-the-nose (""I can't wait to hear it when you're older"") or just blatantly unnatural (""I'm sorry you were on this beach, but this is my family."" ""I'm not a forensic pathologist, but..."" ""I curate exhibits for museums. I'm telling you this because I want you to trust me..."" ""No, I don't know, man. Maybe it was butterfly stroke. I don't watch the Summer Olympics like that."" ""The dog has died!"" / ""Oh, my God. He was only just alive."" and so forth). Given the material, the uniformly awful performances are hard to blame on the actors, though there are still some stand-outs, Vicky Krieps (Phantom Thread) in particular being surprisingly terrible. All the setups are painfully obvious: the free cocktails, the seizure, ""You don't want to be hunched when you grow up"", the entire opening scene and its constant references to the future and ageing; the payoffs are not much better. Any attempts at horror are ruined by the confused tone, in that the comically bad elements diminish the possibility of sustained tension. Occasionally a psychological horror is tapped into, with the premise naturally providing ample opportunity to consider themes of growing old, health, experiences and memories, but these ideas are presented clumsily, and any success is retroactively neutered by a final twist that serves no purpose other than to surprise the audience (which, of course it does, as who could see something so illogical coming?). In fact, its inclusion takes away from the previous hour-and-a-half, by reframing the narrative to be about *spoiler* rather than the concept of people ageing while stuck in time, gradually dying without the chance to ever live. Hard to understate how idiotic the final fifteen minutes are - this makes for an exemplary case as to why a twist is not inherently compelling. Luckily the main movie is too weak to be at all ""ruined"" by its ending, already suffering from stilted dialogue, poor performances, nonsensical plot-beats, and lame body horror regardless. Shyamalan films the heck out of that beach, though.",Old

Like what's the movie with Jack Nicholson and Marlon Brando? (I looked it up and I think it is a movie called The Missouri Breaks)
And a rapper named 'Mid-sized Sedan' ?? Really?Also the scene where the lady has a seizure and dies was unintentionally funny that I actually kinda had to hold my laughter in the theater.However I enjoyed the overall experience - despite the weird and poorly written dialogues and average cinematography / directing, I found this movie weirdly engaging and interesting. I was actually invested in the story!I think there were a lot of cool ideas in the movie. The scene in the cave with the girls' limbs being twisted was kinda disturbing and killing the insane man by poisoning him with a rusty knife was cool. The idea of the husband being semi-blind and the wife having hearing issues was cool showing the influence of aging.The twist was also cool - doing experiments using the mysterious beach - I liked it.I don't think I'd purposely rewatch the early scenes of the film, but the latter half, and especially the final act and the ending - I'd watch again!Right now I'll give this one a 6/10 - closer to 7 than 5 (YMS voice)ps.

398,anthonygiancola24,Literally what else do you expect?,8,2 August 2021,"This is par for the course M. Night Shyamalan, right on par with Signs or The Village. The awkward dialogue and method of acting are deliberate, and I really don't get why people are getting so heated about a movie that is actually pretty good. He's never changed his style, it's just been applied to more easily digestible genres before this (like the psycho thriller of Split, or the found footage weirdness of The Visit), but when all is said and all is done, Shyamalan has his own version of reality you either need to buy into before the film begins or you won't enjoy it.It's not perfect though, I actually think the ending goes on for ten minutes too long, and while I like his bizarre framing, sometimes it could give me a bit of a headache, but apart from that I think this is a good thriller with good performances and enough intrigue to keep me hooked.

Night Shyamalan's adaptation falls below his usual high-suspense-and-thrills standards. Shot during the pandemic lockdown, the film gives an uneasy trapped feeling as its small cast navigates through an isolated setting. Its two non-native English speaking leads, Gael Garcia Bernal and Vicky Krieps, don't seem to fit in either. It is a shame that the talent of its diverse cast is wasted by a dismal screenplay.

401,jim-75272,Great concept but badly executed,3,22 September 2021,This could have been such a better film. For one the acting was not consistent and overacting way too often. This was more of a made for TV movie.It could have been so much more with the right actors (or acting or maybe it was just the bad dialog). It is not an easy concept to realize but it was a bit insulting to the viewer's intelligence more often than not.The thing about most M Night Shyamalan films is that they resort to only the ending or punchline being the main part of the story and makes the main story weak. His first few were done well and teh films were strong from beginning to end but this one I have to say is another disappointment. I did like the ending though so there's that.,Old

A genuinely creepy story that seems to change its way more than once, with characters whom one actually cares about. The multi racial cast adds to the surreal feel of this movie, since the viewer is never quite sure exactly where the story is taking place. Some of the characters who are introduced briefly turn out to play a major part in the story, others who seem as if they are going to be major figures simply fade away.My one slight criticism is that the pace of the story is slightly uneven, some parts are glossed over when some more development would have been nice, whilst some other parts are laboured.

Is a movie that's just a movie, it leaves no unanswered questions, it's crowpleasing, and has enough chills to satisfy thrill seeking audiences. Yes, the movie has some uneven sequences, like of some the sequences were left in the editing room, but that actually helps the pacing. This is not a movie of acting, but of atmosphere, so if someone goes wanting a new Sixth Sense that won't happen here. It's like a mix of The Village with The Happening, but taking the best part of both. And the message actually makes some reflections about how we spend our time, if we use it to fight or to enjoy. Yes, it's a cheesy message, buy Shyamalan is a family man and he shows it here. And I also enjoyed that there's no gore or extreme violence, so this is a movie that the family can enjoy together (no joke, I think my parents would enjoy it). Finally, at the beginning of my screening there a brief introduction to the movie by Shyamalan himself (and he has an appearance in the movie, what he does here I won't tell), so I felt very welcome to the theater like if I almost was in the director's house.",Old

Night, you either are a big fan of him and see the movie as a ""thought provoking masterpiece"" or you just don't get his idea and this is a ""piece of pretentious trash""I'm going to be objective here and say that this movie has a cool interesting premise and some good ideas but not a very good execution.I did not love this movie but I don't really hate either it nor think it is absolute trash. It is just kind of: ""Meh.""The whole premise is actualy interesting and the first half of the movie works. You feel interested in what is going on, the mistery of how are they getting out, the feeling of time literaly going at x100 speed, but then by the end I wasn't feeling how all the resolutions were handled.First the lady with a bone condition has to become scary because apparently we needed jumpscares and body horror.Then the violent mentally ill man is killed with a miracle rusted knife that creates a very cartoony ""infection"" it felt a little out of place for me.And lastly, the final revelation that the evil medical coorporation was behind it all along and was taking advantage of this aging phenomenon for some shady moral reasons, I understand it. I wasn't mad at it mostly, I was just so ready to leave the theater at that point that for me it was like ""Meh. Yeah, whatever""
I also think we didn't needed the kids to survive I didn't feel it worked for me. Maybe it would have been better to leave the ending with them in the sea and open for discussion, like you decide if they made it and save the other guests or not.Overall I'll give this movie a true neutral medium score of 5, it is not that great as some people say but it does has an original idea and is at least watchable.

There's only so much one could do with such on-the-nose, redundant, cringey dialogue. Also the antagonist's actions weren't really motivated. And for being a contained thriller, there were long periods of time where characters would randomly disappear for a while and then re-appear when convenient to the plot.The cinematography also got noticeably weird and it didn't work.There are a few unintentionally laughable moments but it's not even worth watching for laughs.

I mean it was bad, but it was like bad in a strange way. I mean you can tell M Night at least has SOME sort of budget for these movies, the cinematography and location were both good. But then it's like he gets these goobers to act in his films. The line delivery felt so wooden from most the actors. And the dialoged itself I can only describe to something that was badly translated? But it was never translated from another language so it makes no sense that it's like that...The writing was super wooden too, like it was too self explanatory and hand-holdy if that makes sense, like a character would just announce something that doesn't need to be announced or narrated in a certain way, It's really hard to describe if you're not literally watching the film.Also what was that fight scene at the end? (it almost reminded me of a Pokémon battle) The husband is like ""hey who is that!?"" (because he's going blind) as the senile man with a knife is hobbling towards him. His wife is literally right next to him. It may have been implied she was going hard of hearing, but still, dude just tug her arm or something, jesus... So it's this lame scene where he's holding his arm up and it's getting knifed slowly by an aging man, and the wounds are healing immediately, so it all seems of no consequence. The wife instead of just getting behind the guy and helping, runs the opposite direction across the beach to first hide the kids... THEN she comes back, and instead of just bonking him on the head with a branch or rock or something, she had to go out of her way to get a rusty knife and slice him with it because ""rust acts like poison when it get's in the bloodstream"". Ok cool? But it was entirely unnecessary, you could have just ganged up on him, grab his arm... There done. I guess we needed to see where M Night's budget supposedly went, definitely not cocaine and hookers, it was on the incredible actors and special effects I swear!",Old
417,tukenukemi,"Yep, it really is that dismal",2,22 September 2021,"As many already noted, interesting premise is thoroughly botched here with a squalid execution on every possible level. It really is bizarre how hit or miss type of movie maker Mr. Shyamalan is. How did the same guy manage to do The Sixth Sense, Unbreakable and Split - which were great - and now in ""Old"", literally nothing works? The premise of the movie had surely provided interesting results in more competent hands, but instead of giving us even the most simplistic contemplations about the tragedies of life and growing old, every introduced idea seems under developed and hastily put together. Dialogue is horrifyingly bad throughout the runtime, with acting being a perplexing mix of characters just apathetically staring into nothingness, or yelling without any apparent reason.The involved actors clearly are not the ones to blame for this mess however, because the script gives very little room to work with. Shyamalan just clearly has no idea what to do with these characters. The movie even manages to be boring and feel rushed at the same time - it's amazingly amateurish work really. The compulsory twist at the end can be seen as a minor redeeming quality, but it does not offer a reward that scrumptious, which would justify all the previous suffering.",Old
418,jprice-38253,Movie will sure get OLD FAST! Ridiculous...,2,1 August 2021,"It was a lazy Sunday afternoon and my Dad hadn't been to the movies with me in forever. So I decided I wanted to see this because the trailer looked solid, the poster looked cool and plus Alex Wolff was in it, whom I know from Hereditary and other projects. He wanted to see it because he's into thrillers. Well, considering I've seen that some of Shamalyn's work is quite good, this one unfortunately just flat out goes off the railroad tracks and crashes into several cars. I'm really surprised something like THIS even made it to the screen AND it was made by Shamalyn. There's just no way, it was completely ridiculous...A family of four goes to a tropical resort and they find out they can be taken to this private beach. With other guests that are with them as well, it turns out the beach is cursed and obviously makes people age every few hours. After the first 30 minutes, you won't even care anymore. You can't take the whole cast seriously (except for Alex Wolff, he's great), but you won't care about anybody anymore, you won't care what happens, you can't take the dialogue seriously! Sounds like a 12 year old wrote it. Half the time you'll hear ""We have no reception!"" ""Oh no! Mom! What's happening to him or her?!"" ""Oh my God!"" ""We have to get off this beach!"" ""We have to get out of here!"" I wasn't laughing at how funny this was, I was laughing at how utterly pathetic and embarrassing the cast is to watch. I was so bored that I purposely went to the bathroom twice, even though I really didn't need to go and by the end of the movie I'm just on my phone. Although, you do at least find out why the beach is cursed and why people got old, but it's nothing original or exciting in the slightest. So most of this movie you're pretty much gonna be sitting there watching random things happen from left and right. I tried to pay attention to this very hard, and I just couldn't. An hour and 40 minutes of my life was just wasted. Could've been playing Xbox with my brothers or be at the gym. Giving this a 2 star just because of Alex Wolff and the cinematography was pretty cool and surreal. Not your ordinary cuts or transitions that you'll normally see.And after the movie was over, most of the audience was relieved. LOL one dude behind me was just sitting with the most straight face and looked like he just wanted to kill himself. But on a last note to leave, PLEASE DO NOT go see this. Ok? Instead hang with your family, hang with your boyfriend/girlfriend, hang with your friends, go do something else. This wasn't worth my time nor should it be worth anybody else's. Trust me you won't be missing anything....",Old
419,diamondarrow,Not Shamaylan's best film,6,13 August 2021,I thought I was okay I liked the hole beach vacation gone wrong plot of it and it was creatively executed. But the twist was very expected and it wasn't the best of Shamaylan's twist ending I thought it was kinda of lazy and could require more thought. I did like some parts of it though it was very good at the horror aspects of the film. In my opinion based on what I've seen The Village's twist is the best of his twist endings.,Old

At one moment I was watching how they were arguing over random things or making a camp fire but not trying to escape. I can't give details as I do not want to spoil and a camp fire in a movie isn't a spoiler. :) Like nothing would matter at that point, they're gonna die anyway so why not try to get off the beach?

I love mystery, twists, unreliable narrators, etc....as long as they are worthy. Old was a bit of a disappointment for me. Usually after a second viewing of M. Night's films, I catch more and feel differently. This one, not so much. Aging and death are tough subjects for many, and this film is filled with both. After the first hour, I found it depressing and long. I was also disappointed in the lack of a twist, unless there wasn't one intended. SPOILERS.....
When the Mom mentioned how she found the resort, she said it was advertised on the bottom of her pharmacy receipt. Well maybe that was supposed to be the twist? That you knew it was a going to be a medical experiment? There could have been a better payoff. It wasn't a horrible film. Visually it was really nice, camera angles worked well. Story wise it was just lacking. Go into it not expecting much, and maybe you will enjoy it.",Old

424,frankperkins-76225,A very sad and emotional movie. Do not expect a huge twist,10,29 July 2021,"Is this movie a stereotypical M Night movie that we have had in the past? Not exactly. There are no jump scares, nor are there no ghosts, or aliens. I feel like this movie is a combination of Wayward Pines, and The Lord of the Flies.People who are sick, or have some ailment, go on vacation and are placed at some beach as they rapidly age. During this process, allies are made, a sanity is lost, and young puppy love is to be had.This movie is part satire, part family drama, and part horror. The satire part comes when he compares this aging process to the social happenings that exist in this country today. The sick people drag those along who are healthy. One mother has cancer, and she seems to care solely about herself. She seems to want this vacation more than her family, and she is to blame as her kids and her husband are becoming sick. The other part is family drama. One can see how these kids are taking care of their parents as they get older. There is no western medicine on the beach so they rely on their children. As they see their parents rapidly age, and their health deteriorate, this audience member knows what that would be like in the future. I even called my parents to tell them how much I loved them afterwards.The other part is to show how scary aging can be. There were teens there who left upset. These teens longed for the days when they dream of their license and to go to university yet when they witness this aging process it terrified them. I think that this movie is scarier for teens than it would be for people in their mid 30s to early 40s.Also, with his movies people expect some huge twist. The thing is, there was no twist. It ended in a depressing sort. I think that is why people did not like it. It is a great movie. Just a little sad.",Old

There was no proper timeline in this movie. The children age the adults don't. And what was this on-site surgery?The director's responsibility to achieve proper and believable acting.

But he gets axed off fairly early, and he doesn't have that many lines otherwise, so it's not that distracting.The premise of the film is great and it was executed perfectly. I didn't even realize I got attached to the characters until I found myself crying near the end.I recommend this film, not just to those who have grown used to Shyamalan's algorithm, but to those who haven't.

An absolute bad example of si-fi and creativity and was definitely written by a sexually frustrated junkie with a dumb brain. The worst depiction follows a cheating wife talking like a three-year-old, a kid who impregnates another kid, a kid asking her mom to change her bra because her breast doesn't fit in. The most horrible part was a cardiothoracic surgeon who doesn't know anything about medicine, so it seemed! Yes, it was a si-fi movie but for instance an example like Angelman syndrome could led a person have Intellectual disability forever and now in this film you depicted a 5 year old developing the brain and understating the full functionality of the human body? Growing one's hunger for sex and blah blah blah, are you kidding me? It could have been described better with unique creativity. And with all this, was this film rated PG-13? What! I couldn't understand why was your camera shaking while filming the movie, was it because to add some special effects? Didn't work though!

There are a lot of surprisingly touching moments, and to my surprise a few funny ones as well. People said they hated the dialogue, but I found a few lines to be refreshing. It's not an absolutely amazing life-changing movie or anything like that, but it's definitely entertaining and though the ending was a bit lacklustre with some unnecessary scenes, it's still delivered. The plot holes were a pretty big problem: If you're the kind of person to get hung up on details, then you will not have a good time with this movie. There are a lot of basic things that don't make sense, but if you're able to ignore them, the movie is nice to watch.

But Old is another one that's simply going to disappoint and annoy anyone who keeps giving this guy a second (or third, or fourth) chance. How or why he does it is a mystery, but it's as though Shyamalan takes everything that was left ON the cutting room floor (the worst takes, the weakest performances and the most frustrating camerawork) and makes the film out of that instead. Combine this with an illogical, clunky script delivered by C-list actors, student-level storytelling (with the now 100% predictable 'twist at the end') and Old is just as bad as it is baffling.",Old

I could predict most of what was going to happen and I'm no Einstein or Nostradamus. It was just so damn predictable.The acting wasn't all that either and there were a lot of plotholes (non spoiler: Mid Side Sedan's not aging at the rest of them, the entire ending of the movie, etc). Extra bonus point for getting on my nerves goes to Vicky Krieps' accent, but I feel it is lame of me to complain about that. I have a terrible accent myself.

Also, Shyamalan's shoehorning of his daughter's song in the beginning during the car trip was a case of awful nepotism.That ending though.Why did it all have to be tidied up and presented to us in such a banal and unneeded fashion?The ending could've come 5 or 10 minutes earlier without the need for the unnecessary exposition and police interference.Ending it at the point of the big reveal that the lab was simply able to do research at a rate quicker than previously ever thought possible was jaw-dropping.

453,averylubocki,An Interesting Experience,5,25 July 2021,"M Night Shyamalan's ""Old"" is not a perfect movie. In fact, it has some major problems. The dialogue was very awkward and stilted. It's easy to tell how hard the actors are trying to make these lines work. It has a couple scenes that take up a lot of running time but don't effect the movie at all. And the famous twist ending that has to be in every M Night movie feels forced and unnecessary. But what makes this movie different then your average mediocre movie is Shyamalan himself. He puts so much passion into his directing and it really shines through in this movie. I absolutely love the premise of this movie, and M Night explores every creepy idea that can come from it. This is easily one of his best looking movies. The cinematography is very exciting and suspenseful and the setting of the beautiful yet creepy beach was visually stunning. All of the actors are giving 100% and any issues that I had with their performances mostly come from the script. Stand outs for me were Thomasin Mckenzie, Aaron Pierre, and Rufus Sewell. For the most part, the movie doesn't drag, and I was very entertained throughout the entire movie. If your a fan of M Night, this is a must watch! If not, read the premise of this movie. If it doesn't do anything for you, avoid this movie. If your the slightest bit intrigued, I recommend checking it out. Whether it's good or bad. If it's Shyamalan, it's entertaining.",Old

The most i knew about the film was something about people aging on an island.Off the bat:
it wasn't very hard to figure out the resort was shady as hell and was up to something, they basically spoonfed you that from the start. Some of the dialogue is so terrible it just kept giving the story away, it definitely wasn't a film you had to think too hard about. Could see the ending off a milethe acting:
remember m.nights the happening ? Yeah ?, this was up there with that. No real people talk this way to each other and some of the things they do come out with make you cringe a little inside, but i think this is by now a m.night trademark. Its cheesy as cheese can be and i'm not sure if anybody can take it seriously anymore but its so fun to watch and when a character comes out with some random line that really doesn't fit the scene it's a great moment that makes you laugh in confusion.The plot:
yeah it's not an amazing story, the mysterious beach/island thing has been done to death over the years and the shady resort plus scientists made it seem a little like a lost rip off. The plot was very predictable but it did keep me watching it all the way through without a problem. I was curious to see the ""twist""I was hoping the twist in this one was going to such a simple one that nobody would ever think of it because its so dumb and simple and they would kick themselves when finding out because everybody could have lived.Example:
When he decoded the little boys msg i really wanted it to say something like ""walk backwards through the caves to get back safe"" he shows his sister in disbelief and they both cry out in frustration that that's all they had to do and everyone would still be alive .Im mean, m,night does tell them to walk back the way they came maybe he meant it literally ? They had no head pain walking in to the beach through the caves so walking out backwards could have worked? Right ?.nobody ever mentioned it or tried it.Also when the young boy/man mentioned making a metal tube or like lined vest like at the dentist i thought they could have made a blanket out of the food bags and cover themselves with it and just walk out seeings though they were foil lined and would stop the magnetic thing around them somebody even had a sewing kit when they were gonna stitch up his mum , then i remembered he was meant to be like 6 and his sister not much older so rational thought wouldn't have been great.I thought the scariest thing about this film is when you think on the situation they are all in ...in the sense that once you are on this beach you cannot leave and will be dead within 24 hours.It makes you wonder mentally how would you cope in the same situation?Would it completely destroy you? Taking all that in in such a short space of time and watching people age in front of that fast, your kids becoming adults in hours and people around you dying of old age who were in their 30s when you met them just hours before . Or would it all happen so quick it would seem so surreal and you'd spend your last day alive thinking you were stuck in a messed up dream and not taking anything seriously before dying not knowing what the hell just happened. Usually in life we have time to process life events and if we are lucky we have time to mentally get ourself ready for death. It would be absolutely terrifying to have your whole life squeezed down to just one day...everything else in this film is pretty dumbthere are some stupid & dumb moments in this film:
the glamour chick breaking all her own arms and legs in the tunnel and looking like a spider somebody stepped on.The evil holiday resort/ evil pharmaceutical company testing on live people on their special aging beach and wiping them off the face of the earth by wiping their computersthe tumor removal scene . Why didn't the womens body regenerate around everybody's fingers? If a knife wound is instantly healed. What about sepsis? Infections ?And why didn't the rapper age twice as quick as everybody else as he was on the beach the night before. The rest arrivedwhy did the policeman at the end and everybody else around him for that matter believe the duos story ""just like that"" because the kid/man gave him a book?Also would you take a guys story if he come up to and said ""hey i was 6 yesterday and now i'm 50, the resort put me on an island with my mum and dad and sister and some others and everybody aged within hours and died of old age"". And the copper's like ""yup, that sound plausible, i'm gonna abandon my holiday and check this out"" Seems a bit of a lazy way to finish the film tbh. It should have ended with that they hung out till dark kidnapped the owner and m,night and made them walk the threshold of the beach themselves trapping them on the beach to die a horrible quick death just like the people they put there, then burned the resort to the ground.The film is okay , if you liked any of m.nights previous stuff then you probably find this one to be alright as well
The stories nuts, the scripts pretty terrible and the actings very bad but it's a must see for fans. It's a very easy film to watch and should not be taken too seriously,
li don't think he's going for an oscar with these films thats for sure but he seems to be having fun making them and it shows and that for me is great there's no politics, he's not pushing his own or someone's personal agenda on you unlike another recent film i just watched .*candyman*....a lot of bad reviews on this but i quite enjoyed it so gave it a 6.

Supposedly at least some of the actors that are in this mess can act, but maybe here they forgot it, or decided not to do it. Adding to the terrible impression that they make is the fact that the two leads (Bernal and Krieps) are not good at speaking English and Krieps is especially struggling with it.The script is laughably bad. Seems like it was written by a preschooler convinced that he knows how the world works and has something really deep and meaningful to say, but is actually just scribbling nonsense. None of the characters act like a real person, and they especially do not speak like real people. On top of all that, there are several obvious language mistakes - ""This is nobody's responsibility, but me"" (instead of ""mine"") is just one of them. Shayamalamadama should have at least let a native English speaker proof read the script for grammatical and linguistic errors.It really took me a lot of effort to get to the end of this nonsense.

467,VanillaLimeCoke,M Night Shyamalan really seems to be making a comeback,7,25 July 2021,"Old is definitely not one of M Night's best films but still far from his worst films too.First off is the obvious question many are wondering if they haven't looked at the cast list........yes........he does make an appearance in this film and actually winds up playing a major role in this film.......and isn't even in just one scene (like Lady in the Water). I won't spoil all the details here.To be honest though......this film was worth the wait.The ending will indeed be a surprise.And I guarantee you'll like Idlib (played by Kailen Jude) as despite him playing a smaller role than M Night Shyamalan does....but very important.The trailer though seems misleading showing 5 kids (2 boys and 3 girls).......there's really just 3 kids (1 boy and 2 girls). The scenes we see from the trailer are from two different days (them arriving at the hotel and then them getting driven to the beach the next day. I'm addition there's some rapper, and two other families (two (husband and wife) and then one with six (dog, husband, wife, husband's mom, the one girl, and 28 year old lady). Then we have the main family (dad, mom, boy, and girl).So all together these 12 people and a dog are on a beach having the time of their lives when the young boy stumbles upon a dead lady in the water (who we see earlier which the rapper was watching). Not knowing how she died, some of the people try leaving the beach but can't because they keep blacking out going the way they came.They soon realize too time is speeding up and they are aging (over 10 days by each minute) like a year every half hour (over 300 days each 30 minutes). The dog and husband's mom are the first to die.More different escape tactics taken prove to be deadly (climbing the rocks x1 and swimming out in the ocean to an adjacent area x2).To make matters worse, the one husband starts going psychotic.......sometimes in a funny like Anthony Hopkins like way.....but most of the time very scary psychotic crazy.More people meet their fates.In the end, just our family of four is remaining.....but the parents soon dwindle quick.Our two kids are the only ones to survive the night and to make yo the next day.The only plot that I felt was unnecessary was the part about the one girl getting pregnant. This is mainly because the baby only survives 1 minute and 20 minutes later......they're not even mentioning this plot anymore in the film.It is somewhat explained that only the kids go hungry and eat more food, while the adults need hardly any food......but still time is moving at a constant rate for everybody......so I still feel like this plot doesn't gel so well.And the ending just proves to ask more questions of logic like this.Like I said, I feel M Night Shyamalan is getting back but isn't completely back yet.I particularly enjoyed this much better than THE VILLAGE, AFTER EARTH, THE VISIT, and THE LAST AIRBENDER.",Old

501,some-like-it-hot,Painful on so many levels...,1,21 July 2021,"This movie could have gone two ways... One way would be a horror-comedy that, despite its attempt to be scary at times, it deliberately chooses to amuse and entertain. The other is plain horror/thriller, which is in fact the genre this movie advertised with. Sadly, they went straight through the middle, resulting in neither fun nor scary. And don't get me started on other aspects of this film. To be honest, I went in to see this movie tonight with medium expectations: the concept seemed interesting, it had a bunch of actors on a remote location. Usually, these form some pretty nice ingredients for a strange, bizarre and interesting film. However, in the first 20 minutes or so, the movie already starts giving off warning signs. You know, those warnings that let the audience feel like they're children or people with some intellectual defect. This pattern of story telling is, unfortunately, very recurring. It's not that complicated of a story, why bother telling us everything we need to know, all the time. This is called exposition and is a cheap and unoriginal way of storytelling, by the way.So far, I haven't even touched other elements of the film. The quality of the acting varies but is mostly very poorly directed. Not to give any spoilers (as if I could), but when something shocking happens, people just seem to carry on relaxing on the beach. No traumatic or dramatic emotions, not a single tear, nothing. That's one of many arguments for making my previous point: is this supposed to be entertaining or some sense of dark humor? It's not? Oh, well, then it's certainly not tasteful. They do a horrible job at depicting violence by the way, one of these moments even involves a baby, which I found absolutely tasteless and disgusting to use as some cheap way to shock the viewer.Another thing that strook me as remarkably consistent is the amount of nudity and exposure of young women in the movie, including many suggestions (implicit or explicit). This was one of those warning signs that clearly sends out the type of people who made this movie happen: perverted guys that missed out and feel the need to compensate by releasing this kind of material. If you're going for that kind of style, at least have the decency to advertise it as such. This was clearly aimed at men with specific interests, but I'm sure the audience is not expecting this.The story line is flatter than the beach it takes place on. There are more holes than a fishing net. Again, if you're going for comedy-horror, at least admit it. This movie continuously tries to be something it is not. It tries to sell this story to the audience but it has no clue how to do so, so they end up grasping at straws and decide to resort to cliche jump scares and cheap effects to give us some of the excitement we are so desperately looking for.In summary, I experienced this movie as one of the worst movies I have ever seen and would not recommend anyone to watch it. It is tasteless, has no story, no silver lining, hardly any positive aspects and is a reflection of the cheap, money-grabbing industry called Hollywood.",Old

So if mommy has a tumor they are testing a cancer drug on, the whole family will perish from old age so that the data can be gathered on the one specific drug being tested.We are supposed to be torn by the fact that the medical research is a net good for humanity, while the resort itself is just a for-profit slaughterhouse.As with any Shamalamadingdong production, a lot of ridiculous events occur for no reason and there is a happy ending, of sorts.So strap in and try not to laugh yourself into a coma, because that beach isn't a real place and you won't be cured by any of the Flumazenil and naloxone knock offs that might have been able to wake you back up.",Old

By the time we get to the beach, I found it almost painful to watch. The flow was so awful because some shots and scenes had no cohesion. The one that jumps to mind first is Mid-Size Sedan is sitting out by himself in like the little valley alcove thing, then he is being stabbed to death by the doctor. What?There were many situations like that where the flow just didn't work. The editing was pretty bad in that sense.As for the story itself, it's always best not to overthink movies like this, however, there are a few things that bothered me.For instance, the cave. It's not a malevolent force. It's nature created, or so it is explained, so that should also mean that they feel the same effects entering that they do exiting. But it's a movie.Another story misfire for me was the deciphering the note at the end. Given the parameters of the character set-up early on, I feel like one of the first things he would have done is decode the note. It would have made more sense if he decoded it when he got to the beach, and his 6 year old brain was like ""Whatever, who likes coral anyway."" And THEN the 50 year old version finds it again and his adult brain thinks about and figures it out. Would have made much more sense. I could go on, but you get the idea. Lots of things didn't really work.Now, I applaud the camera work. It looks great and the fact they filmed during full on Rona and all were OK. That's great too, but it still doesn't excuse the cobbling together of disjointed scenes and trying to pass it off as a movie.I really like M. Night and have enjoyed most of his films, even some of his much maligned ones. Here's to hoping his next one is a winner.",Old

And within this time, the screen play, the acting, scenes were just disaster. Before understanding what was actually happening, they found a body and couldn't care less.

522,stepperwalsh,This movie aged me... more than 90 minutes,5,4 October 2021,"M. Night Shaylaman is the master of intriguing ideas, clever hooks and unsettling premises. It's just a shame he has no idea where to take them.In his latest attempt, OLD, a group of unfortunate vacationers are trapped on a beautiful secluded beach. This wouldn't be a problem were it not for the fact that everyone begins to age at a rapid rate. For every 30 minutes on this beach your bodies grow a year older. While this is scarcely noticeable in the adults (at first) suspicions are raised when the infant kids reach puberty by lunchtime.Leaving this outlandish paradise isn't an option either. The sea washes back anyone who tries to make a swim for it and the original path has a force-field preventing anyone escaping. The vacationers are naturally annoyed by this phenomenon, none of this was advertised in the brochure.The quick aging process affects each person differently. An 80-year-old woman drops dead after 45 minutes. A 50-year-old doctor gets dementia. The poor dog, already aging seven years for each human year, never has a chance. (I'll let you do the maths on now quickly he was aging.)Pre-existing medical conditions are exasperated. A woman's tumor inflates to the size of melon after a matter of minutes. An ad hoc surgery is performed, which is fun since rapid cell regeneration means the incision keeps healing seconds after it is made.The reason all this is possible, just like everything else in this movie, is not important. We get a few throwaway lines about the earth's magnetic field and it's sufficient. The crazy pseudo-science, however, is the least of this movie's problems. The reason I haven't bothered including character names is, quite simply, they're irrelevant. Like so much of M. Night's later work the characters are mere pawns for the premise and we couldn't care less who lives or dies.Expectations are always going to be high when M Night Shayalman sits in the directors chair.

526,markgordonpalmer,Masterful filmmaking provokes an emotional response.,9,25 July 2021,"It's not often you see a film that, when it ends, has you wondering why there are tears in your eyes: is it because it's such masterful filmmaking that it provokes an emotional response? Or that the themes of loss (of love) and regret, ageing and death are so powerful? It's also enthralling and horrific (a true shallow sea blue horror movie at heart) and daring too: the children here grow old but remain childish. They play sandcastles at 50, and lose virginity in their late teens having only just that morning been barely in double figures.It's not a sleazy film though. The normality within the extreme weirdness and vice versa never feels forced or exploited: in a weird real world right now, we know how to handle crazy!I think, in retrospect, I felt emotional at the end of this film (as the blisteringly cool and beautifully designed surge of end credits jumped out at an audience who barely moved and sat quite still until the music died) because creative, joyously wild filmmaking like this is something to be embraced, and welcomed back to our daily lives: the wilderness year is officially over!M. Night Shyamalan's Old, is based on the graphic novel Sandcastle (a better title if I had to gripe) by Pierre Oscar Lévy. The film was made at the heart of Covid's limitations and the director has said it became something of a meditation on fear of sickness, death and entrapment. They genuinely had to get through each filming day safely. Really though, it's just a beautifully lit, filmed, acted, scripted triumph of visual ferocity. Soundtrack and cinematography are mesmeric, warm: the skin is glistening, the waves crash against rock in sprays of majestic anger or placid silence and you will believe that YOU are on that beach with these doomed, voyagers of the damned.The sea and the shore and the caves are inviting and enticing, but equally places of uncertainty and threat. Which is as it should be. Nature here is the heroic one only, abused by those in positions of power. Like a wild animal, it can't be caged up. Not even in lockdown.It's a terrifying and horrific film to experience; bursting with love, personal redemption and acceptance of the past: of an affair and forgiveness (a loss of love is at the centre of this story, along with losses of innocence, youth and normality). It's a film of sundrenched beauty - and of hideous wounding and decay. It's also about healing: physical and emotional.Cinema is a good place for films like this.",Old

Questions got answered and I didn't have a lot to complain about. I gave it bonus for a unique idea that was entertaining.

528,juraj-jerkovic,Interesting idea gets worse as film progresses,7,21 August 2021,"In typical MNS style, an intriguing idea ends up as an not so great movie as the film progresses. The film has some thought provoking qualities. My favorite is when the group comes up with the hypothesis that slowly moving through the passage would get them out but they would age twenty years. They all decide not to. In life we often dont want to invest our time into something that is valuable. We rather continue our daily routine hoping for something better that never comes and life passes by.But the bad in the film are plenty. Some are so bad they are funny. The ""famous rapper"" with a stage name Mid-Sized Sedan had me chuckling all the time. He isnt old when they arrive at the beach.The kids grow in a day but also become wiser as if they experienced life.One daughter has blue eyes as a child & teenager but brown as an adult.The scene in the cave with Crystal going berserk is wtf. So is the operation of a melon sized tumor with a flip knife. If that can be survived, than why does anyone die from wounds? They take away the knife from the doctor but he later has it again while tje lady kills him with a rusty knife. Why does he have the knife? Why is one rusty and the other isnt?And so on, and so on. The film lasts 1h 48 min. While it is interesting in the begining, the failed attempts to leave the beach, histeria and dialogue become repetitive and boring. At 1h 20min I was looking at my watch wondering how much more is left. In the end, the revelation is its a pharma company that uses the concept of fast time to find cures for illnesses faster. OK, intriguing idea, but again, testing on one subject? You can test nothing medical like that. 73 families disappear on holiday.Some good camera work, some good and some bad acting, poor character build up.

Visual effects are non existent. No plot twists & things happen just the way a 6 years old would imagine. Not a bad story, but nothing to be impressed of. Plot hole like, Mid-sized Sedan not aging throughout the last night he stayed at the beach, made it laughable. No explanation on who authored the experiments. How did they find this place. Who made it back from there to tell their story. Then comes the laughable cliched young kid leaving a msg, not checking long enough if test subjects survived or not, no backup plans for if there are any survivors, previous test subject writing down many many other subjects names & addresses for making it easy to wrap up. Everything was super convenient for the movie to speed up. Like having a doctor for surgery or having someone from the museum to guess the decomposition time.No tension or thrilling moment in this movie. Characters are shallow & you don't feel anything for anyone.

I'm sure this wasn't M's intention, but it was one of those amazing slow-motion train wrecks you just can't look away from--we needed to see it through.I don't know if M. Knight considers himself some sort of rogue genius, or mad scientist, or perhaps an amalgamation of the two, but whatever it is that he once had is completely gone. This will go down as maybe the worst film I've ever seen.This hit the trifecta of what makes a bad movie bad.Acting--TERRIBLE.Writing--HORRID.Cinematography--THE WORSTThis movie didn't even make any sense, like ... at all. There were so many holes and things that never got explained. The acting was just so so bad. That black dude, in the beginning, had us cracking up ... just always looking lost and passionlessly saying, 'damn.'As far as holes ... for instance, it constantly seems as if the people on the island are aging at vastly different rates, the timing is completely off and it never attempts to explain this. When some people die they leave behind bones, but for some reason, the baby that was born on the island is somehow cremated and turns to ashes ... WHAT? HOW? WHY? Those are some of the questions M. Should have asked himself the entire way through the movie-producing process.There is a tiresome sense of randomness and incompleteness at every turn. The camera work was so annoying, I think M. Thinks he's being quite clever with all the spinning camera scenes and uncut scenarios, but it doesn't make any sense and certainly doesn't add anything to the movie. Only a narcissist could have produced this movie.Near the end there is also this coral scene where they're swimming through a tunnel and the sister gets caught on some coral, then there's some weird black line that comes down the coral and then we cut to them outside floating in the water. Again, the movie never tries to explain what that was, why it mattered, or what its purpose was, this type of thing plays out again and again during the course of the movie.

They were having fun (studio covers all bills and pays them big money) and, by the way, giving birth to a movie production during this time frame. Why is there so many harsh criticism against M. Night Shyamalan or his brainchild? Just don't take it as a sci-fi, thriller or philosophical essay. It was created in aim to loosen audience up in the face of a hard time in real life.Shyamalan is responsible for directing, screenpaly and a small acting role. One of his daughter is the second-unit director, another daughter of his wrote and performed a song in the soundtrack. The cast of OLD (2021) includes quite a few talents with Hollywood ""connection"": Clint Eastwood's daughter, actress Tilda Swinton's relative, actress/producer/director Polly Draper's son, actress Miranda Harcourt's daughter, actor Thomas Ian Nicholas' son, documentary producer Henry Chalfant's wife, British actor Geoffrey Streatfeild's ex-wife, German actor Jonas Laux's partner, ...

He is clearly a competent film maker; The Sixth Sense, Unbreakable and Signs were really great films. The more recently The Visit and Split were excellent additions to a filmography that is as all over-the-place you can get.The most I can say for this movie is at least its original. Playing on out fears on growing old or watching someone we love grow old and become feeble. The idea of this happening at an accelerated rate COULD be quite thrilling and even thought provoking. Some of the ideas presented in this film do make it exciting and can it least keep you watching...however there are plenty of moments that lend themselves more to groaning, eye rolling or unintended chuckles that anything else.The script and acting overall is fairly stilted. Frequently people will do something or say something that looks and or/feels unnatural. Its difficult to stay invested in a film where you can't take your characters very seriously. Many times it just felt like; ""People don't really act or say things this way!""Perhaps M. Night is most known for his twists. A well executed twist could make a mediocre film good, or even a poor film entertaining at the very least. Unfortunately I believes that this film cant quite stick the landing in this case either. I couldn't help but feel like there was something big trying to be said here but it just didn't come through. In the end; the classic Shamayalan twist just fell flat.In the end I watched the whole movie. It at least kept me engaged long enough to stick with it. I REALLY wanted to like it.

It pretty much ruined the film.The graphic novel maintained the mystery to the end, it didn't need to explain events. It was smart enough to leave readers to make up their own minds about what was going on, and what the meaning of it was. The novel was an exploration of the brevity of life, and ended in a very different way to the film, I would advise you to go and read it.The ending of the film sucked, it treated the viewers like idiots.",Old
555,Clumsy_blonde,Disappointing,5,5 November 2021,"I was excited about the seemingly original plot and how that could be explored by the mind of M. Night Shyamalan. But from the opening scene all the actors irritated me, so much b-movie style overacting. It felt like Sharknado. The whole beach sequence was hysteria, with zero depth and no exploration of how you might actually feel in that reality. It missed opportunities and played to coffee-table-psychology. Some of it was just cliche horror - laughable and annoying.",Old

The start is promising and interesting and you can tell the atmosphere is off and that the bad things are bound to happen soon.As the core of the plot unfolds, dialogue that makes sense, is thrown out the window. The cast delivers robotic and unintentionally funny lines throughout the movie. The characters should be questioning the strangeness of their environment more and seemed far too calm. Moments that are supposed to be the height of tension in the movie are a lot of the time funny or feel goofy in their delivery. You're clearly meant to feel creeped out and discomfort in those moments. This movie needed more time to breath upon each major development in the plot, but instead your left noticing how disjointed the movie really feels.The script needed another once over or M. Night Shyamalan needs to start reading his own dialogue out loud and realize it doesn't make sense! All I can really say is, what even happened? This movie is mistakenly named a thriller and horror, when it's clearly lands as a comedy.",Old

I don't know what happened here. If Shyamalan was running out of money and he had to film a quick cheap film. If he was going through some personal issues when prepping this film. I don't know what happened here. It is as if Steven Spielberg had directed The Room, and presented it as his greatest achievement.So, why is this film so bad?The acting: I don't know any of these actors, the only actor I know is Rufus Sewell from ""The Man In The High Castle"", and he's the only one who is able to perform any decent acting. I honestly thought the bad acting was going to be part of the plot-twist, that bad it was. Most of the actors have an accent, and some of these characters, when they age, they lose the accent, and when they age again, they get it back! Honestly, I appreciate a director that tries to recruit new talent, but none of these actors had any talent, it is as if Night Shyamalan walked into a bar, made a few friends and then asked them if they wanted to act in a movie.Not enough story: The concept, the idea, was nice, but it needed more development. Have you ever seen those posts on Instagram about book ideas? Posts that in 3, 4 lines of text, try to pitch a book idea. I saw one the other day that it was like:-""Two guys staring at each other break the blinking world record, and they start to realize things are not looking the same in the world."" Well, this was the same, someone took an idea, and try to make a movie with that, without any other development.The ending: The only thing missing from the ending was a ""Directed By Robert B Weide"" disclaimer because it felt like a joke, zip zap, everything ends in 2,3 minutes. Done! Let's go home!Final thought: If you like Night Shyamalan as much as I do, please skip this film. IDK what happened here. Maybe he was going through some personal issues. Maybe bad luck. Maybe who knows. I hope this blow isn't that bad for his career, he's one of my favorite directors and I'll wait eagerly for his next film.",Old

The reason it's so upsetting is that it could have easily been a mediocre film if a little bit of effort went into it. If this was made by a 19-year-old film student, I'd say ""well, it sucks, but that's understandable"", but Shyamalan knows better. It's so clearly a cash grab and no self-respecting filmmaker would ever attach his/her name to.There's an old adage in writing that goes ""show, don't tell"". They don't do that in ""old"". The dialog is SOOO contrived. There are so many extended scenes of the cast standing around explaining the plot to each other. Basically, Shyamalan thinks that the viewer is so dumb that he has to baby feed the story to you throughout the film. On top of that, the audio sucks, the cinematography sucks, and the acting sucks. Basically, this film has no redeeming qualities. If everything sucked just a little bit more, it would fall into the ""so bad it's good"" category, but unfortunately it can't even do that right.Do yourself a favor and pass on this one.",Old

However, after they arrive on the beach, the director starts using a lot of bizarre and jarring camera angles and editing styles that just completely took me out of it. Then it gets messy.However there are definitely some good moments. There is a particular scene involving the death of the parents in the dark beach which is just truly terrifying and sad because it felt so real.The ending gets really messy though. There's this sudden twist and huge exposition dump and then the final twist and resolution is just really jumbled and forced in there.There were some good elements to the movie, but it got messed up by the director's strange choices.",Old

He started his career with a bang, with the fantastic ""Sixth Sense"" and has somehow managed to live on that movie to thorougly prove to the world that this was pure dumb luck.I get it, he can film, but he is simply unable to write anything coherent, and unable to direct. It's like he never heard a real conversation in his life, or never seen real people react to something.This film has a typical ""twilight zone""-derivative premise, we all expect that from visionary filmmaker M. Night Shyamalan by now. And it's gorgeously shot, and then the characters starts to talk, this weird sort of pretentious, but childishly stupid, clunky, nonsense dialogue, they have conversations that could never be held outside a Shyamalan, or Ed Woods or Tommy Wiseau movie, and when something happen, they react in a ways that noone other than characters in said filmmakers movie would ever react.I'm dumbfounded how little grasp he has on this after so many years of making movies. In the beginning it's like he's trying to emulate the dialogue as in a Yorgos Lanthimos movie, but whereas the dialogue is weird in the former filmmakers movies, they serve a specific purpose, the should make you uncomfortable, and you can tell where it is meant to be funny. And the script supports it. In Shyamalan's case it becomes funny because they are soo incredible poor written, it almost alway clash with the script, and to top it of, the pretentiousness makes it evident that he is really proud of how clever he is, when we, the audience can see clearly how incompetent and ignorant he is.So please, don't let him write another script, don't let him direct, at most they can let him produce.

They took his knife, put it in a bag and carried on with their day. They didn't even think to consider the fact that there's a psychopathic murderer among them. I think this makes no sense psychologically and has no realism. If someone killed someone, people would restrain him, or even try to kill him as well. But they just ignored him until he attacked them at night. It was just bad, and this is not how humans behave.The science organization doing the trial made no sense, either. How can all of those well educated people be completely missing moral compasses? How can such a sophisticated scientific organization not abide by any ethical protocols? How would they explain the missing people after 73 trials to the Customs of the small island country they reside in? What about the government of the country from which the tourists came from?Also, the psychological development of the children seemed to be a step that the writer just skipped, seemingly because it was too complex to explain.Overall, these nonsensical things really put me off.

612,ruckmaninoff,"""Old"" isn't bad overall! But has some Problems....",7,1 August 2021,"I was looking forward to this flick. M. Night has made a bit of a comeback in recent years. His film The Visit (2015) made back like 20x its budget. And I think Split (2017) made back nearly 30x its budget. That is almost unheard of. ""Glass"" was a decent flick but maybe not as great as I'd hoped. But overall things were looking hopeful...I thought the concept of this movie was great. That's the strongest part of the film. It's a good idea. It's an interesting idea. This island shore is beneficial for some folks, and horrible for others. Huge medical breakthroughs for some, but the opposite for others. That's interesting. Lots of places you could take it.The two biggest problems: The acting was bad. I'm sorry. It just was. And the dialogue. Baddddd.M. Night usually has a few good/great actors to assist in many of his films... whether it's Samuel L. Jackson, Bruce Willis, Joaquin Phoenix, Mark Wahlberg (movie was still bad though, lol), Adrien Brody, William Hurt, James McAvoy, Anya-Taylor Joy... This movie had nothing resembling that echelon of actor or actress. Sometimes the acting was really bad, then sometimes it was decent or good. It was all over the placeI'm kind of torn on this. I was hoping it would be better. But parts of it I did like. I liked the ideas. The potential. The concept. Even the ending was decent! But it got bogged down by nonsense...I still did enjoy it, but it's nowhere near Night's best work. The always great Rufus Sewell was pretty bad in this, which I can't believe I'm saying. It did have ""Miles"" from ""Lost"" in it though, haha, which oddly made sense, casting wise. He was decent. Lol!There was definitely a slight ""The Village"" feel (Nature Preserve), ""The Cube"" and ""Cabin in the Woods"".Overall score (normally) 6.5/10. But due to the ending: 7/10.",Old

614,iuliaradu-86508,I was kind of expecting something else,5,16 October 2021,"So, I saw the trailer and I thought that it was probably a metaphor on time and life and what we do with the time that we are given. Most of the way through I thought that the best ending this film could have was for them all just to die and for the phenomenon not to be explained. So, for like half the film I was just hopeing the ending didn't suck. And, as it turned out, the ending kind of sucked. The twist that they were chosen to be there because of their medical conditions so they would be part of a medicine test, just competely changed the films metaphor half way through, from being about time and life to being about how we are just numbers in a sistem and how our lives don't matter in hindsight. And the way that the twist was executed was not the best : as in, they explaind that they were chosen , that their leave was coverd up by the ""resort"", that the ""resort"" was just a cover just a cover story for a medical test facility, but the phenomenon of the island is still not explained. They should have explained either both or neither.This film could have been amaising, but it kind of wasn't.Also, at least on good thing came out of this film: I found out that I can watch four horror movies in a row with no problem ( and belive me, I've watched some pretty gory stuff). So, I guess I can watch a lot of horror now :)",Old

It's not very scary or very gory which is fine by me. I really like when characters die in these movies- it's a way of moving forward.

The one that restores your faith in him?Well, in this case the answer is no. Absolutely not.The warning signs are immediately apparent as the opening scene of the main family is unnatural, stilted and annoying. Sadly it doesn't get any better.It's hard to describe, but it's almost as if MNS has never heard two humans talk to each other. I lost count of the number of times I rolled my eyes and frustratedly sighed ""Nobody talks like that!"", but by the end I just laughed out loud at the nonsense spilling from the actors mouths.Any plot would be seriously undermined by such terrible dialogue and one as chock-full of holes as this one stood no chance at all. Inconsistent application of the aging process makes it almost impossible to figure out what's happening, while characters react to events in the most bizarre ways. Again, has MNS ever actually seen humans and how they behave?I feel like the movie wanted to say something wise about aging but the weight of the terrible dialogue and unrealistic characters makes that impossible. Instead it ends up saying nothing. Zero. Nada. Ziltch.Don't be fooled by the higher ratings, this really is a bad film in pretty much every respect.",Old

My favourite films of his has to be split and the sixth sense so I was intrigued by this film and the trailer for it made it look very interesting.Overall this film is okay. Not amazing, not awful but just disappointing. The story concept is it's strongest element. It's characters get some development but as soon as they are on the beach they just become cliche and hollow.Some direction choices weren't impressive, the twist at the end falls flat unfortunately. It's a film that seems like it will pick up pace throughout but never does. This film would have benefited much more with a higher budget, a higher age rating and possibly a different director. Jordan peele could certainly make this something historical!The trailer gives far too much away and overall it's a clunky beach vacation.

We got some obvious continuity errors, the script sometimes doesnt make any sense, some scenes break the concept by accident I feel like and the acting is sometimes... wonky.Those aside, the rest was, for me, exactly what I was hoping for and more. I love high-concept movies and the way Shyamalan stuck with the concept and told such an original story with it really resonated with me.Days after seeing it I still was thinking about it and discovering some kind of second layers beneath the story, like the power of the unity of a family and how that can help through the toughest of times. (trying to not spoiler here).So this movie seems to be made exactly for me. High-concept, original script, quite nice visuals.

I feel like some people take movies too seriously and those kinds of people are unable to suspend their disbelief. Just accept the movie for what it is.Some of the acting was poor, but I enjoyed the performances by the kids, Alex Wolff, Thomasin McKenzie, and Vicky Krieps. The cinematography and scenery were beautiful to look at. There were inconsistencies but they didn't take away from the overall movie for me. I liked this movie a lot better than M.

Why are they talking about their relationship problems? Why are they having conversations about random stuff while they are aging years? The whole movie is like that, after they get to the beach. Sure, they try to leave the beach a couple of times, but the movie is more about them all talking about stuff while they age. You'll see a kid age to an adult, and they have a conversation about how their parents are splitting up, like that even matters anymore at that point. I just felt like the film was stretched out. I feel like as soon as they saw that they were aging rapidly, they should have been 100% trying to find a way off of the beach, instead of talking about life and things happening in their lives.",Old

But I cant wait to hear your voice when your older has to be... I have belched more realistic sentences. Is this supposed to be foreshadowing because it has annoyed me now. And things do not get any better.A few minutes later we are given some child acting that makes Jake Lloyds delivery of whoopeee in the phantom menace look oscar worthy by comparison. Now I am not hating on the kids cos it's not their acting skills that makes the scenes horrible. Its the pacing, direction, and the entire crowbarring of an unrealistic situation to establish -
""Hi I'm Trent. This is Idlib. What are your names and what do yo do for a living"" says a 6 year old boy to a group of strangers on the beach. After asking the same thing to another group of strangers. Oh Greg Mitchel is a cop. I bet that's going to come in handy at the end of the movie.Then the film establishes that the beach is speeding up the aging of cells. Fortunately not hair or nails as those cells are dead. Somehow the kids have gained some life experiences too though, such as a 6 year old able to rock climb because she is sad she wont have a prom.This film is -expletive- stupid. I gave Shawaddylamaaman a lot of room, and even found some enjoyment in The Happening. I love the Glass trilogy. But whatever or whoever is missing from the process for this film is sorely missed.I've watched plenty of bad movies but none that are made with a large cast and crew that apparently must have suffered some form of brain death during the lock downs that nobody thought to say - 'this is really really bad'.They say you only regret the things you don't do.

The cast isn't all a-list, but they do excellent work to keep us invested in the characters. Suspense also works rather well. What the heck is going on? Can they get out? Will they go insane and kill eachother?Con's: some of the dialogue is a bit dubious, the beginning is a tad slow and I wasn't too fond of the ending.But did that stop me from enjoying the show? Nope.

The idea of people ageing rapidly on a beach surely would include them actually ageing?The kids just grow up and suddenly act like adults even though they are 6 mentally.The script has absolutely no ability to unfold the events to draw you into the tension of what was happening. 3 hours equals ten years?? That means nobody would survive the night???The camera work (easily the most annoying aspect) deliberately lost focus, drifted off the action or concentrated on the sky, rocks or ocean and pushed the viewer away from the scene. No wonder I didn't care about any of them. It looked like M. Knight himself was growing old and forgot where to point the thing.It looks like they spent the entire (meager) special effects budget on one scene in the cave which was the most hilarious thing I have seen in a while. The rest was some poor (and obvious) use of paste on the faces to create wrinkles.The payoff is.... weakly typical. I was truly hoping for something magical to evolve that would give you some cause to rethink everything you have just watched..But NO. Corporate greed - you may, like me, guess that when the hotel concierge invites ""Special"" guests to enjoy the beach.Not to mention that M.

This movie, while having an awesome scary plot and visuals, actually left me feeling more encouraged to ""smell the flowers"" and enjoy my life. The message I saw in my life was just that - life is fast, and resisting the passing of time is futile, the only way to truly resist the existential dread of aging is the live life in the moment, not take life so seriously, and understand that in the end the only important thing is love and togetherness.

So the son and daughter swim into the sea and in cliche fashion, the daughter gets trapped. We then cut to M Night as a researcher filming the two. Blah blah blah, the resort is actually a lab that makes medicine for people with illnesses. This is what I mean by my summary title. Why can't we theorize and think for ourselves? Did we need every single thing resolved? And as if that wasn't enough the kids survive and expose the whole thing and there's this cop character that helps bust it.The most annoying part is that when we see the lab we can't theorize, no, the guy has to walk up and explain everything even though this is their 73rd time doing this.

It's extremely original story telling depicts the way time goes by in the blink of an eye, and how little our grievances with loved ones matter in the end.The cast is fantastic, and it's awesome to see such a talented and diverse group of actors which symbolically plays so well with this film.M. Night's humor is also at its most mature to date, finding the humor in horror ways few directors are able to.It's cinematography is ambitious and encompassing, and the screenplay is really effective and layered considering the events taking place.

670,llanasgab,A movie jumbled with quirks and flaws,8,10 August 2021,"Honestly, I never really knew why many people crap on this movie so much. Of course it has a cool idea, but the execution (in my opinion, of course), passable. It's not great, it's not poor, just...passable.It has it's quirks, such as the stable pace, a legit impressive setting, the decent acting from time to time, wonderous cinematography, impressive sound design, and it has a kind of decent twist. Not a great twist (like the ones from The Sixth Sense, and The Eastrail 177 Trilogy), but certainly not a bad one.But even I can agree that it does have it's flaws.There are some hokey acting, that sometimes overshadows the good ones, the inconsistencies in the story are revealing. The script feels like an unfinished jigsaw puzzle, missing one or two crucial pieces, and the twist ending is, like I said before, decent, but it still leaves you asking you some more questions, than answering them.Overall, M. Night Shyamalan's Old is not a great movie, heck, it's not even close to one of the best thrillers, or movies of the year, but, a solidly passable movie that's captivating enough to let you ask what will happen next.",Old

I could not care less for any of the characters. The movie started off terrible and got worse. The writing was horrible. If you have to make a six year old push the plot by asking for everyone's occupation it is not good storytelling. It seemed contrived and not natural. There were more plot holes than I could count. The Goofs section covers some of them. I went with my wife who is a big fan of the director. She got mad at me because there were times I was laughing at scenes. This is not a comedy. Some say that the plot twist was intriguing; it did not work for me. This movie should sweep The Razzies. I created an account solely to warn people. This movie made Lady In The Water look like a masterpiece. When it was over, I looked at my watch and saw that I had lost two hours watching this.

Is his family inside of a jar or petri dish? Is Mark Wahlberg also inside of a petri dish when the wind chases after him?I think M Night has wanted to go full on petri dish since forever.The reason his films have become more irritating over the years is because all of his twists require an obscene amount of disbelief suspension to work.We let it slide when Bruce Willis couldn't deduce that he was dead, and when Mr Glass orchestrated mass murder to locate a single superhuman to square off with, and when hydro-susceptible aliens invaded earth while naked, and when a non-blind father sent his blind daughter on a dangerous trek to find modern antibiotics...

709,gkmacca21,"Promising idea, badly executed",4,18 September 2021,"M. Night Shyamalan. What a strange character. Intriguing but often exasperating. If his ability to develop ideas into a coherent story was better, he'd have a far more impressive track record.I notice some reviews sneering that the 'masses' might not get his genius. How amazingly patronising. It suggests there's something 'deep' here that only the really sophisticated can appreciate. The opposite is nearer the truth.So the director seems to have just discovered mortality, and, like so many other filmmakers who've belatedly stumbled on to this theme, he appears to think he must teach the rest of us what it means. That's bad enough, but the way that he does so suggests a precocious 14 year old trying to explain 'carpe diem' to his intelligent parents.The idea draws you in - a strange secluded beach where time seems to accelerate. Fine. And he knows where he wants to go - he knows the start and the finish. It's the between bit, alas, that he fails at.There's barely any character development, so we don't really care about anyone. The dialogue is almost laughably bad at times, so we're not even nudged into trying to believe in any of them.As usual, the director has to rely heavily on actors just staring slightly to one side of the camera, looking beyond at something or nothing, like a revival of the Kulshov Effect, to intimate whatever you want it to intimate. At least that's preferable to the terrible dialogue, but it isn't great storytelling.And there's not really anything happening in the middle except one after another of them dying. Yes, there are a few tacked-on muttered 'if onlys' and 'what ifs' to encourage the idea this is some kind of profound meditation on time, meaning and mortality, but, as we don't know anywhere near enough about any of these people, who cares?So you get a few characters, a clumsy attempt to list their conditions (they may as well have had them all sing that old 'Float On' song to get the job done: 'Hi, I'm Larry, and I'm a paranoid schizophrenic...Float, Float On...'), a tiny bit of excruciating dialogue, and then we're straight into an hour of 'I'm not feeling very well'/'I have a knife, and I'm very angry!'Insulting tosh, I'm sorry to say. Really irritating nonsense.As an episode in The Twilight Zone, it would have made for a distracting enough little fable (although they would have told it far better). As a full-length movie, however, it's a couple of nice pieces of rustic bread with a heck of a lot of processed ham stuffed inside.If M. Night Shyamalan just had ideas and passed them on to filmmakers with greater intelligence, maturity and discipline, I suspect we'd end up with several excellent movies.

The aging was a bit strange, especially with children as they jumped from about 6 to 11 and then to 18, there was no proper aging, like they only aged every hour or 2 and not by minutes. But what bothered me the most were the birth and the tumor operation scenes, I mean where was the blood? Everyone put their sand dirty hands inside her body to remove a softball sized tumor that wouldn't even fit in her, much less so with all her organs in there and she survived without an infection, on top of that everyone's hands were clean after and aswell her stomach. Great news for everyone with a tumor, becouse I guess you can all remove it at home easily (sarcasm). Oh and do you get smarter by aging or by learning?

721,valeriiegedeshevykh,Good Try But Mediocre Result,5,14 August 2021,"We all love M. Night Shyamalan. He has serious contributions to cinema, especially horror cinema. Lately, of course, he is not in his old form, must to admit. He still continues to be the director of interesting subjects, even though he no longer has those crazy twists that were made fun of in the time of Robot Chicken. Still does not hesitate to try new things in each of his films. Although Old remains a weak film when we look at his filmography. But if we evaluate the film in itself, I can say that it is not such a bad film. It all really depends on your expectations.Let's talk about it briefly... Before breaking up, Guy and Prisca come on vacation to a hotel they found online in order to have a good time with their children maybe last time. The hotel manager tells them about a secret beach as he is fascinated by the family's energy. While the family is on their way to the beach, they learn that other families are involved in this secret getaway. The beach is beautiful just as mentioned. Families are having good time. Until 6-year-old Trent suddenly looks 11 years old.The plot of Old, based on the novel Sandcastle, is not that bad. A group of people will age by 2 years every hour. What I like about the idea is that it shows the fact that diseases and future problems are actually ingrained in our DNA. As time passes and the characters get older, their illnesses appear. These diseases also shape the course of the movie. At the same time, the idea of healing the wounds caused by the rapid flow of time was really interesting. The scene where Abbey Lee broke her arm multiple times was quite creative in my opinion. It was perhaps the best part of the movie.I liked the idea of fast forwarded life, which is caused by the supernatural beach. I can say that I watched the whole movie with curiosity, but the main problem with the movie is that what happened is left in the air. The idea, which might have been quite attractive as a book, seems to have lost its grip when it turned into a movie. The element of fear or tension is quite weak. It's intriguing yes, but the result isn't all that delicious. Normally I like movies that open up ethical debates. After all, our fake hotel manager may have killed a total of 730 people, but his goal is to produce a drug that will save millions or billions of people. Of course, I will leave the question of ""who is right"" to you. The experiment part is actually the twist of the movie. But this twist, maybe because it is for the benefit of people, we did not like it very much. After all, twists in Shyamalan's films often lead to bad consequences.If the cast of the film, which M. Night Shyamalan is also presenting as a scout and driver, were not so strong, perhaps my energy for the film would not be so high. Thomasin McKenzie, Eliza Scanlen and of course Abbey Lee were enjoyable to watch throughout the movie. Along with acting, the directing is also interesting and somewhat experimental. The director preferred to make the transitions in time by rotating the camera, which did add some mystery to the film. Although even its sometimes to much, this shooting technique keeps the story flowing. Dialogues are very important to me in such ultra-absurd situations. I can say that the movie managed to stay logical enough in this regard and ensured that i did not break away from the movie.To sum it up... Old has handled kind a good idea correctly but the result is unfortunately not that impressive. Old, which can be very attractive while reading, lost its mystery and fear when it turned into a movie. Some ideas, although they sound good, unfortunately do not stand as strong when reflected on the screen. Woefully Old is a good idea yet the result will not satisfy most people. It's a pleasure to watch, it has some impressive scenes, but i don't think that will you watch it again when the movie is over? I'm not sure about it.",Old
722,kennethkrabat,"Stop wasting viewers' lives, please!",3,2 October 2021,"M. Night Shyamalan in not a visionary filmmaker. I probably agree with his own sentiment, though, that he is in fact trying something different in every movie, but this one is simply bad movie-making. Bad direction, bad, meaningless, stupid script, filming is un-inspired and encumbered in terms of shot length by the need for editing to constantly hide the only trade-off the director has from employing only 2 locations: He cannot show the ageing, because then there is nothing, and he cant leave the primary location. So there is nothing - nothing but tenseful music and meaningless shots of rock walls, sand and waves to fill out the movie-time. Thus, actors working hard at trying to whip up enough energy to be the director's accomplice and hide that fact.Let me just repeat myself: It is a mono-linear and highly boring movie filled with lack of surprise about absolutely nothing but an idea to speed up ageing for a reason. Which I will keep to myself as a gift to the die-hards, who can spare this never-really-has-been of a director a dime and enough minutes to possibly even feel a bit like the characters in the movie: Aged beyond belief.My recommendation: Don't do it. It is only a moment in film history, which will soon be forgotten. There are much better films to grow from. Not even cult material here. Not even that.3/10.",Old

The ensemble cast was great. The scenes on the beach made me uncomfortable in all the ways a horror movie should make one uncomfortable plus about 7 more. And the end provided the satisfying answers that a lot of modern thrillers either forget or neglect to include.There were moments with the daughters that got a bit uncomfortable as they aged and the cameras seemed to focus a bit too much on their bodies, aside from that it was a good film.

753,michaelpoteet,Movie Had Lots of Potential But Ultimately Will Let You Down,5,24 July 2021,"First off, I am a huge M. Night fan! I've enjoyed most of his films. This one on the other hand, made me feel a bit let down. It was a great idea for a movie but it just felt like the story and the ending could have used a little more creativity. I really love how M. Night shot the film in respect to his camera angels. I think he does a really good job using the camera to convey human expression or emotion. The actors were all great! I was introduced to Vicky Krieps for the first time. I think she was amazing! Ultimately the thing that lost me was the story and the ending. They kind of build up this great big mystery. The entire time I was watching, I was trying to figure out what was going on. I kept coming up with all sorts of different scenarios in my head and when the actual plot was revealed, I felt betrayed. The movie really had tons of potential.Spoiler Alert:I really didn't like how the twist of the movie was simply, the girl got her garment caught in some coral reef, and the twist was... she was able to free herself. Very weak twist.I also didn't like how after the 2 kids, now grown adults, escape the beach and then just hand over a book with the victims names in it, over to a cop who is vacationing on the beach also. And this somehow foils the entire operation. The cop doesn't question it or need to be convinced to put his reputation on the line. He just makes some phone calls like he works for men in black or something. He is a local police officer on vacation and all of a sudden he just needs a book with missing peoples names in it to make a bust. Felt like underdeveloped writing. I would have liked to see more hardships with trying to expose the beach and their operation.Lastly the biggest things that irks me the most, is that all of the intended victims of the beach had serious illnesses. They all needed to be researched in order to find a cure. In a morbid way I kind of get that. They are unwilling and unknowingly, sacrificing their lives in order to develop a cure. But none of the children had any sort of illnesses. They were basically collateral damage. It would have been better to develop a way for them to have a purpose on the beach.I enjoyed the movie. Although I feel like the plot and ending could have used a make-over. We are talking about something that every normal person has to deal with, and that is the thoughts of growing old and eventually dying. I really would have liked to see the movie take on a more philosophical approach. The kids grew into adults in the timespan of a few hours. I think more could have been done and said about time. How we lose track of it. And that being said, my time is up. I really appreciate M. Night, he is a great director and writer. I'll continue to watch his films.Thanks.",Old

The consequences of such a world is portraited interesting in the movie, with many examples and logical outcome from the people who are trapped.However, my criticism for this movie is how the director executed such a good idea. Paying too much attention on making and exploring experiments, Mr. Shyamalan seems to underestimate the basic of film principles: show don't tell, a good and understandable antagonist, a good climax and the preparation for it. All of it create a good topic for discussion after the movie, but not-so-great experience inside of the theater.One last thing about this movie: I am not a huge fan of this cinematography.

758,scottlindquist,Not meant for the big screen,4,21 July 2021,"I saw an advanced screening of this film. I'm going to avoid any major spoilers but, given that the film is a mystery, you may wish to avoid reading this altogether.While the concept of the film (based on a 2010 graphic novel) was interesting, I felt there was a failure in execution. The primary flaw is pacing and this may have been unavoidable.It is not a spoiler to state that the film involves people rapidly aging (at a rate of 1 year every 30 minutes). As a result, the pace of the film was probably going to be, unavoidably, fast paced. However, where the film fails is that the characters not only age ""physically"" fast but also ""emotionally"" fast. This results in an emotional roller coaster that frequently struggles to avoid veering off into the realm of ridiculous. The actors try their best to carry script, but repeatedly jumping from emotion to emotion every few minutes is a struggle for even the best of actors.It's possible that this story could have been better handled as a mini-series, where the actors and audience could have had a little more time to savor each ""year"" of the rapid aging process. However, given the constraints of a standard length film, it too often felt like an overly dramatic soap opera.",Old

764,ShadeKnight,"Great idea, shoddy film",5,19 August 2021,"The film is lovely at moments but suffers from odd direction choices and cinematography nonsense.The film was captivating solely due to much of the dialogue which was well-constructed at times and genuinely engaging. On the other hand, other moments were repetitive, senseless, and catered too much to folks with IQs lower than 20, explaining far too much and not delving sufficiently into the character choices or relationships. An exception were the dialogues related to the children, which were consistent and a joy to watch. I couldn't help but feel that the dialogues were unnatural by default yet punctuated with moments of brilliance and introspection.The film could have used less data dump, less attempts to explain (poorly) what was happening, and leave more to the imagination of the viewer. Without spoiling, the end of the filmed seemed totally out of sequence and had zero emotional impact. Everything I had cared about seeing had already been shot, and the pat, rushed conclusion seemed tagged on to an otherwise decent narrative.The people knew too much, they deduced too much, it lessened the final impact of the end, which could have been filmed in a much more startling style, with a clearer narrative edge. I gave away everything long before the audience needed to hear it.Technically, the film offered strange camera shots that perhaps sought to be profound and interesting, yet swiftly became a ""who's who"" of camera work, incorporating techniques famously used by Welles, Tarantino, Wilder, and others. It just became frustrating to watch the camera go off and try to make it's presence known to increase the ""coolness"" of the film, when it should have been doing precisely the opposite.All in all, I enjoyed a lot of the film, but was so disappointed with its last 15 minutes that I wound up leaving the theatre, swearing to myself, and debating its merits over a couple of pints with some friends.",Old

768,tommo-merison,A Pathetic Excuse For A Film,2,1 September 2021,"I love movies, I really do. It's extremely rare that I'll hate a movie so much that it'll make me literally embarrassed and annoyed to watch it. But Old has to be one of the worst movies I have ever seen in my life. And I've seen a lot of films. This one infuriated me. M Night Shyamalan has really lost the plot, literally.I'm a big lover of arthouse movies (Eraserhead and Greenaway's The Cook, The Thief, being a couple of my top favourites). I think movies that try something different are very special and many that succeed deserve to. Trying something new is always good. The problem is that this movie doesn't feel new. It feels like a typical mid budget blumhouse horror with a intriguing concept but no real content of value.Horror has been taken a lot more seriously in recent years, so much so that you can see some amazing technical films out there. Horror is becoming more artsy and I love it. Old is pretty much an arthouse horror movie of the worst kind!The camera work was incredibly obnoxious and unnecessary throughout. I'm a geek for interesting shots and angles, however in this movie, it felt like an excuse for M Night to just play with the settings on his camera. I'm surprised he didn't lob the camera at the wall and add it in as a shot. It's a shame too because you can tell he really tried, and some shots are pretty great, but every single one gets ruined because M Night doesn't know what to do with them. He just shoves in anything and hopes it sticks.Almost none of the directorial choices impacted the story at all. Characters get hit by some disturbing stuff but they all just stand around talking afterwards and the sense of dread is just flat. It doesn't help that the dialogue is so goofy. I really didn't believe what any character was saying.The acting is that typical wooden Shyamalan performance that you'd find in The Happening, combined with terrible direction so you get a complete mess with very little holding it together. And these actors are really talented in other projects, yet they're all as alive as corpses. The emotions felt forced and nothing looks natural or well paced. Characters will lash out one minute and then it's just sort of forgotten about.The dialogue in this movie is appalling for the most part. Whenever there is a decent line, it's ruined by a cringey one. The film gets kind of obsessed with what characters do for a living but all the jobs either feel like plot conveniences or pointless to the actual story. The script also literally force feeds you exposition and has too many coincidences to be believable.The general idea of the film is very captivating and will get peoples attention, the actual plot and development of the story however is mindless. Nothing really makes much sense and the world they create in this film has no real weight to it. Characters just sort of exist and tell us who they are but we don't get to know much about them at all.The film is really a load of nonsense deep down. It's trying to have this whole family story about enjoying the moment and appreciating the present which ties into the main plot of the movie but everything is so ham fisted and dumb that you just don't care about anything or anyone.There are so many great directors that could've taken a whack at this concept and conjured up something decent or maybe even brilliant. But instead you have M Night Shyamalan projecting his massive ego for 2 hours. You can tell he must've been so proud of himself making this film, he probably thought he struck gold with all these unique angles that mean nothing. But he will just shove an angle or shot into any situation just because it looks cool and maybe it will catch the eye. I'm interested to hear the directors commentary of this if there ever is one, I'm genuinely curious to know what the hell he was thinking.I absolutely hated this movie, it frustrated the hell out of me with how terrible it was. I wasn't expecting much from Shyamalan but he really out did himself with how shoddy he can be.There are some super talented people out there struggling to make a living in their industries and then you get people like M Night who just churn out high concept, trailer bait garbage. So many other people could've made this movie and done a good job.It's a shame too because he has demonstrated in the past that he is a knowledgable filmmaker, capable of making some very thoughtful and provocative stuff. But this movie is really not that. Avoid this movie, if you wanna see it wait until it's on Netflix or in the bargain bin or something. Don't waste money on this tripe. I tend to be very forgiving of movies because they're difficult to make but this had a budget and it had talented people behind it, yet it was a car crash throughout. Embarrassing!",Old

Maybe If this were filmed during normal times , they would have a change to add those elements.

Admittedly, the camera angles and the acting wasn't perfect, but this was an amazing concept! If your into sci fi thrillers then this is for you. This movie also reminded me a bit of Fantasy Island made by Blumhouse. With this movie you either like it or you don't. Give it a shot. If you have read this review and decided to watch it then don't complain that it was trash because i have given you things you need to know. But for an M. Night Shyamalan movie, it could do better. The reason why i gave this a 7 was because some things didn't make sense. Something i picked up on was, why did the parents have completely different accents to the children and it didn't really make sense. Also when the kids are growing up rapidly, how did they get all that knowledge in 1 day!? They knew everything an adult would know. It would make more sense if they had knowledge of whatever age they came to the beach as. But something i liked A LOT was how they started to make the parents look old by adding probably some sort of makeup. I think that was very clever because near to the end they started looking very old. As i say, i really enjoyed this movie but things didn't really make sense, camera positions wasn't great and the acting wasn't too great either. But because of how brilliant the concept was, i really didn't mind. Good Thriller!",Old

Split is one of my favorite movies and frankly the fact he didn't get a at least an Oscar nomination for best director in or best screenplay is ridiculous. The sixth sense is still another one of my favorite movies. And don't even get me started on the visit, the idea of the twist still creeps me out just thinking about it. But this movie was just really disappointing. I thought the trailer looked amazing it had good actors a good plot idea and from what I saw I was hoping there would be a really good twist. But there wasn't. The movie was confusing and I still don't really get the twist, even after understanding what it's supposed to be. The acting sucked, and what I found disappointing was that the actors were sick. I mean Nat Wolff is a brilliant actor. He's good in paper towns, and plays the part well. And again the fact he didn't get a oscar nomination for hereditary is ridiculous. Thomasin McKenzie has only had one good movie, but when your good movie is Jojo rabbit, now you've got high expectations from now on because her performance in that was brilliant. But anyway the acting wasn't good at all, the story didn't make sense as it went on and frankly it just wasn't scripted well.

It feels as if it was rushed, the screenplay is disjointed & lingers for what seems like an eternity. This may be a clever device that some appreciate, each to their own. For me this offering is well over that fine line between entertainment and liquid self indulgence.M night shyamalan is boring.

He's a story-teller, and usually there's something worth watching in his story.But this... oh man... what on gods earth happened?Now, I'm trying to give him the benefit of the doubt by reminding myself that this was originally a French graphic novel. But many Hollywood movies were once graphic novels... and many of those are great.The script and acting in Old is so over-the-top horrible, that I'm exhausting myself trying to understand why Shyamalan intentionally chose to go this route.How do you get such quality actors to act this badly? Why would he write such imbecilic dialogue and moronic scenes?I have to believe that he insisted each take be less believable than the one before, until he settled on the absolute worst from his cast. I'm actually embarrassed for the actors, because it's far too much of a coincidence that every single one of them suddenly forgot how to act on the same movie. But then again, the dialogue was preposterous, so...Skip this movie and go read the book.

827,bernardaquina,Typical M. Knight thought proviking semi-horror,7,26 October 2021,"After viewing reviewing Old Henry, by Tim Blake Nelson, I thought I would stay on the Old theme with M. Knight Shyamalan's Old. Shyamalan is a writer/director with an itch for odd and unusual film making. His body of work doesn't appeal to many but taking this into account his artistic leanings, I found this most recent offering of 2021 worth a sit down. I liked his earlier works mostly for the variety of creative performers he at one time used to cast in his movies, but rarely seem to attract any longer. Perhaps the appeal to the big-name box-office actors and actresses has waned. But of those films, to name few; 6th Sense with Bruce Willis, Signs, starring Mel Gibson, The Happening, staring Mark Wahlberg and John Leguizamo and Unbreakable with the wild, zany Samuel L. Jackson, in Old I only recognized the male lead as Gael Garcia Bernal as the selfish, annoying Alpha male cheating partner of Julianne Moore from the movie Blindness, but he rest of the cast, not so much. Still, with the weak cast, I feel Old deserves a medium sized buttered popcorn bucket and large Sprite rating largely because of Shyamalan's knack for challenging audiences to take an expansive view of humanities spiritual failings and societal short sightedness, like ignoring the consequences of taking the environment for granted and not believing in ghosts and forest monsters (Halloween is days away folks), Old suggests there are mysteries of this world we have yet to consider or accept as well as a commentary on the lengths man will use his fellow man to visit abuses that may have good intentions but evil methodology. I found the less well-known characters in Old a failing and not as believable as others in his more note-worthy films, but not too distracting. I found them sympathetic in their obvious vulnerabilities. The story line and dialogue also fell short at times but I still give Old a solid 7, for its entertaining value as a characteristic M. Knight suspension of beliefs theme movie.",Old

The dialogue and the acting is so atrocious, there literally isnt a single scene in the whole movie that didn't make me cringe. Then there's the ""cinematography"" or should i say lack there of, as the whole movie is a convoluted mess of random camera shots pieced together by who i assume is M Night's 6 year old son.

I enjoyed the concept and the unfolding of the story. It is good to let go of distractions of life for two-hours and just enjoy the ride the director and storyteller takes the viewer on. The acting was exceptional with special praise for the wildly undervalued (at least in my opinion) Ken Leung. The man is a legend. Rufus Sewell was outstanding, as well. M. Knight had more than just a passing cameo, and he nailed it. This was my favorite Shamalan movie since...the Sixth Sense. My thought is that a movie, a true movie experience, needs to take someone away to a novel place employing the willful suspension of disbelief to deliver maximum impact. Along with pacing and great acting this movie delivered outstanding entertainment on all levels. Kudos and praise to all involved!",Old

It didn't... this is truly the worst film I've ever seen. Its not even cheesy bad or funny bad its just plain old stupid and BORING.

852,allismile,7.5 stars. Fun,8,25 October 2021,"M. Night Shyamalan has been on a bit of a comeback streak since he simplified his approach in story telling starting with The Visit in 2015. None of his recent movies are to the level of his greatest achievements of 6th Sense, Unbreakable, and Signs- but his more recent films have been a huge step up from movies like After Earth or Last Airbender.I like to think of his more recent films as A level B styled films- which is a smart retrograde move with all the overly complex and long mainstream movies being made, especially in the action sci fi department.Old is quite good, and has very good story telling and pace. It's succinct, fun, and smart. I think a lot of people gained such a high standard for Shyamalan because of his big 3 films, followed by huge disappoints after, that he will never be forgiven and fully accepted as the film maker he is today. I will forever believe he needs an honest voice to help his vision out, because sometimes he makes really simple bad decisions that hurt the overall story (for example the very end of Glass). But I still think he's a top notch director, and Old is another in a line of fun movies that I think is easy to enjoy if you don't take it too seriously.",Old

It was like they were just walking into the scene and reading their lines. Really disappointed after such great movies from the director. The ending should've finished at the twist rather than going on to the credits as the twist more than made up and compensated for the bad acting. Would I watch it again? Hell no.

856,jimereybat,"Commendable approach, however...",3,24 July 2021,"I came into this movie with high expectations. The cast, diverse and interesting; certainly talented. The premise seemed exciting and I walked into the theater with the certainty that I was going to watch a fantastic film. Regrettably, I left with an unshakable disappointment.On a bright note, the film was visually intriguing and beautiful. The performances were solid for the script they were given, and I absolutely ADORE the diversity of the cast. It highlighted societal issues that, though popular subject matters and themes, were tackled from a different angle.While no one can dispute the originality and good premise of the film, I didn't find it very well executed. It didn't make a choice between a horror/comedy and a more serious film; and it didn't work in its favor. The characters were surface level, which made it impossible to care about the misfortunes that plagued them. This wasn't the performers' fault as much as the script's. The relationships between said characters were poor... they cared so little about each other that the stakes completely sank, and ultimately this resulted in a visually intriguing but boring film that left me craving something more. The pace was pretty consistent throughout, as the seemingly high stakes were so pushed and evident that they soon became ordinary and dry. Since this didn't fully lean towards the humorous side of things, the only thing to enjoy was the ridiculousness of the characters' actions at times; but this was not enough. Even the original approach to issues like racism and mental health, which were tackled in an original and provocative way, were overshadowed and lost quality because of how utterly inconsequential everything became at one point. Every tragedy was comparable to the previous and the next. I also found it too... ""in your face"". It didn't really make the audience figure things out; everything was stated or very evident. This also made it a bit difficult to watch.While I appreciate the approach and the risk... I don't think it got to where it wanted to go.",Old

Many motifs happening in this storyline.Spoiler: when the son Trent finally goes to look and decode the message from his friend, its a great parallel idea to youth is wasted on the young.

865,carlburger,An instant cult movie,2,21 September 2021,"I haven't written a review since 2015. But ""Old"" demands it. It defies what the common definition of what ""bad"" means, in the same way ""The Room"" (2003) did. It is something else. It is its own entity. Should you watch it? Definitely. Will you enjoy it? Well, that depends entirely on your expectations. If you expect to see a good horror movie, then the answer is a resounding No. But if you expect a challenge on par with eating a Carolina Reaper pepper or having an ice bucket poured over you - then this is for you.Because this is an attack on all fronts. From the horrible acting, the ridiculous cinematography, the horrendous editing and the script, oh the script... The script feels like it was written by aliens who have never met humans, so they had to guess what normal human interaction looks like, and completely wing it when it came to the dialogue. Because noone talks like they do in this movie. Everything is exposition and self narration.So, mark my words. There will be musicals made on this. People will learn every line by heart and yell them out loud at yearly screenings. People will brag about watching the whole thing.This is a cult movie. It was made unironically. It takes itself serious. Dead serious. And it's in the contrast between the intent and the result where cult movies are born. ""The Happening"" didn't quite reach all the way over to the magical realm of movies that are so bad that they become immortal legends. But ""Old"" does. Plan 9 From Outer Space, The Room, Howard the Duck, Old. They all belong on the same shelf.In conclusion:
Old is a glorious, spectacular mistake from start to finish. Enjoy.",Old

This one though, is different. It has the usual NS' trademarks in terms of camera works, dialogues etc but this movie feels like a different class from the other ones he made. It's an outlier and it makes me wonder what made him want to do a movie from the original book.The first half gave me a feeling that this is going to be one of those 'out there' movies full of ridiculous ideas and a head-shaking ending I often find in streaming services. It is cringy at times and the plot implaussibity is just borderline comedic (far off from the level of Sharknado ofcourse but enough to make me wonder if some scenes are meant to be funny or not). The second half, especially when it is getting clear where the movie is heading, is slightly better eventhough some parts are too dark (lighting wise) and the revelation in the end is so predictable and not exactly rewarding.Go watch it but don't expect another Sixth Sense or Unbreakable.",Old

Theres no plot and theres a feeble five minute attempt at creating a sinister plot in the end. Theres no explanation of how and why the two kids ( Old bro and sis) survived. Nor is there any explanation for why people are getting old on that beach.Cant believe that someone has actually written a book on this tenuous plot.M Night Shyamalan has also got into this bad habit of wanting to act and appear in his movies aka Subhash Ghai ( Bollywood Film Director Of Yesteryears)What were you thinking MNS, seeing a film plot in this story in itself is a living proof that youve lost it.",Old

893,anodette,Shyamalan is a Master,9,24 July 2021,"For some reason, there is a fervent distaste expressed by many film lover regarding M. Night Shyamalan. I, for one, respect and enjoy almost every single one of his movies, barring a few obvious exceptions in The Happening, The Last Airbender, and After Earth. So needless to say, I was excited for this film, however my fear that Shyamalan may return to the same directorial spot where he made The Happening still lingered in the back of my mind.I expected that I would still, nevertheless, enjoy this movie. I didn't expect a masterpiece. This movie is top tier Shyamalan. For you, that may mean automatic disinterest, but for fan's of Night's work, and fans that are able to look past the stigma surrounding his films, this is a treat.The modern master of suspense has reclaimed his title. The Visit had some spooky elements, and Split was a great thriller before it was revealed to be a part of the Unbreakable trilogy, so this is the first true and original thriller since Shyamalan's resurgence with The Visit. To say he nailed it would be an understatement.In terms of direction, Night's quirks are certainly present, but I would say that they bookend the film, occupying the first act and the last ten minutes or so, while the rest is purely atmospheric tension. The cast put together here is not what you'd expect from a summer blockbuster, but it makes it all the more enjoyable. While there are some familiar faces, our leads are certainly not box office draws, and that makes this all the more immersive. Alex Wolff continues to prove his acting chops, especially in horror with this and Hereditary under his belt. The same goes for the lovey Thomasin McKenzie, who, with Wolff, pull off what many actors would make unbelievable and foolish in portraying literal children in adult bodies. The parental leads steal the show however, especially Vicky Krieps, who's relationship with her family is truly the heart of this picture. The rest of the cast is mostly great as well, but the main family is truly where the focus goes.On paper, much of what happens in this film would come across slow and boring, but the execution, coupled with the ticking-clock element that you truly feel the moment that things start to go wrong make for a blood-pumping thriller. What I love about this movie is how bloody strange it is. This is NOT your average summer blockbuster, but it is my hope that the lack of competition at the box office will draw in viewers to this experience.The story is very odd and twisty, in the Shyamalan fashion, but what is most impressive is the array of emotion it creates within a viewer. The closest of Night's other films this can be compared to in terms of tone is probably Signs in the fact that it is emotionally sweet, funny, and terrifying all within a seconds notice. Touching on themes of human nature, life moving too fast, and the hopelessness we sometimes feel at our mortal lives, Shyamalan hits every single statement he wants to make with this movie out of the park. This may be his only movie where the messages portrayed are so excellently done, and the added beauty of the final twist being politically and socially relevant lead for a truly cathartic experience leaving the theater.I want to avoid spoilers at all cost, but do yourself a favor and see this movie. By all means, read the reviews that give mediocre scores and call it boring, but be aware that many of these people give perfect scores to corporate advertisement slog films such as Black Widow and Snake Eyes (this film's box office competition). If you want a truly unique, original, exciting, scary, and truly engaging experience at the cinema, watch Old. Otherwise, just watch Tik Tok videos.",Old

907,markemek,The biggest waste of an intriguing premise!,1,19 October 2021,"There was a time when M. Night's films were a good and solid watch. Yes, he had the shtick of twist endings which made the films only worth watching once, but at least they were worth watching. But, he seemed to have completely lost his edge.So, a simple breakdown of why this film was terrible:1. Special effects: Very 90s film aesthetic. Completely outdated and even the CGI was poorly done.2. Camera angles: One word - DISORIENTING! Even when two people are just speaking casually, the camera would circle around them non-stop to the point it made me feel physically ill. A good thriller can have quiet moments that don't need to utilize crazy camera angles to heighten its intensity. That's film directing 101 for you.3. Plot: A lot happens at ONCE. Almost every scene has multiple reveals and various complications. It's just too much. Instead of spreading it out and having a solid pacing for the unfolding of the story's events they all just happen simultaneously. So you end up having a lot of moments where characters are just running frantically from one place to another without a moment to actually digest what's happening. It could be good to have one or more scenes like that in a thriller, some confusion can really add to the emotions, but because it's like that all the time everything just falls flat. The emotions never have time to arrive or resonate.4. Dialogue: This is the clincher! THE DIALOGUE WAS ATROCIOUS! It sounded like it was written using google translate! Real humans don't talk like that. I know some of the actors in this film from other movies, and I know they can act difficult scenes, but the dialogue was so poorly written they sounded like actual bots! Just thinking that an entire room of writers actually fleshed out those lines makes me cringe so hard!!5. Addressing Representation of Physical and Mental Illnesses: In order to keep this review spoiler free, I will only say that M. Night has definitely not done sufficient research regarding the conditions presented in this film and instead relied on outdated and toxic tropes that did nothing for the film and just made everything really obvious and cliched.",Old
908,jadearce,Typical M. Night Movie,6,27 July 2021,"I feel like M. Night can always comes up with a very original movie idea/concept, and then NEVER knows how to finish the movie. I actually liked the movie up until the end. It started of slow, but as the movie started to unfold it picked up really quick. I thought it was the right amount of creepy and had a few ""WTH!!"" moments that I definitely didn't see coming. The writing was weird at some moments and the characters were pretty flat (which I didn't really care about), but then the ending was just so disappointing. The whole ""coral"" decoding at the last minute and then the ""almost drowned"" scene was just ridiculous. First of all, I don't find the coral code very believable. A 5 year old boy that is the son of the hotel owner just so happened to hear this conversation and give the other 6 year old boy this as a note to decode. Then at the last minute, the boy is like ""hmm I should decode this note"" and then it just so happens to be the answer to the island!!??? Come on. Second, I was so annoyed when the girl almost drowned because seriously, just TAKE OFF THE WRAP!!! Why this thought didn't come to their mind drove me crazy. Lastly, the ending was just extremely rushed and unsatisfying. I only give it a 6 because I still applaud M. Night for the idea and bits and pieces of the delivery of it.",Old

How can these medical trials be conducted through observation alone? Don't you need blood tests or biopsies to confirm results.

It's incredibly difficult to make a decent film, let alone a good one and this film certainly doesn't deserve its current low rating. This was a good film. It is after all a work of fiction so you have to suspend disbelief. I don't know about you but I go to the movies to be entertained and this film did just that. It was beautifully shot so kudos to the cinematographer. The acting was great, loved the storyline, there were also bits of humor. It kept my interest throughout and it was very suspenseful and highly entertaining. The movie is almost entirely shot on this remote beach and you are drawn into the story and these characters. There was just the right amount of dialogue and I felt really invested in the storytelling and wanted to know how it would all end. Great twist at the end, in true Shyamalan style. This is what makes good filmmaking, it's not special effects and a billion dollar budget, it's good storytelling. M. Night hit it out of the park with this one. Borrowing on elements from Hitchcock and with masterful direction, he manages to make this sweet film. It was a real treat and I thoroughly enjoyed it. If you are a fan of M.

927,feckingmoonmars,I felt as though I aged 50 years watching 'Old'.,3,28 July 2021,"I will say I enjoyed the premise of the film. I suppose that's because it came from a graphic novel, which presumably didn't try to squeeze so complex a story into one feature film (not that I'm asking for more of it). I'll give the actors the benefit of the doubt, Vicky Krieps and Rufus Sewell are well-established thespians, but the dialogue in this film was almost unbearable. The characters seem to flatly blurt out superfluous statements at random, as if the film were being narrated by a particularly lazy audio-describe voiceover. Inexplicably, characters with no depth or real interest for the audience confess to years and years of secrets, worries, and regrets; but without the pathos achieved by developing the characters at all, these scenes are embarrassing to watch. I'll admit that I did laugh, slightly uncomfortably and while wondering whether certain lines were intended as comedy. I am by no means a film snob and went into this one with an open mind, not expecting greatness but hoping for a good time. The one thing I can say in its merit is that it has a knack for making you feel a good few years older by the time it's over, which is perhaps the only way it forces you to sympathise at all with its characters.",Old

At this point, I think it's just a trend to hate on his films.Was this his best work? No, but it certainly wasn't his worst. It's a classic Shyamalan film with his unique flare added to it. It has the Shyamalan twist ending and his usual camerawork style. I enjoyed it and understood what he was trying to convey. Unlike others who like to nitpick his films, I took it for what it was and enjoyed and understood the overarching concepts. If you go see this, don't expect it to be a slasher horror filled with cheap jump scares. It's meant to disturb and unsettle. I liked it, but it's not my favorite Shyamalan film.

I expected that the original idea of this movie would carry it a bit higher.Old is just what the plot summary says, It's a movie about abnormal aging. I was hoping for a non medical take and more of a Sci-fi ""it just happened"" rendition to this unusual and original idea. Sadly, the plot also lacks any means of intrigue towards the characters, in fact, I became mildly uncompassionate during the runtime of this movie.With the same lack of empathy from the producers and director, some very interesting medical procedures took place. As I do not want to spoil anything for someone that wants to see the movie, i can use a word, softball, to describe what scene I am talking about.Altough the cinematography were at some points mediocre, I did manage to keep attentative enough to realise that some scenes had oscar worthy cinematography. Do not be fooled however, those scenes do in no way make this movie anything other than a quick buck. The ""Show-no-tell"" was also pretty good, atleast it stood out compared to the negative attributes of the movie.Should you watch ""Old""?Honestly speaking, no. If you however have kids or someone who might want to watch this, go see it with them. I probably would not have payed cinema prices to see this movie, so maybe wait for a sale?All in all, a movie that i will forget in 30 minutes and something i did not really enjoy.This idea deserved more, this cinematography deserved more.

Because the movie was all over the place they were forced to explain what was happening through the dialogue. Which made it hard to watch. The inconsistencies were frustrating. Their bodies aged but they didn't seem to age mentally, but all of a sudden they did? Where did all of the bodies go? How come they could walk through the rocks to the beach with no problem?

While you can sense this isn't a major award contender by any stretch, Old is a movie well worth your dollar while in theaters if for no other reason than not too much else along these lines seems to be produced as of late. It's also commendable that without reaching an R-rating, scenes range from shocking, unjust and creepy...to introspective, thought-provoking and even heart-warming. The impressive thing is that it manages these things while teetering on the edge of absurdity. As he briefly introduced the film, the director seemed enthusiastic with this movie for the sake of pleasing his audience by way of his filmmaking labor of love.",Old
953,thatjennings,A wonderfully garbage movie from a M Night,7,24 September 2021,"This movie is impossible to give a score. I gave it a 7 anyway. Judged purely on its technical and artistic merits, it's a 2, maaaaybe a 3 at best. It's a 9 judged on how much fun I had watching it. So I more or less split the difference. Sort of? Whatever. It get a 6.5 and we'll round that up.I am utterly fascinated by M Night Shyamalan. He's a weak triple A league director or a strong double A director depending on who you ask. He's produced some genuine classics of Hollywood. He's also bad at almost every part of making movies. Some of the worst theatre releases of the past two decades have come from him. He can't write or direct natural dialogue to save his life but he seems to consider himself an auteur and you can tell he takes his work incredibly seriously. He puts himself in his movies which is just peak narcissism to me.I love him.To me, a good bad movie is a movie that is genuine and sincere in its attempts to say or imitate something. I don't enjoy schlock like Sharknado because it's clear the idea was to make a stupid movie right from the get go. Contrast that with films like The Room which are clearly a labour of love of their creators and yet turn out incomprehensible and terrible.That's the sweet spot Old falls into. I don't want to cover anything about the plot, because it all needs to be experienced firsthand to truly be appreciated. It's the Room-iest film I've seen since The Room. M Night has clearly been snorting lines of pure Wiseau, absolutely mainlining ""Oh Hi Mark"" directly into his veins. The dialogue here is so badly delivered, so ineptly paced and interjected into scenes that I was convinced I'd blacked out and accidentally hit my remote to switch over to another channel.It's so badly shot at times that I was convinced the version I was watching had been accidentally zoom scanned and I was only seeing like half of the shot that was supposed to be visible but I've confirmed this is not the case. He was clearly going for some tense singletake cinematography, but the choice of shots and the terrible acting that so frequently filled them just destroys any hope of being pleased with the outcome. Not to mention the absolutely garbage CG and set-design. I found out after the fact that the cliff backdrop for the beach was actually fully fake and had been constructed for the film, a fact that seems obvious based on CG panorama's that would have looked awful and out of place in 1992's Jurassic Park.Everything about Old is just so inept and poor and yet so earnest and sincere that I can't help but love my time with it. Watch while high with some friends that can appreciate bad film making and you'll have a blast.",Old

960,moviecorner,"A few bright spots aside, it looks like Shyamalan's ""return to form"" was nothing more than a delusion",4,27 July 2021,"What else is there to say about the infamous M. Night Shyamalan that hasn't been said already? This guy's entire career since the late 90s has been nothing short of bizarre. Starting off with his brilliant masterpieces ""The Sixth Sense"" and ""Unbreakable"", and his decent alien movie ""Signs"", Shyamalan's been on a confusing - and sometimes frustrating - up-and-down journey throughout the years. Not to mention he had his darkest days with trash like ""The Happening"", ""The Last Airbender"" and ""After Earth"" that really put a huge dent on his once-promising reputation. It's like all the potential he used to have just.... randomly disappeared, and nobody could even try to explain what in the world happened to him.And even weirder, Shyamalan's career kinda saw.... a little bit of a revival (of sorts) in 2015, with his found-footage horror movie ""The Visit"". Which was surprisingly decent. And then, it got better for him when he put out ""Split"", his best movie since ""Signs"". At this point, people started wondering if Shyamalan was actually learning from his mistakes and going back to his roots where he was at his peak. But then... ""Glass"" came out in early 2019... and let's just say: i think we kinda let our guard down here, 'cause as the final chapter in his ""Unbreakable"" trilogy was.... underwhelming.And that brings us to today, with his latest movie, ""Old"". A movie about a group of people who decide to spend the day at a secluded beach, only to find out this beach is rapidly aging them, leaving them with only 24 hours to live.Now, i'm just gonna come out and say it: that premise is fantastic, and i can kinda relate to it. Being an awkward guy with anxiety and self-esteem problems, sometimes I feel nervous about growing old and the idea that we'll inevitably leave this world one day. So, movies that focus on this topic always been fascinating to me, and the fact that this movie's based on a comic book from 2010, i couldn't help but feel intrigued. Then again, this is from M. Night Shyamalan, so i still made sure to keep my expectations in check, just in case. But then, i actually went to see the movie..... and i'm writing this review a day later..... yeeeeeaaaahhhh.I wanna start off with what i liked about ""Old"", because there were quite a bit that did work. First off, it looks great. Beautiful cinematography, great make-up effects, fluid camera movements, fantastic lighting and the perfect location for the movie, you can tell Shyamalan gives it his all when making his movie look appealing and eye-catching. The actors are doing a fairly decent job with what they're given, and there were some genuinely effective scenes that had me like: ""Whoa! Okay, Shyamalan. I see what you did there. Good job"". And i'm not gonna lie: there were a few other moments that got me teary-eyed a little bit.But.... unfortunately, that's all i can say about positives. Because with what Shyamalan actually gave us (compared to what it could've been).... i'm sad to say: ""Old"" isn't a very good movie. And the movie's biggest sin is the script and the execution of said script. Again, i can relate to Shyamalan here, because i too am nervous about the idea of growing old. The problem here is that he doesn't do a whole lot with this premise. He only scratches the surface without ever going into depth with it. And because of this, the plot just ends up being paper-thin and really show. There's really not much of a story here, other than freaky s**t happening on this beach that kills these people one by one. Most of the time, it's just a bunch of stuff happening on screen strung together for almost 2 hours, and it's meant to shock you, but when there's little to no substance, then what's the point?And then, there's the dialogue.... dear sweet God, where to start? I'm actually kind of at loss Shyamalan legit wrote this dialogue and was like: ""Yeah, that's perfect!"" No Shyamalan, it's awful! I mean, okay. There might be a few lines sprinkled here and there that genuinely work well, but most of it kept reminding me of the dialogue in ""The Happening"" or ""The Last Airbender"". It's so corny and over-the-hop, it makes the movie unintentionally hilarious at times, when it's supposed to be something scary or intense. Like, am i seriously supposed to take a line like ""You have wrinkles"" seriously? Come on, Shyamalan! Not to mention the characters weren't really all that interesting or likable (I can barely even remember their names), and some of the acting feels way off, but i guess that's par for the course given the script to this thing.And in typical M. Night Shyamalan fashion, there's yet another ""final twist"".... I don't know why he keeps doing these, even when it's not necessary. The final twist in this movie just baffled me. It straight-up didn't make any sense at all. Now, i haven't read the original comic, so i have no idea how faithful Shyamalan is here, but the point still stands: this movie didn't really need to have a final twist. At least, not one as baffling as this!At the end of the day, ""Old"" proves that Shyamalan's supposed ""return to form"" was nothing more than short-lived and delusional. It's not his worst movie - far from it, actually. Really hard beating ""The Last Airbender"" - but with that concept and a promising first act, i'm still shocked at how the movie actually turned out. I keep hoping for Shyamalan to actually give us something good, but now.... i don't know if i can keep on trusting him.",Old
961,gabriellegrosbety5,Timely themes inhabit this newly warped sense of time and place,8,30 July 2021,"""Old,"" directed by M. Night Shyamalan, is a tale that grew on me more and more as it progressed because of the increasingly timely and impactful themes that it explored through a world constrained by a lack of time that hurries along before each of the characters can fully process or reconcile with their own emotions.""Old"" opens at a tasteful and tropical island resort as families and their children seemingly get ready for a week of paradise. The adults unwind, splaying themselves out to tan on beach chairs, while drinking delicious, satiating cocktails, as the whole island for their children becomes their oversized playground.However, I'll stop right there, because unfortunately a beautiful, idyllic vacation is not quite where ""Old"" is headed. Soon, different families find themselves on their way to what is promised by the resort to be a breathtaking, unmissable nature reserve and private, secluded beach. However, the longer and longer they stay there the more strange occurrences seem to swirl menacingly around them. Time at this beach and escape from it aren't usual because whenever someone tries to leave they black out before they get very far. Years propel by condensed in minutes and hours as the children of the family grow from children to teens to adults and the adults age and grow old without living those days out.In this newly warped sense of time, space, and place, the characters begin to powerfully, alertly recognize that arguments that seem significant in the moment aren't as significant in the grand scheme of time and relativity of the universe. And also aren't as significant as the importance of loving each other and never forgetting to express that before it's too late. Emotions are urgently felt and recognized in a time that is even more fleeting than the time we know and these characters grow up before they are ready and experienced to be a certain age, which is an undying testament to how sometimes we're forced to grow up before we feel we have grown into our physical age, which usually differs from our emotional age and self-perceived maturity.I took away a star, because although this movie, at its core, was wired in strength and aptitude to identify and explore, like a toddler trying out its legs for the first time, important questions associated with human existence, there were parts that felt a little zany and off-the-walls, which distracted me a bit and took me out of certain moments I could've been feeling even more deeply and appreciatively. Overall, though, this was a story that stops to make you think about how you treat people, strangers, acquaintances, friends, the ones you love, and encourages you to fervently question how you leave people and say goodbye. A general good rule of thumb, which translates onto screen in this movie, is to never leave someone angry or hurt if you can help it or leave them in a way where you would regret everything if they died unexpectedly the next day. Life is precious, mobile, and transient as it is so aim to be the best version of yourself you can and forgive yourself on the days that you can't because not each part of the human experiment will be pretty, fully fleshed out, or easy, but that is all part of the ride we call life and isn't it a privilege to be on it.",Old

It was one of those movies that clearly after the first incident in the movie the characters should start to realize that there is something wrong, but they do nothing but just walk around aimlessly.

So I stepped into this movie with a open mind and high expectations. I can't say I was disappointed, because it had some kind of impact on me, but for me it lacked the dark mysterious tone Shyamalan puts in his movies. Mostly it is a drama disguised as something trying to be gruesome and scary, which is ok... many great horror movies are dramas deep down, like the conjuring trilogy for example, but they are also scary and disturbing, and Old just didn't brought that to the table in my opinion.",Old

It's literally all tell and no show, Exposition: The Movie. Characters talk at each other rather than with each other.What's so maddening is that the concept (which MNS adapted) is a beautiful allegory on accepting mortality and appreciating life however short.If MNS had just focused on character development, it could have worked. But he chooses to make the figurative literal and as a result over-explains every last detail and bends it all to a dissatiafying twist that robs the story of its core humanity and message.Once again, MNS has been given a good story with great actors to execute it and has managed to ruin it with awful writing.",Old

The Sixth sense was a masterpiece, then comes Unbreakable, a great film, after that Signs, which still had that original touch, the Village was good, really unexpected twist, I even liked Lady in the Water, but this... I honestly don't know how his films can worsen so much with time, he should be in his creative prime now. Split was the only glimmer of hope for M. Night's creative work in the last 15 or more years, the rest..""Old"" begins with couple of too obvious mentions of ""time"", like ""value your time"", ""we have all the time we need"" and similar, those moments feel too cheap and artificial. The protagonist family leads the most awkward dialogues that you can imagine in a family. Later on, on the beach I thought at least 5 or 6 times, come on what's happening here!. There's a scene where the model lady got stuck in a cave and due to calcium deficiency her bones are breaking too easily and healing extra fast in wrong places too quickly which makes her turn in a human spider in a matter of seconds. Come on! :)) Everything felt unnatural and took away from the overall quality. This is just one example, the whole script feels unnatural. Camera work tries to be original and this is a matter of taste, so I wouldn't comment on that. After ca. 1 hour I seriously considered leaving the projection, but decided to power through to the end.

If this film was maybe 30 minutes shorter in runtime then maybe I would recommend checking it out.

The story is simple and the end is pretty good but not as spectacular as Shyamalan's classics. I think that's where Shyamalan evolved, he's not taking risks anymore that could ruin the movie. The film always finds a way to show you the events in a subtle way. The movie also keeps you thrilling thanks to it's fantastic music that almost never stops. The actors are good in general. Thomasin Mckenzie delivers a really good performance, with amazing facial expressions. The movie also finds the way to push his concept to the max while still being interesting. Even if the movie has a lot of things going on in it, it takes his time to show the psychological effects that time has on people. Shyamalan delivers a touching study of people getting old in one scene in particular where they're around a fire. I'm expecting people not understanding Shyamalan's films as always and say ""it's ridiculous and doesn't make any sens ( the end in particular)"". To you, I'll just say to watch the movie carefully and you'll realize that everything is pretty much coherent. And if it's the concept that troubles you, why did you go to see it ? Anyway, I encourage you to see the movie to make your own opinion. I advise you to learn Shyamalan's color codes before seeing it will make the film even better.",Old

Throughout the first half of the movie I almost thought that he was part of the scheme with the hotel staff because of the way he was interacting with characters, only to realize he just did a very bad job in his role. After I realized he was not part of the scheme, it felt like he was standing there reading off a scrip not even trying to get into character.The next issue I had with acting was the character of Charles (played by Rufus Sewell). In my opinion he didn't do a bad job, but I felt like they could've had someone better in the role. I loved the idea of the character Charles as a schizophrenic/crazy person but Sewell didn't fully sell me on him being crazy. If the role had been done better and made me believe he was insane I think it would've added a lot to the movie.Another issue I had with the movie as a whole was the rating. It's a PG-13 movie, but I felt if they made it rated R and showed some of the more intense scenes all the way through instead of cutting away it would've given me more of a thrilled/scared feeling.All in all I really did enjoy the movie and like I said I would recommend it to friends and family.

1060,elcochan,"Horrible movie, good think piece.",4,18 September 2021,"I wanted to like this movie; I really did you just have to get past the bad dialogue and the movie can be entertaining, but it is really hard to get over that hurdle. I caught myself a few times during the movie reading lips to make sure I was not watching an English dub of the movie, that is how stale the dialogue and line delivery was. The emotions in the voices did not really match up with the situations that were being portrayed on the screen through most of the movie. Because of this contrast this threw the whole movie off balance. It was like the actors were only handed a script with their lines on it and they had to guess when they needed to deliver their next line. All of the dialogue through the entirety of the movie felt disjointed. If I had to choose a picture to describe it, I would choose the image of Madrid in the cave that was twisted into a broken mess right before she died.There were a few parts that were suspenseful and were really done well; in particular the rock-climbing scene, and the coral tunnel scene. The endings to those scenes were predictable but still suspenseful. Character deaths were common, but the problem was when a character died you felt nothing, you just thought ""Well I knew that was coming. Now who is next to die?"". You are pulled in to many directions to really care about any of the characters.Even though the characters thought processes were changing and they were aging rapidly, it did not feel like the movie was progressing until after Trent and Maddox got off the beach. If that is what Shyamalan was going for that pacing was genius or a huge fluke.There was the twist at the end and it was a good one. You can almost sympathize with what the Resort Manager was doing, the ends did justify the means...but involving innocents to get results just left a sour taste in your mouth.Is it one of Shyamalan better movies...no, not even close. Will you think about it after it is over...yes. If you want good Shyamalan movies, I suggest any of them from 2000-2006, Split, and Glass.",Old

The movie contains various undertones hidden beneath the surface - the one that struck us the most was the fact that time is the only true currency in this world. Something we take for granted so much. Shocked at the average rating of 6 at the time of writing this review. This movie is an easy 8 if not more. A 10 for us anyway. The movie kept us on the edge as well as sent us deep into through about what truly matters in life. Most people do not want to explore such deep emotions which would explain the average 6 rating.

The acting at times was very bad and the script was poor too but most of the time when it was really bad it was really funny and added a light hearted energy. I think personally if the acting was superb it would have been terrifying! Which would be good for some people but I thought the premise alone was scary enough so having those little cheesy moments just made it more enjoyable. In short I think the premise is so good that it makes up for everything bad about the movie. I was thoroughly entertained and got exactly what I was looking for and more. The twist was so clever as well and made so much sense and I didn't see it coming. It's not amazing but it's an extremely entertaining and fun movie.

1127,eviao,People Are Too Picky,7,3 August 2021,"Alright, I'll try to keep it short. I might be a bit biased on this review because I watched M Night's earlier movies when I was young. I recently checked out some of the reviews on his movies and was a surprised they were so low, which inspired me to write this.This movie is one of his weirder ones, for sure. He has a handful of disturbing scenes in all of his movies, but this one involves a damn CHILD getting pregnant! I think it was stated the child was around 6 years old at the start of the movie and even appeared slightly younger. (She did age to at least her teenage years, but does that help much?)And I won't lie, this scene seemed very unnecessary. Like it was added in for shock factor. I really can't even remember how this girl getting pregnant helped move the plot along if it did at all. Maybe her getting driven a little nuts and trying to climb a cliff on a whim just to.. fall asleep(?) and then actually fall to her death helped the other characters realize what NOT to do, though.Yep, ending up on a beach where you age 50 years in one day is bound to create problems. The majority of the crowd that arrived were already adults which resulted in some interesting details. Details such as heart attacks, loss of visuals, memories and hearing. This was a nice touch - the fact this would happen didn't even really occur to me until it showed up on the screen, and I thought to myself, ""Oh, of course!""I thought the ending was a nice twist, too. I've seen some people saying they don't like M Night's movies because of the plot manipulation, but I think that's stupid. That's his thing - he makes plot twist endings. If you're already biased about that kind of thing then go watch another movie instead of watching one like this *just* to nitpick it.So much for keeping it short, I guess.

1135,lvhswwilliams,An ambitious project by M. Night,8,23 July 2021,"So, when a movie comes out that is intensely divisive, when people either really like it or really don't, I usually fall on the former end. This is why The Village is my favorite M. Night movie (lol), and Old is no exception. This movie made me laugh, cry, hide my face in fear, and ponder on some big themes like death, grief, and the brief time we have on earth. I thoroughly enjoyed this movie, I know it might not be for everyone but I would definitely recommend it, just for the experience. And yes, of course the explanation of ""why"" these twelve people are hyperaging on a beach in the Dominican Republic is ""unrealistic"", I think that is clear from the mere premise of the movie itself that it isn't a literal scenario. I would go into this film with more of a fantasy/sci-fi/concept movie in mind. I've also seen some complaints about some awkward dialogue, but I think that's intended here, especially with the kids. Keep in mind that even though their bodies are growing, their minds are not. So in that case I think the awkward and blunt dialogue from the kids at some parts actually accentuates the film, because that's how children are, and it reminds you that they are children still on the inside. At some points it even reminded me briefly of my favorite M. Night film: The Village.",Old

The charcters lacked depth and the cinematography was very questionable at times. M. Night Shyamalan manages to ponder for an hour and fifteen minutes. As you approach the end you think ""oh wow m. Night kind of redeemed this movie"" and as you utter those words you immediately take them back. Old was interesting enough to get you in the theater, but disappoints you in the first thirty minutes. M. Night dropped the ball on this one. I hope to go the rest of my life never having to set my eyes on another M. Night film and to M.

1144,sabrinasibelius,"interesting concept, but terrible execution",1,24 July 2021,"I started out really hopeful for this movie. When I watched the trailer, the concept was what brought me back to the cinema. But my god, this movie did anything but deliver. I felt the concept was too out of reach and too ambitious for M. Shyamalan.The script writing was the most horrendous and unbearable bit, I never before had to fight the urge to leave the theater twenty minutes into a movie. The dialogue was just so CRINGE. So cringe that it actually elicited a physical reaction. My body, unable to decide between its fight or flight response from the mixture of disappointment and anger at how bad the movie was, sat paralyzed in the cold, dark theater, unwillingly ready to be violated by the screen in front of it.There felt like too many ""fake deep"" lines (Maddox's monologue before finding Jarin) or empty strings of words that really failed when it came to actually having meaning and contributing to the plot. It hurt to watch the interactions between characters, which felt so unnatural and awkward and not at all like a normal conversation people would have if they were in that situation. Majority of the movie was just the adults, other than that oh so poorly written walking stereotype of a ""social media influencer"", trying to out-smarta$$ each other. Weaving knowledge from each of their professions into their dialogues just failed so badly, it was like they were trying so hard to convince their own selves that they are what they say they are. They all just ended up sounding like really bad liars. With the way Chrystal was written, she was so unmemorable, I forgot her name and that she was even part of the movie when she walked off. Jarin with his medical advice and Guy with his G0dD@MMNED statistics that were so unneeded and not at all asked for, were the worst of all.There was so much that was trying to be accomplished in the time the movie ran that no one had a chance to get attached to any character (also because they were given no depth at all) or even introduce any character without writing like a seventh grader. The movie basically had to spell everything out for the viewers to let them know who's who and what's happening. Just like a joke, if you have to explain it to make people understand, it's not good. From using the odd ""what do you do for a living?"" question from a curious six year old to introduce everyone, to the idea of the metal tube as a means of escape, to the man in the lab out right explaining the purpose of the beach and experiments like we didn't already get it it just felt so rushed and such a lazy way out.There were also a number of unnecessary details thrown in that did not come back later or even really influenced the plot. Like, did everyone just forget about granny dying??? Where did she even go when she died??? And the impending separation of Guy and Prisca was a failed attempt at making their interactions and their ending emotional and meaningful, it could've just been a regular family vacation and nothing would've changed.All in all, the storytelling was what made this movie hard to stomach. I would say a bit of the acting too, but I feel like that was more on Shyamalan's directing, as he is the one to decide what kind of delivery he wants from the actors and which take he is satisfied with. It was like he rushed writing the script because he forgot that the deadline was dangerously close. But the cinematography and setting, I have to say, were the only things keeping this from being a complete flop. It's the only thing I can admit to liking in this movie.Could've spent the money I spent on this ticket on some nice food and would've walked away 100x more satisfied.",Old

1146,tobywilliamsimmons,It Will Get Worse With Time,2,24 July 2021,"The film's tone was completely off. What was intended to be a poignant, mysterious, even slightly disturbing film was actually a farcical series of events that left me wondering how in the world this film ever made it past the initial concept. There was far more laughter in the cinema than intrigue.I'm not familiar with the graphic novel Sandcastle, but going by this film alone it's as if M. Night Shyamalan adapted a story from a Year 6 creative writing class. You can almost hear the childlike narrator behind each scene:'And then they find a dead body. And then the body suddenly decomposes. And then the doctor stabs the young rapper guy to death. And then the nurse swims into the ocean and drowns. And then the girl gets pregnant and has a baby, but the baby dies suddenly. And then the lady stabs the doctor with a rusty knife and he gets infected and turns into a zombie-like figure and dies. And then two of them escape and find out they were all part of a trial for experimental medicines. And then all the bad guys get arrested. The end.'The characters are underdeveloped and two-dimensional, meaning that none of the events that happen on the beach carries any emotional weight, adding to the shallow hilarity of the film.The only thing about the film that left me ""haunted for days,"" as the trailer suggests, was its awful script. I won't say the acting was bad, as it is hard to act well when the scripted dialogue is so stilted and awkward, but at times it did feel like GCSE Drama class material.I was waiting for a redeeming 'twist' at the end that would turn everything on its head and make me reassess everything that had gone before. It's hardly a twist. It's more of an explanation - and one that was very obvious from the outset of the film.The only reason I have given this film 2/10 rather than 1 is because it was quite fun to watch it with friends only to laugh at its absurdity.",Old

1155,michaeljones-02074,"Feels like it could be a classic, but it's not.",5,25 July 2021,"In my opinion, Old has the potential to be a film and story classic, but it isn't.The concept of being in a place that essentially speeds up an entire human life into a two day period provides the opportunity to create some deeply engaging, philosophical thought provoking cinema that could really wow viewers.Shamalan hints at this, with some good dialogue in the early parts of the movie where the main family make comments to each other about being present and not living in the future/past. Again towards the end as the main couple approach the end of their lives there is an engaging and emotive scene between the two of them.But in an almost 2 hour film these are the only two deeper though provoking scenes I remember (There are more but they aren't powerful).For a lot of the film I couldn't tell if it was meant to be thought provoking or funny. I wanted to take it seriously but couldn't help but outright laugh during some scenes.It felt like we didn't really get to connect with most of the characters of their storylines. Main characters die and you feel indifferent.The acting was good but at times you can't even understand what people are saying.The best word I can think of for the story line is 'bluh' and felt flawed.There's a guy who reaches the beach the night before the main characters and stays overnight. When the rest of the people arrive the next day he should be near death, yet he hasn't aged a day.. this is never explained in the film but there is one moment where this man makes a comment about black people not showing ageing as visibly as white people....But for me the worst part that left a sour taste in the mouth was the coral.It's explained to us in the film that due to the location of the beach, the rocks and the magnetic forces time is rapidly increased. It makes loose sense and your happy to buy into in the film. But towards the end of the film, the main characters manage to counteract this physics phenomenon and escape the beach which has previously entrapped everyone by... swimming through some coral and being nipped at by fish. What's the explanation for this.. absolutely nothing.It feels lazy. It's like saying kryptonite harms superman just because. Just a little bit of thought or explanation here could have made all of the difference, but there's nothing (unless I missed it). I can't picture intelligent people looking at this script in pre production and being ok with this?!So it could be really good, but in my opinion, it's not.It's worth a watch, it's a good concept, but I don't think it's going to leave a lasting impact on you.",Old

The acting was nothing short of abysmal, with throwaway, unrelated lines being flung at you from every corner. When it came to the actual beach, I had my hopes up that the quality would vaguely improve but I was presented with the polar opposite. The stupidity of certain plot points like the preganancy scene or the utterly awful repteition of that 'Marlon Brando film' were clearly just fillers to make the movie long enough. I must admit, however, when the horror was not laughable, Shymalan excelled, in particular that first encounter with the corpse. However, the audacity of Shymalan to do such a lengthy cameo in his own dreadful film is, quite frankly, embarassing. I did not really expect much from this film aside from a decent storyline, but even with my limited desires I was dissapointed. Once again this director has not been able to pick up his feet, on a slow decline yet again from Split. My rendition- watchable, at best.",Old
1162,robbinkpowers,I REALLY wanted to LOVE Old,6,26 July 2021,"I will not bash this movie but I can't help but feel it could have been so much better.A) The acting. I can watch a HORRIBLE movie and still find it enjoyable, if the acting is brilliant. You don't want to feel like you're watching a movie but that's how it felt the entire movie. I don't understand why M can't just let actors act. The story and acting (and popcorn) are why I go to movies.B) The script. It was painfully clear the scripting was written to make sure the people in back, who aren't paying attention, catch any necessary clues instead of making you work for your understanding. Be clever with your clues. Don't work so hard to fill in plot holes. And be conversational. No one has conversations like this!C) The story/plot. The plot concept is what made me enjoy this movie and not give it a lower rating for the items mentioned above. I found myself thinking about it all day. That, to me, is an above average movie. I'm actually going to see it again with a different group of friends to get their reaction and hopefully find some things I missed the first time that might make me increase my thought of the movie. But I'm afraid points A and B are still going to be nails on a chalkboard for me!Overall I would say you could wait to stream/watch on DVD but the scenery is breathtaking on the big screen, and I love movie theater popcorn with real butter, so a trip to the theater isn't wasted on Old, IMO. My movie opinions almost always range between 7-9, only going to 10 if it's perfection or lower than 7 if it has too many distractions, hence my rating of 6 (for too many distractions, for those in the back who need it spelled out!

1187,fischer-16215,An ending worth examining,8,30 July 2021,"""Old"" and its expected buildup and predictable climax of aging overshadows the tangential, and more profound, theme revealed in its ending. Although, Shyamalan spent only about 5-10 minutes answering the 'why?', it leaves open the possibility of a much larger discussion after one leaves the theater. It's unfortunate that more time and dialogue wasn't spent on this aspect of the film. However, the long discussion that could be taking place at the conclusion of the film (setup by the big reveal) has the potential for an ""Act 2"" between family and friends. What sets Shyamalan's movies apart from others is not only it's expected plot twists at the end, but also the buildup for the theme twist at the conclusion of each film.What is the consequential theme ending? (spoiler alert)The film climaxes to the two remaining characters (who start out as children at the start of the previous day) figuring out a way to escape the mysterious cove. The observer on the cliff (Shayamalan himself), thinking the last of the ""subjects"" have drowned within the coral, radios to his team about their final, and from their viewpoint hopeful, demise. It is revealed that they were medical research subjects in the testing of a wide variety of cures for medical issues. Due to the cove's magnetic properties that rapidly advances aging, they can quickly test the effects of various drugs on individuals who exhibit specific medical ailments. They mention the benefits to the greater good by how they were able to save the lives of millions of people around the world due to the ""progress"" made in the cove from these and previous test subjects.This speaks to the question of the collective good over the individual. After leaving the theater, my mind began rushing with similar historic tragedies that were justified by the greater good, from collateral damage seen during any past war to the bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki during WWII to the inhuman treatment of the mentally ill during previous decades and centuries. All these acts were done for the greater good. One can very easily argue that the sacrifice of these few individuals did in fact save and protect a far greater, and exponential, number of lives. Although these are extreme examples of collectivism, the question remains, at what point, if at all, does the greater good outweigh the lives and liberties of the individual? ""Old"" makes the case that this line should lie somewhere at least after the life of the individual. However, does that line stop there or does it lie somewhere within the individual's natural and/or human rights? These questions are fundamental to understanding and implementing the authority and impact of government, laws, and society.",Old

Oh my god the acting, minus the child actors, each of the main characters seemed like they tried to do out one another with who could deliver the worst performance. Zero passion, no emotion to grab you, to show you the severity of the situation that their characters were in, it was like a bunch of amateurs reciting their lines so they could get the hell out of there as quickly as possible.The longer this film went on, the more annoyed I became at the adult characters, I spent the entire film just waiting for it to finish.Your time is precious and this will be 90 minutes you'll never get up, please use that time wisely and avoid this film.Tell your friends, tell your neighbours and tell your family - avoid this and watch something else.",Old

I can't say that there weren't times I was entertained, but the premise was just too all over the place. At times it felt like a comedy. I don't think of his work as comedic. If I want a comedy, I will go into one expecting one. I get what others are saying about having a deeper meaning and I got that and appreciate it. It was probably my favorite thing about the movie, but it wasn't enough to save this one for me.

Feels a constant lack of continuity and bad editing that just cuts you off the story and reminds you that you are watching a cheap thriller. For example when the characters go through these ""blackouts"", the bad editing makes it feel like a comedy.The movie tried to look artistic and unconventional, but it came out as a rookie, unprofessionally executed film. They tried to look original, but I guess it is hard with such a terrible script. The writing is just terrible and exhausting, its just annoying how the script is trying to explain EVERYTHING to the audience. It seems like the different artistic departments in this film were in completely different channels. I think the terrible acting is a consequence of a even more terrible script.I would have given more stars to my rating because of the story, but it was based on a graphic novel.

Storyline was rubbish, my husband was stifling his laughter it was so bad, I was seething I wasted my money. Avoid at all costs.",Old
1199,sambro-91331,"Original, with a hint of cheesy spice",9,1 August 2021,"When I went in to watch the movie, I was expecting something along the lines of a movie to make fun of. I'd heard of the unoriginal and straight up awful plot twists of MNS but this was pretty damn good.Makeup:
The makeup in this movie was just absolutely phenomenal, I didn't have any moments where I was taken away from the actors aging at rapid rate, especially when two specific actors are talking about a specific text conversation (I won't spoil anything), you could see their bags getting more pronounced, their hair became grayer and their face became very wrinkled.Effects:
The effects fall short a bit when it comes to wounds healing quickly, but overall not bad in that regard, just a bit janky. However, during one scene where a woman is in a cave sorta dying, it doesn't look magnificent. It's scary and unsettling, but you kinda know it isn't real which takes you out of the movie a bit.Cast:
I've got to say the cast in this was pretty well picked out, performances from characters imitating their older selves was spot on, and they all portrayed their characters to the fullest. Adults pretending to be kids was odd to see at first but once you grasped the concept that they're still kids in their head, it made sense.Plot:
Now, a lot of people are contriving the plot to be another twist with no basis to the prior plot and that's almost correct. The plot in of itself isn't complicated on face value and even in depth; a family goes to a private beach while on a vacation only to discover that the beach is rapidly aging them. When the main reason they're there is revealed, I thought it was a very good ""twist"" if you could even call it that. I was expecting *something* along the lines of what happened but it was still done in a very well thought out way. I think the journal they find revealing things is a bit thin and the secret message even thinner. But it all flows together into a solid movie, even if it was a bit bumpy along the way.Now I've said everything I can about this movie without extensively going into spoilers. If you have the chance to see this movie and you're interested by it's plot, trust me, I don't think you'll be disappointed. I found myself pleasantly surprised enough to write my first review after the watching the movie. It's not a perfect film by any accords, but it's a good one to watch especially on a night that's open.",Old

Did she fall asleep? Also did her mom find out????The Skinny Mom death actually creeped me out it was so gross 🤢 !!The singing was also cringe ...It kinda was talking to much about age in the beginning so it was like also cringeBut it was honestly entertaining to watch , I was calling the characters dumb but it did cute my boredom and i can see if other people liked it ..

The premise is not believable in the slightest, the acting is so bad that becomes laughable and I didn't care about any of the characters. The woman with the short hair and the awful accent is so bad at acting that she should quit and find another job she can be good at. In general, the whole cast couldn't act. It was like the director found some random people from the street and told them to play in his movie without paying them. And Miles from lost was bad too. He should have stayed on the lost island. I would only recommend watching this stupid movie if you want to laugh at how bad everything is.

If you set this aside, the movie is pretty terrible.Let's start with the dialogue, oh god the dialogue. It really tries to be a high concept film, but it really seems like if it was pulled out of Sharknado. Things like:
______________________________""I need some TIME""
""The only thing we don't have is TIME""
______________________________Where disappointing at best and sometimes embarrassing.Story. The protagonist had literally a few resources (some of them literally shown in the first minutes of the film) available and they spent 3 whole days crying and doing all sort of things except using them... they even figured out what was happening and still didn't bother using them... seriously?The science. There's an explanation to everything that happens on the movie, but it's just so bad, so absolutely terrible you'll think its purpose is to make you laugh, but it's not, it is indeed a completely serious explanation. It really feels bad thinking directors where fine with that, like, how stupid do you think your audience is? Don't really want to make the same comparison, but Sharknado's explanation for a tornado with sharks is FAR BETTER than the one given for the beach in this movie.In conclusion, I payed 4 euros for this film cause It was Spectator Day and still felt I wasted my money, should you watch it? Well, that's hard to tell, if your expectations are really low and you find a cheap ticket definitely.Finally, this is something personal, the movie is based on a novel I've never heard of, which appears on the credits with a really small letter, just.... why?

Great delivery on the concept. Also good to see M. Knight make a cameo appearance very Stephen King esk.However the 2 parents that had French accents were out of there depth to say the least. Poor acting lack of expression and the accents which the children didn't have for some reason. The casting for the kids was good the rest of the beach goers was great but the 2 parents were horrible and no matter how old they got they never got better.I rate it a fair rating could have been a great movie instead of a good movie if the casting had of been better.,Old

Had planned to watch San Andreas but accidentally ended up watching a similar titled B-movie that came out about the same time. I was so dismayed by the ""talented"" poor acting and script that I was unable to restrain myself from writing a review to spare anyone from making a similar mistake.Come 2021 and I saw Old trailer and being a lover of syfy, the waiting was killing me as the concept in the movie held an amazing attraction to my interest and could hardly wait to see it. Well, finally I got this movie and yesterday evening, I sat comfortably with remote in my hand, super eager to satisfy my long waited for hour. Within the first few minutes, I remember shifting in my sofa as if to nudge the movie not to head where I could immediately see it heading. The poor script and acting was instantly there and I paused to confirm that I was watching the correct movie and that I had not made a similar mistake as I did back in 2015. Sure enough, It said ""Old (2021)"". I consoled myself that for a certainty, this is just a bad section and continued watching full of optimism. Like a collapsing building, it only got worse and even the cameraman seems to have been bored by the poor script, acting, emotionlessness and poor directing that he started to play with the camera so as to appear to be working and get paid. Its difficult to explain the dissatisfaction and disappointment of this film. After B-movie, if there is C-movie, this one qualifies for that category (and if C-movie budget does not exist, its about time someone suggested that classification).The unusually high user reviews shortly after this movie was available is clear that many who watched it did so with high expectation considering the provoking concept; however, after watching it, like me, it seemed unfair not to write a review as they could not understand why this movie is so bad. The concept is captivating and full of potential but the director decided to make it one of the most disappointing movie most will remember. The 88.7 million box office.is a strong indicator of how big this film would have been. After buying the ticket and watching, you realize you have lost a hard earned dollar.

1249,benjigeez,"Read the book, it's bound to be better.",1,25 September 2021,"I haven't read the book... but it has to be better than this garbage. As many have already said, interesting premise... but it's just so poorly done.The premise is that time passes differently on a remote beach. M. Night Shyamalan even suggests that it applies to everything on the beach, with cutlery oxidizing quickly, corpses decomposing into skeletons in a few hours, babies being conceived and born in less than hour... and yet, that's it. All other props will not show the ravages of time that are supposedly being experienced. There are baskets, clothing, food, umbrellas, etc, that never experience this time dilation... and I must ask, why not? Is M. Night Shyamalan so poor that he can't even spend an extra 20k for multiple props? I bet he could, he simply felt that this movie didn't deserve any extra effort except that which the studio allotted him. If you are going to try and sell me on absurdity, I expect you to address every little detail of absurdity.Take the coral scene when one of the characters shirts get caught on coral underwater. Most people would probably realize that all they need to do to save themselves is to take off the article of clothing... but not these characters.The effort that M. Night Shyamalan put into this movie... shows that he doesn't care about the viewers experience. This honestly looks like M. Night Shyamalan simply tricked a movie studio into paying for his vacation on a tropical island.After viewing this film, I will never again watch anything simply because M. Night Shyamalan touched it. I skipped over more of the movie than what I actually watched.And to save y'all some time, here's the entire movie in a nutshell:
Family arrives at an exotic resort, and they are given complimentary 'cocktails'. These cocktails are laced with experimental drug therapies, catered to the individual. This is because the resort is actually a research facility for a pharmaceutical company. They apparently discovered a magical beach where time passes much more quickly, while searching for novel medicinal plants. Thus, now they can test for the long term efficacy of the medications they develop over the course of 24 hours. Also, the individuals brought to the beach can't leave, becuase... then the whole premise wouldn't work. So, they claim 'it's the rocks', thus people black out and then reappear on the beach.The family is taken there on day 2, as expected everyone ages rapidly and eventually succumb to their disease or die of old age.Two children who became adults over the course of the day survive because they escaped to the coral. And, the bad guys are exposed in the end.Please pass on this movie, save yourself the wasted time and watch a cute animal video on YouTube instead, at least that will bring inner joy. And to the psychopaths, do what you will.",Old

1251,samsonovaala,I wish I would've died of old age watching this,1,3 October 2021,"I've never written a review here, but with this movie I simply must. First of all, I was quite excited about this movie. When I saw the trailer I thought ""damn what a cool concept, I'm sure it's gonna have an interesting plot"" NOPE! Like someone's already said in a review, trailer is all you need-much better than the movie itself. The whole relationship between Prisca and Guy was just awkward in my opinion, Chrystal and Charles topped it off though.. She, knowing full well l, that her husband is kind of inclined to murder and her daughter is mentally off after losing a child (which I will get to as well btw) decides that instead doing ANYTHING HELPFUL at all, she'd rather cry about her looks and hide away...I mean ?!? And don't even get me started on her death.. just what the hell was that? Was is supposed to be scary? Funny? Sad? I can't tell but I definitely went through it all (I also wonder if Trent and Maddox had to push her out or simply waited til she turned into dust and then crawled over her to get out of that hole, but that's just a quick thought). Back to the pregnancy though because that really was something else..How do 2 children decide to have sex as a ""game"" when there are literally people dying around them, they grew up 10 years in like 4 hours and one of their parents is a literal murderer? Make it make sense please. Also I'm not a doctor but is it really just that simple to cut out a tumor? I have to imagine it isn't .. right? Anyway overall I think the whole movie was too long focused on what was happening in the beach, once you realized that probably nobody was going to survive it was only about 'how' will they die.. only in the last 15 minutes it finally got a little more interesting but still, I think that the one thing you can get out of this movie, is to realize that time is precious and you should never ever waste 2 hours of your precious time watching a movie like this.

I think M Night is a great writer, he's always aware of continuity, the relationships, the dialogues and interactions feels natural, and you can easily understand everything.

Family, relationships, kindness to strangers or lack thereof, sickness and ultimately death. Personally I was touched by it, and it made me reflect a lot, both during the session and afterwards.The premise of the movie, why are they on the beach, I think but I might be wrong, is only a pretext to show you all this. So the unfolding of the plot did not interest me as much as the events that happen on the beach. But I think this was intentional?True, some dialogues were a bit weird and quirky (as in other Shamalan movies btw), but I found them funny and it did not annoy me. It added some comedy to it.

This movie displays them all, so warning to those looking for pure, fun, frivolous horror entertainment. But when has MS ever stuck to just that. There are moments of deep sadness and loss while also bringing to the forefront what is truly important in these short lives we live, but I think if you're really watching anyone can see their own experiences in this movie. I think this movie also calls into question Big Pharma's ethics and practices at a particular time during the pandemic some might not want to really look at, which may account for the low IMBD scores. Specifically, the risk vs. Benefit of testing potentially life saving drugs, which may have life long consequence for some while saving others and more specifically whether collateral damage and the greater good make testing those drugs on uninformed people worth the risk. I will say they should not have given so much away in the trailers/marketing as it seems many found it predictable, which it was, but to me MS was not trying to hide this fact, but make it glaringly obvious so people wake up to the reality.",Old

The mediocre hotel scenes are oscar-worthy compared to the idiotic, D-list, backyard film project style of direction put forth by Mr. Shyamalan, hindering an already ""meh"" cast performance. I'm sure the majority of the main cast are wonderful actors in their own respect, but Shyamalan's utter failure as a director is an absolute nightmare. From deliberate(?) wooden performances, to confusing plot points, to completely insignificant pick-ups and things popping up seemingly out nowhere (anyone remember the dog? Yeah, didn't think so), this film is an absolute disaster from beginning to end.

No one in the movie talks like normal people do. You'd think that this was a foreign movie with a terrible English translation.The acting is just laughable with the exception of Alex Wolff. I'm wondering how Gael García Bernal, being a pretty well-renowned actor and producer, agreed to be a part of this trainwreck.Obvious continuity errors abound in this movie. I won't even try to get into them as there's just... so many.I've really loved some of M. Night Shyamalan's past movies, but they have been going downhill fur the most part.

The pace of the film did not let up going from one crazy moment to the next.For me I was sold on how the film, whilst at times being crazy and over the top in some ways, portrayed the stages and miseries that people experience in ever day life. Wether it be the loss of a elderly loved one or a new born. Someone's struggles with mental health, or dealing with divorce the film really does cover the full spectrum of human life in many ways whilst also providing thrills along the way.There are moments of on the nose exposition but I didn't mind it because I was interested in the concept the film was built upon.I've also never read the works in which this film is as based on which may have altered my viewing experience compared to some but I thought overall it was a great piece of film.",Old

So many actions are taken and details are added to the story line without any explanation or an excuse

I've gone from being blown away by Shyamalan's movies to just plain running away.I read the premise - strangers on an island ageing at an alarming rate - and knew it had to be terrible. It's worse than that actually, but at the same time there's tiny glimmers of a good story. What this film needed was a Nolan-esque director who could just make it not so linear in style; we know whats going to happen, so it can't hurt to play around with timeline of it all.It's also one of these films where I laughed somewhat inappropriately, like it was just me laughing awkwardly in the cinema but I'm assuming the other moviegoers were still at this point trying to take it seriously. If you let your mind tell you it's intentionally comedic, it's not that bad.It's a one-way ticket to plot hole city, and all the questions you have at the end might as well be asked to David Blaine's left hand.

1313,sbarrax-763-704928,"The Sixth Sense meets Shutter Island - M. Night Shamayalnan is back to his ""old"" form.",10,18 September 2021,"M. Night Shalamanan's ""Old"" is a thought-provoking and controversial masterstroke of riveting proportions.Always poignant - ever profound - Old's multifaceted, metaphorical mediation on life will have you gripping the edge of your seat one moment, and crying-out-loud with laughter the next. But be warned, for those tears of joy will swiftly turn to tears of sadness, and then to tears of joy once more.Let's get this out of the way:
Yes. ""Old"" is a thrilling and suspenseful emotional-rollercoaster. It is. But don't you dare check your brain in at the door, else you'll come away confused and bewildered, asking yourself ""why.""I confess, you probably do need a reasonably high IQ to fully appreciate the gravity of Shalamans's genius here, but don't let that dissuade you. As to the depth of genius therein, ""Old"" is lovingly constructed with layers of complexity, until now unseen in modern cinema - truly the ""inception"" of modern moviemaking - and there is something here for the whole family, no matter one's intellectual aptitude.Phenomenal cinematography:
Shalamanans's use of awkward and clumsy camerawork subverts your expectations of what good cinematography truly means, bringing your preconceptions full-circle to slap you in the face with your own folly. Perhaps a metaphor for how not everything is at it first appears, tying-in very neatly to the plot as a whole. Remarkable.Incredible acting:
The sometimes stiff performances and somewhat stiffer dialog feel cumbersome and unsettling at first - clearly intentional - because as the movie continues to grow, one gets the overwhelming sense that each character is speaking to them on a personal level, projecting their thoughts to the viewer as opposed to the rest of the cast. This creates a connection that I can't quite put into words. Genius.As I sit here with so much more to say about this masterpiece, I'm inundated with an overwhelming sense of responsibility to let you discover it all for yourself. Reluctantly, and despite being on my third draft of this review, I'm going to do something I've never done in my career as a film critic - I'm going to throw out the remainder of my commentary, and let the film do the rest of the talking.

It shows what it means to be a parent and what it means to be
a child. What is first love and what is loss.And it packs all of this in one beach day.Fine detail is the ending explanation of the whole situation on the island.And even though you are not sure what or how the things on the beach actually function, you get a nice moral dilemma regarding how people will use everything in their grasp.I follow M.

I would not consider this horror in the least though. I think it would've been better if it was rated R because it felt VERY watered down to the point that there was only one scene where I slightly got excited for, only for it to last less than a minute or 2. The ending seemed like it was going to give you an option of feeling completely sad or actually seeing how it could've been a good thing. Only for it to be ripped away from you and given a rather cheap and lackluster conclusion. All in all it was okay but it could've been such an amazing adaption of a great story and a serious mind $!@# of a movie.",Old

1322,fieldt-958-885064,Middle School Storytelling,1,26 July 2021,"TL;DR: If you've seen the trailer, that's all you need to see. Great trailer, great idea, weak film. Really a disappointing story from Shymalan. Lazy writing. It was like every line was an awkward, hamfisted setup for something later in the film. SPOILERS: The characters lacked depth, limited almost to lines suited to their occupations. They inserted a really obnoxious child character who conveniently asks everyone their occupation, so the viewer won't have to do any work there. Luckily, on this tropical paradise resort, there's a cop on vacation...The psychologist was always analyzing things and getting people to talk problems out, the museum curator was obsessed with dead bodies, and apparently knew all about the speed of decomposition (maybe her museum had fresh corpses in it), the actuary quoted statistics to family and strangers (OK, that might be realistic, but he likely wouldn't be married). The story lacked continuity and felt like it inserted random unnecessary explanations and deus ex machina whenever the team couldn't figure out how to make the story work. So, hair and nails don't grow quickly because they're dead tissue, but a body decomposes more rapidly than normal? And who the heck was the rapper and why was he there? Kids who age 40 years overnight somehow no longer think and talk like kids. And the pregnancy? WHAT? Like, ""We're suddenly physically mature, let's go somewhere private and skip all of the awkwardness and go straight to sex? There's 8 of us trapped here on a half-acre and we're in grave danger; our parents and siblings will never notice?"" Overall, it felt like someone overthought the current Operation Warp Speed and came up with a hasty science fiction idea that they just didn't take the time to solidify.",Old

1349,kaiva,Favourite movie of 2021,9,22 August 2021,"I went to the cinema immediately upon discovering that there was a new M Night Shyamalan movie out. I love this guy, cringey scenes or dialogue is no minus in my book and is instead just the Shyamalan flavour. Particularly bad scenes from his movies have made for some of my favourites (and have turned into internal jokes) and his plot twists are likewise some of my favourites. Shyamalan is an unique director who isn't going to be everyone's cup of tea, the sooner we can establish this and accept it, the quicker we can look past people needlessly complaining about Shyamalan's trademark style. I went into the movie knowing nothing about it - no trailers seen, no descriptions read, nothing. That is the best way to enjoy this movie. The idea is unique and creative, and it did not go into the direction I anticipated at all. Instead, I was pleased with what is essentially a study of the fear of mortality, (both regarding oneself and one's friends/parents/friends/lovers) and the fear of age-related woes like illness, bodily malfunctions and perceived ugliness. It was somehow more unnerving than any monster or traditional horror could be, and it reminds me of his other movie The Visit which explores the fear of old age including its less glamorous and sometimes horrific aspects (like diapers, mental health difficulties and possibly your grandparents starting to scare you with their increasingly strange and disturbing ""old people"" behaviour). This is indeed a collection of bodily horror mixed with existential dread mixed and reckoning with mortality and illness. Still thinking about it and the fact that we're all on that beach, speeding towards inescapable doom. There are lessons to be learned here.",Old

I have NEVER written a review on a movie, but I just got home from watching this and I was SOOOO annoyed within 20 mins. Of the film starting. Such a shame, I have always been a fan of M. Night, but each time I've the last few films, I have been completely unimpressed.",Old
1374,baezareich,A complete madness.,5,28 September 2021,"A complete madness. For some reason the plot of the movie is good. But the absurd jumps between scenes the indiscriminate death of its actors. They make it a crazy movie. At last they unlink in a premature way the whole plot and although it is something very sudden, the foundation itself makes sense. Typical movie to eat popcorn saludes from Colombia.",Old

The storyline is very original and had a few nerve-wrecking moments that kept me intrigued all the way. I had low expectation when I read that the ending was weak before I watched it so I was expecting the characters to just die of old age one by one with little to no explanation, however, it turned out it was well-explained and made perfect sense.I really enjoyed this movie as a thriller/mystery movie fan.",Old

1377,jakobrogers,"A gripping, emotionally resonant thriller",8,16 August 2021,"I cannot claim to be an expert on M. Night Shyamalan's work given that this is only the fourth of his works I have seen, the others being: Sixth Sense, Unbreakable, both great, and Last Airbender, which the less we talk about the better. So I really didn't know what to expect from his latest film. Color me surprised, this is one of my favorites to have come out of this year so far.I swear I haven't had this much fun in a movie theater with an audience in ages. And not at all laughing at the movie, but rather at the communal experience of feeling like we're watching a gripping thriller with some of the most terrifying sequences this side of Ridley Scott Alien dread and gnarliness. What makes these excellent scenes wrapped all around in tension work is thanks to two qualities: the visual style and the performances.The cinematography by Mike Gioulakis (Under the Silver Lake, Us) is astoundingly gorgeous, Shyamalan's use of mise-en-scène is simply flawless, perfectly conveying the claustrophobic nature of the story, whilst still retaining the beauty in the scenery along with great compositions accompanying each personal moment.The performances are all-around perfectly cast. Gael García Bernal and Vicky Krieps as the parents are both reliably great, particularly in their final scene which has a certain beautiful melancholic feel to it. All of the actors playing their children did a fantastic job, seamlessly portraying them while never missing a beat from their previous counterpart. The best out of all of them is Thomasin McKenzie, the young supremely gifted actress who continues to impress with each role, very excited to see her in Edgar Wright's upcoming Last Night in Soho. Rufus Sewell continues his quest in playing the biggest asshole in the world, truly few are better at it than him (see A Knight's Tale or The Father for further proof). Abbey Lee continues to prove she's one of the best model-turned actress working today. Eliza Scanlen is, as usual, wonderful in a very tricky role, she has one particularly dark scene involving a pregnancy that she masterfully handles, especially focusing on the clear heartbreak after the situation ends badly.One thing I was not expecting was how heartbreakingly human the film is, filled with some really nice passages of dialogue and scenes wrapped in emotion. My favorite moments include when around the beginning Prisca tells her kids to ""stop wishing away this moment."", Prisca and Guy's final moments together, Patricia's comment on her relationship with her sister, the indelible pain & sadness experienced by Kara and Trent after their brief moment of happiness seeing their baby, Trent and Idlib's friendship that eventually saves the siblings, the moral dilemma at the end with the experimentations, etc.There's also some excellent horror imagery, the scene in which Chrystal deforms her entire body chasing after the kids is the stuff of nightmares. Happy about the use of practical effects and actual old-age makeup instead of CGI. Another thing I wasn't expecting that I don't see others mentioning is how Charles' terrifying nature comes not from his mental illness, as some have stated, but from the fact that he's obviously racist, right from the beginning he's obsessed with finding Mid-Sized Sedan guilty of killing the girl, and Patricia even mentions when she enters the scene that she doesn't like the ""dynamic"" going on.Lots of people are going to have issues with the ending, understandably so, but for my money it worked perfectly, giving me Westworld vibes, and it also works on an interesting thematic level due to the unfortunate reality about how, while the work may be for a good purpose, the way in doing so is as unethical as it gets.In terms of issues, I would have liked to have seen a bit more from certain characters, and I think the final two scenes should have been swapped or the last one taken out, because the film would have ended better with that beautiful shot of the kids coming out of the beach with all those fish around then instead of the helicopter. Nevertheless, I will happily defend this movie as it's one of the most fascinating and gripping horror movies I've seen in recent memory.",Old

Many things did not make sense at all.Characters had totally different accents, even though they were related.Like I mentioned before: the idea isn't that bad, that took my to the cinema, but the performance is REALLY bad.Don't waste your time watching this movie.

Kids and parents had me immediately hooked (mostly the kids-I wish them happy careers in the future). Mood was sufficiently ""too good to be true""...and then it all kept getting worse.

What I didn't like is the development of the characters, the survivors were kids one day and in their 50s in the next day shouldn't they act like kids? (They were acting like they had an experience of 50 years life) The beach makes a person old not go through a life and because suddenly behave like a 50 year old, another thing the dialogue between some of the characters was kinda not in its place especially between kids. Overall I thinks it's OK 7 out of 10 is more than enough.",Old
